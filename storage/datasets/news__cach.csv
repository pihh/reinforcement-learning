Street finally sat up and took notice  The new devotees helped to push gold to nearly  1 900 by September of 2011  For the next year and a half it held relatively steady  trading mostly between  1 500 and  1 800 as more mainstream investors caught the fever  But now it appears that the brief love affair is at an end  It was really only a flirtation as the two were never a good match in the first place  Gold s new suitors never understood the fundamental case for gold and now they are turning their affection back to their true love  U S  equities   This is creating a brutal season for gold investors  The metal is in the midst of its largest pull back in nearly five years  and as the selling has gathered momentum powerful Wall Street voices as diverse as Goldman Sachs and George Soros

evaporated with the recent  improvements  in the global economy  particularly in the United States  Ironically  this ignores the fact that gold actually performed better in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis than it did during or following the crisis  That may be because the inflationary monetary policy that fueled the housing bubble also powered gold  Deflation fears led to gold s 35  decline in 2008  but once the Fed reopened the monetary spigots gold rallied to new highs  But in 2008 gold fell in concert with nearly every other asset class  This time  it s falling while other assets are rising  The negative spotlight makes the current decline potentially more meaningful     Neither the new round of Keynesian expansion in Japan nor the recent fallout from the Cypriot solvency crisis produced gold rallies  Bears cite these failures as the signs that the bull is dead  The latest warning bell came late last week when the Bank of Cyprus announced that it would be selling its gold reserves in order to raise the cash to pay its debts  Concerns quickly spread that other heavily indebted Mediterranean countries with large gold reserves like Greece  Portugal  Italy and Spain would follow suit  The tidal wave of selling would be expected to be the coup de grace for gold s glory years  While this neat narrative may be sufficient to convince the financial media

3503,225018,CACH,Paulson Versus Krugman Revisited  Not A Keynesian Clincher ,opinion,Noah Smith  an assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook  recently expressed recently an insight on his blog worth whatever additional exposure I can give it here   His entry   KrugTron the Invincible  may be one that does Smith himself a disservice  It seems as if Smith is goofing off  whereas he s making an important point about everyone s favorite Keynesian pundit  Paul Krugman   Here is a quick spoiler  Smith says that yes  Krugman has had a good prediction record of late  measured against both the overly optimistic  John Paulson  and against the overly pessimistic  Niall Ferguson   Krugman himself surely believes that his prediction success validates his Keynesian view of the world   BAC  Back in 2010 Since this is  after all  AllAboutAlpha  let s focus a bit on experienced alpha seeker Paulson as a Krugman foil  Back in the early summer of 2010  Hugo Londgren  of BusinessWeek  wrote a commentary contrasting Paulson s views with Krugman s  Paulson was saying at the time that the corner had been turned  the crisis had been overcome  and it was a great time to buy equity in U S  based banks  Indeed  Londgren cited Paulson s 13f that said that as of March 31  2010  Paulson held nearly  2 995 billion of Bank of America common stock   Oops  BAC was above  18 a share at the end of the first quarter of 2010  It was just above  15 at the end of the second quarter  when Londgren wrote his column  Five quarters later  in early October 2011  the price of BAC was below  7  Krugman  with his characteristic humility  wrote an I told them so column   Now  in late April 2013  BAC is somewhat recovered from the pits that called forth Krugman s triumphalism  BAC  see the five year chart above  is flat lining between  12 and  12 50 these days   So  is Krugman right in such instances  Smith obligingly gives others  because he is right in general  in how he sees the world  Does his streak of accurate predictions vindicate Keynesianism  That has repeatedly been Krugman s own explanation  And  if not  is his success simply a historical fluke or is there an alternative explanation   The Agnostic and the Blazing Sword of Analogy Smith is not himself a Keynesian  he declares himself  agnostic  on key Keynesian matters   but his expectations have been in line with Krugman s  One did not have to be a Keynesian to be less optimistic than Paulson was in early 2010  Indeed  we don t have to take Smith s word for his own views  We know that all the people and institutions who were selling Paulson their BAC stock so he could accumulate that  2 996 million cache of the stuff were presumably more pessimistic than he was  there is no reason to believe they were all Keynesians   Nor  as Smith rightly says  does Keynesianism necessarily have the implication that the  liquidity traps  it postulates are inescapable in the absence of a massive stimulus or money creation policy  In many Keynesian models  growth can recover on its own   Smith s suggestion is that many of those who have successfully predicted the course of the U S  and European economies in recent years have done so more on an analogy than on a theory  They have presumed that the U S  and Europe  for whatever macroeconomic reasons  are following the course laid out for them by Japan since the early 1990s  The presumption that  We are like Japan  accounts for the right predictions nicely without a lot of theoretical baggage   Smith s bottom line is a good one  and it might well be addressed to all of us  I emphatically include myself  who find Keynesianism doctrine in all its variants unpersuasive    If  you want to get into the economic prediction game  and you don t want to be sliced and diced by KrugTron s Blazing Sword    t ake a good close look at Japan    That is advice we have taken of late  even if not exactly as a consequence of Smith s reasoning ,2013-04-30,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paulson-versus-krugman-revisited:-not-a-keynesian-clincher-165130,165130
3504,225019,CACH,Global Stock Markets In Serious Denial,opinion,Global stock markets are in serious denial as markets climb while macro economic picture declines  Last week  many observers of global stock markets were surprised to see global stock markets and European investors react with a wave of bullishness after  that the Eurozone was stuck in recession for a sixth consecutive quarter because its GDP contracted by 0 2 percent during the first quarter of 2013  despite expectations for a less significant drop to negative 0 1 percent  Belief that the report would motivate the European Central Bank to step up its efforts toward stimulating the European economy sent investors on a buying spree  The first quarter GDP for the 27 nation European Union contracted by 0 1 percent  which   after fourth quarter 2012 GDP contracted by 0 5 percent   brought the EU into recession with the Eurozone  European investors were apparently mindful of the often repeated reassurances from Super Mario Draghi that the ECB remains  ready to act again  if Eurozone economic conditions deteriorate beyond their currently dismal state  Eurostat s GDP report indicated that Germany barely dodged economic recession as its first quarter GDP squeaked into positive territory by 0 1 percent  despite expectations that the German GDP reading would indicate expansion by 0 3 percent  Because fourth quarter GDP for the Eurozone s strongest economy was revised downward from negative 0 6 percent to negative 0 7 percent  we might find out in three months that Germany really has been in recession  Despite the economic advance  a May 8 report from Markit Economics suggested that although Germany s economy may have expanded during the first quarter  the second quarter has been signaling more contraction  EWG   Things look much the same in the United States as last week s worse than expected drop in April industrial production was enthusiastically received by stock markets investors  who saw the bad news as justification for the Fed to reverse any earlier plans to taper back its quantitative easing program  The  of a 0 5 percent decline in industrial production during April portrayed a situation worse than that seen by economists  who anticipated a less significant decline by 0 2 percent  Industrial production took its most significant drop in eight months  Beyond that  manufacturing output dropped 0 4 percent in April after a decline of 0 3 percent in March  The March and April  back to back declines marked the first time that manufacturing output fell for two consecutive months since 2009  Despite economists  expectations that the New York Federal Reserve s  would increase to 3 75 in May from 3 05 in April  the report indicated that the general business conditions index fell more than four points to negative 1 4  further adding to the seemingly divergence between bad news and stock markets euphoria  If recent grim economic reports had any impact on global stock markets  the only logical conclusion one could reach was that investors saw the bad news as a victory for the cause of eternal quantitative easing and defeat of any plans to  taper back  QE  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  continues setting records on a near daily basis as bad news is considered good and good news is considered great  The grim economic news continued all week and was accompanied by the same lack of investors  concern for economic reality  The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to keep climbing in spite of last week s disturbing jump in weekly initial unemployment claims to 360 000  the report on April housing starts and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve s   which sank from 1 3 in April to negative 5 2  China s economic slowdown has been documented by the HSBC China Services Business Activity Index  which dropped to 51 1 in April from 54 3 in March  for the weakest expansion of service sector activity since August 2011  The April HSBC China Composite PMI  which covers both manufacturing and services  declined to 51 1 from 53 5 in March  indicating the weakest rate of expansion since last October  The results were consistent with the government s official manufacturing PMI result for April  which declined to 50 6 from the March reading of 50 9  Worse yet  the HSBC Hong Kong PMI declined to a contractionary 49 9 in April from 50 5 in March  The June 18 meeting of the Federal Reserve s Federal Open Markets Committee  FOMC  could bring an interesting battle  Last week  Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Charles Plosser remarked that he would advocate a plan to scale back the quantitative easing program  Up until that time  Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George had been the only current FOMC member to enthusiastically speak out against QE  Now that the Richmond Fed s Jeffrey Lacker has finished his term as a sitting FOMC member  Esther George has taken up the crusade against QE  On May 9  Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher pointed out that the lack of job creation is a result of poor fiscal policy rather than monetary policy  Fisher explained that monetary policy had accomplished all it could in stimulating the economy and that ongoing bond buying by the Fed amounts to  overkill   Richard Fisher s statement was followed by   after the markets closed on that Friday afternoon  concerning a new strategy by the Federal Reserve to taper back its quantitative easing program  The disclosure was carefully timed to give investors an opportunity to process the information and get used to the idea of life without quantitative easing before the next opening bell of the stock market  Nevertheless recent bullish trading activity demonstrates that investors are not only in denial about the lackluster economic recovery   they also have an alternative  plan B  denial mode to the effect that even if the economy is as bad as reports indicate  that situation would deter the Fed from taking away the punchbowl  This Wednesday s release of the most recent FOMC meeting minutes  coupled with Fed Chairman Bernanke s trek to Capitol Hill could provide stock market moving insights into the Fed s future plans regarding its quantitative easing programs  Meanwhile  for those global stock market investors who remain concerned that economic conditions could take their toll on stock prices  the following ETFs present opportunities to make profits as equities and the formerly invulnerable  safe haven  of gold head south  Ranger Equity Bear ETF  HDGE    This ETF is designed to obtain capital appreciation through short sales of domestically traded equity securities  The strategy for achieving its investment objective involves short selling a portfolio of liquid mid cap and large cap U S  exchange traded equity securities  ETFs  ETNs and other ETPs  ProShares Short Dow30 ETF  DOG    This ETF is designed to obtain results which represent the inverse   1x  of the daily performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  The fund invests in derivatives which ProShares Advisors believes should have similar daily return characteristics as the inverse of the daily return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  ProShares UltraShort Gold ETF  GLL    This ETF is designed to provide daily investment results  before fees and expenses  that correspond to twice  200   the inverse  opposite  of the daily performance of gold bullion as measured by the U S  Dollar p m  fixing price for delivery in London  Bottom line  Like an addict in search of his next fix  global stock markets are in denial over the possibility that the punchbowl of easy money might finally be taken away after all these years that have led to a serious form of financial addiction  Although the Fed won t go  cold turkey   the addict might still find himself in serious withdrawal should even a small reduction in easy money become apparent Disclaimer  The content included herein is for educational and informational

3505,225020,CACH,Apple s Next Steps  Will Team Cook Deliver ,opinion,Monday will not only be an interesting day as to see what Apple  is going to roll out at its annual 0608 appleWorld Wide Developer s Conference  WWDC   It could be one of the most significant days in its post Job s history Unlike politics there comes a point where you can no longer lay blame or receive continued praise based on the length of coat tail left from your predecessor  In business there s a moment where everyone including you understand  It really is your baby now Conversations and more about the way someone else ran the company or  the way this  that or what  they  would do is dead and gone I m not trying to be coy or infuse a form of pun here as in Apple s case  At some point all questions  conversations  scuttlebutt  and more transform without warning  Near instantaneously everything changes  All of the sudden it s as if there never was anyone else before you in the position that you now hold Every single question  insinuation  and more feels like the sword of Damocles is raised before being asked   What are you doing  What have you done  What are you going to do   As scary as it is when it s realized   it is the moment one has waited for  It will make or break you You know this to be true in your gut  However  so does everyone else   and they re watching   Some with champagne if you do well   others with theirs if you fall   Athletes experience this in that  give me the ball  win or lose everything moment  In business  this is that moment Personally I ve had that moment in my career more than once being involved in turn around situations  You don t know nor can you anticipate when it s about to happen  Only that when it does  you had better be ready because  if you ve asked for the ball when everything s on the line  Trust me   it s coming   whether you still want it or not I believe Tim Cook is entering that moment however  so to is Apple  the company  Once again both the CEO as well as the company itself   together  Funny how the more things change the more things stay the same on some levels is it not At this moment in time one will not come out of it better or worse than the other  If Mr  Cook bombs   so does Apple as a whole and vice versa   again  for this moment in time   who knows what the future holds on a longer time frame Currently Apple products are hands down the product to own  Period  They are like owning a Mercedes  as compared to any top tier domestic brand  Many like their current or new devices  But  and it s a very big but    they d like them even more if they sported an Apple logo Apple is now a luxury brand as well as device  It is an aspirational brand like it or not  You may wish to throw cold water on such a thought all you want yet denying it  doesn t make it so  Keeping it   is now the task Will Team Cook deliver what both current as well as future customers need to continue viewing Apple through the aspirational lens  This is what is at stake in my view  Again  in my view  all other questions are irrelevant  Everything rides here  It is Team Cook s  here s the ball  moment It s win or go home  I m not trying to be hyperbolic  I do not believe this dynamic or moment can be over played  Downplaying  or poo poohing the importance here is missing the bigger picture in my estimation The tech media and more are all a buzz with what to expect from operating system revamp  device changes  to the much maligned or outright hatred of skew morphism   For those not familiar with the term  this is where the application takes on the appearance in the digital world of its real world equivalence  i e   A note taking app looks like your typing onto a yellow legal pad and so on  Although I myself never put that much thought into such details   I just cared if the thing worked as I wanted it to  this is where we will get our first glimpse from the man whose impact both changed or developed the design of all these devices in the physical form  Enter Johnathan Ive  Now Sir Johnathan to be formal  design extraordinaire of the physical product to the digital side This is where everything changes   or doesn t I know there will be a ton of people who will shake their heads in outright disagreement in what I m about to say next  However  I ll say it anyways  because that s what I do   Right now the outside  the casing  or screen for that matter is irrelevant in as far as needing a design make over  It s ALL about the interface  With what s  under the hood  running a close second  i e   processor speed  brand  blah  blah  blah  For technophiles yes  The rest of us   not so much This is exactly the spot where Mr  Ive will be able to prove to both skeptics as well as current or future customers that Apple not only hasn t lost its way rather  is once again forging new and exciting paths  Incidentally  this is precisely where Microsoft  just had its chance with  the ball  and not only missed  they threw as if blindfolded  enter the Surface  and New Windows  interface  The cutting edge design that made people aspire to purchase Apple products in the first place can be laid directly in this mans wheelhouse  In most cases it s his design prowess that s responsible for making many of the attributes associated as being Apple   Apple  Now his design and influence encompasses the software or interface side bringing it under his tutelage  This really is a game changer to what it may or may not bring forth in user experience If the design of applications  or whatever you want to call the place where you actually interact with your device  can morph or change in both elegance as well as the simplicity as first demonstrated with iPod  then through both Mac  as well as iPhone   You may not only beat your competition   you just might crush them For those who never purchased an Apple product before iPad   the one take away heard over  and over again with astonishment from users were   I could not believe there was no instruction manual   That was as game changing a moment as the iPad itself  We could be at an even greater milestone in the development of operating systems  OS  whether it be mobile or desktop  We will soon find out   or at least get a hint I truly believe it s now more imperative to focus on experience interface and branding than anything else  Yes  the media is hemming and hawing about competitors pushing out offerings at a far more rapid rate than Apple  People are also implying this is a tell tale sign that Apple is unable to come up with new ideas  Personally  I think that view is misplaced or  could be a complete misinterpretation of what might truly be taking place  Let me express it with the following analogy Years ago I had a discussion with my father  He drove Lincoln Continentals  pretty much all his life  When the Lincoln Mark VII was introduced it was a radical design change for Lincoln  So much so I asked him why would they come out with something so radically different from what Lincolns are known for  Big square heavy behemoths   Are they trying to attract Mercedes buyers  more round  driver orientated  etc    He said   No  You ll never get a Mercedes guy to buy a Lincoln  It s Lincoln s attempt to keep Lincoln owners from switching to a Mercedes   I never forgot the importance of that statement Current Apple owners are not going to switch anytime soon in my opinion  Once you ve made the switch from PC to Apple there is no going back   At least at this moment in time  Windows 8  sealed that opportunity for the near future   Sure Android   Samsung   and others are growing more  and more  However  they don t have the cache  or that je ne sais quoi that people just want to own It s now all about how Apple becomes more like  Apple  and all that entails  That s not a play on words  Apple needs to push further into what it means to own an Apple device and reside under the now ever present Apple logo ed umbrella The real profits to be made now and into the future might not be with how many  new  devices one sells  Rather  what interface will continue to draw the people with both money to spend   and   that will spend it  Apple s ability to construct its brand into the aspirational genre has been second to none in this regard  They need to continue as to give customers a reason to reach for  as to buy    not make excuses as to offer lower quality products or standards as to compete on   of devices sold metrics  That s a race to the bottom where the winner usually ends up the loser If Apple truly is at a game changer moment as I believe they could be  Monday s WWDC could go down being just as an important of a day as when Job s announced he was changing Apple Computer into Apple as we now know it The importance of that day wasn t realized till much later when the Apple brand which culminated out of that conference began to exert itself into the mainstream  Apple has

3536,225051,CACH,Book Review  How To Make Money With Commodities,opinion,Andrew T  Hecht s How to Make Money with Commodities  written with Mark S  Smith  McGraw Hill  2013  is a surprisingly good book  I say  surprisingly  because it joins a crowded and for the most part uninspired field and yet manages to stand apart   Despite the fact that the book is intended for two radically different audiences  the equities investor and the beginning to intermediate commodities trader  it artfully glides between them  The investor learns to read futures data as a guide to the prospects of his commodity driven investments  The beginning commodities trader is introduced to the landscape  the intermediate trader gets a richer context and some tips   One thing that distinguishes this book is its stories  Hecht has many of his own  such as the outsized silver position that he and three other traders at the Philbro division of Salomon Brothers had in 1995   a bigger position than the Hunt brothers took back in 1979    Some come from his friends  for instance  the  fiasco of the giant sugar cube    Because of the low value of sugar  the ships that transport this sweet commodity are often old and sometimes not in the best state of repair  Raw sugar is loaded onto and off a ship with a device that resembles a vacuum cleaner   In this case   at some point during the journey  moisture had leaked into the cargo so much moisture that the shipment had turned rock solid   The trader who had negotiated the deal needed some quick thinking to reduce his losses   He hired a team of laborers to break up the giant sugar cube with jackhammers  The laborers then had to remove thousands of smaller cubes by hand  The cargo was eventually unloaded and delivered to the buyer  who then demanded a discount because the sugar was not in the form contracted for  While insurance paid for part of the fiasco  the trader s profit margin was not enough to cover the losses  which amounted to several million dollars    p  48   Hecht also recalls one of the problems that coffee traders encountered in the 1980s  The vessels of drug smugglers often carried  huge coffee shipments to mask the aroma of the drugs   On one occasion  a dead body arrived with a massive coffee shipment  along with a large cache of marijuana and cocaine    p  209   Another distinguishing characteristic of the book is its detail  When discussing natural gas  Hecht describes among other things its dramatic historical volatility  the divergence between UNG and the price of natural gas in early 2012 when the book was being written  signaling that  either UNG is too low or that the price of natural gas will rally from levels shown on the chart  the latter happened   and the negative correlation between heavy natural gas users such as Potash and the commodity   And he demonstrates how the trader who understands commodities can profit in the stock market  A case in point was his 2008 trade in JetBlue as oil made new all time highs and JBLU was dirt cheap   When the price of crude oil fell  there was a short term correction in JetBlue s price it shot up by more than 100 percent in six months    p  110   Hecht had skin in the game for nearly 35 years  and it shows in this book  Both investors and traders can learn from him ,2013-01-09,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-how-to-make-money-with-commodities-150182,150182
3537,225052,CACH,Investing In Britain s Infrastructure  With And Without Guarantees  ,opinion,The National Audit Office of the government of the UK  their GAO  if you will  has expressed its concern that the government is risking substantial liabilities in its approach to infrastructure projects  A report issued in mid January    worried in particular about the degree to which the government has offered guarantees to potential private investors in infrastructure to save these investors from a range of risks  As the NAO notes  guaranteeing someone against a risk in this way shifts that risks   and in this instance  the risks in question would be borne by the taxpayers  if the underlying cost risks are not managed well   The broad meaning of  infrastructure  employed in the NAO discussion includes water  waste disposal  energy  rails  highways  and other institutions  In the continuation of a development that dates back at least to the mid 1980s  an initiative given formal expression during Tony Blair s time on  the government now expects that  310 billion  US  490 billion  will be expended over the next three years in infrastructure projects  HM government doesn t intend to do all that spending itself  Rather it is looking to private companies for 64 percent of it As the above graph indicates  the private percentage of infrastructure financing rose steadily from about 1986 through 1999  despite a dip in the years 1994 and  95  Through the years of the new millennium  though  the percentage has been roughly constant in the neighborhood of 64 to 66 percent   Demand for infrastructure is set to increase   said Amyas Morse  the head of the NAO  when that office released its report   fueled by population growth  technological progress  climate change and congestion   Well over half of the projected  310 billion  or about  176 billion  would relate to energy  and most of that   123 billion  to electricity generation  In what seems a bit of stiff upper lip understatement  the NAO s report says   Energy projects are often large and complex and the costs are difficult to evaluate   Indeed  EDHEC on Infrastructure Debt  Only days after the release of this report  on January 22  the EDHEC Risk Institute weighed in  expressing the view that infrastructure construction risks don t need guarantees from the public sector  they need  scientific portfolio construction   EDHEC  through its NATIXIS Research Chair on infrastructure debt investment  now makes the point that the risks associated with construction are mostly a function of who will bear that risk  This is the old  moral hazard  issue  When does a safety net become a hammock  Or  to put it another way  if the U K  simply decides that its infrastructure program in general is Too Big to Fail  what could go wrong  EDHEC will present a paper on infrastructure debt investment at a conference in London  March 2013  the culmination of three years of academic research on the nature and the performance of debt instruments in this field  and on the potential benefits for institutional investors of including such fixed income instruments in their portfolios  The bottom line of EDHEC s research is that there is no need to create new public sector liabilities  Institutions will invest because it is rational for them to invest  because  adding some construction risk to an infrastructure debt portfolio  moves a portfolio toward the efficiency frontier  and omitting the whole category moves the portfolio away from that frontier  And on Infrastructure Equity  Another recent related product of Edhec is a report on   by Fr d ric Blanc Brude  Blanc Brude helps clarify the nature of some of the risks involved from the point of view of the investing institutions  He considers  for example  the UK s water utilities  which operate within a regime of price cap regulation  This has  especially over the last quarter century  reduced the return for investors in the affected utilities from 8 percent to 5 percent today  The critical fact about infrastructure investment  though  in Blanc Brude s view  is that it is both non linear and predictable  It is non linear in that projects have a lifecycle  that implies different risks and different return profiles for the different components of the capital structure   But this is itself a predictable datum   contrary to the classic case in corporate finance  where equity risk is the least predictable  These unusual features of infrastructure projects are precisely what allow for a scientific balancing of the portfolio  The investment strategist can  focus on the contractual and regulatory characteristics of underlying infrastructure  and can design an efficient portfolio including such equity ,2013-01-29,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investing-in-britain’s-infrastructure:-with-and-without-guarantees-152831,152831
3538,225053,CACH,Switzerland  The Biggest Loser,opinion,In Switzerland  it s not just the clocks that are cuckoo  Over the past four years Swiss politicians and central bankers have gone on an unprecedented buying spree of foreign exchange reserves  In 2012  their cache swelled to as much as  420 billion worth of various currencies  primarily the euro  This figure is a seven fold increase since 2008 and equates to 70  of the country s annual GDP  The sum translates to  200 000 per family of four  enough to keep the Swiss in clocks  chocolates  and fondue for many years to come  The Swiss leadership will claim the money has been  invested  with an eye to the future  but what they ve done is impoverished themselves in the present  Although such a decision seems perverse  it makes perfect sense when seen through the lens of today s presiding economic thinking   For the past few generations Switzerland has enjoyed some of the strongest economic fundamentals in the world  The country boasts a high savings rate  low taxes  strong exports  low debt to GDP  balanced government budgets  and prior to a few years ago one of the most responsible monetary policies in the world  These attributes made the Swiss franc one of the world s  safe haven  currencies  But in today s global economy  no good deed goes unpunished   Central bankers around the world  particularly in Washington  Frankfurt and Tokyo  have been engaged in a massive and coordinated campaign of currency debasement to combat the recession  But for years the Swiss refused to join in the printing parade  As a result  investors around the world wisely decided to park their savings in the reliable Swiss franc  From December of 2008 to August 2011 the franc appreciated an astounding 59  against the U S  dollar and approximately 30  against the Japanese yen  More importantly  the franc gained 42  against the euro  As the Eurozone completely surrounds Switzerland  its trade with those countries represents the vast majority of its international transactions   During this massive run up in its currency  the Swiss economy continued to prosper  Wages and purchasing power increased and GDP grew consistently faster than other countries in Western Europe  Despite generally positive export statistics  some Swiss exporters noticed that at times the strong franc put them at a disadvantage against foreign competitors  In addition  the strengthening currency helped keep a lid on consumer prices  giving Switzerland a consistently low inflation rate with occasional bouts of actual deflation  Despite the fact that Switzerland was an island of economic health amidst a sea of problems  the reigning economic orthodoxy convinced Swiss leaders that their strong currency was a burden rather than a blessing  More pointedly  the rise in the franc was seen as a repudiation of the expansionary policies occurring in other countries  And so the Swiss government decided to join the currency killing party   In early August 2011  the Swiss National Bank took a series of steps to reverse the fortunes of the franc  In the simplest terms  they sold francs and bought foreign currencies  most notably the euro  The announcement included a promise to buy unlimited quantities of foreign exchange to maintain a floor of 1 20 francs per euro  In so doing  the Swiss essentially outsourced their monetary policy to the Eurozone  Any moves taken by the European Central Bank would need to be matched by the Swiss  Ironically  it was fear of this outcome that kept the Swiss from adopting the euro in the first place  Despite the former bias toward independence  the Swiss have de facto adopted the euro anyway  Since that time  the franc has fallen 16  against the dollar  Swiss foreign exchange reserves have skyrocketed  and investors who bought francs as a means to escape debasement have been betrayed   Productive nations generate excess goods and services that can be sold abroad and their growth and stability attract investment funds from abroad  These conditions will tend to increase demand for the nation s currency  thereby pushing up its price  A strong currency keeps capital and raw materials costs low  enabling more productive workers to earn higher real wages  But according to most economists  a strong currency will bring down an economy because it destroys international competitiveness and can even lead to lower prices  deflation  which they see as economic quicksand  These fears have ignited a  global currency war  in which countries are expending huge amounts of national savings in order to ensure that their currencies stay cheap  In today s economic logic we must fail in order to succeed   But it is very easy to have a weak currency  All that is needed is an unlimited willingness to print  A strong currency requires real fiscal discipline and actual production  Yet  like the weight loss TV show  economists believe that the winner of a currency war is the biggest loser  You win not by killing your competitors  but by killing yourself  It s like a student convincing his parents that an  F  is a better grade than an  A   And if a straight  F  report card results in parental accolades rather than anger  the students will lack any incentive to improve performance  Similarly  as nations like Switzerland strive to reduce their own grades  the failing nations have a reduced incentive to change their study habits  Without outside support  nations with collapsing currencies would see huge increases in consumer prices  The resulting fall in living stands would force productive reform   I take the minority position that just as it is better to be rich than poor  a strong currency is better than a weak one  Although much more credentialed economists may try to muddle the arguments  the truth may be seen when a particular position is taken to its logical extreme  If a weaker currency is preferable to a stronger one  then logic would dictate that a currency of no value will be preferable to one with an infinite value  But how would economies with these drastically different currencies operate   It is true that the country with the zero value currency will tend to see full employment and strong exports  The relative low cost of labor will mean that the locals could be easily employed in even the most marginal activity  But since holders of other currencies will be able to outbid the domestic population for all of their production  everything produced will be exported  Imports will be zero as the local population would be unable to afford anything produced in countries with more valuable currencies  As a result  actual consumption would be extremely low  In essence this economy would be analogous to impoverished  subsistence level economies such as Bolivia  Zimbabwe  and Haiti   In contrast  a country with an infinitely valuable currency would see the best of all possible worlds  Even the smallest amount of money would allow citizens to buy huge amounts of goods from abroad  An evening s babysitting money would deliver more purchasing power than months of hard labor in poorer countries  The strong currency would mean that consumption would soar even while hours worked fell  Savings would increase in value  and people would have more ability to travel and pursue leisure activities  In essence  we are describing a rich economy   Placed in such a context  it s easy to see the preferred option  Those who believe in the benefits of weak currencies do not specify when a falling currency becomes a bad thing  Clearly there must be a tipping point where lost purchasing power overcomes supposed gains in growth  Yet they are silent on that point  My position is that a rising currency is always good  No magic tipping point needs to be identified   The problem is that economists now believe that the goal of an economy is to provide employment  not goods and services  They see a job as an end in and of itself  rather than as a means for people to get the things they really want  But if we can get all that we want without having to work  who needs to bother  A strong currency takes us closer to this goal  It is a testament to how far the  science  of economics has fallen that this goal has been utterly forgotten   But this junk science is killing real growth  As long as this  black is white  ideology remains in place  the biggest printers will continue to be the biggest actual losers BY Euro Pacific Capital,2013-02-02,Euro

3539,225054,CACH,UCITS Brand  Time For A Restricted Extension  ,opinion,EDHEC Risk  in collaboration with CACEIS Investor Services  the asset servicing group affiliated with Credit Agricole  has now outlined the case for the creation of a new category of transferable security within the European system  the  Restricted UCITS   In a striking case of  burying the lead   that new label doesn t turn up until the final paragraph of the joint EDHEC CACEIS press release announcing the study  For most of its length  the press release seems to be announcing a rather anodyne analysis to the effect that current regulation  does contain some very positive elements in terms of investor protection against non financial risk  but that it fails to encourage stakeholders in the value chain  to contribute to the improvement of information and to manage non financial risks better   All Right  We ll Bite Financial risks  the risks that the value of assets in a portfolio will suffer a sharp decline  are those which are  or ought in principle to be  borne by the investor  Non financial risks  such as the risk that a particular custodian or sub custodian of collateralized assets will fail unexpectedly  losing or locking up the assets in litigation for an extended period  these ought to be borne by parties within the value chain  those who are in the best position to mitigate them  In a 2010 study of this issue  EDHEC s No l Amenc and Samuel Sender contended that  That was both their conclusion and their title  The new paper    is written again by No l Amenc  this time with Fr d ric Ducoulombier  the director of EDHEC Risk Institute   Asia  Amenc and Ducoulombier cite a survey of European finance professionals in the third quarter of 2011 that asked which non financial risks were of most concern to them As the table above indicates  the bankruptcy of a financial intermediary was the most worrisome of the risks included in that research  at least in the sense that the largest group of respondents identified that risk as  very important   If you lump together the responses  very important  and  important   though  you can see that liquidity risk   as represented by the third bar from the top   is a concern  at least an  important  one  to a slightly larger chunk of the pertinent population Economic IncentivesThe authors maintain that there are two key moves that will establish the kind of economic incentives necessary to secure better management of non financial risks  First  the industry should adopt capital requirements proportional to the non financial risk assumed by the major value chain participants   namely depositaries and fund management companies   Second  it should establish a system of residual risk assessment that would allow for the reduction of this capital requirement  depending on the application of best practices for managing non financial risks such as centralized clearing of OTC trades  tripartite agreements for the securing of collateral  or adequate segregation of clients  assets  Extending the BrandBeyond that re jiggering  though  they suggest as I ve noted  the creation of an extension of the globally recognized UCITS brand  a new category of UCITS investment  to be labeled  Restricted UCITS   The range of assets and operations eligible for an investment so labeled would be restricted only to those assets that could be kept in the custody of the depositary and to those operations that do not involve counterparty risk  because they are accomplished through regulated central counterparties as that term is understood in the EU   Further  the depositary will guarantee the full restitution of all assets for this new category  allowed Restricted UCITS to be  marketed without any duty to advice or any restriction when dealing with retail clients  The authors want Restricted UCITS created because otherwise  they fear  there will occur a sort of arms race in which depositaries would attempt to satisfy their clients in a competitive way in an escalation that would end with their  offering guarantees for risks they cannot really control   The proposal would create a world in which they can control those risks  and so can offer that guarantee  segregated from the rest of UCITS so as to short circuit such an escalation CollateralIn an appendix  the authors treat certain technical issues that involve the posting of collateral  For example  on the one hand  cash collateral results in higher funding costs for counterparties and complications for funds that do not usually hold cash   on the other hand non cash collateral when limited to the most risk free of assets can artificially increase demand for the classes of asset allowed  and can hurt the liquidity of the counterparties Amenc and Ducoulombier recommend  as Amenc and Sender did in the 2010 paper  that parties be allowed to post  a broader set of eligible collateral with appropriate haircuts   They also note that this idea has been picking up steam of late  it  is now the recommendation of the Working Group on Margining Requirements of the Basel Committee   and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions  ,2013-02-12,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ucits-brand:-time-for-a-restricted-extension-154861,154861
3540,225055,CACH,Will A Superabundance Of Capital Lead To An M A Boom ,opinion, Bain   Company  the consultancy  forecasts a  superabundance of capital  between now and 2020  In a recent report it argued that markets would be distorted by surpluses in Asian and Middle Eastern countries and private investment funds  It estimates that the world s financial assets will outbalance its domestic product by ten to one   it will have  900 trillion of financial assets compared with  90 trillion of GDP   by 2020  The result will be a  world that is structurally awash in capital  chasing few opportunities  Capital superabundance will increase the frequency  intensity  size and longevity of asset bubbles  The propensity for bubbles to form will be magnified as yield hungry investors race to put capital into assets that show the potential to generate superior returns   the report concludes  These words from John Gapper appeared over the weekend in the Financial Times of London The signs of this possibility  according to Gapper  are two  first  the presence of lots and lots of cash on the balance sheets of corporations  hedge funds  and other financial interests  and second  the apparent movement in the buyout and acquisition market that reflects a growing belief among international investors that the US economy is stabilizing  the eurozone crisis has reached its final stages  and that elsewhere in the world economic recovery continues and capital flows are increasing  Apparently with these events  the desire to take on more risk has risen I have written for three years or so about the build up of cash on the balance sheets of corporations  Companies that never had issued long term debt before took advantage of exceedingly low interest rates to increase their cache of money  The basic reasoning behind this buildup was that these financially sound firms would  make a killing  as the United States economy began to grow faster and government regulatory policy came together The targets of these companies  The answer was companies that were not so financially sound  companies that needed restructuring  and companies that needed new life and new capital The merger and acquisition binge never took place  The reasons given for why a massive boom in M A never took was also two fold  first  economic growth remained tepid  and uncertainty seemed to blanket the world as the regulatory stance of the Obama administration never became clear  as the European crisis worsened and grew longer and the economic health of the rest of the world  especially in China  India  and others  was unclear Corporate leaders were just not willing to commit  Better safe than sorry But  now this seems to have changed  The Federal Reserve System has pumped billions of dollars into the United States economy and is continuing to do so as we go to work each day  The Fed has promised that this will continue for an extended period of time and short term interest rates will remain low for another year or more  We believe them The American economy is not growing robustly  but there seems to be sufficient confidence that the economy will not fall apart to warrant some belief that investors can extend themselves into riskier investments  European financial markets have been relatively stable now since early December as European officials seem to be working to knit something together  even though the pace of accomplishment remains extraordinarily slow  And  the rest of the world seems to have stabilized and seems to be heading in the right direction The confidence of international investors seems to be building as money has moved out of United States Treasury securities and German Bunds Furthermore  it finally appears as if money is finally flowing into the  deal  market  Of course  the eye catcher here was the  24 4 billion buyout deal struck by Michael Dell for Dell  DELL   This was followed by John Malone  of Liberty Global  LBTYA   who stated that he was buying Virgin Media  VMED   Then a group of private equity funds in England announced a deal with EE  the United Kingdom s largest mobile phone operator  And  there is also the deal announced a little earlier to less press coverage of Dish Network  DISH  buying Clearwire  CLWR  The year started off slowly  but now near the middle of February  the numbers are starting to look really good  Finance is good But  what about economic activity  Will all this financial activity help the real economy grow and help to reduce the unemployment rate Three years ago when I was writing about the corporate build up of cash and the possible  boom  in mergers and acquisitions that might follow as the confidence picked up and the uncertainty surrounding government regulation dropped away  I wrote that there was still one problem to consider  All this money going into  deals  was not immediately going into new innovation or into the purchase of new capital equipment  This money was going to be swirling around and around with little or no immediate impact on achieving faster economic growth Buyout deals  like the Dell deal and mergers and acquisitions usually result in company consolidations  corporate restructurings  downsizing and reductions in employment The immediate impact of these transactions is to  rationalize  the economy and make it more efficient  This  rationalization  and increase in efficiency does not immediately add to economic growth or to lower unemployment rates  If anything it can move things in the opposite way Yes  eventually these restructurings and so forth will be good for the economy  They will lead to greater worker productivity  more capital expenditures  and more innovation  But  these latter things will not take place immediately Gapper  in his Financial Times piece  closes with similar sentiments  He states that  such investors are not risking money on entrepreneurs through venture capital funds or buying stakes in untested companies in initial public offerings  They are choosing well known enterprises on a firm footing and using their earnings to gain better returns than cash or government bonds  These activities may lead to better times  he states  but  at the moment  the wave of deal making contrasts oddly with sluggish economies and risk averse banks  The scary part of this scenario is the possibility presented us by Bain Capital   Capital superabundance will increase the frequency  intensity  size and longevity of asset bubbles  I have written a great deal about credit inflation in my posts  It seems to me that the Bain 2020 picture of a  900 trillion in financial assets compared with  90 trillion of GDP is the height of credit inflation  Even if we don t get all the way to this result  a credit inflation of this degree makes the credit inflation of the 1961 to 2007 period look like an insignificant  bump in the road  ,2013-02-18,John

futures traded on the MCX have fallen nearly 2  so far in 2013  Despite the higher duty  local gold prices have gone down due to the drop in overseas prices as well as the rise in the Rupee against the U S  Dollar  India s undying passion for gold has got the government worried especially since around 20 000 tons is reportedly lying unused with Indian households  The government wants to make physical Gold buying unattractive  India s passion for gold  seen by many as a hedge against persistently high Inflation  means gold Bullion comes second only to Crude Oil in the import bill of Asia s third largest economy  Much of rural India  however  lacks adequate banking to offer alternative investment options  keeping gold popular  Less than 10  of the total number of villages in India has banks  an MMTC  Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation  official said   as reported by Reuters  Gold Demand in India seems sluggish as buyers postponed purchases expecting further sharp drop in Gold Prices  India s government may further raise import duties on Gold or put a cap on purchases in a bid to rein in the Current Account Deficit in the 2013 14 budget  an official with the biggest state run gold importer    MMTC said  The government had already hiked import duties by 2  to 6  on Jan  21 to discourage higher gold imports  The Government of India may cap imports  impose a fresh set of duties or cut the number of companies authorized to import gold if purchases have not slowed down by the time it announces the 2013 14 budget on Feb  28  The Reserve Bank of India  had earlier indicated it could limit gold imports by banks  which corner about 60  of supply  MMTC s Gold purchases this fiscal year were down to around 30 40 tons from last year s 160 tons India Trade Deficit Of  20 billion On Imports SurgeIndia posted its second highest ever monthly trade deficit of  20 billion in January as imports surged to record highs  piling pressure on a widening current account deficit and limiting scope for the central bank to cut interest rates  The January trade deficit was the second worst on record  The worst figure was  21 9 billion posted in October  The RBI    Reserve Bank of India warned that future rate cuts would depend upon declines in both the current account deficit and inflation after it cut interest rates by 0 25 percentage points last month  Imports rose 6  to  45 58 billion  their highest ever monthly total  Imports of crude oil  the single biggest item  rose 6 9  from a year ago to  15 9 billion  The oil import bill is definitely a challenge  but for a growing economy  energy needs have to be met  The Reserve Bank of India is worried that India s ability to fund its rising current account deficit is becoming increasingly stretched  and could lead to fresh pressure on the Rupee  which in turn could hike up Gold Prices in India if it starts weakening again  The high current account deficit is unsustainable as it can t be funded for a long time with capital flows and it will get adjusted through the exchange rate  The exchange rate will depreciate when the correction happens  Portfolio inflows into India have been robust  with  8 34 billion so far this year after inflows of  31 41 billion in the whole of 2012  Consumption cannot be stopped in India  said Minawala  of the All India Gems and Jewelry Trade Federation  Irrespective of all the measures that the government brings on  imports could touch 850 to 950 tons this calendar year  he added SEBI Allows Gold ETFs To invest In Banks  Gold Deposit SchemesIn an attempt to curb physical gold demand and boost Gold ETFs  India s securities regulator  Securities and Exchange Board of India  SEBI  has allowed Gold ETFs    Exchange Traded Funds to invest in GDS    gold deposit schemes offered by banks  The move would also bring additional returns to gold ETFs allowing them to beat their benchmarks  The total investment in GDS cannot exceed 20  of the total assets under management of any scheme  SBI  which launched a gold deposit scheme sometime ago  offered 1  interest on deposits of longer duration  Assuming fund houses use up the entire 20  limit prescribed by SEBI  it would result in up to 10 20  gains for investors even if banks pay just 1  interest  Analysts said the move was in line with India s efforts to cut down gold imports and also to utilize idle assets of the precious metal for more productive purposes  A panel by the RBI has estimated that about 20 000 tonnes of idle gold is lying with the people  The Reserve Bank of India aspires to channelize the idle gold bullion for productive purposes and also check the demand for imports  As per SEBI guidelines  before investing in GDS  mutual funds would have to put in place a written policy related to the investment with due approval from the Board of the Asset Management Company and the Trustees Gold And Silver Coin Sale In China s Year Of The SnakeResidents lined

Chairman  Ben Bernanke  stated that there was need to maintain the current monetary easing measures  He explained that the country s unemployment remains too high and given the current rate of inflation  the economy needs help in order to improve  The greenback declined against the majority of its counterparts as the minutes from June s Monetary Policy meeting were released  which revealed that policy makers were divided on when to begin reducing stimulus  However  the majority supported the idea of continuing with the current level of monthly asset purchases until the job s sector shows signs of growth  The U S  currency remained under pressure and continued to trade lower versus the Euro and the Yen following the announcement of Initial Jobless Claims  The Labor Department indicated that applications for unemployment benefits rose by 16 000 in the past week and posted a two month high of 360 000  Gold Futures increased the most in 12 months following Mr  Bernanke s

the highest price in three weeks versus the greenback following the release of the FOMC s minutes  which prompted the dollar s quick decline  The foreign currency exchange reacted with extreme volatility to the remarks made by Chairman Bernanke as his comments suggested that reducing the level of stimulus was not a consideration at this time  Due to the volatility  the shared currency flirted with the  1 3200 level  but retreated soon thereafter as political uncertainty is still playing a major role in the Euro zone while the fundamentals continue to denote economic weakness  The British Pound rallied for a second day in a row versus the U S  Dollar after the Fed Chairman Bernanke reiterated that stimulus was necessary for growth  The British monetary unit rose against the Euro in the heels of the release of the Monetary Policy Meeting minutes by the Bank of England  which are expected to show how the members voted in regards to quantitative easing  As analysts indicated  the Sterling s movements have been prompted by the greenback s weakness  not necessarily as a result of strong economic metrics The Yen gained against the U S  Dollar but economists predict the currency may fall 18 percent in the event that the Bank of Japan opts for increasing stimulus  which would cause investors to shift their holdings abroad  The Yen remained strong even as the central bank announced it plans to augment its monetary base to 70 trillion Yen per year on signs that suggest the country s economy has improved  This also indicated that the BOJ may expand its monetary easing program to reach the inflation target of 2 percent And in the South Pacific  positive economic data together with the release of the FOMC minutes prompted the Australian Dollar to

economic reports which revealed that Consumer Sentiment dipped this month  According to the University of Michigan  the Index  which gauges confidence  slipped from 84 1 to 83 9  Though the drop was minor  it still denoted that confidence remained at a 6 year high  Other metrics showed that Producer Prices climbed 0 8 percent last month  driving PPI to a one year high  The hike came about due to the sharp advance in gas prices  even though food and energy costs merely increased 0 2 percent  This week  market investors will pay close attention to the release of important economic indicators such as Retail Sales  and Mr  Bernanke s testimony regarding the state of the U S  economy  Analysts believe the latter will promote further volatility in the Forex  Gold Futures remained little

a drop in demand as China s Finance Minister stated that he anticipates the world s second biggest economy will only expand 7 percent in 2013 rather than the expected 7 5 percent  Growing concerns over the economic situation in China also reduced demand for the New Zealand Dollar  especially since China is the nation s second largest trading  Production DipsThe Euro traded lower against the U S  monetary unit after the greenback recouped subsequent to a major sell off that began when central bank s chairman suggested that policy makers don t plan to cut stimulus any time soon  The shared currency was weighed by a number of factors  including the reduction of France s AAA rating  and the fact that the region posted a bigger decline in Industrial Production than predicted  According to

the nation s biggest trade partner announced that its imports and exports fell for a second consecutive month in June  The Chinese Finance Minister suggested that the country would only grow 7 percent

3554,225069,CACH,The Formula For Surviving The Great Bust Ahead  Harry Dent,opinion,With a perfect storm brewing on the horizon  investors should be building their cash cache and running for cover  warns Harry Dent  author of The Great Crash Ahead  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Dent explains how central bank stimulus programs are fighting a futile battle because a huge army of aging baby boomers has reached the stage in their economic lifecycles when they curb spending  How is Dent preparing for the gathering storm The Gold Report  Your considerable research over many years indicates that the size and age of its citizens drive a country s economic growth or decline  Because people have predictable consumption patterns throughout life  you can predict well in advance national economic growth or decline  How does that work  Harry Dent  We ve identified a peak spending wave indicator that correlates strongly with the stock market and the economy  It doesn t apply so much to emerging countries  where we look at urbanization rates  which greatly affect incomes  and workforce growth because emerging nations don t have a middle class curve where typical consumers earn  60 000 a year at the peak of their careers  In developed countries  though countries with higher tech infrastructures and a solid middle class this spending wave indicator peaks at around age 46  People slow in spending way ahead of retirement  from 46 on  That is basically when the average person s kids are leaving the nest  In fact  the greatest slowing comes from age 50 on  That s the correlation  that people earn and spend more money dramatically as they approach midlife  On average  they enter the workforce at about age 20  marry at 26  have their first child when they re 28  and hit 46 50 when that child gets out of school  Then their spending drops like a rock  Part of that is because they re saving for retirement but  more importantly  they don t need bigger houses and don t drive their cars nearly as much  It s just a natural life cycle in developed countries  It s the ultimate leading indicator  We saw the spending slowdown we re experiencing now coming 20 some years ago  when we came up with this tool  We said baby boomers  spending would peak around 2007 and slow down from 2020 2023  TGR  Is the pattern the same across the globe  or do slowdown years differ from country to country  HD  There s some degree of variation  but the post World War II baby boom pretty much happened around the world  Birth rates in most developed countries peaked in the late 1950s to early 1960s  so the whole developed world is pretty much synched on this baby boom  all peaking together  Japan is the one exception  where births peaked twice  once in 1942 and again in 1949  TGR  So you ve gone back through history and now can predict that every 40 years or so a country s economy slows as waves of babies come through  Is the age related consumption pattern the only demographic you use to evaluate what influences economies  HD  Another cycle comes into play as well  It s an 80 year economic cycle consisting of two generational booms and busts  like the Bob Hope generation that drove the U S  economy up from 1942 1968 and then down from 1969 1982  and then the baby boomers who drove it up again from 1983 2007 after that 46 year lag  and now down again from 2008 2023  Additionally  these boom and bust pairs go through a pattern we relate to the four seasons  If you think of the consumer price index  CPI  in temperature terms  a high CPI is hot  or inflationary  and a low CPI is cold  or deflationary  A deflationary period or depression  as we re going into now  is the winter season  A spring boom follows  with a new generational spending pattern and the modest inflation that comes with it  In the summer  with that generation entering the workforce  inflation continues to rise  We do a lot of research to demonstrate that young people are inflationary  They have more to do with inflation than any other factor  and nobody has a clue of this in economics  The last summer in the U S  occurred when the baby boomers entered the workforce in large numbers  basically from the late 1960s through the early 1980s  The fall boom brings bubbles and the resulting expansion of debt  Stocks  real estate and so on bubble up and when that boom ends  those bubbles burst  Winter sets in again  with restructuring and deleveraging of debt  which create deflation  The 1970s was a difficult recession time  but it was inflationary  not deflationary  and not similar to the downturn that the Federal Reserve is trying to prevent now  The Fed is actively and constantly inflating the economy to prevent deflation to avoid a replay of the Great Depression  But it won t be able to hold it off indefinitely  TGR  Let s talk a bit about the debt issue  HD  In the U S   most people focus on government debt  Under George Bush  the national debt grew from  5 trillion  T  to  10T in 2000 2008  At the same time  the banking system  financial systems and shadow banking in the private sector created  22T in debt  That was the greatest debt bubble in history  and it occurred in developed countries all around the world  So we have this global debt crisis and this debt has to deleverage  Everybody is in too much debt financial institutions  consumers  businesses and governments  with central banks propping them up and bailing them out  Obviously  this can t go on forever  If the demographics weren t working against the Fed and the other central banks  it might be different  But they re fighting a battle they can t win because the baby boomers are working against them  How do you stimulate an economy when the largest part of its workforce  the aging baby boomers  wants to save and not spend  to pay down debt  That s the problem  The money the Fed creates gooses up the markets  but doesn t do much for the economy  and banks aren t lending  It s crystal clear in history  Every time you see a big debt bubble in a fall boom as in the 1860s and 1870s a depression follows  We saw this from 1873 1877 and into the early 1880s  We saw the next big bubble into the roaring 1920s  followed by the Great Depression and debt deleveraging after that  In short  debt bubbles ultimately burst and then deleverage  Deleveraging debt destroys money  so there s less money in the system and it means deflation in prices  That s very important for investors to understand  In a deflationary crisis whether in the 1930s or what started in 2008 everything goes down  commodities  stocks  real estate  even gold and silver in many cases  In deleveraging an asset bubble  all assets go down and there s nowhere to hide  Investors have to be in the U S  dollar and very safe bonds and cash and wait for the crash  and then buy at the bottom  That s the trick  Cash is king cash and cash flow  In contrast  in an inflationary crisis such as the one we had in the 1970s  commodities  gold and silver were booming  Japan was in a positive demographic cycle  Emerging countries benefited  Real estate loves inflation  In that environment  a lot of things go up  but stocks and bonds go down  In this environment  though  there s nowhere to hide  So people just have to get out of the way  Even with all the stimulus  the Fed has no way to restore normalcy with this debt level and this demographic downturn  The stimulus has merely created bubbles in stocks and commodities  and commodities are already going down pretty fast  We think stocks are next  so we expect another stock crash within the next few years  And the next crash will be worse than in 2008 2009 because the Fed has pumped everything up and stretched the system to the max  This is what happens in the winter season  It s a survival of the fittest struggle for businesses to see who will dominate their industries for decades to come  So it s a huge payoff for the companies that simply survive and it deleverages the whole debt and asset cycle and brings things back to affordability  So it s a difficult season  but it s necessary and actually good in the long term  Lower prices in general will increase the standard of living  The government is trying to skip winter  It keeps heating things up  pouring the money into the economy so the banks don t deleverage debt and the banking system doesn t collapse as it did in the 1930s  The truth is  it s only keeping us in high debt and maintaining a bubble that s not sustainable  Sooner or later  this stimulus will result in a crash that takes down the economy  The top 10  of consumers are the only ones still spending  We know from demographics that wealthier people marry and have kids a little later  Their kids go to school a little longer  so their spending peaks four to five years after the average person s  After these folks  spending peaks  which will be by the end of this year  we ll have a second demographic drag on the economy  TGR  So we re basically just getting into this 2008 2023 winter depression  How deep will the trough go  Will it bottom at the midway point  What should consumers expect over the next 20 years  HD  A winter season lasts from 13 to 15 years or so  The worst collapses in stock prices and real estate hit when the banking system deleverages  In the 1930s  that happened early on  In this case  the government took a lesson from the 1930s and decided to keep pouring money into the banking system to prevent its meltdown  But it can t be done  There s a limit to how much you can stimulate  It s like a drug  It takes more and more of the drug and it has less and less effect until it has almost no effect  and then the drug itself kills you  We re seeing that in Europe already  The last round of stimulus there Qualitative Easing  QE  2 was massive and came well after QE2 in the U S   but Europe s already back in trouble again and is having to implement all sorts of emergency procedures  There s no bailing out Spain  It has one of the biggest real estate bubbles in the world and a rapidly aging population  The Spanish people won t be buying housing for decades  TGR  What do you see in terms of stocks  HD  The worst is likely to hit in the next two years  It s a matter of when the stimulus stops working or when governments throw in the towel  At some point  for example  German citizens may just say they won t bail out another country  They ve been doing it to protect exports and avoid defaults on all of the money they ve loaned out already  but considering the demographics  it s a losing game  We ve studied all of the major debt bubbles and depressions in history  and this one is different because Keynesian economics  which came out of the Great Depression  wasn t adopted as economic policy until the 1970s recessions  So now  for the first time in history  central banks around the world the European Central Bank  ECB   the U S  Federal Reserve  the Bank of China and the Bank of Japan are actively fighting deflation  When banks start to deleverage or when deflation starts to step in  they just push money into the system  The question is  Do they lose control  Japan has been through all of this before  but when it came into its crisis in the 1990s  it had budget and trade surpluses  The rest of the world was experiencing the greatest boom in history  which we d predicted  There was mild inflationary pressure and everybody thought Japan was about to take over the world when it was about to collapse  We were among the few who predicted that ahead of time in the late 1980s  Japan continued to push money into the system and never let private debt deleverage at all in either consumer or financial sectors  Japan is still carrying very high private debt  and its government debt has risen from 60  of gross domestic product  GDP  to 230  and still climbing  So Japan didn t really go through a depression  It was more an on and off mild deflationary recession because the stimulus eased the pain  But now Japan s debt is much larger than before the crisis and deleveraging still looms ahead  Japan has been a lost economy for 22 years now  Real estate is down 60  and stocks are still down nearly 80   22 years later  Demographics say the Japanese economy will weaken even further after 2020  The interest on its debt will go up in a spring boom with rising inflation worldwide  and it will be bankrupt immediately because its debt is so high  It s only because it s borrowing at 1  or less that it can handle its deficits now  Sooner or later  this game has to end  TGR  So Japan s QE has raised government debt to more than 200  of GDP but only managed to postpone a depression  HD  Yes  it kicked the can a couple of decades down the road  It s like trying to resuscitate a patient with a defibrillator  You keep hitting the chest  clear  boom  At some point  the patient dies  If the bond markets allow the U S  to keep putting in money like Japan  we d end up with a balance sheet on the Fed at  5 6T and up with QE of  4 5T before this is over  We ve only gone about  2T so far  The Fed stimulus pushes money into the banking system  but the banks don t lend it to fuel economic growth  They cover their losses and reserves  and then turn around and reinvest the rest in government bonds and stocks  They re speculating  The money ends up in the stock markets  It s like crack in the markets  and the markets just want more crack  But the markets can t continue to go up when demographic trends are pointing down  TGR  Your earlier mention of losing control brings to mind the people of Greece out in the streets rioting because demands for further sacrifices and more fiscal austerity have become unbearable  HD  It is true  One of our financial advisers who was there recently reported every third store is closed or boarded up  Greece is in a depression and Spain s headed there  The ECB has already pumped  270 billion into Spain and Greece just to cover its bank runs  which may happen faster than the governments can fend them off  In the U S   the vulnerability is much more in real estate  as in Spain  We have a backlog of close to 4 million foreclosures already in the system  At some point  the banks will realize that home prices are not coming back  That they haven t come back in Japan after 21 years gives us a hint  But if the banks start dumping these millions of foreclosures that aren t on the market  it would kill the housing market and trigger a bank crisis that the Fed couldn t stop with stimulus  China also is vulnerable  Exports  which drive most of its economy  are declining rapidly while government spending on vacant buildings and empty cities has created a real estate bubble  If that bubble begins to seriously break down  Chinese consumers with disposable income  the top 10  of the population  own the real estate that will lose its value  TGR  A while ago  you said businesses that manage to survive the winter would dominate their industries for decades to follow  What advice do you have for those running companies to help them come out the other side of a depression  HD  First  those who are running a company and thinking about retirement within five years should sell their companies and retire now  Those who want to keep their companies and hand them down to the next generation or continue to grow them should hunker down  cut costs  cut overhead and put off capital expenditures  Rent your building  don t own it  Sell real estate  Sell marginal product lines  In fact  sell everything you don t need  Do everything to raise cash because  as I said before  cash and cash flow are king  Be lean and mean  Office space  real estate  factories  warehouses  anything you want to invest in your company will be a lot cheaper after deleveraging  Even if your business weakens  if your competitors weaken more rapidly  you re winning  At some point  a lot of your competition  just like a lot of banks  will fail  We saw this phenomenon after the Great Depression  There was a big payoff for the companies that survived  they dominated their industries for decades to come  Everybody thinks the market leaders were born in the technology revolution in automobiles and electricity in the early 1900s and into the roaring  20s  Certainly  the race was on then  but the shakeout of the Great Depression decided who was left standing  General Motors survived and absolutely dominated the automobile industry from the 1930s through the 1970s  In electronics  it was General Electric  TGR  You ve also emphasized the importance of cash and cash flow for investors  advising them to either exit the equity markets or greatly reduce their exposure to stocks  HD  Yes  Take advantage of the fact that the Fed has revived stocks and sell when the market is high  Reinvest when the prices are low  Joseph Kennedy made his fortune in the early 1930s  getting out at the top of the market when his shoeshine boy was giving him advice  When stocks were down 87   he was buying at  0 10 0 20 on the dollar  TGR  What are you doing personally to preserve or grow your wealth during this winter  HD  I moved from Miami to Tampa in 2005  at the top of the real estate bubble and I ve been renting  so I avoided a huge loss  Real estate in my neighborhood is down about 50   and probably will fall another 20 30  before it s over  I m just looking at investments to actually be short stocks  I m looking at ProShares Ultra Short MSCI Europe  EPV   which is an exchange traded fund  ETF  at two times short the MSCI Europe index  The ProShares UltraShort Financials ETF  SKF  is another good one  two times short financials  because the financials in Europe are tending to get hit the worst  I think there s a rising chance in Europe in the next few months of either a mini crash  about 20  off the top  or a major crash like 2008 2009  where Europe just blows up  One way or the other  you need to either be out of stocks or you need to bet on things going down  TGR  Any other insights  HD  We re buying natural gas  which seems to be going up since it bottomed out at  2  We re buying agricultural commodities because that s the last thing to go down in demand  and emerging market demand is still strong  Apart from natural gas and agriculture  though  pretty much everything else we see going down  TGR  What about gold  HD  I think gold has another run in it  It s trending down right now  but I d expect gold to benefit from the early stage of this crisis  If we have one more big QE coming in the U S  and Europe especially in Europe gold is likely to rally  We told people to sell silver when it hit  50 ounce  oz  in April of last year  Now we re suggesting selling gold if we see a good rally  say   2 000 oz or higher  Ultimately  there s a natural instinct to expect gold to go up in a crisis  but if you look at 2008  gold and silver went up in anticipation of a financial crisis  But when the crisis actually hit and debt started deleveraging and money supply started contracting  which happened in the second half of 2008 and early 2009  gold went down I think 32  and silver went down 50   TGR  Everything went down  HD  Exactly  That s the point  The only thing that went up was the U S  Dollar Index and Treasury bonds  This time  I think Treasury bonds may turn around  People act as if German  U S  bonds and United Kingdom bonds are risk free  They are not  These U S  and UK governments are in terrible debt  and Germany is holding the bag for Europe  People are throwing money at negative yields just because they don t know where else to go  A better bet might be to go long the dollar or  even better  short the euro  That would be a good hedge  TGR  What s the best investing advice you ever received  Harry  HD  Basically  I think you have to think contrarian  because it s just human nature for people to pile into something  especially in these bubbles we ve seen  They pile into tech stocks or real estate  thinking they can t go down  and then the bubbles burst  I learned early on to think contrary to the crowd  something like Joseph Kennedy  Right now  most investors think these markets can t go down because the Fed won t allow them to  They call it  the Bernanke Put   Well  if everybody s thinking that  I don t think that  TGR  Whom do you view as the best investors  HD  The classic ones are Benjamin Graham back in the good old days and Warren Buffett these days  although I think Buffett s off base now that he s become a cheerleader for the U S  government  TGR  You re speaking at the MoneyShow in San Francisco in late August  What major themes will you cover  HD  Basically three things  debt  demographics and deflation  People who argue that hyperinflation is ahead are dead wrong  Japan had zero inflation for the last decade despite massively more QE than we ve done relative to its economy  It would have been a deflation if it hadn t stimulated so much and the world hadn t been in an inflationary mode  Debt deleveraging leads to deflation  and aging societies are deflationary  Old people are deflationary  young people are inflationary  The inflation of the 1970s had nothing to do with monetary policy  It was the baby boom generation partying in college  spending their parents  money  It s expensive to raise kids  who don t contribute economically until they get into the productivity curve in the workforce  At that point  productivity drives down inflation  TGR  Do you expect the U S  to fare better than Europe over the next two decades because of the echo boom  as the millennial generation gets into a serious spending cycle  HD  Yes  The echo boom kicks in from about 2023 forward in the U S  and in a lot of countries  It s nowhere near the size of the baby boom generation  but enough to create growth again  But there s no echo boom in Southern Europe or in China  where the workforce will start shrinking like Japan s after 2015  Japan s little echo boom runs out by 2020  and because Japan never deleveraged its economy  it s not even benefiting much from it  But  yes  there should be a worldwide boom with the stronger developed countries Northern Europe  North America and Australia doing fairly well  though as I say  not as strong as the boom we saw in the 1980s  1990s and early 2000s  Excluding the developed countries of East Asia Japan  Korea  China the emerging world will really dominate in terms of demographics and workforce growth  Investors should be looking to invest more in emerging countries because they re going to outperform  I would look first at India and Southeast Asia  TGR  Should we be doing that now  HD  Not yet  I d wait until after the shakeout  China s slowdown is hurting emerging countries  which depend on exporting resources  and so are the collapsing commodity prices  By the way  the 29 30 year commodity cycle has nothing to do with the 40 year demographic cycle  but they happened to peak in the same timeframe  around 2007 2008  TGR  Other than going to cash  what else should people be doing to prepare for the depression deflationary period ahead  HD  Cut expenses and high interest debt  I wouldn t cut a mortgage if I m paying 4 5  tax deductible on it  but get rid of credit card debt with interest at 22   Don t make any big capital expenditures  Don t buy a house and don t let your kid buy a house  If you re more aggressive  you can bet on markets going down  For example  you actually can make money in the downturn if you short the euro  European stocks and U S  financial stocks  But for most people  it s just better to be safe  TGR  Easier said than done these days  HD  Unfortunately  the government is making it very difficult  The stimulus programs are knocking down interest rates on safer  long term bonds so people can t get yield anymore  If they go after yield  if they rush into bonds  stocks  commodities or especially dividend paying stocks which are the most popular thing now they ll get creamed when the stock market crashes  The alternative is to give up the dividends and low yields  Just be safe  You d be crazy to buy a 10 year Treasury at 1 4  yield or a 10 year bond at 1 3  yield  All the countries are going to be in trouble  TGR  Thank you  Harry

3556,225071,CACH,The Largest Economy In The World Is Imploding Right In Front Of Our Eyes,opinion,A devastating economic depression is rapidly spreading across the largest economy in the world  Unemployment is skyrocketing  money is being pulled out of the banks at an astounding rate  bad debts are everywhere and economic activity is slowing down month after month  So who am I talking about  Not the United States   the economy that I am talking about has a GDP that is more than two trillion dollars larger  It is not China either   the economy that I am talking about is more than twice the size of China  You have probably guessed it by now   the largest economy in the world is the EU economy  Things in Europe continue to get even worse  Greece and Spain are already experiencing full blown economic depressions that continue to deepen  and Italy and France are headed down the exact same path that Greece and Spain have gone  Headlines about violent protests and economic despair dominate European newspapers day after day after day  European leaders hold summit meeting after summit meeting  but all of the  solutions  that get announced never seem to fix anything  In fact  the largest economy on the planet continues to implode right in front of our eyes  and the economic shockwave from this implosion is going to be felt to the four corners of the earth  On Friday  newspapers all over Europe declared that Greece is about to   again   The Greek government says that without more aid they will completely run out of cash by the end of November  Of course the rest of Europe is going to continue to pour money into Greece because they know that if they don t the financial markets will panic  But they are also demanding that Greece make even more painful budget cuts  Previous rounds of budget cuts have been extremely damaging to the Greek economy  The Greek economy contracted by  during 2010 and by  during 2011  Overall  the Greek economy has contracted by  since 2008  This is what happens when you live way above your means for too long and a day of reckoning comes  The adjustment can be immensely painful  Greece continues to implement wave after wave of austerity measures  and these austerity measures have pushed the country into a very deep depression  but Greece still is not even close to a balanced budget  Greece is still spending more money than it is bringing in  and Greek politicians are warning what even more budget cuts could mean for their society  For example  what Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras had to say  was absolutely chilling      Greek democracy stands before what is perhaps its greatest challenge   Samaras told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview published hours before the announcement in Berlin that Angela Merkel will fly to Athens next week for the first time since the outbreak of the crisis  Resorting to highly unusual language for a man who weighs his words carefully  the 61 year old politician evoked the rise of the neo Nazi Golden Dawn party to highlight the threat that Greece faces  explaining that society  is threatened by growing unemployment  as happened to Germany at the end of the Weimar Republic    Citizens know that this government is Greece s last chance   said Samaras  who has repeatedly appealed for international lenders at the EU and IMF to relax the onerous conditions of the bailout accords propping up the Greek economy  But don t look down on Greece  They are just ahead of the curve  Eventually the U S  and the rest of Europe will go down the exact same path  Just look at Spain  When Greece first started imploding  Spain insisted that the same thing would never happen to them  But it did  By itself  Spain is the 12th largest economy in the world  and right now it is a complete and total mess with no hope of recovery in sight  The national government is broke  the regional governments are broke  the banking system is insolvent and Spain is in the midst of the worst housing crash that it has ever seen  On top of everything else  the unemployment rate in Spain is now  and the unemployment rate for those under the age of 25 is now well above 50 percent  An astounding  of all loans that Spanish banks are holding are considered to be bad loans which will probably never be collected  Before it is all said and done  probably ever major Spanish bank will need to be bailed out at least once  Manufacturing activity in Spain has contracted for   and the number of corporate bankruptcies in Spain is rising   Five different Spanish regions have formally requested bailouts from the national government  and the national government is drowning in an ocean of red ink  Meanwhile  panic has set in and there has been a run on the banks in Spain  The following is from a recent     Banco Santander SA  SAN   Spain s largest bank  lost 6 3 percent of its domestic deposits in July  according to data published by the nation s banking association  Savings at Banco Popular Espanol SA  the sixth biggest  fell 9 5 percent the same month  Eurobank Ergasias SA  Greece s second largest lender  lost 22 percent of its customer deposits in the 12 months ended March 31  according to the latest data available from the firm  Alpha Bank SA  ALPHA   the country s third biggest  lost 26 percent of client savings during that period  Overall  the equivalent of  was withdrawn from the Spanish banking system in the month of July alone  Thousands of Spaniards have become so desperate that they have resorted to  for food  In response  locks are being put on supermarket trash bins in some areas  But Greece and Spain are not alone in seeing their economies implode  As I wrote about   the number of unemployed workers in Italy has risen by  over the past year  The French economy is starting to implode as well  Just check out   The unemployment rate in France is now above 10 percent  and it has risen for   It is just a matter of time before things in Italy and France get as bad as they already are in Greece and Spain  The chief economist at the IMF is now saying that it will take  for the global economy to recover  but unfortunately I believe that he is being overly optimistic  As I have said so many times before  the next wave of the global economic crisis is rapidly approaching  Depression is already sweeping much of southern Europe  and it is only a matter of time before it sweeps across northern Europe and North America as well  Neither Obama or Romney is going to be able to stop what is coming  The global economy is  with each passing day  The central banks of the world can print money until the cows come home  but that isn t going to fix our fundamental problems  The largest economy in the world is imploding right in front of our eyes and nobody seems to know what to do about it  If you believe that Barack Obama  Mitt Romney or Ben Bernanke can somehow magically shield us from the economic shockwave that is coming then you are being delusional  Just because what is going on in Europe is a  slow motion train wreck  does not mean that it will be any less devastating  Yes  we can see what is coming and we can understand why it is happening  but that doesn t mean that we will be able to avoid the consequences ,2012-10-08,Michael T.

3557,225072,CACH,A Thought For The Next Relapse  Europe And Gold  ,opinion,An analytical piece by Stephen Fidler of  s  Brussels Beat  on October 18th raised the prospect of the use of gold as collateral for sovereign debts  something that sounds like a big step toward re monetization  One story does not make for a policy shift  but it is good that such ideas have returned to the mainstream of discussion after a long and unhealthy exile  Fidler was in turn inspired by two papers  one a policy note prepared for the European Parliament  by   and commissioned by the World Gold Council  The other paper  also commissioned by the WGC  was a  Europe Economics Executive Brief  written by  And yes  as Fidler acknowledges  the WGC is hardly a disinterested party  Still  unless we are to decide that ad hominem disqualifications are now good things   not a decision that will help anyone in search of alpha   we ought to take a look at this new fermentation about the old precious metal Portugal and Italy Either Portugal or Italy could kick off the collateralization  on Fidler s hypothesis  Each country has significant supplies of the stuff  Portugal has 383 metric tons  equaling 90 percent of its foreign reserves  Italy has close to 2 5 thousand metric tons  or 72 percent of its foreign reserve  Also  Portugal and Italy both need the ability to continue to sell bonds  Further  the  of both Portugal and Italy are more than 20 percent of their respective financing requirements over the next two years  At the moment  the euro debt crisis is in one of its periods of remission  as measured for example by the  18 billion that Italy raised in   so no such action is imminent  But nobody seems to regard the remission as a solution  and this is an intriguing thought to store away ahead of the next relapse  Northern Resentment After all  the latest remission came about courtesy of the European Central Bank s plan of   OMT   a more overtly inflationary successor to the Securities Market Program  SMP   both bond purchasing campaigns  These campaigns remain extremely controversial within Europe  in large part because the citizens of the northern countries are convinced they involve the shift of risks northward  As Belke writes   a gold based solution is much less inflation prone and does not reduce incentives for the reform of beneficiary countries   The price of gold is now standing  so to speak  on a roof  Back in 2000  gold was selling for  333 an ounce  This price crept up slowly over the following years  reaching  650 in July 2007  By that point  markets had been spooked  quite rationally   A boom largely built on the flip ability of U S  homes  and the ingenuity of the designers of derivatives  was reaching its inevitable end   sold in the U S  had clearly peaked and derivatives based on the premise that prices could go up forever were  then  plainly overvalued  No one could yet be sure of what other consequences these facts might have  but the markets were turning  So it was that in mid 2007 the price of gold began an historic four year rally  and passed  1 880 in September 2011  Is the World Ready  Prices haven t continued upward since then  but they haven t come down from that roof  either  Thus  at close of trading on Friday  October 19  2012  gold sold at about  1 740  This was off its peak of 13 months before  but still well over 500 percent of its value at the turn of the century  So  is the developed world ready to re monetize gold  Nineteen forty four was the last time such a thing happened  and it had taken a terrible war to bring that about  The resulting system  the  based ultimately on gold  worked quite well  for a time  Now we find ourselves again within a world of mutually competing fiat currencies  and there is reason to fear that it will end  and not end well  It seems both a plausible and a cheering speculation  then  that the value of gold may yet serve to strengthen the credit of two of the southern tier European nations  and this in turn will be a turning point in the re monetization of gold worldwide ,2012-10-23,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-thought-for-the-next-relapse:-europe-and-gold-140814,140814
3558,225073,CACH,More Evidence Of A European Slowdown,opinion,EUR USD  Reports Wednesday October 24 confirmed that the economic slowdown which has been plaguing the countries in Southern Europe is moving north  The German Manufacturing PMI  M M  was down to 45 7 from 47 4 last month  The Services PMI slipped to 49 3 from last month s 49 7  Continuing  the German IFO Business Climate  Current Assessment  and Expectations surveys are reflected unchanged or negative expectations  The following day  another report was released in Amsterdam by Heineken N  V  Their revenue grew at 7 1   but they noted there was a    This resulted in an earnings boost from profits in the Nigerian naira  the British pound  and the Mexican peso versus a weaker euro  For the nine month period  the global volume of Heineken and their affiliates was higher  however  the exception was a 4  sales drop in Western Europe  Is it possible that slower beer sales is a leading indicator  There is other data which suggests the Euro area debt crisis has become worse  The government debt at the end of the 2nd quarter was 90  of GDP compared to 84 9  a year ago  The highest ratios of government debt to GDP were in Greece 150 3   Italy 126 1   Portugal 117 5  and Ireland 111 5   The biggest percentage increase in 2012 from the previous year s debt to GDP was 13 4   This was in Greece  and should serve as an indictment how ineffective  perhaps destructive  the troika s austerity plan is   For the euro  it looks like the Draghi rally  prompted by his claim he would do whatever it takes to save the euro  has run its course  The recovery top was established around 1 3170 in mid September  After a retracement  the euro staged another rally but stalled at the 1 3140 area  With the European debt crisis unresolved it is difficult to make a bull case for the euro  Wednesday  the euro rallied when the Greek finance minister said the troika auditors had approved the Greek austerity efforts and the next tranche of bail out money would be coming in November  this was denied by a German official and the euro then retreated  Spanish banks have many problems  They hold billions of euros of bad real estate loans  The EU has provided a  100B which they insist are loans to the Central Government  and they would lend this money to the troubled banks  There are problems with this approach  The government debt to GDP ratio would rise beyond an accepted level for the Spanish government  Also the  100B is probably not enough to recapitalize all of the ailing banks  Further  there is no assurance the banks holding the bad paper will reduce prices to a level where the market will buy them  The real estate market cannot recovery until the price is written down to the current market level  In Europe  there is no shortage of potential troubles that can hurt the euro  In addition to Greece and Spain  the French economy is contracting  and the capitalization of the French banks is in danger  Political instability in Europe  with each new election  will remain a threat as long as the economy fails to recover  Though the seeds of the economic destruction may have been planted in years prior  current incumbent politicians will pay the price  Who knows what plans the new politicians will then bring to office  It is easy not to be bullish on the euro  but this is hardly a reason to be USD bullish  The US economy is slowly recovering  Last Thursday October 25  the monthly US Durable Goods was a positive 2   better than expected   But the growth rate at 1 5 2 0  is hardly good enough to increase employment and please the Fed s Bernanke  Until the US economy recovers  the Fed is going to continue with QE3 at the pace of at least  40B per month  This expansion of the Fed s balance sheet will increase the money supply  which  over time  depreciates the USD  Combine this with practically free money until 2015  there is then a big incentive to fund foreign investments with USD loans  There are reasons to be bearish on both currencies  this probably implies we are going to move forward in a trading range  Support appears to be around the 200SMA which is about 1 2835  a level where you buy the EUR  Resistance should be around 1 3130 where you sell the EUR  Eventually we will break out of this range  but until  then best treat this as a pair  trapped in a trading range ,2012-10-29,Cash Back Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/more-evidence-of-a-european-slowdown-141521,141521
3559,225074,CACH,The Good  The Bad  And The Onions  Part Two  ,opinion,The 5th annual TradeTech liquidity conference in London  held on November 29  was a top shelf collection of participants in and experts on Europe s equities markets  They discussed matters of liquidity  technology  and regulation in the present unsettled environment  This is the second of a two part meditation on the conference  The Slow Moving EMIR The European Market Infrastructure Regulation  EMIR  came up for discussion  especially in the second panel discussion of the morning  in which securities industry panelists had the chance to question Jasper Jorritsma  policy officer  securities market unit  DG Internal Market and Services  EC  Among those directing sometimes sharp questions at Jorritsma  Christophe Roupie  Global Head of Trading and Securities Financing  AXA Investment Managers  John Serocold  Senior Director  Market Practice and Regulatory Policy  International Capital Markets Association  Karl Spielmann  Head of Legal   Compliance  EuroCCP  and Mark Schaedel  Managing Partner  The Coba Project  EMIR came into force  subject to various transitional issues  in August 2012  requiring that any Europe based entity that is a party to a derivatives contract must report the particulars of the contract to an authorized trade repository  TR   EMIR also requires that financial counterparties to derivatives contracts must either clear their contracts through a central counterparty or adhere to certain operational risk management requirements  Spellman said that EMIR is a matter  very close to the clearing industry s heart   yet it is also a good example of how slowly things move  how matters can get held up in the European bureaucracy  He noted that in the U S   Dodd Frank regulations are only now coming into effect  two years after the bill became law  Europe  is in danger of making that look quick  by the deliberative nature of its own processes  After all  the EC published a final proposal for EMIR in September 2010  Yet as noted above it wasn t until August 2012 that most of EMIR came into force  It wasn t until late September that the European Securities and Market Authority submitted final advice regarding certain technical issues  Some provisions of EMIR still are not effective  and MiFID II is amending some of that which is effective  Bearing with MiFID in Process MiFID  the 2010 re working of the 2004 vintage Markets in Financial Instruments Directive  was a hotter topic  though  than was EMIR  and this reworking  MiFID II  was the main topic both of Jorritsma s address and of the questions directed to him thereafter  Jorritsma emphasized that when finalized MiFID II and its regulatory corollary  MiFIR  are works in progress yet   You ll have to bear with the European rule making process for two months more   he said  before a final text exists  The development of MiFIR has historical significance  by the way  in that it shows that Europe as a whole is now implementing MiFID related regulations  National interpretation of the sort expected in the old  has become superfluous  Whatever one s fondness for the notion of national sovereignty  this change seems designed to make regulatory arbitrage more difficult  One crucial aspect of MiFID MiFIR is that it will require algorithmic traders to post competitive prices on a regular continuous basis  regardless of prevailing market conditions  The Eurocrats don t want firms to just turn their computers off when things get hairy  Also  the new system imposes rules for what it calls organized trading facilities  An OTF is defined broadly enough  Jorritsma said   to capture all existing facilities that currently avoid regulation  and thus to change the nature of the OTC market  An OTF is any venue that is not a regulated market  that is operated by an investment firm  and in which buyers and sellers of financial instruments can interact in a way that results in a contract  Thus  OTFs include internal matching systems  also known as broker crossing systems  and the operators of such systems will not be able to execute client orders against the proprietary capital of the firm  The Thought is to Oblige Them  There are a lot of other obligations  too  imposed upon OTFs  including a requirement  in all but exceptional circumstances  to suspend trading in a particular instrument if another OTF  multilateral trading facility or regulated market does likewise  requirements for pre trade and post trade transparency  and requirements to retain data concerning orders for a period of five years after their receipt  Jorritsma knew that he was in the midst of a group  both on the panel and in the broader audience  that was largely skeptical of  when not more actively hostile to  much of what is involved in MiFID II  Indeed  he seemed to relish a sort of Daniel in the lion s Den role  One member of the audience  noting that the range of burdens to be placed on market makers seemed likely to discourage that activity  asked   how are you going to incentivize them   Jorritsma replied   The thought isn t to incentivize them  The thought is to oblige them  ,2012-12-12,AllAboutAlpha,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-good,-the-bad,-and-the-onions:-part-two-147142",147142

3575,225090,CACH,ACG  Intense Competition For Seed Money  ,opinion,Acceleration Capital Group  a division of Arcadia Securities LLC  is a financial services platform that assists managers in raising their day one  seed  acceleration  and institutional capital  It has recently issued  a concise report on trends in early stage capital that makes reference to two other reports on the same theme  one from  and another from the interstate law firm   Looking at these three reports in tandem I get a vivid sense of the state of play in the competition for that seeding  Some Numbers ACG says that there were 1 113 new hedge funds in 2011  and 775 funds liquidated   This is the highest  number of new funds in a year since 2007 The increase in the number of supplicants has coincided with a  decline in  the  traditional seed capital currently deployed by fewer dedicated seeders   It is  thus  unsurprising to read that hedge funds have had to pursue as many as 100 meetings to win from two to four allocations  and in the process come under a good deal of pressure to provide significant discounts in the traditional fee structure  or concessions on such other matters as liquidity  and transparency reporting What ACG considers an evolved 21st century seeder is a conduit of institutional capital that is looking for exposure to emerging talent ACG quotes an anonymous seeding vet who says   From the managers  perspective  you feel you have won the race against your peers for day one money when you fund launches with founders share investments   But it is important for the managers to remember that although they may have won that race  there is no time to be cocky  another race is just beginning  the race to get the  regular  limited partner money  If they fail to keep this in mind  they fall victim to what that individual calls the  victims curse  FeesACG cites the Seward   Kissel study of hedge funds sponsored by new U S  based managers who entered the market in 2011 and thus excluding new funds opened that year by existing managers Sewkis found that the sort of competitive pressures described by ACG are pushing down the management fee rates  but that are not yet having much of an effect upon the incentive fee  The old mantra is  20   2   in other words  20 percent of annual net profits as performance incentive and 2 percent of net assets per annum as management fee  The 20 percent benchmark is holding up  The 2 percent figure  though  now holds true for only a little more than half of the firms surveyed  The mean per annum rate is now 1 71 percent Chart Source  Seward   Kissel LLCThe competitive pressures may also be having consequences for liquidity  Only 10 percent of the funds Seward   Kissel surveyed had a  hard lockup  of funds for the first year as part of the conditions of investment  Likewise  most of the funds involved in the study had no redemption gates  either at the redemption or at the fund level Chart Source  Seward   Kissel LLCEarly investors make a wider range of demands than that  though  As the Citi report indicates  they also often want special redemption rights  additional reporting  transparency requirements  and  most favored nation  treatment  Managers have to be careful not to give away the proverbial store here in their eagerness to get this seeding  These issues need to be properly positioned and structured with all investors   in order to minimize potential conflicts and hurdles  Citi says One way to structure preferential fee terms is through the creation of a  founders  class  of shares  a structure that may be set out in the offering memorandum Launch SizeInvestors concern themselves with launch size too  Before the global financial crisis  there were some  1 billion AUM launches  In the new normal  those fond memories can be put aside  but investors  especially in the U S   still have threshold AUMs in mind when looking for promising emerging managers  According to the Citi survey  two thirds of the EMEA and APAC respondents Citi surveyed said they had made day one or early stage allocations to managers with AUM under launch below  100 million  Only one third of U S  based respondents acknowledged having done the same Finally  investors have decided views on who should be running the emerging management firms  what their resumes should look like  Said a large fund of fund questioned by Citi   Ex prop desk managers need more of an education to understand that they should not try to do it alone  If they launch with a senior COO to manage the business aspects of the firm they will greatly improve their chances of success  ,2012-07-15,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acg:-intense-competition-for-seed-money-129586,129586
3577,225092,CACH,Mister Market Is Cheery For Now,opinion,There was no news from Greece today  although optimistic journalists penned excited articles indicating  progress  such as the idea that the ECB  headed by Mario Draghi  not Mario Monti as I incorrectly wrote yesterday  might exchange its Greek bonds for new Greek bonds  It is unclear to me if this is progress  but it certainly isn t big progress  The latest rumor is that  the deal will be completed on Monday   with a little asterisk that  the deal  is the offer to Greece that has 24 preconditions that need to be completed by the end of the month  And  the deal  doesn t include the private sector initiative  And  the deal  hasn t been signed off on by any of the legislatures that would have to actually approve it  To me  it doesn t sound like a lot of progress  but investors are clearly predisposed to be excited by anything that anyone calls  the deal   even if it s not Mister Market was cheerful today  though  and looked kindly on the positive economic data  Initial Claims recorded a new post Lehman low at 348k  and Housing Starts approached a new high by printing 699k  The Philadelphia Fed was good  except for the  Number of Employees  subindex  which actually looks a little weak at the moment  see Chart  That small blemish is no reason to toss out the entire carton of apples  though  and investors were justifiably upbeat about the data  I have more trouble explaining why Mister Market was so willing to ignore the awful news that Moody s is preparing to slash bank credit ratings soon  I don t think investors understand the implications  perhaps figuring that since a downgrade of the US didn t cause any alarm then why should a downgrade of Morgan Stanley   why it should  but today bank and financial shares outperformed the rest of the market No doubt  U S  commercial banks are further away from insolvency than they have been in a while  and loan growth is showing it  The chart below  Source  Federal Reserve Board  H 8 report  is updated as of the latest available data  commercial loan growth is now growing at a 4 2  pace year year  the fastest pace since November 2008 Incidentally  that also means that the enormous cache of sterile reserves the Fed has added is no longer just sitting there  It is starting to circulate  which is one reason that M2 growth is still at  10  y y  where it has been essentially since August But  getting back to the market  while current loan volumes are better than they have been in a while  that s partly because banks don t have many other ways to make a buck these days  And this data is backward looking  while a downgrade is negative in the future  It isn t as if these banks are good values even before a downgrade  Goldman is at 16x earnings  with revenues down 20  over the last year and ROE is 5 5   Bank of America is at 8x earnings  with revenues  14 6  and ROE of 0   I should add that Goldman is up 27  year to date and Bank of America is up 45    This is not an investment recommendation  and I m not long or short either stock  The rally in stocks helped push bonds lower  and the 10 year yield again reached for the 2  level  Since November  the 10 year note hasn t been outside of a 1 80  2 10  range  which is amazing quiescence  There are two obvious pressures on bonds  On the bullish side  you have the fact that Europe is and will continue to be a basket case for some time  But on the bearish side  you have 2 2  current  core  inflation and the Fed targeting approximately that level  2  nominal yields is clearly a losing proposition and clearly too low absent a significant deflation  At some point  this tension will be resolved and yields will move sharply  I will observe that the inflation and Fed targeting arguments aren t going to go away for a long time  while the Europe story will eventually fade  I remain short fixed income The crowning economic data point of the week  well  at least from my perspective  will be the CPI  released tomorrow  The consensus call for headline inflation month month is  0 3   and  0 2  on core inflation  leading the headline figure to drop to  2 8  year year and leaving the core year year number unchanged at  2 2  That actually implies that the market forecast for core is for a  soft   0 2   meaning something that rounds up to that figure  A true 0 2  should cause the year year core rate to rise to 2 3   Since we haven t had a true 0 2  since August  this seems like a reasonable guess  I think it is a reasonable guess  but not because of the recent below trend prints  The housing subindex of CPI has been rising at a faster pace than it probably should be  given the inventory overhang  and last month it decelerated on a year year basis  I think this will probably continue for at least a few months  keeping core apparently tame  That also  though  means that we need to be careful to look at core ex housing  The expected softness in housing is a wonderful gift to the Federal Reserve here  who could point to the core number and pretend they don t know it s because the unwinding bubble is still dampening the cost of housing  It means there may not be much pressure to reduce their accommodation even if inflation in the non bubble economy continues  Core inflation ex housing rose at a 2 5  pace for 2011  up from 1 1  for 2010  I expect a continued rise there although probably at a lower rate of acceleration Tomorrow s report also involves revised seasonal adjustment factors  which happen to suggest that either the m m headline figure will be a little softer than 0 3  or else the actual CPI index itself will be a little higher than 226 573  which is the consensus estimate  this latter figure matters only if you own inflation indexed bonds  the rest of you may ignore it  The U S  markets will be closed on Monday  which also means that this author is unlikely to write then  I will probably write something after the CPI report  but then use the weekend and Monday to work on our firm s Quarterly Inflation Outlook   Thanks to all of the readers who made last night s article one of the most viewed I have written in a long time  Do pass along these articles  or better yet links to them  to your friends  Tweet them   And follow  inflation guy  On Bloomberg  you can type NH TWT INFLATION GUY for my Twitter feed  something I just discovered   And let me know what you think about them ,2012-02-16,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mister-market-is-cheery-for-now-114239,114239

3580,225095,CACH,EDHEC On CDS Speculators And Eurozone Bonds ,opinion,Dominic O Kane  of the EDHEC Business School  has performed an analysis of the relationship between the credit default swaps market and the market for the underlying bonds  with reference specifically to the bonds issued by the Eurozone s more credit challenged countries The result is a working paper for the  that is at least in part a reaction to the European Parliament s ban on naked CDS  in October 2011  That Parliament was clearly acting on the hypothesis that speculative trading in CDS s in 2010 2011 had pushed bond prices down in the eurozone periphery  worsening the  EDHEC Risk  in a news release that accompanied O Kane s report  expressed the view that the ban on naked CDS s may be counterproductive  that is  it may cause harm to the banking system by  removing one sovereign risk mitigation tool  Causal Links and RadarsO Kane s study itself undermines the naked CDS ban from the other direction  not by pointing to its costs but by questioning the reality of its alleged benefits  The ban does some good only if there is a clear causal relationship between the CDS market and the referenced bonds  with the suspect activity in the former creating distortions in the latter  O Kane cautions against accepting that causal link  His point turns on the difference between statistical  Granger  causality and physical causality There is  he writes   evidence for a Granger causal relationship with a one day lag for CDS and bonds for Greece and Spain  the reverse relationship for France and Italy  and a feedback relationship for Ireland and Portugal  Granger causality is a  in which the past value of Y improves an observer s ability to predict a future value for X  Because of the element of a time lag  this is something more than mere correlation  but it is still considerably less than what O Kane calls  pure causation in a physical sense   which requires a  transmission mechanism   If there is no Granger causality  then it seems a safe inference there is no physical causation either  but the reverse inference does not hold Indeed  the relationship between these two markets that O Kane posits might almost be taken as a paradigm of the difference between Granger causation and physical causation  Consider the case of two distinct radar systems  one better at longer range detection than the other  The superior radar system will detect an oncoming airplane before the inferior system will  Thus  there will be a relationship of Granger causation between the detection of a particular blip on the better system and its detection on the other system  If we see an incoming blip on the better system we will be able to predict that it will soon show up on the inferior system  It doesn t follow  though  that the one radar is physically causing anything to happen to the other radar  The oncoming airplane is the physical cause of the blips  and the mechanics of the two radar systems are the physical causes of the time lag  That is the relationship that O Kane posits between the CDS market and the market for the underlying bonds  The deteriorating credit worthiness of the countries issuing those bonds serves as the oncoming airplane in our analogy Let us note explicitly the similarities  the CDS and the bond markets involve the same credit risk  Further  at what O Kane calls a  micro market structure level   most dealers have the same traders make markets in both instruments  Thus  they are sensitive to the same approaching planes    The  arrival of new information about the reference entity sovereign   will quickly be reflected in the prices of both  But the workings of the two radars differ  On this  O Kane refers us to a study by     Did CDS Trading Improve the Market for Corporate Bonds    2011   suggesting  in O Kane s paraphrase  that  the greater convenience of the CDS market means that price discovery occurs there before it does in the bond market   One way in which the CDS market  an over the counter market in synthetic assets  is more convenient is simply that it is equally liquid in both directions  in contrast to the bond markets which are more liquid for buyers than for sellers   Also  it is easier to trade in large sizes through the CDS market and easier to use leverage In general  CDS is  the preferred instrument for those seeking to implement a short credit position   This may well have made it in certain circumstances the better radar  and thus may explain the Granger causality for Greece and Spain ,2012-04-10,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/edhec-on-cds-speculators-and-eurozone-bonds-119629,119629

3582,225097,CACH,Final Thoughts On JP Morgan  By Mark St  Cyr  ,opinion,I was having a discussion on the JP Morgan  JPM  news and was asked  How would you have advised them differently  After all one would assume they have at the ready the best consultants or public relations firms money can buy advising them    Fair point  but the assumption that just because they have money to spend doesn t mean the value of the advice received will equal it  You can spend a near fortune obtaining worthless advice then spend nearly twice as much trying to repair the damage from the original investment  And the latter will always remain an open question of   If    I decided it was a fair and relevant topic for discussion and although I normally don t write about certain strategies and tactics I would advise for a client  in other words opinions are free  advice I charge  I decided to write what I would have advised with my reasoning for stating so   This post will be a little longer in breath than most  but I wanted it to be available to you or anyone else whom might be new here  And there are many  and thank you   rather than writing a white paper and putting it in the archives  So with no more fanfare let s get into it   Mitigating the debacle caused by the CIO  Chief Investment Office  in London   As of this writing JPM is regarded in the minds of many to have two faces  One face is of greedy financial executives cheating depositors and taxpayers alike for their own benefits while leaving behind a wasteland of financial disasters in their wake  The other holds JPM in a slightly better limelight than most others  It seems they have been able to keep some of their cache  intact with being looked upon as one of the more prudent  well run  less riskier institutions with a straight shooting  credible CEO at the helm  What will be critical to management from the CEO down will be to embrace while understanding the former image of greedy reckless behavior will overshadow the latter view in the public s perceptions and minds  You will not be able to overcome a very emotionally charged subject with logic at first  That will take a consistent effort and marketing campaign that will involve all levels of management for the foreseeable future  This will not be viewed as a one time problem or issue  This will be viewed by the public as systemic and will be fueled by the press and other news outlets as  red meat to the masses   The first critical words uttered will set the stage which will be relentless  Management must realize this dilemma will fuel an image problem  an emotional perception  You won t be making logical arguments to people who know or understand your business  They want to know where to gather with the pitchforks  Understanding this will go far in mitigating the issue  Execution of tactics is now paramount    As of right here most of you have seen the financial channels or media outlets  You ve heard Jamie Dimon s reasoning or defensive statements and more  I ll just write what I would have advised if they had done nothing as of this moment    What needs to be understood at JPM   Since the financial collapse of 2008 public perception of the financial sector is that not only have they not learned from it  but is currently engaged in even more riskier assets since the collapse  and with their money  not the banks  They hear of legislation passed  not passed  implemented  not implemented all laced with ridicule  misunderstandings  and misconceptions  Even the more sophisticated of market mavens are having a hard time understanding what is good and what s not  No matter how manageable JPM thinks the risk might be in the losses accruing  the perceived details available to the press will have all the trappings of tabloid styled headlines the press will be delighted in running with  Mr  Dimon is the type of CEO whom is comfortable in front of the camera while being asked tough questions  The initial statement should be initiated  and delivered by him  Here s how he should address the press    What I would have written for Mr  Dimon s press conference   I want to address an issue first hand before anyone in the press or other outlets run with this story as to give JPM s customers  shareholders  and even the American people solace as to a situation that arose in our London office over the weekend  I see it as my duty as CEO of JPM to make sure that people have no misconceptions and to put minds at ease so they can make their own logical conclusions  As with anything regarding banks or financial institutions there will be a myriad of tabloid expectations and story writing  Although some will try to overstate the severity  in the actual operations of JPM this is well within our parameters and profiles of risk management  Managing risk is what JPM is all about for both our clients and shareholders   I was made aware that a hedging strategy that was being executed in our London office seemingly has over run its risk profile parameters  Although the sum to most at first blush might seem large and makes for a great headline the risk to JPM is minimal  Although I am of the belief no loss is a good loss  There are times where you need to pull plugs even if you are capable of correcting the mistakes  For us at JPM it s a matter of financial management along with the perception we know many have of the banking and financial sectors  I believe it is my duty as CEO of JPM in understanding that perception is everything  regardless of my ability to stand here and state how we are completely in control and understood the risks when we first entered into this strategy  With that understanding clearly in mind I am compelled to address it before anyone else so that it may be understood clearly  and factually   The CIO in our London office has reported to me they will experience a  2 billion dollar loss as a result of parameters poorly executed by the team in charge of that strategy  Although the sum sounds large I would remind everyone that JPM is on track to earn for its shareholders over  14 billion in profits  Although this amount will of course result in a dent to our original projections as anyone with even a grade school grasp of mathematics can understand 14 is far larger than 2   Some will try to make a story or for some push an agenda of if it s so small why even state it  The reasoning is we reported our quarterly earnings just weeks ago  If I or we were to say nothing on this subject only to report it at our next earnings report we would be by our own dint fueling perceptions of secrecy or the letting of others sensationalize such an event  Although waiting until our next report is well within our rights to do so  I felt in today s world of misconceptions  distrust  and other perceptions the public has of the banking and financial system whether deserved or not  I thought it was only proper to address this myself as to put at rest any misconceptions that might arise   Our CIO office in London reported to me that the parameters set regarding a hedging strategy had been breached  The reasons for the breach in my estimation is unacceptable  Although it is possible to salvage the losses incurred the cost in retro fitting and personnel change is not worth the effort  It has been decided it is more equitable to jettison the strategy completely rather than as the saying goes throw good money after bad  The head of the office is Ina Drew  She has since tendered her resignation  I have accepted it  I have placed Matt Zanes to fill that position  JPM will pursue any and all fixes needed to ensure this situation isn t repeated   As with everything at JPM the buck stops with me  I have alerted the board of my decisions and asked the board to conduct a full review of the matter  I have also instructed the board that if they find anything improper or a mismanagement on my end that for any reason put JPM at risk or its shareholders I would tender my resignation if they wish  Both the board as well as the shareholders must feel secure that one of Americas finest financial institutions is being managed with correct discipline and adherence to proper risk management that today s turbulent markets demand   I will be happy to take a few questions   And that s what I would have had Mr  Dimon say   As you can see the above is far different from the response that was actually delivered  The problem with what was originally delivered by Mr  Dimon was it left far too many questions unanswered than answered  It sounded more like someone covering their derriere more than it did about getting in front of something to put to rest the issues  I feel their original press conference followed by the Sunday show appearances allowed more fodder for the innuendo crowd of writers and talking heads  Without concise details  and the direct understandable reasoning on why you are speaking to begin with  followed by an understandable layman s view of why the public needn t worry they will find themselves arguing the same points over and over again reigniting old wounds rather than the ability to leave scars behind and get on with healing process ,2012-05-22,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/final-thoughts-on-jp-morgan-(by-mark-st.-cyr)-123854,123854
3584,225099,CACH,Major U S  Retailers Are Closing More Than 6 000 Stores,opinion,"If the U S  economy really is improving  then why are big U S  retailers permanently shutting down thousands of stores  The  retail apocalypse  that I have written about so frequently appears to be accelerating  As you will see below  major U S  retailers have announced that they are closing more than 6 000 locations  but economic conditions in this country are still fairly stable  So if this is happening already  what are things going to look like once the next recession strikes  For a long time  I have been pointing to 2015 as a major  turning point  for the U S  economy  and I still feel that way  And since I started The Economic Collapse Blog at the end of 2009  I have never seen as many indications that we are headed into another major economic downturn   If retailers are closing this many stores already  what are our malls and shopping centers going to look like a few years from now 
The list below comes from information compiled by About com  but I have only included major retailers that have announced plans to close at least 10 stores  Most of these closures will take place this year  but in some instances the closures are scheduled to be phased in over a number of years  As you can see  the number of stores that are being permanently shut down is absolutely staggering

So why is this happening 
Without a doubt  Internet retailing is taking a huge toll on brick and mortar stores  and this is a trend that is not going to end any time soon 
But   we have also seen a stunning decline in true discretionary consumer spending over the past six months 

What we find is that over the past 6 months we had a tremendous drop in true discretionary consumer spending  Within the overall downtrend we do see a bit of a rally in February but quite ominously that rally failed and the bottom absolutely fell out  Again the importance is it confirms the fundamental theory that consumer spending is showing the initial signs of a severe pull back  A worrying signal to be certain as we would expect this pull back to begin impacting other areas of consumer spending  The reason is that American consumers typically do not voluntarily pull back like that on spending but do so because they have run out of credit  And if credit is running thin it will surely be felt in all spending 

The truth is that middle class U S  consumers   Most families are just scraping by financially from month to month  For most Americans  there simply is not a whole lot of extra money left over to go shopping with these days 
In fact  at this point approximately one out of every four Americans spend at least half of their incomes just on rent 

More than one in four Americans are spending at least half of their family income on rent   leaving little money left to purchase groceries  buy clothing or put gas in the car  new figures have revealed 
A staggering 11 25 million households consume 50 percent or more of their income on housing and utilities  according to an analysis of Census data by nonprofit firm  Enterprise Community Partners 
And 1 8 million of these households spend at least 70 percent of their paychecks on rent 
The surging cost of rental housing has affected a rising number of families since the Great Recession hit in 2007  Officials define housing costs in excess of 30 percent of income as burdensome 

For decades  the U S  economy was powered by a free spending middle class that had plenty of discretionary income to throw around  But now that the middle class is being systematically destroyed  that paradigm is changing  Americans families simply do not have the same resources that they once did  and that spells big trouble for retailers 
As you read this article  the United States still has more retail space per person than any other nation on the planet  But as stores close by the thousands   space available  signs are going to be popping up everywhere  This is especially going to be true in poor and lower middle class neighborhoods  Especially after what we just witnessed in Baltimore  many retailers are not going to hesitate to shut down underperforming locations in impoverished areas 
And remember  the next major economic crisis has not even arrived yet  Once it does  the business environment in this country is going to change dramatically  and a few years from now America is going to look far different than it does right now ",2015-05-03,Michael T.
