3995,225510,AMWD,Is American Woodmark  AMWD  A Profitable Stock Pick Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put American Woodmark Corporation   NASDAQ AMWD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  American Woodmark has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 44  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 15  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level American Woodmark puts current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 20 30  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 27  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that American Woodmark has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  American Woodmark has a P S ratio of about 1 08  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 48 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  American Woodmark currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AMWD a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear too Its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 13  which is noticeably better than the industry average of 11 08  Clearly  AMWD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall 
Though American Woodmark might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives AMWD a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while current year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0 7  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has improved 2 04  in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below American Woodmark Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerican Woodmark is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  Top 19  out of more than 250 industries  and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most Likely for Early Price Pops   Since 1988  the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of  24 6  per year  So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention ",2020-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-american-woodmark-amwd-a-profitable-stock-pick-now-200495975,200495975

4004,225519,AMWD,Use Rising P E Strategy To Grab 5 Winning Stocks,opinion,"A common investing technique is to hunt for stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  That s because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for  1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why 
Power of Increasing P E
The concept is that as earnings rise  so should the price of the stock  As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher  strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings 
Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  Now if the P E ratio becomes 35 within a short spell of time  it means that the person is ready to pay  35 for only  1 worth of earnings  It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals 
So  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal   
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 66 
Here are five out of the 66 stocks 
Columbia Sportswear Company    NASDAQ COLM     The company is a global leader in design  sourcing  marketing and distribution of active outdoor apparel and footwear  It hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 25    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1

4009,225524,AMWD,Buy 4 Stocks With Rising Cash Flows To Enrich Your Portfolio,opinion,Investing in stocks based on top line growth and increasing profit numbers might be a popular choice  But choosing stocks based on a company s efficiency in generating cash flows can be far more rewarding This is because even a profit making company can have a dearth of cash flow and become bankrupt while meeting its obligations if its profits are not channelized in the right direction  But a company can effectively weather any market mayhem if it has a solid cash position as that lends a company the flexibility to make decisions  the means to invest and the fuel to run its growth engine  It is indeed the key to a company s existence  development and success  and reveals a company s true financial health To find this efficiency  one needs to consider its net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at

4010,225525,AMWD,Top 6 Stocks With Solid Net Profit Margin,opinion,Net profit margin is the most important entry in an income statement  as it demonstrates the affluence of a company  It determines the efficiency of a company in deploying its resources  making it the best metric to measure a company s profitability   Net Profit Margin   Net profit  Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Higher net profit is indispensable for rewarding stakeholders  Also  strength in the metric not only attracts new investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin as compared to peers lends a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective to analyze a company s performance The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought after elements in a business model Apart from these  we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months   Most Recent     greater than equal to 0  High net profit margin

4011,225526,AMWD,Spirit Airlines  American Woodmark  Amazon And Delta Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 7  2018    Spirit Airlines   NYSE SAVE   as the Bull of the Day  American Woodmark Corporation   NASDAQ AMWD   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Delta   NYSE DAL   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  Spirit Airlinesjust gave bullish revised fourth quarter guidance  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is at new 52 week highs as earnings are expected to jump by the double digits in both 2018 and 2019 Spirit Airlines is a low cost airline that operates 500 daily flights to 70 destinations in the US  Latin America and the Caribbean Raised Fourth Quarter GuidanceOn Nov 26  Spirit raised its fourth quarter total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  by 5 points to 11  year over year versus its initial guidance of about 6  year over year The big boost is primarily being driven by higher non ticket revenue and higher load factor expectations  The non ticket gains were in its new dynamic pricing on seats  bags and bundled service offerings The company s recent network re alignment  and its initiative to optimize peak and off peak scheduling  has also resulted in higher than expected load factors It also believes that a stronger industry environment  especially around the busy peak travel periods  is contributing to some of the improved revenue outlook Lower Fuel Prices a BoostAdditionally  the sudden November plunge in crude prices is going to boost EPS in the fourth quarter dramatically as well In its third quarter earnings update in October  Spirit gave guidance on fuel cost per gallon of  2 46 On Nov 26  it revised that downward to just  2 27 Estimates Revised Up for 2018 and 2019The analysts are bullish on the end of the year and the outlook for 2019 with the duel market conditions of lower fuel costs and higher RASM 9 analysts have revised their 2018 estimates in the last 30 days  with one even revising it higher in just the last week The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to  4 22 from  3 66 during that time  That s earnings growth of 26  as the company made just  3 33 in 2017 2019 looks solid as well with 8 analysts raising estimates  pushing the 2019 Zacks Consensus up to  5 47 from  4 51 over the last month  That s earnings growth of another 30  Shares Hit New 2 Year HighWhile the rest of Wall Street was mired in the red  Spirit shares have been soaring They ve gained 39 3  year to date and are hitting new 2 year highs  American Woodmark Corporation is facing cost pressures across multiple channels  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is struggling as more tariffs loom American Woodmark makes kitchen  bath and home organization products for the remodeling and new home construction markets including kitchen cabinets and vanities It operates 18 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico and 7 primary service centers located throughout the United States Big Miss in the Fiscal Second QuarterOn Nov 29  American Woodmark reported its fiscal second quarter 2019 results and missed the Zacks Consensus by  0 29  Earnings were  1 60 versus the consensus of  1 89 Excluding the RSI Home Products acquisition  which closed on Dec 29  2017  sales were up 8  to  297 7 million and the company saw growth across all channels However  it is getting crushed across multiple channels as costs rise in logistics  which is transportation  labor  and materials  In materials  it continues to see increases in hardwood  plywood and paint Then the tariffs are another added cost on top of that American Woodmark is still looking to mitigate the impacts that a possible 25  tariffs would have on its business but it can t mitigate it all Estimates SlashedWith fiscal 2019 still remaining a challenge due to the cost pressures  the analysts moved to cut their fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 earnings estimates 2 estimates were cut in the last month for fiscal 2019 pushing the Zacks Consensus down to  6 92 from  7 62  That s still earnings growth of 32  compared to fiscal 2018  however 2 estimates were also slashed for fiscal 2020  pushing the 2020 Zacks Consensus Estimate down to  8 07 from  8 66  That s 16 6  earnings growth Shares At 2 Year LowsInvestors have been fleeing the housing and remodeling stocks since the summer of 2018  If a recession is coming  who wants to own them Shares of American Woodmark are no exception  They have plunged 52  year to date and are at 2 year lows They re cheap  with a forward P E of just 9 but it s not clear when the inflationary pressures will moderate Maybe Facial Recognition Isn t the Best Way Along with every other technological advancement  facial recognition has also joined in  Many companies and softwares use it in their products to identify the person s  opening a device or for security reasons  In recent news  Amazon and the U S  Secret Service have been receiving criticism for their decision to install facial recognition biometrics in their chosen areas Your Face Might Not Be Safe Out There  Amazon launched its facial recognition system  Rekognition  in 2016 and since then  there has been quite a lot of controversy over it  Amazon was accused of giving away the facial recognition software tools to different law enforcement agencies  according to a FOIA request that the ACLU submitted  Many civil rights groups and organizations have reached out to Amazon to put a stop to this  as it could be a potential threat to vulnerable individuals and communities Although a tool used by many businesses and that has proven to be somewhat successful  it still poses as an ethical concern to many  According to   facial recognition allows strangers using the software to identify individuals who don t wish to be identified ACLU ran a test using Amazon s recognition software where the software ended up misidentifying people of color in the database  They cross referenced 25 000 mugshots with photos of Congress members  From the test  the people of color who were  identified  accounted for 40  of the wrongly matched faces when they actually accounted for only 20  Technology and Civil Liberties Director for the ACLU in Northern California  Nicole Ozer  mentions that once powerful surveillance systems like these are built  the harm can t be undone  Yes  it is true that many companies and organizations do use facial recognition and that there are benefits to it  but once it gets out of hand it has the power to track protestors  target immigrants  and spy on neighborhoods  according to  Similarly  the Secret Service has just started testing a facial recognition system as a means of protection for the president and members of the White House  Although they haven t revealed what company s facial recognition system they are using  the Secret Service had security cameras installed outside the White House  These cameras installed with the facial recognition technology allows images of people to be taken and then matched those images to  people of interest  This could potentially pose a problem  seeing as numerous studies  as well as research by the U S  Government Accountability Office  shows a lot of facial recognition technology is more likely to mistakenly identify people of color  which can lead to wrongful accusations and arrests Just like Amazon s software was a concern to many privacy and civil rights groups  the same goes for the Secret Service s actions  According to   these groups worry that the government can  target  anyone with these cameras and software  Hence  it was advised by the Secret Service that if you don t want to be identified  avoid the area until they are done testing out the surveillance program OverviewSo much of our everyday lives are controlled by one technology or another  Whether it s our cameras on our smartphones or Delta s facial recognition terminal  there are opportunities everywhere to capture anyone s photograph and have it analyzed  identified and stored in some database More Stock News  This Is Bigger

find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  American Woodmark has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 2  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  American Woodmark s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 21 8 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that American Woodmark has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for American Woodmark stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  American Woodmark has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  American Woodmark currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes American Woodmark a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for American Woodmark is just 1 3  a level that is a bit lower than the industry average of 1 7  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though American Woodmark might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives AMWD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to two downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and downward revision each in the same time period This has had just a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below American Woodmark Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerican Woodmark is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 15  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get to excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Furniture industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you can more effectively safeguard your retirement with a new Special Report   4 Warning Signs Your

NASDAQ AMWD      and Kraton Corp  NYSE    NYSE KRA      Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Obama Trump Bull Run Is the 2nd Best Ever  Top 5 GainersThe Obama Trump bull market on Wall Street is now the second strongest ever  with the broader market performing exceptionally well since Donald Trump was elected as the President  Wall Street s post election rally was driven by expectations of tax cuts  and supported by steady economic recovery and corporate earnings In fact  the equity market scaled new highs after the adverse effects of Irma waned  and easing of tensions between North Korea and the West increased risk appetite  Banking on such optimism  it will be judicious to invest in such stocks that have not only gained significantly during this record bull run but also have scope of scaling higher Obama Trump Bull Market is Now Up 268 The S P 500 surged 268  since bottoming in March 2009  when the economy was struck by the Great Recession  This means that if you had invested  10 000 in the benchmark index during the dark days  it would be worth almost  37 000 today The existing bull run narrowly eclipsed the gains generated by the 1949 1956 bull run  as per data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group  It  however  fell short of the best bull run ever   the boom of 1987 2000  Such a boom started during the end of the Cold War and was later propelled by the internet revolution Nevertheless  this time around  majority of the stock market s gains happened during the tenure of former President Barrack Obama  During his eight year tenure in office  the equity market more than tripled and reached top gear in the Trump era  The S P 500 registered a staggering  2 04 trillion in market value since Trump s election last November  said Howard Silverblatt  senior Index analyst at S P Dow Jones Indices  One of the biggest beneficiaries is the information technology sector Trump s Tax Policy ProposalsThe benchmark index moved north after the election  in part  on expectations of tax reforms  A key component of such a tax reform is to bring overseas profits to the United States  without paying the 35  corporate tax rate  Under Trump s proposal  companies need to pay only 10  on money they bring back  often known as  repatriation  Last week Trump said in North Dakota   We must bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that s parked overseas   He wants to do so to spur jobs and growth  Tim Cook  Apple s chief executive also said that it should be made mandatory for companies to bring money back to the government to spend it on building roads and bridges However  tax reforms did sway as the White House faced some hurdles to move its agenda forward  including in party differences  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  however  gave a ray of hope   At the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference  he said that the government will consider backdating tax cut to Jan 1 to give a boost to the American economy Economic Recovery Solid  Corporate Earnings EncouragingIn fact  stronger economic growth and corporate earnings  both at home and overseas  helped the stock market gain traction  The U S  GDP expanded 3  in the second quarter  the fastest rate of growth in more than two years  An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment gave the economy a boost  Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3 3  in the said quarter  Consumer spending   the biggest driver of the economy   picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation Meanwhile  the Q2 earnings season is nearing its end  Total earnings for the S P 500 members in the quarter increased 11 6  from the same period last year on 6 1  higher revenues  Additionally  total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 members are expected to increase 4 2  from the same period last year on 5 6  higher revenues  For this year  total earnings for the S P 500 members are expected to increase 8 1  on 5  higher revenues  which would follow a paltry 0 7  earnings growth on 2 1  higher revenues last year  read more    Stocks Set New Highs as Irma  North Korea Fears EbbWall Street  meanwhile  breathed a sigh of relief after hurricane Irma shifted its direction and eased fears of widespread devastation in Florida  Irma gradually lost strength once it made landfall on the Florida Keys on Sep 10  The eye of the storm missed Miami and lost steam once it crossed the mostly uninhabited Everglades  Following this  Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm Investors were also relieved that tensions between the United States and North Korea didn t worsen further  following a national holiday in the rogue nation  The White House wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on North Korea and at the same time freeze Kim Jong un s assets in response to his regime s sixth nuclear test last week  The United States is also demanding a ban on North Koreans working abroad since they pass most of the foreign currency to the regime Top 5 WinnersBanking on such positives  we have selected five solid stocks that have outperformed in the current bull

4381,225896,AMWD,What the Market Wants  Who Will Blink First ,opinion,Today was not pretty  Stemming from a sign of opposition to more stimulus from the Chinese government  shares in the Shanghai Composite dropped 5 3  overnight  its largest one day fall in four years  The Industrial   Commercial Bank of China went limit down at 10   Given the signs of disagreement among our domestic Fed members  that was enough to send our markets reeling at the open  By noon EDT  the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen well over 200 points  and the S P 500 and Nasdaq were both off more than 2   with decliners beating advancing issues on the NYSE by more than 20 to 1 More rational trading took hold in the afternoon  with the Dow Jones closing down 1   the S P 500 losing well over 1   and the Nasdaq losing over 1   The NYSE decline advance ratio  improved  to a little worse than 1 to 6  No  not a pretty day  Interest rates continued to climb today  with the 10 year US bond yield reaching a high of 2 66   up a startling 50 basis points from just last Tuesday  Fortunately  afternoon trading sent the 10 year yield lower to close at 2 53  because traders showed little enthusiasm for buying the 10 year bond at 2 66   his was likely due to the rapid rise and the unwillingness to risk overnight losses in US treasury bonds  Clearly  the rapid exit of dollars from the fixed income market has not yet translated into a rapid flow of dollars into the equity markets  but equities is where much of those funds will likely end up  given the rising risk of bonds  It is really a case of  who blinks first   Assuming the stock market holds near the current support levels  it is our opinion that the bond contingent who have sold or will sell their bonds will blink first by purchasing equities There were few pockets of safety today  Gold  silver  and most currencies also fell  although silver rallied to close up a bit  Crude oil had a decent day  gaining 1 4  All domestic stock sectors fell sharply today  Financials were down the worst   1 87   with Industrials   1 53   and Technology   1 39   close behind  Utilities were down the least at  0 08   The remainder of the week will challenge both equity investors and fixed income investors  due to the plethora of economic releases scheduled this week  Although there were no significant releases today  that will change  beginning tomorrow  That s when we get the important durable goods number for May and  perhaps more importantly  a preliminary consumer confidence report for June  In both cases  analysts expect

4382,225897,AMWD,5 Low Leverage Stocks To Keep Your Investments Safe ,opinion,Leverage  in particular financial leverage  is a common yet a difficult to grasp concept  It refers to the amount of debt a nation utilizes to boost its economy  At the micro level  it indicates the corporate debt of individual companies Although debt financing is quite common  no one wishes to be a part of a debt ridden economy  Yet  in matured economies  the debt market is larger than the equity market in terms of market capitalization Speaking of debt ridden nations  it is imperative to mention the U S  Yes  America   the richest economy in the world is the biggest borrower too  In fact  if we consider the latest report released by the U S  Congressional Budget Office  the country s debt this year is estimated to jump to the highest level since 1950  relative to the size of the economy However  this should not disappoint investors putting their money into U S  stocks  as debt has been part of the U S  economy since its foundation and yet the country stands atop others  Investors however need to choose wisely and select companies bearing less amount of debt This is where financial leverage ratio plays an important role as it indicates the extent to which a company is using debt to finance itself  Debt to equity is one such ratio used to identify the amount of debt a company bears Define the Ratio Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityDebt to equity is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A higher debt to equity ratio indicates that the company uses more debt financing compared to equity financing  thereby investing in its stock could prove to be risky Although companies reflecting high earnings growth should be ideal investment choices  those with high leverage might not generate satisfactory returns  This is because at the time of economic downturns  debt ridden companies are more prone to become victims of a debt trap    Picking the Right StrategyConsidering the above discussion  it is obvious that a sensible investor will go for stocks bearing low debt to equity ratios  However  choosing stocks based solely on one financial metric might not fetch the desired outcome To ensure the maximum possible return from this strategy  we have expanded our screening procedure to include some other criteria

4384,225899,AMWD,Invest Like Driehaus In These 5 Momentum Stocks,opinion,"Banking on the  buy high and sell higher  principle  Richard Driehaus   a strong advocator of momentum investing   came out with a successful investment strategy that made him popular in the 1980s and 1990s  Barron honored Driehaus by including his name in its All Century Team  Risk loving investors favor the momentum strategy as it s known to be a high yielding one like Driehaus  strategy 
The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns 
A Detailed Look into Driehaus  Strategy
Regarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy 
It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 
Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term 
Screening Parameters 
In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
  Zacks Rank equal to or less than  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2   Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business  
  Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median  Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5  Positive EPS surprise indicates potential  
  Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks  High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend  
  Momentum Score equal to A or B Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success

4398,225913,AMWD,5 Stocks To Buy On Record Consumer Confidence,opinion,Consumer confidence surged during the month of August  indicating that the economy was rebounding after performing poorly during the first half of the year  Cheap fuel prices and a strong jobs market seem to have contributed toward improving the health of the economy substantially This release adds to several such reports which are indicating that an economic turnaround in the second half of the year is well underway  For instance  recent data on consumer expenditure had also been encouraging  Adding consumer related stocks to your portfolio would make for a smart choice at this time Consumer Confidence SurgesIn August  consumer confidence surged to its highest level in 11 months  The index increased by 4 4 points to 101 1  well above the expected level of 97 4  to its highest level since Sep 2015  The present situation index increased from 118 8 to 123  the highest level witnessed since end 2007 Additionally  the expectations index increased to 86 4  but remained below the highest level achieved since the end of 2008 s recession  But more significantly  the labor market differential  the gap between those who believed that jobs were in abundance and those who thinks jobs are difficult to get  was the highest since Jan 2008 Buildup of Bullish DataThe labor market differential has a high correlation to official unemployment rate data released by the Department of Labor  The fact that is has become increasingly favorable indicates that unemployment is set to decline further  On Tuesday  Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fisher also provided similar indications about the state of the economy  Fisher said the labor market was extremely close to full employment levels   Fisher s optimism about the economy has also been reflected in economic reports released recently  Housing data released this month has been encouraging as have reports on durable goods and industrial production  The only weak spot witnessed this month has been Department of Commerce s second estimate for second quarter GDP However  even the GDP report had a consumer expenditure related silver lining  Household consumption increased on an annualized basis of 4 4   higher than the rate of 4 2  that was earlier estimated  This is the fastest pace of expansion the metric has experienced since the last quarter of 2014  Consumer expenditure contributed 2 94 percentage points to GDP growth  the highest in more than a year Our ChoicesSurging consumer confidence is another indicator that the economy is poised to grow stronger in the second half of the year  Low fuel prices and a stronger labor market are also increasing the purchasing power of the economy and in turn fueling economic gains This is why it may be a good idea to pick consumer related stocks at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum

4399,225914,AMWD,5 Low Leverage Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,In the complex world of corporate finance  a company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations  meeting obligations and expanding business  Depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is next to impossible  The two financial resources often resorted to are debt and equity A comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity  as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity  especially in periods of low interest rates  This happens because when a company finances its operations with debt  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a fixed time period  Whereas  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well However debt financing has its own drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  In particular  companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario In fact  the greater the proportion of debt in a firm s capital structure  the greater is its financial risk  That said  for the investor  the real challenge is determining whether the organization s debt level is sustainable as a debt free corporation is rare to find  Historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios What s Debt to Equity Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that reflects how much debt a company currently bears  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a comparatively less risky business and thereby instills investors  confidence in a company s financial stability In general  investors target companies exhibiting solid earnings growth projections  But in the uncertain world of investment  markets can trip anytime  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level is not a wise move Choosing the Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion  it is imperative for an investor to choose stocks that have a low debt to equity ratio  To ensure the maximum possible return from this strategy  we have expanded our screening procedure

4404,225919,AMWD,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks For Safe Returns,opinion, Growth based on debt is unsustainable  artificial    Jose Manuel BarrosoWith capital being one of the basic factors of production  companies   especially those facing a dearth of resources   need exogenous funds to finance their corporate expenses  run operations smoothly as well as expand the realm of their business  Among equity and debt   the two most common options used to boost a company s future earnings   debt is the more popular one  This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing However  one should not forget that too much debt can also be detrimental as companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more  it also bears the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future  Of course  this does not mean that debt financing  which is an inherent instrument for corporations to grow their earnings  should be a taboo in corporate financing Nevertheless  to be on the safe side  investors try to avoid stocks that bear large debt loads  And here comes the importance of leverage  which indicates the level of debt a corporation carries at present  Empirically several leverage ratios have been constructed to measure the exact amount of debt risk a company bears in order to safeguard investors from debt traps Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  which has been used to evaluate a company s credit worthiness  for potential equity investments  What s Debt to Equity Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityDebt to equity is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a more financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity With the third quarter earnings season set to pick up pace by the end of this week  investors must be gearing up to put their money in stocks exhibiting a surge in earnings  But if the stocks bear a high

4500,226015,AMWD,5 Top Ranked Stocks Powered By DuPont Analysis,opinion,"Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete storyand an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis gets the upper hand while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 10 stocks that made it through the screen 
Nutrisystem Inc    NASDAQ NTRI    This Zacks Rank  1 company is a provider of weight management products and services  Though its Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 29   its Sector Rank is in the top 50   You can see

4503,226018,AMWD,Buck The Retail Slump With These 5 Solid Picks,opinion,"Last month  U S  retail sales suffered their largest decline since Jan 2016  A report from the U S  Census Bureau shows that the drop was primarily attributable to a concurrent fall in gasoline prices  Additionally  a relatively smaller number of cars and trucks were purchased last month 
However  retail sales registered a moderate level of year over year growth  This suggests that the sector s fortunes are in keeping with that of the wider economy  Though May s decline was reflected across most categories  some still fared relatively  better remaining unchanged or even posting small increases  Investing in stocks from these areas can make for a prudent option at this time   
Largest Decline in 16 Months
In May  retail sales declined by 0 3   belying expectations of a small  but significant 0 1  increase  The figure also compares poorly with the unrevised 0 4  increase reported in April  An unusually late Easter holiday and the payout of tax refunds had ensured that sales in April experienced an improvement 
In contrast  sales weakened in May  primarily due to the 2 4  decline in sales at gasoline stations  This is  of course  a major positive for consumers since it increases their purchasing power substantially going forward  Meanwhile  sales at auto and other motor vehicles dealers also declined  by 0 2   last month  This fall also had a major impact on the composite reading since they account for nearly 20  of all retail sales 
Declines were also witnessed across most other categories  but this may have had only a limited impact  Sales at electronics and appliance stores declined by 2 8   marking the sharpest fall since Mar 2010  Additionally  food services and drinking places sales experienced a 0 1  decline while sporting goods  hobby  book and music stores witnessed their receipts falling by 0 6   The steady rise of online retail led to sales at department stores falling by 1  
Moderate Growth Trend Intact
Looking past the gloom  a year over year increase of 3 8  proves that a moderate growth trend for the retail sector remains firmly in place  Moreover  sales for the first five months of 2017 have registered an increase of 3 9  compared to the same period last year  A strong jobs market  soft interest rate regime and increasing home sales will continue to push consumer expenditure higher  The CPI declined by 0 1  in May to underline the fact that levels of inflation continue to remain low 
More importantly  not every category experienced a downturn last month  Sales for building material  garden equipment and supplies remained flat while registering a year over year increase of 10 8   This development was sufficient to boost Home Depot  NYSE HD  by 1 8  on Wednesday  which in turn helped the Dow end with gains 
Among the notable gainers for May were clothing and clothing accessories stores which experienced monthly and yearly increases of 0 3  and 1   respectively  Furniture and home furnishing stores experienced a 0 4  increase in May and posted a 4 4  year over year increase  But the largest gainer for the month was non store retailers  This category added 0 8  to sales and clocked up a 10 2  yearly increase  clearly benefiting from the furious pace of growth in the online sales space     
Our Choices
Despite the slowdown experienced in May  retail sales continue to be supported by the factors which have fueled gains for most of the year  The job market remains in good health and inflation remains low  Though the slump in receipts at gasoline stations impacted the overall figure last month  lower fuel prices have also boosted consumers  purchasing power 
Picking stocks from retail categories which registered gains even during a difficult month makes for a smart choice at this point  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics 
PetMed Express  Inc    NASDAQ PETS   is a leading nationwide pet pharmacy  PetMed Express  product line contains approximately 750 SKUs catering to dogs  cats and horses

4559,226074,AMWD,5 Efficient Stocks To Buy For A Winning Portfolio,opinion,Efficiency  a company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company s price performance  But  it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio How to Measure Efficiency  We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio implies that the company is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 18 Here are five stocks from the 18 that made it through the screen Sanderson Farms  Inc    NASDAQ SAFM   is engaged in the production  processing  marketing and distribution of fresh and

4570,226085,AMWD,Should Value Investors Consider American Woodmark  AMWD  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put American Woodmark Corporation   NASDAQ AMWD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  American Woodmark has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 59  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 90  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts American Woodmark s current PE ratio considerably below its midpoint  which is 24 61  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 41  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that American Woodmark has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 30  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for American Woodmark s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  American Woodmark has a P S ratio of about 1 26  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  American Woodmark currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AMWD a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though American Woodmark might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives AMWD a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 3 1  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has increased about 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below American Woodmark Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerican Woodmark is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 21  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-08-30,Zacks Investment

4803,226318,AMWD,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include Sanderson Farms  Nutrisystem  NVR  Five Below And American Woodmark,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 21  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Sanderson Farms Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ SAFM       Nutrisystem Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ NTRI       NVR Inc  NYSE    NYSE NVR       Five Below Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ FIVE      and American Woodmark Corporation  Nasdaq    NASDAQ AMWD      Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Dive into DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Analysis with These 5 StocksIn a market where complacency levels may falter any time thanks to central banks  moves  geo political concerns and overvaluation issues  picking the right stock is a challenge  The metric return on equity goes a long way in resolving this issue The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity But to fine tune this basic concept  one can land on DuPont analysis  This theory will take investors a step higher and better pick some quality stocks  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1

4805,226320,AMWD,5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks That Are Broker Favorites,opinion,"The Consumer Discretionary sector is grabbing much of the attention right now  owing to an improving economy  backed by a favorable jobs scenario  increased consumer spending and enhanced consumer confidence 
While a tight labor market is improving wage growth  unemployment rate remains low  Meanwhile  expectedly slow and gradual interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve ensures enough time for consumers to absorb them 
Furthermore  the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow model forecasts gross domestic product  GDP  to grow a healthy 2 7   annualized rate  in third quarter 2017  higher than its previous expectation of 2 3  growth 
Markedly  all these factors influence consumers  willingness to spend and spell good times ahead for this sector  which manufactures products that consumers buy because they want to and not because they need to 
Currently  the sector ranks at  7  out of 16   thus placing it among the top 44  of the Zacks classified sectors 
A Need to Seek Advice from Brokers
Despite the healthy picture  there are a few factors that can still negatively impact the sector participants 
On such factor is fierce retail competition that is aggravated by the shift toward online shopping  thus affecting manufacturers  margins  Meanwhile  appreciation of the U S  dollar relative to foreign currencies seems to weigh on the revenues of companies with significant international operations  Also  macroeconomic concerns in certain regions of the globe  acts of terrorism as well as the recent hurricanes and other natural calamities are hurting the earnings of companies in the sector 
Amid these ups and downs  it might be prudent to follow the expert advice as brokerage firms have a clearer insight into which stocks will work for your portfolio  Notably  as brokers do intense research on stocks in their coverage before coming up with recommendations  it is of no doubt that investors should pay heed to their advice before investing in any such company  Thus  if the selected stocks have been endorsed by the brokers  they will probably be a safer bet 
Screening Criteria
With the help of the Zacks   we have zeroed in on five stocks from the Zacks  with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and a favorable   The crowning achievement is  however  the bullish sentiment of over 75  of brokerage firms on these stocks 
Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth and momentum characteristics  In fact  our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 make solid investment choices  You can see  
Further  these companies have also witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions recently  Since brokers follow the stocks in their coverage closely  they revise their earnings estimates on a stock after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Their action is certainly not arbitrary or illogical  Thus  estimate revisions serve as an important guide regarding the potential of a stock 
The Five Chosen Stocks
Sony Corp  T 6758     NYSE SNE   is a developer and seller of electronic equipment  instruments and devices for consumer  professional  and industrial markets worldwide  Furthermore  this Zacks Rank  2stock flaunts a VGM Score of A  Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year s earnings has revised 0 4  upward over the last two months and reflects EPS growth of 362 8  year over year 
American Woodmark Corp    NASDAQ AMWD   manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets  In addition  this Zacks Rank  2 company has a VGM Score of B  American Woodmark s current year earnings estimate has moved up 1 2  over the past two months  It is expected to post EPS growth of 11 5  year over year 
Gray Television  Inc    NYSE GNT   is a communications company that operates television stations and currently has a Zacks Rank  2 The stock also flaunts a VGM Score of A  Gray Television has witnessed its current year earnings estimate jump 75 3  in the past two months  reflecting EPS growth of 45 5  year over year 
Hilton Grand Vacations Inc    NYSE HGV    a division of Hilton Worldwide Holdings  markets and operates vacation ownership resorts  Further  this Zacks Rank  2 company has a VGM Score of A  Additionally  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s current year earnings has revised 1  upward over the last two months and reflects EPS growth of 14 9  year over year

Inc    NASDAQ PATK   and Thor Industries Inc    NYSE THO   Pick 5 Winning Stocks Using the Dependable DuPont  NYSE DWDP  StrategyReturn on equity is one of the most trusted metrics used by investors  This profitability ratio enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis For

Value stocks  as a group  still underperformed the S P 500 including both large cap and small cap value 
But looking on the bright side  the large cap value ETFs like the Vanguard Value ETF   HN VTV   and the Invesco S P 500 Pure Value ETF  rebounded in 2019 
The Vanguard Value ETF is up 20 2  year to date and the Invesco Pure Value ETF has gained 17 7  
But what if you invested in individual value stocks instead 
Could you get a better return
