3736,225251,CCNE,7 Stocks With Recent Price Strength To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,Every investor wishes to have a magical portfolio of stocks with a one way ticket to success  But this is easier said than done  And when the market is as volatile as it is now  things may take a turn for the worse any moment No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that are witnessing price increase  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Here are seven of the 15 stocks that made it through this screen Columbus McKinnon Corporation   NASDAQ CMCO   is a broad line

6173,227688,CCNE,Is CNB Financial  CCNE  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CNB Financial Corporation   NASDAQ CCNE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CNB Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 46  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 65  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts CNB Financial s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 12 57  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 84  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that CNB Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 08  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for CNB Financial s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  CNB Financial has a P S ratio of about 2 73  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CNB Financial currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CCNE a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though CNB Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives CCNE a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current year consensus estimate has risen 4 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CNB Financial Corporation Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCNB Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors as it has a sluggish industry rank  bottom 23  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming

6178,227693,CCNE,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   November 25  2019,opinion,"You have a substantial retirement portfolio  You re an accomplished investor  You ve done truly well selecting stocks  You probably already own a couple of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
First Financial Corp    NASDAQ THFF    CNB Financial   NASDAQ CCNE   and Broadcom Inc    NASDAQ AVGO   
If you did something similar  would it be advisable for you to trade your own retirement nest egg 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals
