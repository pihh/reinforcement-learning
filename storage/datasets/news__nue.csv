1331,222846,NUE,US Steel Stocks  Q4 Earnings  Will Lower Prices Be A Drag  ,opinion,U S  steel makers reaped the benefits of higher domestic steel prices in 2018  which helped them to deliver strong earnings that year  However  a slump in steel prices and lower demand for the commodity amid the global slowdown hurt bottom lines of U S  steel companies through the first three quarters of 2019  Moreover  last month s profit warnings from some of the major U S  steel makers have raised concerns about a possible weak fourth quarter for the American steel industry Are U S  steel stocks bracing for a tough fourth quarter earnings season  Let s take a look Downbeat Guidance from Major U S  PlayersSome of the prominent U S  steel producers came up with weaker than expected earnings guidance for the December quarter last month  Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    the biggest U S  steel producer  was the first to issue disappointing guidance for the fourth quarter The steel giant sees earnings per share  EPS  in the range of 25 30 cents for the fourth quarter  This reflects a sequential decline from EPS of 90 cents in the third quarter and a fall from  2 07 recorded in the year ago quarter  The company expects performance of its steel mills unit to sequentially decline in the fourth quarter due to lower steel prices  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter for Nucor currently stands at 34 cents  reflecting a year over year decline of 83 6  Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   also provided weak view for the fourth quarter as it expects lower profits in its steel operations in the quarter  The steel producer expects EPS in the range 49 53 cents for the quarter  The projected figure suggests a fall from 69 cents recorded in the third quarter and  1 17 in the year ago quarter   Consensus earnings estimates for the fourth quarter currently stands at 56 cents  indicating a year over year decline of 57 3  Considering the two planned outages  margin compression due to lower steel prices and seasonally lower shipments  Steel Dynamics expects profitability from steel operations to be sequentially lower in the fourth quarter Moreover  United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   issued underwhelming guidance for the fourth quarter  The company projects adjusted EBITDA for the quarter to be a loss of roughly  25 million  excluding an expected restructuring and other charges of  225 million  The company stated that steel markets in North America are recovering  However  the Tubular and Europe businesses remain under pressure U S  Steel expects adjusted loss per share for the fourth quarter to be around  1 15  This compares to earnings of  1 82 a share the company recorded a year ago  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at a loss  1 14 The company stated that flat rolled steel market conditions are improving  However  results of the unit are expected to be affected in the fourth quarter  partly due to lower shipments and steel selling prices    U S  Steel also cut its quarterly dividend to a penny per share from 5 cents  Per the company  the move is expected to generate around  25 million of annual cash savings starting in 2020  Moreover  the company has stopped stock repurchase program and has decided to formally terminate the program Weaker Steel Prices to Dent Earnings The Trump administration s imposition of 25  steel tariffs largely helped U S  steel companies to rack up solid earnings in 2018  The tariffs provided a boost to U S  steel prices in 2018  driving profits and cash flows of American steel makers However  the U S  steel producers were plagued by a sharp decline in domestic steel prices in 2019  After an initial tariff induced rally  U S  steel prices had been on a downswing in 2019 and were down for much of the year  Notably  the benchmark hot rolled coil steel  HRC  prices dropped through the first three quarters of 2019 In fact  after rallying to multi year highs in 2018 on the back of Trump imposed tariffs  U S  steel prices fell back to the pre tariff levels in 2019  HRC prices reached peak level of roughly  920 per short ton  st  in July 2018  Sliding steel prices  weaker demand across major domestic end markets and trade tensions weighed on U S  steel producers  stocks last year With the exception of AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS    all other major American steel makers underperformed the broader market last year  with U S  Steel being the worst performer  despite decent gains in share prices in December on U S  China trade deal prospects  AK Steel s shares surged in December after leading iron ore miner  Cleveland Cliffs Inc    NYSE CLF   announced the acquisition of the former in an all stock deal worth  1 1 billion Higher domestic supply resulting from a ramp up in production contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices in 2019  Driven by the tariff impetus  U S  steel mills rushed to bring back capacity and drive production  leading to oversupply in the market The global economic downturn and softer steel demand are other key factors for the decline in prices  A slowdown in global manufacturing activity  partly due to the trade war  hurt demand for steel last year  Softness across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy led to demand weakness U S  steel producers contended with sluggish steel demand in 2019  Demand in the United States has been hit by a downslide of the country s manufacturing sector which contracted for the fifth month in a row in December amid trade tensions  As such  soft demand may hurt fourth quarter profitability of domestic steel makers   Meanwhile  driven by consecutive price hike actions by major U S  steel mills and supply side actions  U S  steel prices gained some traction over the past couple of months  HRC prices gained some upward momentum in December hitting  600 per st during the month  However  the impact of the price recovery will mostly get reflected in U S  steel companies  first quarter 2020 results It is worth noting that domestic steel prices fell sharply during the third quarter of 2019 and also slumped to a three year low in October  The effects of these price declines are expected to get reflected on U S  steel companies  shipments for the fourth quarter which is also typically a seasonally weak quarter  Lower U S  steel prices also likely to have put downward pressure on selling prices of American steel makers and crumbled their profit margins in the quarter to be reported Steel Dynamics currently

session and instructions will come at that time Certain statements made during this conference call will be forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  The words we expect  believe  anticipate  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward looking statements  which are based on management s current expectations and information that is currently available  Although Nucor believes they are based on reasonable assumptions  there can be no assurance that future events will not affect their accuracy More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward looking statements may be found in Nucor s latest 10 K and subsequently filed 10 Qs  which are available on the SEC s and Nucor s website  The forward looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of this date and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them  either as a result of new information  future events or otherwise Now  for opening remarks and introductions  I would like to turn the call over to Mr  Leon Topalian  President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation  Please go ahead  sir Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon  and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call  In my first call  as CEO of Nucor  I m honored to have the opportunity to lead this company and to serve alongside the 27 000 men and women of Nucor  who inspire me every day  Joining me on the call today are the members of Nucor s executive team  including Jim Frias  our Chief Financial Officer  Craig Feldman  responsible for raw materials and logistics  Ladd Hall  responsible for flat rolled products  Ray Napolitan  responsible for engineered bar products  as well as Nucor s digital initiatives  MaryEmily Slate  responsible for plate  structural and tubular products  Dave Sumoski  responsible for merchant bar and rebar products  and Chad Utermark  responsible for fabricated construction products I also want to thank John Ferriola for his leadership during the past seven years as CEO and the impact he has made over his 28 years with our company  We thank him for his many contributions to Nucor and wish him all the best in his retirement At Nucor  our greatest competitive advantage is our culture and the greatest measure of that culture is how we care for one another through the value of safety  2019 was the safest year in our history and I would like to thank all of my teammates for achieving this tremendous result  Nucor is a continuous improvement company  Our challenge and opportunity is to achieve breakthrough improvements in this core value  Over the last several months  I have engaged our team to ask how we can continue to improve our performance in safety  and we plan to work together with our teammates to implement their ideas and strategies  I look forward to making 2020 an even safer year for Nucor together In 2019  Nucor recorded earnings of  4 14 per diluted share  This was a good result  given the challenging steel market conditions that prevailed throughout much of the year  Strong performance in many of our steel products businesses helped to partially offset the destocking  that negatively impacted our steelmaking operations  In particular  I d like to recognize both Vulcraft and Verco and our Buildings group  which each achieved their most profitable year ever  as well as our rebar fabrication operations  which posted much improved results over 2018  reflecting both strong execution and favorable non res construction market conditions  Thank you for this result We believe that inventory destocking concluded in the fourth quarter when customers resume more normal buying patterns  General business conditions also improved as the fourth quarter progressed due to a number of factors  including a rate cut by the Federal Reserve  the new labor agreement between the United Automobile Workers and GM  as well as progress on U S  China trade relations and the passage of the U S   Mexico  Canada trade agreement by Congress  With regard to the USMCA  we applaud the House and Senate for passing the agreement with overwhelming bipartisan support  The new trade deal with Canada and Mexico is a significant win for the U S  steel industry  especially given the revamp of rules of origin that will greatly incentivize the use of North American steel and autos  auto parts and other products containing steel  All in all  we sense noticeably more optimism about the outlook for the U S  economy as we head into 2020 I d like now to share with you my most immediate priorities for our company  as I begin my tenure as Nucor s CEO  There are four key areas that we  as a leadership team  will focus on and execute on  First  we as a team  care for one another through the value of safety  to further strengthen our culture  which is a key driver of our success Secondly  the execution of the  3 5 billion of growth projects we are bringing online  execution begins with bringing these projects online safely and we ve been doing that  Once they begin operating  we need to ensure that we stay focused on generating appropriate returns from these investments  All of these investments are focused on Nucor s goal of being the supplier of choice  both today and tomorrow  We are staying ahead of the curve in adding the high value products that our customers are asking for Third  effective management of our portfolio of businesses to maximize our earnings potential  Ensuring our future success requires both making sound growth investments and addressing areas of underperformance  We will harness Nucor s culture of continuous improvement to achieve the full return potential across our entire asset base Finally  I ve taken over the leadership of a company  whose ability to attract  retain and develop great people has always been key to our success  So  we will remain relentlessly focused on talent  Our team members create the true value in our company  We have more than a 90  retention rate and I believe we have the most engaged  passionate and driven team members in the world  We will continue to attract great team members by making sure the talent and passion of our team is more broadly recognized outside the company and we are committed to further enhancements of our programs to develop and retain our valuable team members  There will be more to come in all four of these areas as the year progresses  but I wanted to share these initial priorities with you today Let me conclude my prepared remarks this afternoon with an update on some of our more significant capital projects  We achieved important milestones on several of them during the quarter  At our DRI plant in Louisiana  the critical work of replacing the convection section of our process gas heater as well as realigning the reactor refractory was completed in November  The work was done safely  on time and within budget  We expect these projects will further improve the plant s reliability  My thanks and congratulations to the team in Louisiana for their successful execution on this key phase of Project 8000 and for their performance in 2019  which was our second best year ever for uptime and output  despite the 70 day planned outage Two of our growth projects  our specialty cold mill complex at Nucor Steel Arkansas and the new galvanizing line at Nucor Steel Gallatin continued to ramp up production during the fourth quarter  Feedback from our customers on the product set of Gallatin and Hickman has been excellent  And now that we re operating  we ve seen even more opportunities to align with our customers Utilization at Gallatin s galvanizing line is already over 50  and Hickman s new cold mill is operating 24 7  We had contract customers for 31  of the new cold mill s capacity at year s end  Qualifications are ongoing and we expect to be IATF certified by mid 2020 at Hickman s new state of the art reversing cold mill  Several other growth projects are coming online early in 2020 as well  including our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia  Missouri  the new merchant bar quality mill at Nucor Steel Kankakee and our JV galvanizing line located in Central Mexico that we are operating with JFE Steel of Japan We have arced both the EAF and LMF furnaces at Sedalia in recent days and our new teammates there are hitting the ground running  Already serving customers with product made from billets  we expect to ramp up to continue to go well  Kankakee experienced some delays in equipment deliveries in the permitting process  but we expect to come in at our initial capital budget of approximately  190 million  We expect to start shipping product during the second quarter At our joint venture with JFE in Mexico  we look forward to beginning trial shortly and serving our automotive customers in Central Mexico  The facility s opening has been delayed due to some challenges that we did not anticipate  For example  more difficult soil conditions required incremental piling  resulting in higher cost than budgeted  We also found that the local electrical system infrastructure was insufficient for our needs and decided to acquire additional land for our operational footprint These events increased the total capital budget from our initial estimate of  270 million to approximately  360 million with Nucor s share of these amounts being 50   While this is disappointing  JFE and Nucor will remain very excited about the JV s prospects and are very confident in the product and our partnership  This is especially so  following the recent passage of the USMCA with its North American content rules Finally  we are excited to report that we have teammates on the ground and have begun excavation work for our new plate mill in Brandenburg  Kentucky  The mill is the largest investment in our company s history  And when it begins to operate in 2022  Nucor Steel Brandenburg will be able to produce 97  of the plate products demanded in the United States market With that  let me turn it over now to Jim Frias  who will discuss our financial results in greater detail James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentThanks  Leon  Nucor reported fourth quarter of 2019 earnings of  0 35 per diluted share  Included in these results were non cash impairment charges of  66 9 million or  0 17 per diluted share  Of that amount   35 million or  0 09 per share related to our natural gas well assets   20 million or  0 05 per diluted share related to a long lived asset impairment in the steel mills segment and  11 9 million or  0 03 per share related to the writedown of certain intangible assets in the steel product segment  These results exceeded our fourth quarter of 2019 guidance range of  0 25 to  0 30 per share  The amounts of these non cash impairment charges were not included at the time we issued our guidance on December 12 Our fourth quarter included better than expected performance across most of the steel mills segment  Our fourth quarter results included approximately  35 million or  0 09 per diluted share  a pre operating and start up costs related to strategic investment projects  That compares to approximately  28 million in the third quarter of 2019 and approximately  17 million in the year ago quarter  Excluding profits attributable to non controlling interests  the effective tax rate was approximately 24 5  for the full year  Going forward  we expect Nucor s effective tax rate to continue to be in the range of 24  to 25   barring any unusual items In 2019 s challenging steel market conditions  Nucor generated record operating cash flow of approximately  2 8 billion  Capital expenditures for 2019 totaled approximately  1 5 billion  For 2020  we expect capital spending to exceed  2 billion  Major components of this year s capital budget include the Brandenburg greenfield plate mill  the Gallatin sheet mill s hot band production capacity expansion  the Hickman sheet mill s new galvanizing line and our Florida rebar micro mill In addition to investing for long term profitable growth  Nucor s disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation rewards our shareholders with attractive cash returns  Cash return to shareholders during 2019 totaled  791 million or 62  of net income for the year  We paid dividends of  492 million  We also repurchased approximately  299 million of our stock  about 5 3 million shares at an average cost of just over  56 per share  With the dividend increase announced in December  Nucor has increased its base dividend for 47 consecutive years  every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973  Over the 10 year period ending in 2019  Nucor has returned a total of more than  6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases Our focus continues to be unaffected stewardship of our shareholders  valuable capital via both disciplined investments that we expect will generate returns  well in excess of our cost of capital as well as attractive cash returns to our shareholders  Nucor s financial condition remains strong  We ended 2019 with  1 8 billion in cash and short term investments  With total debt outstanding of approximately  4 3 billion  our gross debt to capital ratio was 29  at the end of the fourth quarter  Our  1 5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not mature until April of 2023  Our next significant debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately  600 million Now turning to the outlook  Nucor s earnings in the first quarter of 2020 are expected to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019  We are encouraged by improving conditions in the U S  steel markets entering 2020  We believe this reflects the end of the severe inventory destocking that occurred last year and ongoing modest growth in end use markets overall  We expect first quarter earnings in the steel mills segment to increase from the fourth quarter due to price increases and expected higher volumes It is worth noting that December  a historically weak month  was the highest profit month in the fourth quarter for our steel mills segment  The profitability of the steel product segment is expected to decrease as compared to the fourth quarter  due to normal seasonality  The performance of the raw material segment is expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter  due to improved pricing for raw materials  It s worth noting the outlook from an end use markets perspective  We see stable or growing end use markets  accounting for approximately 70  of our shipments Leon mentioned the strength of non residential construction markets  We see this continuing into 2020  Non residential is an important demand driver for our industry  Boat s order rates and backlogs are up across our Buildings group and in our joist and deck business  We are also hearing similar things from our structural fabrication customers  Nucor is the leading supplier of structural beams in the U S   with the broadest product offering  It s a privilege to support our fabricated customers and important projects across the country Thank you for your interest in Nucor  I will now turn the call back over to Leon Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jim  At this time  we re now ready to take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  sir   Operator Instructions  And we ll take our first question from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies  Please go ahead Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  everyone Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon  Martin Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystSo  you provided some commentary on the demand front and maybe if you could frame up what your expectations are for U S  steel demand in 2020 versus last year  talking about some of the puts and takes among the end market  And then  also  based on the activity that you re seeing today in the order books  what is the sequential change might you be expecting within steel volumes in first quarter here Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Martin  let me begin first by stating how humbled and excited I am to be leading the Nucor team  I stand shoulder to shoulder with the greatest manufacturing team assembled anywhere in the world  And i m surrounded with the most experienced executive team in the industry  And so  as I mentioned in the opening comments  we do see 2020 being a    shaping up to be a better year than 2019  Non res construction is strong  We believe destocking has really been completed  we ve seen some of the restocking  but as we talk about order entry rates  there is a marked improvement in Q4  we see that continuing  Our backlogs are strong  as Jim mentioned in his comments  The fabrication community  their backlogs are very strong into 2020  So  we see the outlook is fairly optimistic as we move into 2020 Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And then  how    sorry  go ahead James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentYeah  the second question was about the volumes we re anticipating in Q1 and we don t give that specific guidance  but I ll say qualitatively  especially regarding our sheet business  we ve had 15 straight weeks  where order significantly exceeded    I d say significantly  but more than 10  exceeded our production capacity and so we ve built our backlog by about two weeks since the end of September  so about two weeks longer So  we re going to run the sheet business at least near full for the first quarter  The rest of our businesses have not really run full consistently for a number for a number of years  other than periodically once full  but we feel very confident sheet will run full  We re not going to give guidance about volume overall other than to maybe give that data point  I think  it s also worth noting that last week  the third week of January  was one of the strongest weeks of order input we ve seen in sheet since the improvements began in mid October Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystIt sounds like a stronger start  maybe  on a sequential basis than what we ve seen in the couple of past few years  though  based on your commentary James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentThe only    maybe than last year  The year before that  it s going to be hard to beat  It has a pretty strong first quarter pick up in 2018 Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  understood  And if I could one more  with growth capex increasing  could you touch on any need to draw on the revolver  perhaps  increase other debt to support the growth initiatives  And also  remind us of minimum cash balances and leverage targets for the Company James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentSure  So  we re starting the year with a very strong liquidity position   1 8 billion in cash and short term investments  And so  we re going to have peak capex over the next two years and then it should taper off based on the projects we ve announced and have in our pipeline actively today  And so  we could be slightly cash flow negative over the next two years  And then    but over the next five years  we would expect to be strong cash flow positive  So  right now  we would not expect to draw on the revolver  We would be more likely to issue CP if we got to that point  but with the  1 8 billion cushion  I don t see that likely this year Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  So rather other debt forms as opposed to the revolver if needed  but you don t anticipate that at this point James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentThat s correct Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystOkay   Speech Overlap  James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentAnd again  we need about  400 million to  500 million  Phonetic  liquid cash  You asked that question  I didn t answer that part  just to sort of support the liquidity in the business Martin Englert    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thanks for all the detail there and congratulations for a strong finish for the year James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentThank you Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Martin OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  Leon and Jim  and congrats on the new role  Leon  A question I wanted to dig into a little bit more was on capex  You touched on that last question  but just a few more specifics  if I may  So  you said  I think   2 billion around that level for 2020  You said  3 5 billion for your total projects  So  from the calculation we ve done  we still got about  2 3 billion of that  3 5 billion still to spend  Can you maybe just give us some color on how we ll    how 2021 will shape up as you go through the numbers and maybe after you ve done these expansions  what the sustaining level would look like  Thank you James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentYeah  Our maintenance capex  we think of as being in the range of  500 million per year  as that s embedded in that more than  2 billion that we expect to spend in 2020  It s too early to say for  21  but I think  21 would be similar in levels to  20  both years would be in the neighborhood of  2 billion or just north of there and then  it d be a fairly significant drop off relative to the things that we ve committed to get this point in time  We could  of course  identify other projects between now and then that would increase that  And the other thing is  each year  as part of year end process  we ve put up some slides that give color to our capex spending items and we will be putting those up today after the call on our website for investors to see Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  thanks for that  And that includes the    what s the additional spending for the paint line that you announced in December  I assume that s around the  100 million level or something in that ballpark Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Chris  as we    and we re very excited about the announcement of our paint line and we re broadening our downstream offering to our customers  We ve not released that number  As we re getting into the    kind of completing the engineering review  as we get that finalized  we ll announce that to you and ensure that we do in the coming weeks Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  thanks for that  So  just to reiterate from the first question  so  you said through the next couple of years  you re comfortable funding the dividend and maintaining the business out till the capex drops off  you re comfortable managing sort of the capital management part of the business  even though the capex will be elevated for those two years Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat s correct  Chris James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentYeah  agreed Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  And the last one from me  just in terms of the new Missouri mill  just wondered if you could give a few more specifics on the ramp up of that  And then  just what you re seeing in the rebar market specifically  Thanks Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe re very excited about the strategy behind the micro mills  and I ll ask Dave Sumoski here in a minute to maybe provide a little update on Sedalia specifically  but that investment strategy and our capital allocation philosophy to become and maintain the world class position in rebar by serving those markets where our customers are at  a high propensity of the scrap  is critically important to us in maintaining that  Dave  anything you d like to update there David A  Sumoski    Executive Vice President Merchant and Rebar ProductsYeah  The only thing I d add on that    I mean  you hit it  but if you look at just the nameplates  it would indicate that we re adding about 700 000 tons of additional rebar  but there s more to our strategy than that  We have a very deliberate process to realign our product mix in the bar group and in another groups  but specifically  you re talking about the bar group  And this includes producing higher value products at some of our    some of our other divisions and that process has begun  It s been thought for some period of time  And I ll just share a couple of examples    Texas facility is now on pace to make about 150 000 tons of SBQ and our Darlington mill now makes about 300 000 tons of rod and when they add their degasser down there  it will move up the value chain even more on the rod market and they ll start producing more SBQ So we are shifting rebar from some of our divisions to these new locations  where it makes more sense  At the end of the day  we re going to move up the value chain  but we ll not abdicate  we will not abdicate markets and customers have been very good to us over the years  Specifically on the start up  I am being told that we re going to melt the heat  We re going to go from melt shop all the way through the process on Thursday  We ve already commissioned some of the proper    some of the processes and we run some billets through the line and we shipped 700 tons out of there from other divisions  just so we can get our ERP system up and working  That s where we re at it Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  David  Does that address your question  Chris Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  that s great  Thanks guys  That s it from me Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America  Please go ahead Timna Tanners    Bank of America    AnalystHey  good afternoon  Happy new year  and Leon  I am looking forward to working with you Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon  How are you  Timna Timna Tanners    Bank of America    AnalystAll right  thanks  So  I just wanted to step back and ask a couple of high level questions  if I could  If we look at the steel products segment  profitability in 2019 is a step up from 2018  I am just trying to figure out how much if any of that was related to declining steel prices and how much might have been related to some of the growth projects  So if we look at 2020 for example  with 2018 under earning and 2019 over earning or should we consider it to being building from recent years Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  let me start up and I ll frame it at the high level and maybe ask Chad Utermark or Jim to chime in  One of the areas  Tim  is that I mentioned in my opening comments was to really begin to look at how we scrutinize some of the businesses that we re not meeting our expectations  So one of the examples  I ll share with you is in our products group  and Chad and his teams have done an amazing job of rationalizing a market that for many years was about 2 million tons that shifted down over the last six or seven years to about 1 2 million tons  So we moved operations  combined different manufacturing plants and brands within the same plants and really brought the market needs to fit our supply framework  And by doing so  it s really created a very positive cash position  So I would say that impact is in the result of the team achieving a record year is largely based on those decisions that we made as opposed to just the declining steel prices  which did have some factor  But Chad  anything you d like to add on that D  Chad Utermark    Executive Vice President Fabricated Construction ProductsYeah  thanks Leon  Yeah  thanks Timna for recognizing that  Obviously  lower raw material costs  as well as the solid non res construction market that we had  had an impact in a positive way to some of the record we set  But that record performance of the fabricated steel products segment is also benefiting from what Leon just talked about  this restructure in particular of our metal buildings business as well as rebar fabrication business  We re seeing the results  the restructure is resulting in a lower cost structure  some of the capital investments in new equipment changes to our process flow and the volume impact associated especially with metal building group  producing multiple brands at the same plant is really paying off  So we re excited  I think there is even further opportunity for us going forward for us to improve our performance downstream Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  the thing I d add  Timna  is this  We took some of the rewards from the changes we ve made to those businesses that Chad talked about metal buildings and rebar fabrication  but we expect to reap further rewards from those changes in 2020  And so we re optimistic that 2020 is likely to be a better year  The other thing I d say is our tube business  which we built through three acquisitions a couple of years ago  didn t have its best year  They were much better in  18 than they were in  19  We expect that business to do better in  20 as well  So  we think 2020 should be a pretty decent year for us in steel products Timna Tanners    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  super  And then I kind of want to ask the same questions about raw materials and long products  because 2018 is a really good year  2019 was a not so good year in all those categories and especially for raw materials  there s been so much fluctuation like how should we think about  normal  EBITDA per ton or margin per ton or however you want to think about it  And same question for volumes in the long products like they fell off in 2019 and so trying to think about how some of these expansions or enhancements can result in better 2020  Thanks for that Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Again  so I got the raw materials and the long products  and again  I ll maybe ask Craig to chime in here  But at the end of the day  the longs business for us is a very profitable sector of our business  Market leadership in beams allows us to operate in the roughly 65  to 70  range through most of  18  But again  as we talked about in sheet  and Jim mentioned  specifically both plate and beams  we ve also seen a market shift in order entries and backlogs  And so we re seeing that market improve from  19  Again  I think a factor of that is the destocking that took place throughout 2019 And as we move into 2020  I think you ll see a much more level in tempered business conditions as we move through whether it s scrap or order entry rates  We believe we will be more stabilized as we hit  20  I think  18  we saw our customers overbuying demand  In  19  we saw them under buying  I think you ll see that more balance But Craig  maybe you d add some color on the raw materials Craig A  Feldman    Executive Vice President Raw MaterialsSure  Thank you  Leon  Yes  Timna  no doubt about it  The margin compression we talked about on prior calls  particularly the DRI plants has been real  it s on both sides  It s on the supply side  and of course  our selling prices were challenged in 2019  Going forward  we really don t share EBITDA per ton numbers in that regard in the raw materials group for VRI  what I would just characterize that this a lot of the heavy lifts that we have done over the last year or so  and we have highlighted Project 8 000  a number of times on the call  and the improvements that we made really focused on reliability going forward So by the middle of the year  I would say that we ll toward a more normalized run rate  I suspect that we will see some relief on the iron ore pricing standpoint as well  And we feel very good about the work that we have done related to capex and improving the reliability going forward  The team in Louisiana has moved from between 250 tons an hour close than 280 tons an hour  so we feel very good about the operational improvements that we have made there  and generally speaking  you don t know where markets will grow  but fairly positive outlook  once we get past the first half of this year David A  Sumoski    Executive Vice President Merchant and Rebar ProductsYes  this is Dave  I just make one comment on the longs  If you re just looking at bars and the numbers there  two different businesses  so you got the SPG product and then you get a rebar in the MBQ product  And on the rebar and MBQ product   18 was a great year  but we are tracking ahead of 2017  So  if you look at that year on the pure bar side  So that industry or that business is supported by the construction industry and that is why we still feel there is a strong construction market out there moving forward Picking on engineered bar  excuse me  engineered bar kind of lives in our view in a different ecosystem  We don t really sell into the construction market  A couple of our major markets  oil and gas and ag equipment  we are actually down  we have to combine factors of destocking with both OEMs in service centers  So  despite that our engineered bar group  special bar quality picked up share in 2020    in 2019  excuse me  So  again  not construction related  but a different market situation  So  excuse me  Timna  continue your point  please Timna Tanners    Bank of America    AnalystOh  no  not at all  I just trying to make sure I understood  So it sounds like 2018 tough comp versus 2019 you expect  not the same destocking  better volumes and then sprinkle in some organic improvements  and that is how we should be thinking about 2020 Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  it is  I think underlying demands is there  I think it is stable and some of the sectors that Dave and both where I mentioned  construction in particular was strong and we re seeing some slight improvements year over year Timna Tanners    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Curt Woodworth    Credit Suisse    AnalystYes  good afternoon  I guess my first question  I guess  I mean Nucor has had a pretty consistent operating philosophy for a long time  that seems like the company has definitely sort of accelerated more of the build for spot mentality with a lot of capex  So  I m just curious with new leadership that are coming  this new perspective  new opportunities  What do you see kind of changing at Nucor  Where do you think the most opportunity for improvement lies  And how do you think your    maybe near term agenda will be different from prior attendance  It is my first question Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Curt  I would frame it up this way  It is not easier for me to talk about those things that are not going to change  Our focus on our core  our culture is going to remain very much intact  How we care for our 27 000 men and women of the Nucor family is critically important  They are the value generators for our future  The  3 5 billion of investment projects we have slated are equipment or things that can be bought  Our team is what revolutionizes and changes the market and the returns that they are able to achieve  And so I couldn t be prouder of our team and we are laser focused after the value of safety curve on executing on that  3 5 billion  It is the second focus for our entire organization and we bring those projects in safely on time and ahead of schedule  And so that is where our focus is at And then third  we move to really the portfolio management  How do we continue to think about growth in the short and medium term and long term  and then coupling that with how do we scrutinize those businesses that have not returned the levels of profits and shareholder returns  we have come to expect of ourselves and the investors have come to expect of us So  based on those focus  I would tell you that there is not a shift in what    how John led or Dan DiMicco led  What I would tell you is the destinations are very similar  The routes we may take to get there might be slightly different than the all of us use ways or Google Maps to get into the city  I may go to New York City five different ways  five days in a row  But how I communicate or the things that we do to achieve the result  the results are focused on the safety of our team and executing really well on the valuable shareholder capital that they entrust us with every day Curt Woodworth    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  that makes sense  And then I guess  with respect to capital bending and sort of dating myself a little bit here  but if I look at your plate capacity since 2005  it is been pretty consistent around 2 8 million tons and your 15 year utilization rate has been about 80   and you were at roughly 70  for last two quarters  So I m wondering  tactically  if we get into a demand situation where the plate stays    demand stays week  would you contemplate postponing plate mill capex Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerLet me begin with the short answer  no  is the short answer  The longer answer is  we have been in this business now for 20 years  Curt  We understand the markets that we serve  we understand the customer base that is asking for this  And this is something that we contemplated since going back in 2008  So  our focus is for the long term  We understand there is going to be ebbs and flows in the markets  It is a cyclical business  and it is a business we know well  and we have been in and a part for over 50 years So as we think about plate  the only side of the fact that we will have the most diverse product offering of any mill in one location located in the heart of the largest plates consumable region  the United States  And so by doing so  we really believe we have a differentiated value proposition to offer our customer base that puts us in a low cost position  a market leadership position  And I m incredibly encouraged by what Mary Emily and Johnny Vegas and the team at Brandenburg willing and be able to do in our future in plates Curt Woodworth    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thanks  And best of luck in the future Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Curt OperatorThank you  We will next go to Andrew Cosgrove with Bloomberg Intelligence  Please go ahead Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg Intelligence    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my question  To start off and see if you could shed some light on the non residential exposure by product on your sheet  bar  plate and structural  if that s helpful Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerGive me a little more color  I m trying to follow your question Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg Intelligence    AnalystI m just trying to square up just the exposure to whether sheet  bar  plate  and structural in the non res segment  I mean  the only reason why I asked is  because just trying to make sense of  I mean long products and I mean all lines are down pretty precipitously in 2019  non res construction was up low single digits  I understand there were some destocking  but I guess  I m just trying to see it non res is still going to be strong and we are not going to get destocking and we will probably get restocking this year  where that might be felt the most Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerLook  I would tell you certainly  I think in a rebar  rebar fabrication businesses that are heavily put into the construction market and certainly some of the structural capacity that we have is a big part of that  And then the downstream products and building and    are all factors in non res construction  So that is the biggest side of the markets  we serve roughly about 30  of our overall products move into that space But one of the things you mentioned  I would maybe characterize a little bit differently  We think some of the restocking is already occurred  And again  as we mentioned earlier in our comments  I do believe you will see a more balanced approach to 2020 in terms of both service internally and buying patterns  And so  we do believe demand is healthy and we are optimistic too as we head into  20 Dave  is there something you would like to add David A  Sumoski    Executive Vice President Merchant and Rebar ProductsYes  I would just add that although there is no federal infrastructure bill out there  the states are really stepping up to the plate and they are doing a lot of work  So that is really going to boost in the non residential construction markets  So  I just wanted to add that Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg Intelligence    AnalystOkay  Perfect  thank you  And then I guess one on plate  I mean plate import last year were down 20 ish percent and then obviously the plate shipments were also down 12   I guess  I was just trying to again that also just down to destocking or is there  I guess maybe if you could give some color on specific end markets where there was some weakness in plate specifically and maybe how you kind of see them shaping up right now Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  look I will start it and maybe you can chime in if there is anything else  But as we think about the plate and the import levels  I would tell you one of the most impactful things is what we been able to do over the last couple of years  We won 12 trade cases since 2016 in plate  that has dramatically shifted the import coming into this country Certainly  232 has helped  however  it is the long term of the trade cases that we ve won and something over 160 cases that we have won  some dating back in plates in 1999  So  our position through the long term ICC and the Department of Commerce and commandment for what they have done and are doing  But that site has got to remain very vigilant  And so  that is a big part of why you saw the drop off in plate imports MaryEmily  anything you d like to add on MaryEmily Slate    Executive Vice President Plate  Structural and Tubular ProductsJust a little bit color on that  You are right  We had the lowest level of imports in the last five years  last year which was great  And we do believe the overall market retracted  but mainly that was due to destocking activity  And we mentioned trade cases  there are still 17 active trade cases going on  So for 2020  we really look for the activity to be consistent  We feel like we are looking at a decent 2020 going forward  Thank you Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg Intelligence    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks so much and best of luck this year Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Andrew OperatorThank you  We will next go to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets  Please go ahead Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  good afternoon Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon  Phil Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystWelcome to the helm Leon  congratulations Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  Very excited and very humble Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystIn terms of the rebar color  it sound like  you are just getting the Missouri mill started in the last week or two  What is your thought around the ramp timeline there  And then  can you give us any color on the Florida mill as well  because I know that was something that was supposed to be around mid 2020 Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerCertainly  On a high level thought  what I would tell you Phil is  the Micro mill in Sedalia is coming online as we speak to team  it has done a great job and taken care of the team from safety perspective  operating costing and schedule  So  we are excited about that  And then  in the micro mill in Frostproof  Florida  is still slated to come online in summer of this year So  the other part of that  maybe I will ask Jim to frame some color  because we do think about how are these investments returning and what is that long term outlook  maybe Jim  you could add some color to those projects James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentFirst of all  specific to your question  I think it is likely that Sedalia reaches breakeven sometime in Q2  And overall  the galv line at Gallatin is already making the positive contribution  We have pre operating start up costs in the quarter  I think it was  36 million in the fourth quarter  that is going to come down slightly in Q1  because some of these projects are starting to ramp  The Hickman cold mill is starting to ramp  So  their pre operating start up costs come down as they go toward breakeven  Sedalia is going to start to have its pre operating start up costs and come down as they strive toward breakeven Now  later in the year  we will probably have other projects increase the pace of pre operating start up costs  But  the projects that are coming online right now and that includes the galv line at Gallatin  the Hickman cold mill  the Sedalia bar mill and the Kankakee merchant bar mill  Those four are going to make a nice contribution to Nucor by the end of this year and a really good contribution to Nucor next year  And we get in the broader numbers that the cumulative projects have  600 million of EBITDA value  I would just say  if you do the math on the capex of those projects  you ll see a nice jump and that EBITDA is going to benefit Nucor in  21  and we will start to see some of that fruit by the end of this year Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystAt a high level  Jim  the start up costs  saying they re coming down a little bit sequentially here in the first quarter  but you are expecting the pre operating start up costs in total to be lower in  20 than the  19 or is that not a fair statement James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentNo  I would say it is too early to say because we got two big projects getting ramped  and because they are bigger  they will have bigger pre operating start up costs  So  the expansion of capacity at Gallatin and the Brandenburg mill  when they come on  it s going to probably greatly increase our pre operating start up costs for a period of time  And we don t forecast that out more than one quarter at a time  so I can t tell you what those numbers are  Other than Q1  it probably going to be slightly down  But I would expect for the year  it might actually be slightly up because of those two bigger projects starting to ramp up the costs Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  And then  the comment I think you made Jim on being cash flow negative for the next couple of years given the capex  are you throwing in the dividend in that discussion  meaning you are including the dividend in terms of that you are being cash flow negative James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentYes  Dividend plus capex against operating  or cash from operations Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  So  you are not saying free cash flow negative  you are just saying after dividend or are we seeing free cash flow negative James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentI m saying after capex and dividends Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And then lastly  just in terms of first quarter  so we are thinking about this right  Seemingly some operating leverage at least in the sheet division from better volumes in Q1  but overall as we look at the steel business  should we think that realizing metal spreads will be a positive contributor versus the fourth quarter Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think so  Phil  And again  as we look at scrapping  and obviously an awful lot of discussions  Craig  may want to add some color here  but the market demand standpoint is still strong  And I think one of the drivers that is not discussed an awful lot as we look at scrap  it is really the export market and the demand outside of the U S  It has an impact on those So  Craig  anything do you want to add on the raw material stuff side Craig A  Feldman    Executive Vice President Raw MaterialsYes  just in general  I would say that there was a lot of commentary around the interest in the spare market as it looks    I think the key drivers is fuel demand and to Leon s comments and the rest of the teams  I think you would hear a fair amount of optimism here  And that is what we are seeing  we are seeing the domestic demand for scrap is relatively strong  So  absent the normal gyrations in the market  I would say  can we see a fairly relatively stable place environment  and again  driven by the steel demand  underlying steel demand Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystThanks so much  That s a lot Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief Executive OfficerPhil  just one point I want to clarify  I made the statement earlier that Frostproof was expected to come online this summer  We will start commissioning  but it will really come online in Q4 of this year Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystPerfect  Thanks very much OperatorThank you  We ll next move to Alex Hacking with Citi  Please go ahead Alex Hacking    Citigroup    AnalystGood afternoon  and let me add my congratulations Leon on the new role  I just have one question  Jim  I just have a follow up on the capex guidance really just to make sure I was straight  I think you said 2021  you would be  2 billion ish similar to 2020  If we take out  500 million a year for sustaining  that is about  3 billion on growth projects for the next two years  I guess that seems a little high compared to what we were thinking  We were thinking total budget of around  3 5 billion  with about  2 5 billion left to spend  I mean  I guess  can you help me pull that gap a little bit  I know you mentioned that   James D  Frias    Chief Financial Officer  Treasurer   Executive Vice PresidentThere are some projects that aren t big enough that we forced to call out that are embed in there as well  there are improvement projects that we don t think of as being capex  but they are not building new mill type projects  so we don t call them out  So  there is some other capex in there for things that are improvement projects as well Alex Hacking    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  it makes sense  Thank you OperatorThank you  And it does appear we have no further questions at this time  I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr  Leon Topalian for any additional or closing remarks Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief

value and by doing so help to improve the safety of our Nucor family and our industry  I m excited for Nucor s future and for all of us working together to expanding beyond take Nucor to new highs  Thank you to everyone on the call for your interest in Nucor  and have a great day Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  52 minutesCall participants Leon J  Topalian    President and Chief

171596,393112,NUE,U S  Steel wins tax breaks from one of America s poorest cities,news,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh GARY  Indiana  Reuters    United States Steel Corporation founded Gary  Indiana in 1906   naming it after co founder Elbert Henry Gary   and the city s fortunes have been closely tied to the company ever since  When the firm started losing business to cheap Asian imports in the 1970s  waves of layoffs followed as Gary became a haven of blight  crime and lost population  Last year  the city harbored hopes for a revival after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel imports and the company planned a  750 million investment to modernize Gary Works  its largest North American plant   But it s now clear those hopes will not translate into new steel jobs  even after the city and state offered the firm a  47 million tax break package  The whole point of the investment is to make the plant more efficient  so the incentives will help finance a project that city and company officials concede could ultimately result in job losses  not gains  Gary s dimmed hopes for a tariff driven renaissance underscore how the policy has so far provided a windfall for U S  steel firms but only a marginal benefit to workers and struggling steel towns   Gary Works once employed more than 25 000 people but now supports only about 4 000 in a city that has seen its population plummet from 175 000 in 1970 to 77 000 today  Steel industry employment nationwide increased by 1 000 jobs to 83 400 between March  when tariffs where imposed  and November  according to the latest available data from the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics   GRAPHIC     In a statement to Reuters  Trump s Commerce Department called the 1 2 percent increase a  welcome change from decades of decline and layoffs  and said  many more  jobs would be created as planned industry investments and expansions are completed  without specifying how many   Improving efficiency is important and was one of the goals of the tariffs   a department spokesman said of the Gary investment   We are glad to see the American industry is making investments that will protect their long term viability and ensure a strong domestic supply   The state of Indiana s investment of  10 million in tax credits  along with  2 million in worker training grants  comes with the condition that U S  Steel retain at least 3 875 jobs at Gary Works  But a state spokesperson declined comment on whether the company could still collect part of the incentives if the number of jobs falls below that threshold  The city would get no guarantees of job retention for its bigger and longer term commitment of property tax breaks  a benefit estimated at  35 million over 25 years  The details of both deals are still being finalized  officials said  U S  Steel Vice President Douglas Matthews acknowledged the modernization would cut costs and reliance on manual labor  Productivity improvements would likely results in a  decreasing headcount over time   he said   But without the investment   then the business is at risk  and then you put all the jobs at risk   Matthews said in an interview  U S  Steel declined to comment about why it needed tax breaks to make its investment viable and declined to provide details about its negotiations with the city  U S  Steel s 2018 profits shot up to  1 12 billion  from  387 million the previous year  The tariff driven windfall has allowed the company to spend  300 million buying back its own stock   GRAPHIC     Investors remain skeptical of the company s longer term gains from tariffs  however  Despite recent gains after strong earnings  U S  Steel s stock is down 51 percent since March 1  when Trump announced he would impose steel tariffs  That s in part because company s underlying weaknesses remain largely unaddressed  It has among the highest production costs in the world  according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Its revenue per employee pales in comparison with that of rival steelmaker  Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE   And domestic steel prices  after rising with tariffs  are now drifting down amid rising supplies and slowing demand  DESPERATE FOR INVESTMENT Gary officials say the factory investment would bring the city about  1 million in new tax revenue  even after Gary allows the company to pay only half the property taxes associated with the upgrade  That will help close a city budget deficit of  14 million  they say  while giving some assurance that company won t abandon Gary entirely  The harsh realities of life in Gary make it easier to understand why officials would cut whatever deal they can to keep U S  Steel  About a third of its citizens live in poverty  and the city has long had among the nation s highest murder rates  A fifth of its homes and half of commercial properties are vacant or abandoned   GRAPHIC     For Mayor Karen Freeman Wilson  the incentives for U S  Steel help ensure the city can retain its largest employer and taxpayer while providing an opportunity to re engage the company in Gary s civic life   When you see an investment of this magnitude  then you see that there is a plan for a continued presence here   she said  When the company shut down its coke plant at Gary Works four years ago  laying off hundreds of workers  the city feared the worst for the facility  Around the same time  Gary had watched the company idle most operations at its Granite City steel plant just outside of St  Louis  Trump s tariffs prompted U S  Steel to hire back about 800 of those Granite City workers last year after restarting two furnaces there  But there s no such hiring plans for Gary  City and union leaders here have accepted a lower headcount as a fait accompli  The company has already eliminated 140 maintenance jobs on the west side of the plant since 2015  said Mark Lash  president of United Steelworkers Local 1066  which represents about 1 400 workers at the plant  The city has had its own layoffs of maintenance workers   shedding 128 of 150 of them between 2006 and 2011  It has been managing with 22 staffers for the past eight years  New spending and hiring are frozen  and city buildings are being sold to raise funds  LIMITED IMPACT Public financing of corporate investments is hardly uncommon but is more typically tied to company commitments to create new jobs that boost the local economy  Gary s deal with U S  Steel is more like the 2016 deal Indiana cut with United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX  with the help of public pressure on the company from Trump  The firm agreed to retain at least 1 069 workers at its Carrier unit in Indianapolis instead of moving the jobs to Mexico  a deal that also included no new hires  But the proposed Gary deal is much more expensive  While the state gave  7 million in tax breaks to United Technologies compared to the  47 the city and state have offered U S  Steel  Carrier has since laid off about 550 workers in two rounds of cuts  but has said it would maintain 1 100 workers  Michael Hicks  a professor of Economics at Indiana s Ball State University  has examined the impact of such tax breaks on the state s public finances in the last decade  His study found that state incentives costing about  30 000 per job provided little benefit to Indiana s economy or tax base  Hicks said the tax deal with U S  Steel is not so expensive by comparison  costing an estimated  12 129 per job retained   But it s not a good deal  either  especially given the limited economic impact  Hicks said  
 It is a fifty percent tax cut for U S  Steel to stay in Gary   Hicks said   This deal is not going to make people move to the city  This is not going to cause a population growth and employment opportunities    Additional Reporting by Timothy Aeppel  Editing by Joseph White and Brian Thevenot ",2019-02-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-steel-wins-tax-breaks-from-one-of-americas-poorest-cities-1774094,1774094

171598,393114,NUE,Nippon Steel to bolster overseas business  focus on India,news,"By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s Nippon Steel Corp  is set to bolster overseas operations  especially in fast growing India  to bypass growing nationalism and capitalize on growth abroad as it faces shrinking demand at home 
 India is the fastest growing market in the world and our investment on Essar s operations will be our key project for this year   said Nippon Steel s new president  Eiji Hashimoto 
Creditors of Essar Steel India approved a joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for the debt laden asset in October  and the two have drawn up plans to double output of the unit in coming years 
 It s a big investment  but this deal was a bargain   Hashimoto told reporters in March  The deal also gives Nippon Steel access to a country that is difficult for foreign companies to enter amid a  Make in India  policy and that has often implemented safeguard duties on steel imports 
From April 1 this year  the 63 year old Hashimoto   with extensive overseas experience   took the helm of the world s third biggest steelmaker  which changed its name from Nippon Steel   Sumitomo Metal Corp 
 The change reflects our commitment to growing globally and winning global competition as a Japan born company   he said  adding that it wants to regain and maintain it previous No 1 status by market capitalization 
Nippon Steel was intermittently the world s No 1 by market cap between 2013 and 2016  but its market cap now stand at  16 8 billion  behind peers Baoshan Iron   Steel at  23 4 billion  ArcelorMittal at  20 3 billion  Posco at  19 4 billion and  Nucor   NYSE NUE  at  17 5 billion  according to data on Refinitiv Eikon 
 For a graphic on  Market cap of major steel producers  click  
The 69 year old steel company is also feeling threatened by Chinese rivals as they improve and upgrade their technology 
 China  which makes half of global steel  is a big threat  We need to keep improving our products and cost competitiveness   he said 
Nippon Steel has aggressively invested overseas in the past several years  including its 2018 acquisition of Sweden s Ovako  which makes speciality steel used in industries 
Some analysts say  though  the more urgent challenge for Nippon Steel is to fix problems at its domestic plants 
 Production overhaul is more pressing issue   said Yuji Matsumoto  an analyst at Nomura Securities 
In February  the steelmaker cut its annual profit forecast for the year ending on March 31 by 6 percent  as technical troubles at its mills reduced its crude steel output 
Hashimoto said aging facilities and a lack of skilled labor were behind the problems and one of his priorities is to tackle these issues 
 We need to raise our production capability as stable output is our base for global competition and higher profits  
Japanese steelmakers are enjoying solid domestic demand from automakers and the construction sector  which is busy with projects for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics  but natural disasters and a series of glitches have prevented them from producing as much steel as they had planned ",2019-03-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nippon-steel-to-bolster-overseas-business-focus-on-india-1823166,1823166
171599,393115,NUE,U S  lifts tariffs on Canadian  Mexican metals in boost for trade pact,news,"By David Lawder and Steve Scherer WASHINGTON OTTAWA  Reuters    The United States struck deals on Friday to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico  the three governments said  removing a major obstacle to legislative approval of a new North American trade pact  The separate agreements  which will not impose U S  quotas on Canadian and Mexican metals shipments  will also eliminate Mexican and Canadian retaliatory tariffs on a broad range of U S  products  including pork  beef and bourbon  The United States and Canada said their agreement will be implemented by Sunday afternoon  and includes new curbs aimed at preventing dumped steel and aluminum from China and other countries from entering the U S  market via Canada  President Donald Trump had imposed the global  Section 232  tariffs of 25  on steel and 10  on aluminum in March 2018 on national security grounds  invoking a 1962 Cold War era trade law  Both Canada and Mexico argued for 14 months that their metals industries posed no security threat as their economies are integrated with the United States  and challenged the tariffs before the World Trade Organization   This is just pure good news for Canadians   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters after announcing the deal to workers at Stelco Holdings Inc s steel mill in Hamilton  Ontario  Stelco shares soared 11 percent on the news  while top U S  steelmaker  Nucor   NYSE NUE  fell 3 1 percent and U S  Steel Corp  which had seen massive profit improvement because of the tariffs  fell 1 2 percent  Spokesmen for U S  Steel and Nucor  which had advocated for maintaining strong tariff protections  could not be reached for comment   TRADE DEAL VOTE The metals tariffs were a major irritant for Canada and Mexico and had caused them to halt progress toward ratification the new U S  Mexico Canada Agreement  the trilateral trade deal to replace the 25 year old North American Free Trade Agreement  U S  lawmakers with constituents suffering from Canadian and Mexican retaliation  including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  also said they would not consider a USMCA vote with the tariffs in place  After the deal  Grassley tweeted   Thank u Mr President for really helping the farmers of Iowa w this important step in USMCA  w lifting metal tariffs  realdonaldtrump just proved he can deliver on negotiations  China ought to take note start dealing in good faith   take Pres Trump seriously   Trudeau said Canada would now work with the United States on the timing of USMCA ratification and said he was optimistic Canada would be  be able to move forward well in the coming weeks    U S  Vice President Mike Pence said he would meet with Trudeau in Ottawa on May 30 to discuss  advancing  ratification  Several U S  Democrats applauded removal of the tariffs  but said USMCA was not yet ready for their support   When it comes to the new agreement  House Democrats continue to have a number of substantial concerns related to labor  environment  enforcement  and access to affordable medicines provisions  Those issues still need to be remedied   said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal  Neal added that the deal does not address global steel overcapacity and criticized Trump s handling of trade negotiations with China  which deteriorated significantly in the last two weeks   Trump  speaking to realtors in Washington  called the pact  a fantastic deal for our country  and said Congress would hopefully approve the USMCA quickly   Then the great farmers and manufacturers and steel plants will make our economy even more successful than it already is   Jesus Seade  Mexico s deputy foreign minister for North America  said the deal  measurably increases the probability  the USMCA will be approved before the U S  Congress  summer break in August  Some U S  lawmakers say passage would become more difficult after the recess due to budget battles expected in the fall and increased 2020 presidential campaign activity  TRANSSHIPMENTS  SURGES Trump s metals tariffs have been largely aimed at keeping excess production from China out of the U S  market  and the deal includes a new monitoring mechanism aimed at preventing steel and aluminum from China and other countries from being transshipped through Canada and Mexico to the United States  But the U S  Trade Representative s office also said the deal allows it to reimpose tariffs in the event of  surges  in imports of specific steel products  If tariffs are reimposed  retaliation would be limited to the steel and aluminum sectors  Carmakers  which have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher U S  costs due to the tariffs  praised the deal and said it brought USMCA passage a big step closer   While many automakers already source the vast majority of their steel and aluminum domestically  tariffs drive those prices up which decreases investment and harms auto workers and ultimately consumers   said the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  a trade group representing most major brands including General Motors Co  NYSE GM   Toyota Motor Corp Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG and others  
The National Pork Producers Council  which says retaliatory tariffs have cost its members  12 per animal  or a total of  1 5 billion  also expressed relief at the end of  a trade dispute that has placed enormous financial strain on American pork producers  ",2019-05-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-poised-to-lift-steel-aluminum-tariffs-from-canada-mexico-media-reports-1871832,1871832

171621,393137,NUE,Nucor CEO Says Quotas May Replace Tariffs in Steel Trade Fight,news," Bloomberg     U S  tariffs on steel could be replaced by quotas for Canada and Mexico  the head of the largest U S  steelmaker says 
The U S   Canada and Mexico are preparing to sign their new trade deal late next month  despite an ongoing tariff fight    U S  levies on the other countries  steel and aluminum imports remain in effect  as do Canadian and Mexican retaliatory tariffs 
John Ferriola  chief executive officer of  Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE    said during an earnings call with analysts on Thursday that quotas of some kind may replace tariffs for Canada  Mexico and other countries 
 At the end of the day  we think that there will and could very well be some changes to tariffs versus quotas  not only within Nafta but other countries   Ferriola said   But what we believe is that the tariffs are achieving their primary objective  
The countries have reached a deal to update the North American Free Trade Agreement  which will be renamed the U S  Mexico Canada Agreement  They aim to sign it on Nov  30 before incoming Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office 
Tariff Hurdle
Some in Mexico are suggesting that the USMCA may not proceed without a steel and aluminum tariff deal  Jesus Seade  who represented Lopez Obrador  said in an interview that Mexico shouldn t sign the deal until the tariffs are removed  according to Mexico s Reforma newspaper  Mexico s outgoing economy minister  Ildefonso Guajardo  has said he expects the issue to be resolved before the deal is signed at the end of November 
Canada  meanwhile  has sought to distance the USMCA deadlines from talks over the steel and aluminum tariffs  Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has said Canada will drop its retaliatory tariffs once the U S  drops its own   We have taken strong responsive measures to defend our workers and our industry  including measured  dollar for dollar tariffs   spokesman Adam Austen said Thursday   The best outcome for both countries would be for the U S  to rescind their tariffs  
Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney  who negotiated the first Nafta deal and has acted as an informal Canadian envoy with the Trump administration  said he thought the steel and aluminum dispute would be dealt with soon 
 I wasn t surprised to see that was not included in the final deal   Mulroney said on the sidelines of a Canaccord Genuity cannabis conference in Toronto   My expectation  however  is that given the importance of the deal and the satisfaction of all three parties led by the Americans with the renewed Nafta deal  that this matter will be resolved to Canada s satisfaction probably in the relatively near future  ",2018-10-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/nucor-ceo-says-quotas-may-replace-tariffs-in-steel-trade-fight-1651289,1651289
171622,393138,NUE,Trump s steel tariffs create big profits but few new jobs,news,By Timothy Aeppel SEDALIA  Missouri  Reuters     Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE   America s largest steelmaker  planned a new plant in Sedalia  Missouri  long before U S  President Donald Trump imposed tariffs to protect the industry   and it does not need them to make money  Although the firm helped lead the lobbying push for tariffs on imports  executives say they invested in Sedalia and two other sites to capitalize on an already profitable strategy that doesn t depend on government help  While Trump has played up the narrative of downtrodden steel workers losing jobs to unscrupulous foreign competitors  most of the benefit from his 25 percent tariffs are flowing to the already strong bottom lines of Nucor and other modernized and globally competitive U S  steel firms  according to interviews with industry executives  experts and a Reuters review of company earnings  Even if tariffs prompt such firms to expand  they are not likely to add large numbers of factory jobs because they have stayed competitive by slashing the amount of labor required to make steel   For a graphic on steel industry efficiency and job loss  see     The Commerce Department said in a statement to Reuters that tariffs will help the Sedalia plant and 12 other steel projects create about 3 405 jobs  That s a 2 4 percent gain industrywide  according to the American Iron and Steel Institute  About 1 400 of those jobs at six projects  including the three Nucor sites  were planned before tariffs or do not rely on them  according to some of the firms and a Reuters review of company documents  In addition  two other projects by Republic Steel  which would create 690 jobs by restarting previously idled operations  are not certain to go forward  the company said  A Commerce Department spokesman did not comment on whether all the projects on the administration s list depended on tariffs but pointed out that steel imports have declined recently and domestic production has increased  The department said broad tariffs on imports were needed because of rampant  chicanery  by foreign producers who evaded existing countervailing and anti dumping duties  which are applied narrowly to specific products  Nucor has led the sector s transformation to labor saving plants since the 1970s  replacing older blast furnaces with more efficient modern electric arc furnaces  Trump s tariffs may prove pivotal in extending the life of older  less efficient plants such as U S  Steel s Granite City plant near St  Louis  where the president held an event in July to tout tariffs  The company credits tariffs for its decision to add 800 jobs by restarting two blast furnaces it had idled in 2015  A total of 1 500 workers will now work in a factory where sparks fly and molten steel is still poured from giant ladles in a labor intensive  multi step process  At Nucor s plant in Sedalia  by contrast  225 people will make steel with a high tech furnace that shoots electricity through scrap metal to melt it into new products  That technology is now used to produce nearly 70 percent of U S  steel   with a third less labor and energy  according to Charles Bradford  president of Bradford Research Inc  Nucor CEO John Ferriola testified in Washington last year that tariffs would encourage steel sector investment  but he emphasized in a statement to Reuters that the company s own capital projects are  designed to be competitive even without tariffs   Although Nucor s expansions don t depend on protectionist policy  a company spokesperson said  tariffs make such investments easier by limiting the dumping of artificially low priced steel on the U S  market  Nucor announced last month that it had nearly tripled its third quarter profits  to  676 66 million  compared to a year ago  Earnings for steel companies in the S P s steel index soared more than 75 percent in the first half of 2018 and are expected to jump 166 percent in the second half  according to I B E S data from Refinitiv   TRANSFORMATIVE  JOBS Nucor has led the way in slashing labor costs with modern factories  a trend driving industry job loss as the hours of labor needed to produce a ton of steel has been cut from nearly 10 to two since 1980  according to the American Iron and Steel Institute  Nucor selected Sedalia because of its location on a main rail line  near ample scrap metal sources and major construction markets needing the plant s steel rebar   Although the plant will create few jobs compared to steel factories of the past  the positions   with salaries averaging  65 000   are highly coveted in Sedalia  where home values average  86 000 and 15 percent of adults have a college degree  according to U S  census data  The desirability of the jobs underscores a political dynamic often lost in the debate over Trump s trade policy  In places like Sedalia  where 70 percent of residents of the surrounding county voted for Trump  steel jobs are prized over other blue collar work  Sedalia assigned a team of 10 people to court Nucor for a year  and the state provided tax incentives that could total nearly  27 3 million over 15 years  Local economic development director Jessica Craig called the jobs  transformative    DEATH BY CHINA  Nucor gets a warm reception in Washington  too  where it s the biggest spender on lobbying among steel firms  laying out  1 25 million so far this year  down from a peak of  2 71 million in 2015  according to Nucor disclosures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics  Nucor s political spending  which also includes millions of dollars in donations to political candidates  started under former CEO Dan DiMicco  who started in 2000 and stepped down in 2012  DiMicco went on to advise Trump on manufacturing during the presidential transition and is now a member of his Advisory Committee for Trade Policy Negotiations  a key venue for business leaders to influence U S  trade negotiators  Nucor also gave  1 million to a San Diego nonprofit in 2011  which was used by Peter Navarro   now a top Trump trade adviser   to make a film called  Death by China   At one point  the film depicts a knife emblazoned with  made in China  plunging into an American flag as a voice over intones   China is the only major nation in the world that is preparing to kill Americans    DiMicco said his experience running Nucor shaped his views   My customers came to me and said   China is killing us    he said in an interview   so this turned into something much larger than the steel industry   You may have to put tariffs on every product from China to change their behavior   As they raise alarms about unfair competition  however  Nucor executives take pride in the company s performance despite such headwinds  Nucor has been profitable since 1968 in every year but one   2009  amid a global financial crisis  Nucor has also sought to block other companies  efforts to win exemptions from the tariffs through a Commerce Department process that awards them in cases where  for instance  a company can t find the type of steel it needs domestically  Nucor said it filed objections to about 10 percent of the more than 42 000 steel exemption requests received as of October 22   They included those from companies such as NLMK Pennsylvania LLC  which sought exemptions for imported slabs it uses to make steel coils   They don t even make the kind of slabs we use   CEO Bob Miller said of Nucor  who he believes wants to compete with him in selling coils   It s totally anti competitive   The tariffs are boosting capacity of the slabs NLMK needs  Nucor said in a statement  so there should be  plenty of slabs available domestically   LOST PROFITS  JOBS Tariff critics argue that rising profits for the steel industry come at the expense of its customers and their workers  Higher prices mean steel users   companies making everything from tractors to skyscrapers   could cut 16 jobs for every one added in steel manufacturing  according to the Trade Partnership Worldwide LLC  a pro trade economic forecasting and consulting firm in Washington  Tariff advocates call such worries overblown   What you see six months into the steel tariffs is that the manufacturing economy is strong   says Scott Paul  president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing  Steel consumers say their cutbacks will come over time  as higher steel prices erode their competitiveness  Major automakers including Ford  Honda  Fiat Chrysler and General Motors  NYSE GM  have said the steel tariffs will mean billions of dollars in new costs for the industry  and GM recently announced cuts to North American white collar staff  The impact reaches far beyond auto factories to anyone who uses steel  Joe Pecoraro  a project executive at Skender Construction  a Chicago builder  said the tariffs caused him to delay two projects that would have produced at least 130 construction jobs   The cost of everything made of steel   he said   has gone through the roof this year

171652,393168,NUE,U S  manufacturers  steel makers battle over tariff relief,news,"By Timothy Aeppel  Reuters    The flood of requests from U S  manufacturers with the Commerce Department to exempt them from the Trump administration s hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is exposing competitive information to rivals  customers and U S  metal producers  The tariff exemptions process is a new front in a battle between U S  steel and aluminum consumers  fighting to keep prices for those metals down  and U S  metal producers which argue that foreign rivals have kept prices low with unfair trading practices  So far  over 22 500 applications for exemptions have landed in Washington and many more arrive each day  Over 4 000 objections have been filed  which is also expected to grow  Only 98 applications have been processed as of last week  and of those  only 42 were approved  according to the Commerce Department  Companies are required to fill out a five page form for each type of product it imports that details everything from the chemical composition of the metal and the volumes they use to its strength and where they are currently buying it overseas  Those are details nearly every manufacturer considers highly proprietary  since it can be used to assess their cost structure  Competitors can use such insights to tell customers that the other company is likely to face supply shortages or is about to sharply raise prices  Greenfield Industries Inc  a subsidiary of China s TDC Cutting Tools Inc in Seneca  South Carolina  has filed 1 176 requests to exempt the various types of specialty steel it imports from China to make cutting tools at its 330 employee U S  operation   In one application  for instance  Greenfield states  the sole U S  producer of high speed steel material appropriate for cutting tools is not currently ramping up any production to expand this aspect of their business and has not shown any interest in quoting new business   The applications give a roadmap to domestic metal producers seeking to block an exemption entirely  U S  steel makers may file objections  each three pages long  to make the case that they can provide the metal to a customer instead of that customer using an overseas supplier    Nucor  Corp   N NUE   the Charlotte based steelmaker  is among those filing objections    We are seeing exclusion requests where the volume being requested far exceeds the entity s actual consumption or capacity   said Katherine Miller  a Nucor spokeswoman   She added that one request was for 30 times more volume than the company s capacity   One reason a company might exaggerate their needs is that the system does not define clearly what it means for a product to be available from a domestic source  Many applications note that  while a metal is available domestically  it s not produced in the quantity required by domestic metal consumers  Cost is not a reason for metals consumers to get relief  If a domestic producer says it can supply a product  no matter the price  it can potentially block an exemption request   Other big steelmakers as well as other metal producers and processors  including United States Steel Corp  N X  and AK Steel Holding Corp  N AKS   are also filing objections  U S  Steel referred inquiries to the company s public statements  which have welcomed the tariffs  while AK Steel declined to discuss the exclusion process or their objections  NLMK Pennsylvania LLC  a subsidiary of Russia s NLMK Group which imports Russian made steel slabs and rolls them into coils at its plant in Farrell  Pennsylvania  filed an application that says  in part   our  U S   competitors consume slab they make for their internal needs and have no excess capacity available for sale on a consistent  stable basis    Nucor objected  stating there are  adequate supplies  of domestic steel slab and that  access to low priced imported steel is not a sufficient basis for an exclusion   NLMK s CEO Bob Miller told Reuters the objection from Nucor is  anti competitive   noting that Nucor is saying they make a product that can be used as a substitute for steel slab   the hot and cold rolled coils of steel that both companies sell to end customers   So they re basically saying they should have their customers buy hot and cold rolled coils from us   and let NLMK go out of business   said Miller  who also does not like that there s no way to  rebut an objection     It s a total lack of due process   he said  Nucor did not wish to comment on their objection beyond their filing   GREAT SALES TOOL  A review of filings by Reuters show how competitors are jumping into the fray   Barry Zekelman  CEO of Chicago based Zekelman Industries  a privately held maker of pipe and tube  estimates his company has filed a  couple dozen  objections and that he views the process as a  great sales tool   He said the filings often show that the real motive for imports is to buy goods more cheaply offshore from low cost countries like Turkey  Brazil and China  Zekelman said it is too early to tell how much business he will gain from the process  but he expects those gains to come in the second half of this year  The makeup of the metal only complicates the application process  Steel is not a single commodity  but rather a complex market made up of hundreds of different grades and types of metal that vary in terms of ease of stamping  resistance to breakage and other properties  For many uses  a new steel supplier has to be certified to assure that the steel meets the end customer s specifications  Another issue is staffing  The Commerce Department is rushing to hire workers to handle the applications  which has many applicants worrying that the government workers will be ill prepared to sift through the arguments   The concern is that these requests aren t properly vetted  by people with expertise in the complexities of steel and aluminum production  said Alexander Russ  director of international and regulatory affairs at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers  a trade group   
 It s bleak to say the least for companies trying to get an exclusion   said Russ ",2018-06-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-manufacturers-steel-makers-battle-over-tariff-relief-1511274,1511274
171671,393187,NUE,U S  slaps heavy duties on Chinese steel shipped from Vietnam,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Commerce Department on Monday slapped steep import duties on steel products from Vietnam that originated in China after a final finding they evaded U S  anti dumping and anti subsidy orders  The decision marked a victory for U S  steelmakers  who won anti dumping and anti subsidy duties against Chinese steel in 2015 and 2016 only to see shipments flood in from elsewhere  The industry has argued that Chinese products are being diverted to other countries to circumvent the duties   U S  customs authorities will collect anti dumping duties of 199 76 percent and countervailing duties of 256 44 percent on imports of cold rolled steel produced in Vietnam using Chinese origin substrate  the Commerce Department said in a statement  Corrosion resistant steel from Vietnam faces anti dumping duties of 199 43 percent and anti subsidy duties of 39 05 percent  it said  The department has said it would apply the same Chinese anti dumping and anti subsidy rates on corrosion resistant and cold rolled steel from Vietnam that starts out as Chinese made hot rolled steel  The duties will come in addition to a 25 percent tariff on most steel imported into the United States that resulted from the Trump administration s  Section 232  national security investigation into steel and aluminum imports  Although the steel subject to the latest anti dumping and anti subsidy duties was processed in Vietnam to be made corrosion resistant or cold rolled for use in autos or appliances  the Commerce Department agreed with the claims of American producers that as much as 90 percent of the product s value originated from China  The global steel industry is struggling with a glut of excess production capacity  much of it located in China  that has pushed down prices  The decision followed a European Union finding in November that steel shipments from Vietnam into the EU also circumvented tariffs  The Commerce Department said that after anti dumping duties were imposed on Chinese steel products in 2015  shipments of cold rolled steel from Vietnam into the United States shot up to  215 million annually from  9 million  while corrosion resistant steel imports rose to  80 million from  2 million

171696,393212,NUE,How the U S  Squandered Its Steel Superiority  Stephen Mihm,news," Bloomberg View     Donald Trump wants to help the steel industry in this country  and he s announced plans for protective tariffs  claiming that  trade wars are good  and easy to win   By way of explanation  Trump claims that steel    and many other industries    has been  decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy  
He s correct about one thing  This has been a problem many decades in the making  But it s a problem rooted in disastrous decisions made by the steel companies themselves when Trump was still in elementary school 
At the end of World War II  American steel had no real challengers  It produced nearly three quarters of the world s steel  and the factories of its biggest competition    Japan and Germany    lay in ruins  Giants like U S  Steel looked poised to dominate the world for the foreseeable future 
Instead  the industry was lapped by foreign producers    and unfair trade practices were simply not a factor  Instead  the blame lies with U S  manufacturers who held onto the so called  open hearth  method of steel production decades after its expiration date 
Europeans  though  had no such attachment to the past  perhaps because many factories had been destroyed in the war  Moreover  they had started experimenting with the idea of turning iron into steel by blasting pure oxygen onto the molten metal  This method  which became known as the basic oxygen process  first entered trial use in 1948 at a factory in Linz  Austria  owned by the small steel firm VOEST  The company soon built a full scale commercial facility that went online in 1952 
Linz became something of an industrial mecca in the succeeding years  as steelmakers the world over visited to see this new process firsthand  Most became immediate converts  and with good reason  The cost of building steel mills using the basic oxygen furnaces was 40 to 50 percent lower than conventional open hearth factories  operating costs were 25 percent lower  though some studies suggested even greater cost savings 
But it was the productivity gains associated with the new process that should have really raised eyebrows  One factory that made the shift could produce 40 tons of steel per hour using the open hearth process  but after installing basic oxygen equipment  it managed to quadruple that figure 
Unfortunately  Big Steel was too proud to notice Europe gaining ground  In a typical advertisement from the era  U S  Steel claimed it was a company  where the big idea is innovation   But this claim    much like so many of the braggadocios claims of today    could not hide a more disturbing reality 
Indeed  throughout the 1950s  as Europe s steelmakers built new factories around the basic oxygen process and simultaneously demolished its remaining open hearth furnaces  Big Steel made endless excuses   Representatives of the Big Three    Bethlehem  U S  Steel  and Republic    repeatedly claimed that the jury was out on the new method  all evidence to the contrary 
By 1957  even Congress realized that something was amiss  and it summoned steel industry executives to testify  In one particularly cringe worthy performance  a U S  Steel representative told a committee   The distinguishing characteristic of the American steel industry is its tremendous productiveness  a quality which other countries have been unable to emulate so far   later adding that the company had examined the methods popular in Europe but found them wanting 
This was madness  While Big Steel fiddled  basic oxygen furnaces burned ever brighter around the world  So  too  did yet another method of making steel that was even more revolutionary  the electric arc method  This technique used electricity to recycle iron scrap  turning it into steel  Unlike conventional steel mills  electric arc mills are small scale enterprises that are easy to establish and cheap to build  even if they can t produce anywhere near the scale of a conventional integrated mill 
The Europeans began building these  too  en masse  As these two methods continued to take off in Europe  and then in Japan and elsewhere in Asia  American companies continued to add completely inefficient open hearth furnaces to their shop floors  doubling down on an obsolescent technology 
By the 1960s  Big Steel began building basic oxygen plants  grudgingly  It was too late  The steel industry had squandered its supremacy 
It could have gone differently  Economists who have run counterfactual scenarios    where Big Steel made the necessary capital improvements to stay competitive    suggest that the American companies could have stayed on top  and reaped even greater profits than it did by postponing the inevitable upgrades 
But there s a final twist to this tale that highlights the absurdity of Trump s strategy  In the 1960s  a man named Ken Iverson took over a conglomerate that acquired a stake in the steel business that became  Nucor   NYSE NUE   Iverson then bet the firm s future on making steel using the electric arc process  building the first American facility in 1969  It began growing at an exponential rate  competing rather effectively with foreign producers  to say nothing of other American producers 
As other steel producers begged for protectionist trade policy  Iverson mocked the idea  In an interview in 1986  Iverson noted that protectionist measures already instituted hadn t had the desired effect   As soon as prices began to rise so that the steel companies began to be profitable  they stopped modernizing   he said   It s only under intense competitive pressure    both internally from the mini mills  and externally from the Japanese and the Koreans    that the big steel companies have been forced to modernize  
Nucor has since become the nation s largest domestic steel producer  Yet it has started to act like the U S  Steel of old  After Trump announced the tariff  Nucor s CEO vigorously applauded the move  claiming it was long overdue 
We ll see  But before Nucor joins the protectionist parade  it might want to recall the words of Iverson  who died in 2002  when his company was on the way to the top   Unless you re under intense competitive pressure and it becomes a question of the survival of the business to do it  you re just going to lapse back into your old ways  There s no other answer

171698,393214,NUE,U S  Metal Stocks Hold Losses as Exemptions Blunt Tariff Boost,news," Bloomberg     After fluctuating in the past week amid uncertainty over planned tariffs  U S  steel and aluminum stocks barely moved as President Donald Trump finally announced the measures 
U S  Steel Corp   AK Steel Holding Corp  and  Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE   held losses Thursday as Trump confirmed a 25 percent duty on steel shipments and 10 percent on aluminum  while giving conditional exemptions to Canada and Mexico 
Those steel stocks surged a week ago when news of the tariff plans emerged  before swinging between gains and losses amid fears that retaliatory measures and exemptions to allies would water down the benefits  Century Aluminum Co  recovered some ground Thursday as Trump said the Chicago based company would bring back capacity  before falling back to close down 7 5 percent 
The president signed a formal proclamation for the tariffs  excluding Mexico and Canada as long as they renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement  The measure gives Trump the flexibility to raise tariffs on other countries if the two Nafta partners are excluded long term 
Earlier Thursday  Trump noted that the U S  has a trade surplus with Australia and called the nation a  long term partner  
For aluminum  such exemptions would render the tariffs useless by thwarting the ability of U S  smelters to restart capacity  according to Harbor Intelligence 
Senator Jeff Flake said he s incredulous about confusing signals from the White House on how it might proceed with the tariff proposal   Flexible tariffs  What does that mean  One day you wake up and say   I don t like Australia   It s unbelievable  
The Arizona Republican plans to introduce legislation that would nullify the tariffs 
Trump announced the planned tariffs on March 1  after a Commerce Department investigation found that imports of the metals pose a risk to national security  The probes were authorized under the seldom used Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act that gives the president broad powers to impose trade restrictions on domestic security grounds ",2018-03-08,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-metal-stocks-hold-losses-as-exemptions-blunt-tariff-boost-1333137,1333137
171714,393230,NUE,Trump Is Said to Delay Decision on Steel  Aluminum Tariffs,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump has delayed a decision on imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum as his administration weighs a move that could antagonize trading partners from China to Mexico and hurt some domestic industries 
The White House has postponed the decision beyond Thursday  when the president was initially expected to make the announcement  said three people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations aren t public 
Trump had told aides he wants tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum from all countries    both of which would exceed the most severe option presented to him by the Commerce Department  The president has until April 11 to announce a decision on steel and April 19 for aluminum 
A White House official said early Thursday that there would be an announcement on trade later in the day  Trump is holding a  listening session  on Thursday with chief executives including ArcelorMittal USA s John Brett   Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE   s John Ferriola and Century Aluminum Co  s Mike Bless  over the investigations 
Steel and aluminum stocks pared earlier advances  Century Aluminum was up 2 2 percent at 11 38 a m  in in New York after rising as much as 8 5 percent  AK Steel Holding Corp  was up 3 percent after jumping as much as 12 percent  U S  Steel Corp  advanced 1 8 percent and was up as much as 8 4 percent  Nucor  the largest U S  producer  climbed 1 6 percent  following a 3 7 percent gain 
Severe Options
Trump has been considering a range of options to curb imports of steel and aluminum  after the Commerce Department concluded that shipments of the two commodities hurt U S  national security  He s told aides he wants tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum from all countries    both of which exceed the most severe options presented to Trump by the Commerce Department 
 Our Steel and Aluminum industries  and many others  have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world   Trump said in a Twitter posting Thursday morning   We must not let our country  companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer  We want free  fair and SMART TRADE  
A U S  move on tariffs may provoke retaliation from China  the world s biggest steel and aluminum producer  China has already launched a probe into U S  imports of sorghum  and is studying whether to restrict shipments of U S  soybeans    targets that could hurt Trump s support in some farming states  While China accounts for just a fraction of U S  imports of the metals  it s accused of flooding the global market and dragging down prices 
China Talks
It could add to tensions between the world s two biggest economies on the same day Chinese President Xi Jinping s top economic adviser  Liu He  is scheduled to meet Trump s senior economic team in Washington    including White House economic adviser Gary Cohn  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin 
Foreign government officials have traveled to Washington in recent days to voice their concern about tariffs  Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo was said to warn the administration about his country s plans for retaliatory measures  Trump is also under pressure from members of his own Republican party to tread lightly to avoid triggering global retaliation and amid concerns of higher prices for consumer goods 
However  American steel producers and workers have called on Trump to defend their industry as it grapples with the effects of overcapacity in China 
Last April  the president ordered Commerce to study the impact of steel and aluminum imports on national security under seldom used section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act  Commerce submitted its final reports to the president in January

171715,393231,NUE,Trump to impose steep tariffs on steel  aluminum  stoking trade war talk,news,"By Steve Holland and Ginger Gibson WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U S  producers  risking retaliation from major trade partners like China  Europe and neighboring Canada as well as helping to trigger a large selloff on Wall Street      Trump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum would be formally announced next week although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out  Trump believes the tariffs will safeguard American jobs but many economists say the impact of price increases for consumers of steel and aluminum  such as the auto and oil industries  will be to destroy more jobs than they create      We re going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back   he said  News of the tariffs drove the stocks of U S  domestic steel and aluminum makers sharply higher  but also hit sentiment on Wall Street due to the potential impact of higher costs on consumers  The move came after what one person with direct knowledge of the discussions described as a night of  chaos  in the White House due to frequent switching of positions in the administration  The threat of tariffs was sharply criticized by some senior Republican legislators as well as industries from autos to oil whose input costs will rise  A major concern is that U S  farm exports could be hit hard in retaliation by steel exporting countries  RETALIATION   Every time you do this  you get a retaliation  Agriculture is the number one target  I think this is terribly counterproductive for the agriculture economy   said Senator Pat Roberts  who chairs the chamber s agriculture committee   China has already threatened to curb imports of U S  soybeans  while the European Union has said it will consider action as well  China s top trade official Lui He is in Washington for trade talks  The move will not directly hit China that hard  with data showing that Canada supplies 16 percent of U S  demand versus China s 2 percent and is by far the largest steel exporter followed by Brazil and South Korea    Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products  Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers   Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a sharply worded statement  Brazil s industry ministry said it would consider taking action on its own over the tariffs or in concert with other countries  Two of its largest steelmakers  Cia Siderurgica Nacional and Usiminas sold off on the tariff news  closing down 4 4 percent and 4 2 percent  respectively   Washington is already engaged in a dispute with Canada and Mexico over its proposed revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement and months of tense talks have failed to produce any meaningful progress  Asked whether there would be exemptions for any countries  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she would not get into any details ahead of next week s announcement  She said the tariffs were still being finalized  After Trump s statement  AK Steel Holding was up almost 10 percent  U S  Steel Corp was up over 5 percent and  Nucor   NYSE NUE  rose 3 2 percent  By contrast shares of steel consumers fell with Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co down over 3 percent and General Motors Co  NYSE GM  down almost 4 percent   The administration says duties would protect U S  industry  but critics say they would raise costs for industry and fail to deliver on a campaign pledge to boost domestic jobs  Trump s decision reflected a victory for the trade hawks in his administration  including White House trade adviser Peter Navarro  who has been rising in importance  and a setback for those who fear the repercussions of the move  such as top economic adviser Gary Cohn  It had appeared unlikely that Trump would announce the tariffs on Thursday after a night of back and forth inside the administration   There was a lot of movement within the past 12  16 hours   said the source who had knowledge of the discussions  but who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue   It was going to happen  It wasn t going to happen and then it did happen   The administration has also cited national security interests for its action  saying the United States needs domestic supply for its tanks and warships  Contrary to the action announced by Trump on Thursday  the Department of Defense had recommended targeted steel tariffs and a delay in aluminum duties  Although China only accounts for two percent of U S  steel imports  its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices  Trade tensions between the United States and China have risen since Trump took office in 2017 and the administration is also pushing on what it regards as forced technology transfers to China   FEW MORE JOBS FROM TARIFFS While American steelmakers have lost three quarters of their jobs between 1962 and 2005  a major study by the American Economic Association showed that much of this had been due to improved production technology as output per worker rose fivefold   Thus  even if trade protection leads to increased domestic production  increases in employment may be far less than many hope   a report from the independent Econofact economist network said last week  Econofact said in its report that two million jobs were in industries that use steel  intensively   including auto parts  household appliances  farm machinery and oil equipment   Across many states  the number of jobs adversely affected in these steel using industries could far exceed any steel jobs saved   Econofact warned  The overall impact on the U S  economy is likely to be muted  barring a major trade war  with steel and aluminum imports accounting for just two percent of the overall total

171716,393232,NUE,Trump Says U S  Will Impose Harsh Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump said the U S  would slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect national security  a major escalation of his hawkish trade agenda that could hit producers from Europe to Asia and spur global retaliation 
Trump said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum for  a long period of time   and he expected to sign a formal order next week  The president didn t elaborate on the details of the planned action  including whether any products or countries would be exempted 
 We ll be imposing tariffs on steel imports and tariffs on aluminum imports   Trump told metals industry executives Thursday at the White House   Some time next week we ll be signing it in  And you re going to have protection for the first time in a long time  
The S P 500 Index slumped to session lows  U S  stocks for companies that consume the metals like Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  fell  and Treasuries climbed as investors reacted to the news  while shares of U S  steel and aluminum producers jumped  It was a different story for steel producers in South Korea and Japan  which were getting hammered in early Friday trading 
Trump had been considering a range of options to curb imports of steel and aluminum  after the Commerce Department concluded that shipments of the two commodities hurt U S  national security  That reasoning has irked allies  with Japan s Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko on Friday pushing back against that view 
 Steel and aluminum imports from Japan  which is an ally  do not affect U S  national security at all   Seko told reporters in Tokyo Friday   I would like to convey that to the U S  when I have an opportunity  
Canada    the biggest foreign supplier of steel to the U S     said the measures were unacceptable while the European Union vowed to  react firmly  with World Trade Organization compliant countermeasures in the next few days 
The punitive measures would level the unfair playing field that has persisted for years and make it easier for American companies to expand and hire workers  Trump said

Trump s statement Thursday followed hours of confusion  Staffers in the White House scrambled to explain what was happening with the expected tariff announcement  ducking in and out of offices in the West Wing as they sought information about the president s plans 
On Wednesday night  Trump was set to announce stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum  and industry CEOs were sent a last minute invitation to the White House for the unveiling  Early Thursday  White House aides confirmed the announcement was coming  But later in the morning  they said it was postponed 
Listening Session
Stocks including AK Steel Holding Corp   U S  Steel Corp  and Century Aluminum Co  jumped on anticipation of the tariffs announcement  then retreated following mid morning reports that no announcement was expected Thursday  Trump s statement pushed them back up again 
Amid the tumult  the tariff event was re billed as a  listening session  with chief executives  including ArcelorMittal USA s John Brett   Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE   s John Ferriola and Century Aluminum Co  s Mike Bless  At that meeting  which was opened up to the press  he announced the tariffs 
Stocks Up

Companies from beer brewer MillerCoors to candymaker Hershey Co   which use aluminum for manufacturing and packaging  said operations would be hurt by the tariffs 
 We buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available  however  there simply isn t enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us   MillerCoors said in a tweet   American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of this misguided tariff

171752,393268,NUE,New Ram pickup notches win for steel in U S  truck market,news,"By Joseph White and Nick Carey
DETROIT  Reuters     Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV  N FCAU   MI FCHA  on Monday unveiled a redesigned Ram large pickup that along with General Motors Co s  N GM  new Chevrolet Silverado  which debuted on Saturday  sealed a double victory for the steel industry s fight to remain the dominant metal in the auto market 
The 2019 Ram is made mostly of  real steel   Michael Manley  head of the global Ram and Jeep brands for Fiat Chrysler  told reporters at a briefing ahead of the official debut of the truck at the Detroit Auto Show  The new Silverado also is made mostly of steel  including a high strength steel cargo box  unlike the top selling U S  pickup truck   Ford Motor Co  s  N F  F 150  which has a body and cargo box made of aluminum 
Ford jolted the industry in December 2014 when it launched the current generation F 150 with an all aluminum body  Ford s F series trucks represented the largest scale use of aluminum in a high volume vehicle  and required technological risk taking at a level rarely seen among the Detroit automakers 
The aluminum F 150 was up to 700 pounds  318 kg  lighter than the previous steel model  and delivered an 11 percent improvement in combined city and highway fuel economy   a substantial boost for Ford s effort to meet escalating federal fuel efficiency targets 
However  it came at a cost  Rolled steel costs around  800 per ton  while aluminum is more than  2 000 per ton  estimated metals industry analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research  The high strength steels used in the new Ram and Silverado cost more than standard steel alloys  but still have the price edge over aluminum  he said 
The auto show  officially called the North American International Auto Show  opened to media on Sunday and runs until Jan  28 
LOW GAS PRICES TIP THE SCALES
Since the aluminum F 150 s launch  U S  auto executives have come to a consensus that U S  gasoline prices will be stable for the long haul  In that environment  Ford s rivals chose to stick with steel  and aim for higher profit margins  The automakers are lobbying the Trump administration for changes to federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy  or CAFE  targets that would make it easier for trucks to comply 
 CAFE standards have been driving much of the shift to aluminum and the Trump administration has really backed off those   Bill Hickey  president of Chicago based Lapham Hickey Steel  which has seven steel processing plants in the Midwest and Northeast 
Fiat Chrysler is taking steps to improve the fuel efficiency of the 2019 Ram over the current model  which is rated at 20 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving 
The new Ram is more aerodynamic than its predecessor  and will offer a 48 volt hybrid system on most gasoline versions  one of the highest volume uses of such technology yet  When accelerating from a stop  the hybrid system will use electricity to launch the vehicle before the gasoline engine kicks in 
The 2019 Ram is wider than the current model and has a 4 inch longer wheelbase  Passengers get more leg room and Fiat Chrysler benefits from federal fuel economy rules that set lower mileage targets for wider  longer vehicles  company officials said 
GM s new Silverado s wheelbase is also stretched by four inches compared to the current model  and can carry more in the back  GM executives on Saturday said it will nonetheless it is 450 pounds lighter  and will be more efficient 
GM is taking between 200 and 500 pounds out of all its new models using a mix of materials  including high strength steel  and redesigning parts to reduce weight  said Mark Reuss  head of the automaker s global product development   That s a great formula without charging all kinds of money for materials that people don t care about   he said after the official debut of the 2019 Silverado in Detroit on Saturday 
GM and Fiat Chrysler together sold about 1 3 million large pickup trucks in 2017  and the Silverado and Ram are respectively the second  and third best selling model lines in the United States 
Fiat Chrysler identified its steel suppliers as AK Steel AKST UL    Nucor  Corp  N NUE  and Arcelor Mittal 
The auto industry accounts for about two thirds of sales for AK Steel  and trucks and sport utility vehicles accounted for about three fourths of those automotive sales  spokeswoman Lisa Jester wrote in an email  She declined to comment on specific customers 
Fiat Chrysler engineers said using high strength steel in the new Ram s frame and body helped cut a total of 225 pounds  102 kg  from the vehicle s weight  or about a 4 percent reduction compared with the outgoing model  The new Ram has some aluminum parts  including the tailgate and certain components such as engine mounts and elements of the suspension 
Cutting weight makes more room to boost payload  and add luxury features to increase revenue per truck  such as an optional 12 inch touch screen to control entertainment and other features  and optional  barnwood  accents in the interior of the Western themed Longhorn model ",2018-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-ram-pickup-notches-win-for-steel-in-us-truck-market-1103773,1103773

171823,393339,NUE,Soft Demand  China Mar Outlook Of Steel Producers Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry serves a wide range of end use industries such as automotive  construction  appliance  container  industrial machinery  transportation  and oil and gas with various steel products  These include hot rolled and cold rolled coils and sheets  hot dipped and galvanized coils and sheets  reinforcing bars  billets  wire rods  strip mill plates  standard and line pipe  and mechanical tubing products Here are the industry s three major themes Sluggish steel demand poses problems for the steel producers industry  The trade war induced slowdown in China s economy has triggered a contraction in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by sluggish real estate investment growth and falling car sales have clouded the steel demand outlook  The world s largest automobile market contracted for the second straight year in 2019 amid a slowing domestic economy and tariff war with the United States  A weakening manufacturing sector is also expected to limit steel demand growth in the United States  While the de escalation in trade tensions due to the recent announcement of the preliminary trade deal offers a glimmer of hope  a material improvement in the demand environment for steel is not expected anytime soon given the global economic slowdown  The industry continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  made worse by continued growth in Chinese production  China  which accounts for roughly half of the global steel output  is a significant contributor to global steel excess capacity  Notwithstanding a slowdown in the Chinese economy and Beijing s efforts to cut steel capacity  its steel mills continue to crank up output to take advantage of healthy profit margins  Chinese production increased at a fast pace during 2019  A glut of cheap Chinese steel has put downward pressure on both its own and global steel prices  China s steel overcapacity remains an overhang for the industry over the near term  The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied last year  drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers  Improved capacity also provided a boost to domestic steel production  However  higher production  partly driven by restarted mills  contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices last year  In fact  after rallying to multi year highs in 2018 on the back of Trump imposed tariffs  U S  steel prices fell back to the pre tariff levels in 2019  Sliding steel prices  softening demand across major domestic end markets and trade tensions weighed on U S  steel producers last year  Driven by consecutive price hike actions by major U S  steel mills and supply side actions  U S  steel prices have lately gained some traction  However  a significant recovery in prices is not expected over the near term given the oversupply in the market and weak domestic steel demand  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of

in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears

171824,393340,NUE,Why Nucor  NUE  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Nucor  NUE   which belongs to the Zacks Steel   Producers industry 
This steel company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6 65  
For the most recent quarter  Nucor was expected to post earnings of  0 80 per share  but it reported  0 90 per share instead  representing a surprise of 12 50   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 25 per share  while it actually produced  1 26 per share  a surprise of 0 80  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Nucor  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Nucor has an Earnings ESP of  4 86  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 28  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-nucor-nue-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200498409,200498409

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 52 94   A quarter ago  it was expected that this steel company would post earnings of  0 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 90  delivering a surprise of 12 50

Nucor  which belongs to the Zacks Steel   Producers industry  posted revenues of  5 13 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 38   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 30 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Nucor shares have lost about 12 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 4  
What s Next for Nucor 
While Nucor has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Nucor was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 72 on  5 29 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 01 on  22 16 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

What s Next for Nucor 
While Nucor has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

171883,393399,NUE,Near Term Outlook Appears Bleak For Steel Producers  Stocks,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of producers of a wide range of steel products for a number of end use industries including automotive  construction  appliance  container  industrial machinery  transportation  and oil and gas  These products include hot rolled and cold rolled coils and sheets  hot dipped and galvanized coils and sheets  reinforcing bars  billets  wire rods  strip mill plates  standard and line pipe  and mechanical tubing products Here are the industry s three major themes Waning steel demand poses problems for steel producers  A slowing Chinese economy amid lingering trade conflict with the United States has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  The trade war has taken a huge toll on China as reflected by its tepid economic indicators  Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and falling car sales have clouded steel the demand outlook  The industry continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  exacerbated by continued growth in production in China  Notwithstanding the U S  China trade tensions  China s steel mills continue to crank up output  A glut of cheap Chinese steel has put downward pressure on both Chinese and global steel prices  China s steel overcapacity remains an overhang for the industry  The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied last year  drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers  Improved capacity also provided a boost to U S  steel production  However  higher production  partly driven by restarted mills  has contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year  In fact  after rallying to multi year highs on the back of the Trump administration s imposition of tariffs  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement  Sliding steel prices  softening demand across major domestic end markets and trade tensions have weighed on U S  steel producers this year  While some of these producers have recently taken steps to reduce capacity in the wake of declining domestic steel prices  the move is not expected to result in a significant recovery in prices anytime soon given the oversupply in the market and weak domestic steel demand Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  172  which places it at the bottom 33  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates a gloomy near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group s earnings growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 61 1  Before we present a few steel producers stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and current valuation Industry Lags S P 500   SectorThe Zacks Steel Producers industry has lagged both the Zacks S P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector over the past year The industry has declined 36 5  over this period compared with the S P 500 s

industry remains hamstrung by sustained overcapacity  driven by continued growth in Chinese production  Sino U S  trade tensions also pose as headwinds to the industry  A weakening Chinese economy

171895,393411,NUE,Trump  Buy American  edict may have little impact on U S  steel,news,"By Nick Carey and Luciana Lopez
DETROIT NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump s  Buy American  Hire American  executive order on Tuesday left questions about how the government would enforce the order and whether it would make a real difference in output and employment  according to steel executives and analysts 
 Buy American  provisions already exist in U S  law but policing them has been difficult because of waivers granted to foreign companies that undercut their U S  counterparts on pricing  Earlier on Tuesday  Trump ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring American companies to see if they are actually benefiting  especially the U S  steel industry 
Trump s executive order promises to properly police those provisions  but avoided detail about how that will happen 
Bill Hickey  president of Chicago based Lapham Hickey Steel  which has seven steel mills in the Midwest and Northeast  said he has heard talk of  Buy American  for decades  but American or foreign contractors frequently find loopholes to use imported steel 
 Politicians all talk the same  but at the end of the day it just doesn t work   Hickey said  citing waivers to existing provisions 
Charles Bradford of Bradford Research said focusing on  Buy American  for U S  steel does not take into account that some steel products   including tin plate and semi finished products   are not made in the United States  So if enforced improperly  it could cause supply problems in a U S  market in which up to 25 percent of steel was imported in the first quarter of this year 
 The people who have pushed for this don t have a clue and they don t know math   said Bradford 
Cutting off the supply of goods not made in the United States would create fresh problems for U S  companies  he said 
In the construction industry  there also are concerns over  too strict a definition of what constitutes U S  made steel products   said Kenneth Simonson  chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America 
Simonson cited concerns with steel that might have been melted down from scrap metal that could have come from outside the United States  for example  and tracing its origins before that point 
Trump s White House track record so far also helps fuel skepticism inside the industry 
Instead of bold action promised last year by then candidate Trump on the North American Free Trade Agreement  on China  and free trade agreements  the new administration has  not shown much evidence of doing so   said KeyBanc Capital Markets steel analyst Philip Gibbs 
 I m a lot less optimistic than I was three and a half months ago because so far what I ve seen coming out of the Trump administration is the same as the prior administration   he added 
As a result  Gibbs said investors should dial back expectations that Trump will do anything meaningful on trade  or on infrastructure which is where such an order could make a difference 
Investors seemed to shrug off Tuesday s executive order 
 Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE  shares closed up 0 2 percent at  57 33  AK Steel Holding Corp gained a penny to end at  6 32 and United States Steel Corp closed down 0 5 percent at  28 73 
AK Steel did not respond to requests for comment  Nucor and U S  Steel both welcomed the president s executive order 
The move was welcomed by labor unions  The United Steelworkers said that under current practice   contractors often try to avoid the law through loopholes to buy cheap and often substandard foreign products like many from China  
Thomas Gibson  chief executive of lobby group the American Iron and Steel Institute  said in a statement that  Buy American  provisions  are vital to the health of the domestic steel industry  and have helped create manufacturing jobs and build American infrastructure  

Veteran steel industry analyst Michelle Applebaum said while it remains to be seen how thoroughly the Trump administration will police the steel industry  the executive order sends a clear message to steel importers   Trump has just created more risk for anyone who wants to import steel   she said   If he puts money behind enforcement that will force people to play by the rules and that will be a good thing  ",2017-04-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-'buy-american'-edict-may-have-little-impact-on-u.s.-steel-475198,475198

171904,393420,NUE,Trump Tariffs Help Sink U S  Steel ,opinion,"US Steel wanted Trump to put tariffs on Chinese steel imports  The company is not at all pleased with the results 
Big Win 

Investigating the Big Win
Bloomberg reports Trump s Tariff Twist Cost U S  Steel  5 5 Billion 
President Donald Trump s tariffs on foreign steel have sped the decline of some of the U S  mills he vowed to help 
Exuberance over the levies dramatically boosted U S  output just as the global economy was cooling  undercutting demand  That dropped prices  creating a stark divide between companies like Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE   that use cheaper to run electric arc furnaces to recycle scrap into steel products  and those including U S  Steel Corp   with more costly legacy blast furnaces 
Since Trump announced the tariffs 16 months ago  U S  Steel has lost almost 70  of its market value  or  5 5 billion  and idled two American furnaces in mid June that couldn t be run profitably at the lowest prices since 2016  Meanwhile  Nucor  down around 20   has touted  2 5 billion in expansion projects 
Last July  Trump stood on a makeshift stage at a U S  Steel mill in Granite City  Illinois  and beamed as workers cheered the tariffs  At that point  the company had already restarted one of two blast furnaces at Granite City  and vowed the second would soon be brought online 

 Workers are back on the job  and we re once again pouring new American steel into the spine of our country   Trump said during the hour long program   U S  Steel is back  
 Less efficient capacity should go away  but there is no guarantee that it permanently goes away   Bank of America s Tanners said   It probably doesn t go down without a fight  

Dumping Nonsense
The US Steel debacle shows just how ludicrous the  China is dumping steel  meme really is 
The fact of the matter is US steel cannot compete 
The irony is US Steel cannot even compete with the tariffs that it wanted 
Meanwhile  chalk up another tariff  win  for the president

171905,393421,NUE,Earnings Preview  Nucor  NUE  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Nucor  NUE  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This steel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 27 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  38 6  
Revenues are expected to be  6 16 billion  down 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 61  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nucor 
For Nucor  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nucor will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nucor would post earnings of  1 50 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 55  delivering a surprise of  3 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nucor doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-nucor-nue-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200438979,200438979

171911,393427,NUE,Trump s NAFTA revamp would require concessions  may borrow from TPP,news,"By David Lawder WASHINGTON  Reuters    President elect Donald Trump s plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  to make it  a lot better  for U S  workers would not be a one way street for his administration  as Canada and Mexico prepare their own list of demands that could require difficult U S  concessions  The 22 year old NAFTA and other trade deals became lightning rods for voter anger in the U S  industrial heartland states that swept Trump to power this month   Trump    who on Monday vowed to file notice of his intent to quit an Asia Pacific trade deal on his first day in office    has pledged to leave NAFTA if it can t be improved to his liking  But he has said little about what improvements he wants  apart from halting the migration of U S  factories and jobs to Mexico  Trade experts  academics and government officials say Canada and Mexico would also seek tough concessions and that NAFTA s zero tariff rate would be extremely difficult to alter  And any renegotiation would likely take several years   In a renegotiation  one side can come in with requests  but the other side is going to expect concessions   said Wendy Cutler  a former deputy U S  Trade Representative  USTR    We need to know what we re going to ask for and what we can give   When Cutler helped renegotiate a stalled trade deal with South Korea in 2010  USTR won concessions for U S  automakers  but at the expense of a longer phase out on steep Korean pork tariffs and allowing Korea to largely maintain a health care reimbursement system that favors domestic generic drugmakers  Trump  who during the campaign called NAFTA the  worst trade deal ever  and threatened to levy a 35 percent tariff on Mexican assembled autos and other goods  would have a hard time raising U S  tariffs without scrapping the agreement  trade experts say   There is no precedent in free trade negotiations for one side raising tariffs more than the other   said Chad Bown  a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington   If U S  workers are more expensive than Mexican workers  the only way to level the playing field is to do things that raise costs in Mexico   Bown said   Negotiating stronger environmental and labor protections would be one way of doing this  as it would increase manufacturing costs in a lower income country like Mexico  The Trump transition leader for trade  Dan Dimicco  declined Reuters  requests for comment  DiMicco  who is under consideration to be Trump s top trade negotiator  is a former chief executive of steel giant  Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE   who has long fought for protections against unfairly traded imports  In a YouTube video message published on Monday  Trump vowed to quit the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP   a proposed 12 country Pacific rim trade bloc  Although the TPP terms were settled more than a year ago  the pact was never taken up by U S  Republican leaders in Congress due in part to anti free trade rhetoric in the presidential campaign      Calling it a  a potential disaster for our country   Trump said his administration would instead negotiate  fair  bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores    His comments would appear to snuff out any hopes among other TPP countries that the pact championed by President Barack Obama could be revived under the new administration  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said at a Pacific Rim summit on Saturday that he would be willing to discuss NAFTA with Trump to  modernize  the treaty    but not renegotiate existing provisions  He said that modernization could include adding environmental  labor and other provisions that weren t contemplated when NAFTA was being negotiated in the early 1990s  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  who met with Pena Nieto on the APEC sidelines  said he was  keeping our options open  on trade discussions with the U S  president elect   But if NAFTA is reopened  Canada will insist that any renegotiation bring an end to a decades old dispute over Canadian exports of softwood lumber  said David MacNaughton  Canada s ambassador to the United States  U S  producers claim the Canadian wood is unfairly subsidized because it comes from federal lands and have threatened to seek billions of dollars in tariffs  which Canadian officials say would make a  mockery  of free trade  For Mexico s part  any concessions that would favor U S  industrial goods could be met with demands to increase U S  import quotas for Mexican sugar and protections for Mexico s potato crop  And both Mexico and Canada would likely demand greater access to compete for U S  public

Since NAFTA was enacted  total U S  trade with Canada and Mexico has quadrupled to  1 3 trillion a year  but the U S  combined goods trade deficit with Canada and Mexico has grown from  9 1 billion in

it has led to the loss of some 850 000 U S  manufacturing jobs  while proponents such as the U S  Chamber of Commerce claim the trade growth has added a net 5 million jobs in the United States   The non partisan Congressional Research Service concluded that NAFTA has had only a small positive effect on U S  growth  but has helped U S  manufacturers become more competitive due to more efficient supply chains   A renegotiated NAFTA could  ironically  end up borrowing key elements from the TPP to stiffen provisions on environment  labor and digital economy standards  trade experts said  Mexico

171913,393429,NUE,Former Trump trade adviser  Border adjustment tax could go a long way toward improving NAFTA,news,"President Donald Trump s former senior trade adviser told Business Insider the border adjustment tax proposal being discussed in Washington could help solve what he believes are major issues with the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Dan DiMicco  the former  Nucor   NYSE NUE  CEO and Coalition for a Prosperous America board member who ran Trump s trade transition team  said a border adjustment tax plan on imports from Mexico could help balance the Mexican value added tax on exports into the country 
Trump has previously chided the trade situation  saying in a September debate   When we sell into Mexico  there s a tax      When they sell into us  there s no tax  It s a defective agreement  
Mexico has a 16  value added tax American companies must pay on exports in Mexico  and there is no corresponding tax on Mexican companies importing into the US  However  Mexican companies have to pay the same tax on products sold within the country 
Trump and DiMicco s viewpoint is  by Peter Navarro  the head of the newly formed White House National Trade Council  and Wilbur Ross  Trump s nominee to lead the Commerce Department  The proposal has been shot down by economic experts who say it s a  of how the VAT system works 
Additionally  the border adjustment tax on imports would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher costs at the point of purchase of imported goods to help offset losses 
DiMicco outlined other issues he saw with NAFTA  many of which were related to  exorbitant  Mexican duties 
But what about Canada 
During a recent meeting at the White House between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  the pair of leaders answered questions related to NAFTA and Trump s promises to renegotiate the deal 
Asked about the Canadian end of the agreement  Trump  effect on US Canada trade relations is  a much less severe situation than what s taken place on the southern border  
DiMicco concurred with Trump  saying Mexico  has got a lot more issues than Canada has  
 But they both have some issues   he said 
While campaigning and in public statements following his electoral victory  Trump promised a renegotiation of the trade agreement within his first 100 days in office  However  under the Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority  Trump missed the deadline to give notice to Congress to be able to start a renegotiation within that timeframe   the renegotiation within the first 100 days of his administration  Trump had to give Congress notice by January 31 
DiMicco  who said he still informally advises the administration  said the delaying the confirmations of Trump s cabinet   particularly as it relates to Ross and Robert Lighthizer  Trump s choice for US trade representative   has made it increasingly difficult to  get the current details  on Trump s trade agenda 
 Yeah  so nobody is willing to talk   DiMicco said was a result of the delayed confirmations   You can t get the current details because the Democrats have held up the whole damn process  ",2017-02-23,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/former-trump-trade-adviser:-border-adjustment-tax-could-go-a-long-way-toward-improving-nafta-461726,461726
171934,393450,NUE,Nucor  NUE  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Nucor  NUE  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This steel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 2  
Revenues are expected to be  6 03 billion  up 8 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 71  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nucor 
For Nucor  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nucor will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nucor would post earnings of  1 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 07  delivering a surprise of  7 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nucor doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nucor-nue-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200407237,200407237

171936,393452,NUE,Steel Producers Industry Outlook  China Dampens Prospects ,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of producers of a wide range of steel products for a number of end use industries including automotive  construction  appliance  container  industrial machinery  transportation  and oil and gas  These products include hot rolled and cold rolled coils and sheets  hot dipped and galvanized coils and sheets  reinforcing bars  billets  wire rods  strip mill plates  standard and line pipe  and mechanical tubing products Here are the industry s three major themes The industry continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  exacerbated by a surge in production in China  Notwithstanding the U S  China trade tensions  China s steel mills have been beefing up output to take advantage of healthy profit margins  A glut of cheap Chinese steel driven by the ramp up in output amid weak domestic demand has put downward pressure on both Chinese and global steel prices  China s output is expected to go up in the coming months as Beijing has lifted production restriction  aimed at curbing pollution during the winter months  across most cities  This may put further pressure on steel prices  The industry faces risks emanating from trade tensions and economic cooling in China  the world s top consumer of steel  The trade war has taken a huge toll on China as reflected by its tepid economic indicators  A slowdown in steel demand in that country amid sluggish economic conditions pose problems for steel producers  Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and falling car sales have clouded steel demand outlook  The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied last year  has provided a reprieve to U S  steel producers  which long struggled to cope with a tide of subsidized foreign imports  The tariffs are driving production capacity of U S  steel producers amid declining imports  Leveraging strong cash flows  a number of U S  steel producers are investing heavily to beef up production capabilities and upgrade facilities  The tariffs have also provided a boost to U S  steel prices  giving American steel makers more pricing power  This has also provided margin benefits to U S  steel producers  Although U S  steel prices tracked downward in the back half of 2018 on concerns over a slowdown in steel demand in China  prices rebounded in February 2019 and have remained stable since then  While there are still uncertainties surrounding the tariffs including exemptions of countries  they should provide further boost to U S  steel producers over the near term Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks  Sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  199  which places it at the bottom 22  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group s earnings growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 39 1  Before we present a few steel producers stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and current valuation Industry Lags Sector and S P 500The Zacks Steel Producers industry has lagged both the Zacks S P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector over the past year The industry has declined 29 1  over this period compared with the S P 500 s rise of 10 8  and broader sector s decline of 10 1  One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing steel stocks  the industry is currently trading at 5 91X  below the S P 500 s 11 13X and the sector s 7 65X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 10 02X  as low as 5 38X and at the median of 7 90X  as the chart below shows Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Bottom LineThe steel producers industry remains hamstrung by sustained overcapacity  driven by a surge in Chinese production  Trade tensions between the United States and China also pose as headwinds to the industry  A weakening Chinese economy amid trade war has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China Nevertheless  trade tariffs have injected a new lease of life into U S  steel producers  The punitive tariffs are bearing fruit as reflected by a decline in U S  steel imports  The tariffs should provide more protection to these producers going forward Here  we present two stocks carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that are well positioned to gain amid the prevailing challenges  There are also a

With little data on the calendar  investors looked ahead Federal Reserve s  Fed  policy decision on Wednesday 
The Fed is not expected to make a move on interest rates at the conclusion of its two day policy meeting at 2 00PM ET  18 00GMT   but investors will first focus on the statement and updated forecasts for economic growth and interest rates that will be released simultaneously with the rate decision for an initial gauge on when the central bank contemplates returning to policy normalization 
Fed chair Janet Yellen will then hold what will be a closely watched press conference 30 minutes after the release as investors look for any change in tone about the economy or future rate hikes

Ahead of the Fed decision on that same Wednesday  the Bank of Japan  BoJ  is set to release its own rate decision and monetary policy statement  followed by a press conference with governor Haruhiko Kuroda

However  Barkindo did indicate that OPEC members may call an extraordinary meeting to discuss oil prices if they reach consensus at the informal gathering 
Bullish sentiment was also fueled by reports of fighting around Libyan oil ports

171957,393473,NUE,Is Nucor  NUE  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nucor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 79  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 09  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Nucor s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 82  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Nucor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 05  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nucor has a P S ratio of about 0 74  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 30 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  NUE is near the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nucor currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Nucor a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Nucor came in at 0 84  which is a bit lower than the industry average of 1 16  Clearly  Nucor is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Nucor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives NUE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to two upward revision  while the full year estimate has seen four down and two up in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 12 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNucor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 29  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Steel Producers industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you

171969,393485,NUE,US STOCKS Dow  S P slip on consumer spending concerns  oil,news,"  Higher savings rate raises consumer spending worries
   Palm shares jump 16 percent  says Pre demand strong
   Dow off 0 7 pct  S P off 0 5 pct  Nasdaq up 0 1 pct
 Updates to mid afternoon  changes byline 
 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK  June 26  Reuters    The Dow and the S P 500
fell on Friday as a jump in the savings rate indicated that
the debt burdened consumer may not drive the economy out of
recession as fast as hoped  and a slide in crude futures
prompted investors to sell some energy shares 
 Nasdaq was up slightly  helped partly by gains in Palm
Inc  after it posted a narrower than expected loss Thursday
and said demand was strong for its new Pre smartphone  Palm
shares jumped nearly 16 percent to  16 35 
 Data showed that while consumer spending and income both
rose in May as the government stimulus spread through the
economy  much of the money was being stored away  Savings
jumped to a record annual rate of  768 8 billion  the highest
level since record keeping began in 1959 
  The consumer is not going to completely hibernate
although the consumer is not going to be the same force  as
was the case when  coming out of the previous recession   said
Henry Smith  chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co in
Philadelphia   Ultimately  this expansion will be
characterized as a below  average  slower expansion 
  I don t think it is going to be any surprise that savings
have to come up  that the consumer has to deleverage   Smith
added   This is not a short term phenomenon  This is going to
play out over several years  
 Energy shares weighed as oil futures fell below  70 a
barrel after oil producer Nigeria said it would halt a battle
with rebels during a two month amnesty 
 However  some early cyclical stocks outperformed the
market as investors continue to bank on an economic recovery
further out toward the end of this year or earlier next year 
U S Steel Corp rose 2 6 percent to  36 93 and Nucor Corp rose
1 8 percent to  45 51 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 56 61 points  or
0 67 percent  to 8 415 79  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
fell 4 38 points  or 0 48 percent  to 915 88  The Nasdaq
Composite Index gained 2 12 points  or 0 12 percent  to
1 831 66 
 Boosted by Palm  other smartphone makers  shares also
rose  including Apple Inc  up 1 6 percent at  142 08  and
Research In Motion Ltd  up 2 percent at  70 70 
 Weighing down the Dow industrials were energy bellwethers
Chevron Corp  down 1 4 percent at  65 96  and Exxon Mobil
Corp  off 1 4 percent at  68 94 
 Analysts noted stocks were buffeted by profit taking after
Thursday s 2 percent gain  as well as by end of quarter
 window dressing   This can add volatility as portfolio
managers sell stocks with big losses and buy some of the
quarter s best performing issues to help improve their
returns 
 The broad S P had rallied as much as 40 percent from
March s 12 1 2 year closing low  but the run up has stalled as
initial optimism about a stabilizing economy was tempered by
worries the recovery could be tepid  The index is up 35 4
percent from the March trough

171970,393486,NUE,Steel group urges Kirk  Locke press China on yuan,news,"WASHINGTON  Oct 26  Reuters    U S  steel companies on
Monday urged U S  Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke to press China in talks this week to raise
the value of its currency 
  The Chinese government s ongoing currency interventions to
keep the RMB significantly undervalued versus the dollar
threaten the fragile U S  recovery and constitute an unfair
practice in international trade   the American Iron and Steel
Institute said in a letter to the Cabinet officials 
 The group s members include U S  Steel   Nucor 
and ArcelorMittal Flat Americas  
 Kirk and Locke are the U S  co chairs of the U S  China
Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade  which is led on the
Chinese side by Vice Premier Wang Qishan  The meeting is set
for Wednesday and Thursday in Hangzhou 
 Many U S  manufacturers believe Beijing keeps its currency 
the yuan  undervalued against the dollar to give Chinese
exporters an unfair advantage in international trade 
 The steel group also complained about Chinese government
subsidies it said have allowed China to increase its share of
the U S  trade deficit even though overall trade is down this
year because of the global financial crisis 
 The yuan  also known as the renminbi   
rose 21 percent against the dollar from 2005 to July 2008 but
has budged little since then 
 President Barack Obama complained loudly about China s
currency practices during last year s campaign  but he has
taken a softer approach since taking office 
 In a  semi annual report this month  Obama s Treasury
Department said China s yuan was  undervalued  
 But it continued the practice of former President George W 
Bush of not labeling China a currency manipulator    a
designation that could trigger negotiations leading to possible
trade sanctions against an offender 
 U S  trade officials  speaking on condition they not be
identified  declined to say last week whether Kirk and Locke
would raise China s exchange rate policies this week 
 But  obviously  currency is part and parcel of our overall
economic relationship with China   a USTR official said 
 Locke  during a trip to China in July  said the United
States wanted Beijing to move to a  freer floating exchange
rate

 TOKYO  June 16  Reuters    Tokyo stocks fell 1 5 percent 
joining other equity markets in tumbling on escalating Greek
debt woes and disappointing U S  data  but support of 9 400 that
has mainly been in place since April looked set to hold as
valuations are seen as attractive 	
 Selling accelerated in thin afternoon trade as gold prices
weakened and U S  stock futures fell  with commodity trading
advisors cited as leading the decline 	
  Euro zone ministers failed on Tuesday to reach agreement on
how private holders of Greek debt should share the costs of a
new bailout  Uncertainty over a second rescue for Athens and
fears of contagion pushed the bond yields of Greece  Ireland and
Portugal to euro lifetime highs  	
 Adding to investor unease  Moody s threatened large French
banks with possible downgrades 	
 But analysts said the Nikkei will stick within its
well trodden post quake range and losses will likely be limited
to the 9 400 line  as Japan stocks  which have shed 9 percent
since the March 11 quake  have broadly underperformed other
markets 	
  We have got used to fairly disappointing data from the
U S   so I think today s fall is mostly prompted mostly by euro
zone problems   said Takashi Ohba  a senior strategist at Okasan
Securities 	
 In afternoon trade  Nikkei average was down 1 5
percent at 9 433 61  The broader Topix shed 1 3 percent
to 814 36 	
  Commodity trading advisors seemed to be selling on weakness
in U S  futures   said Hiroyuki Fukunaga  chief executive and
technical analyst at Investrust  adding that further support for
the Nikkei lay at 9 380 if 9 400 was broken 	
 The Nikkei has traded mainly between 9 400 and
9 800 since April and analysts expect that range to hold for the
next few weeks  saying Tokyo shares look attractive  trading
roughly at book value compared with around 2 1 times book value
for the S P 500  	
 Foreign investors placed basket buy orders  two traders
said  with European funds seen purchasing 3 billion yen in about
20 small cap stocks  while Asian players bought some 30 blue
chip names for the total of 12 billion yen 	
 In contrast  domestic investors were spotted offloading some
10 billion yen in blue chip shares 	
 
 STEELMAKERS CHARGE HIGHER	
 Resource related shares underperformed after oil slid more
than 4 percent on Wednesday as signs of further economic
weakness fed demand worries and a rising dollar weighed  sending
U S  crude to its lowest since February  	
 Inpex Corp   Japan s biggest oil and gas developer 
shed 2 9 percent to 570 000 yen  while Mitsubishi Corp  
Japan s largest commodities trader  dropped 2 9 percent to 1 935
yen 	
 Tokyo Electric Power Co and other power companies
stopped rising  having gained over two straight sessions  with
analysts saying the government s acceptance of the scheme to
help Tepco compensate those affected by the crisis at its
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant has been fully priced in 	
 Tokyo Electric was down 1 5 percent at 324 yen  while Chubu
Electric shed 1 2 percent to 1 288 yen 	
 Takeda Pharmaceutical declined 2 0 percent to 3 635
yen after U S  drug regulators said that its Actos diabetes drug
can increase the risk of bladder cancer if used for more than a
year  	
 But steelmakers charged higher  making the iron   steel
subindex the biggest gainer on the main board  with
traders citing a bullish Nomura report on steel demand after
U S  steelmaker Nucor said it expects second quarter earnings to
jump  	
 JFE Holdings rose 2 7 percent to 2 024 yen and
Nippon Steel gained 1 3 percent to 240 yen

171972,393488,NUE, Russian Trade Deal May Not Go Over Well With US Steel  Sources,news,"By    The U S  steel industry is considering challenging a trade deal with Russia that governs imports of hot rolled steel  potentially reviving a decades old dispute amid mounting tensions over Russia s actions in Ukraine  two sources said 
A so called suspension agreement struck after the Cold War has sheltered Russian steelmakers from steep anti dumping duties on hot rolled coil  instead setting a cap on HRC imports and a minimum price that many in the U S  industry believe is too low even after a 2012 revision 
An industry source familiar with the situation said steel companies were looking at urging the U S  administration to drop or adjust those exemptions 
Imports of hot rolled  flat rolled  carbon quality steel products from Russia rose 162 percent in the three months through April  compared with the previous three month period 
 Given the volume of imports coming in  the industry is actively exploring its options to terminate or modify the agreement   an attorney familiar with the Russian case said 
 We are in the process of preparing a filing for the U S  government  
The discussions come at a sensitive time for U S  relations with Moscow  following Washington s decision to impose travel bans and asset freezes on dozens of Russian officials after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine 
The move also reflects concerns about weak global prices  oversupply and sluggish demand for hot rolled steel  which is used in appliances and autos 
Overcapacity has already sparked other trade disputes  including a high profile U S  case over imports of steel tubes used by the oil and gas industry 
Even so  the news will likely rattle traders already worried about the impact of escalating tensions over Ukraine on steel trade flows  Russia is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of HRC 
If the deal is revised or canceled  domestic companies such as United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  and possibly also AK Steel  NYSE AKS could benefit 
If the agreement dating from 1999 is ditched  Russia s Severstal would be hit with anti dumping duties of 73 59 percent and other Russian producers  such as Novolipetsk Steel and Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works  would face duties of 184 56 percent 
The original deal was agreed as the United States moved to stem a flood of Russian steel imports after the Cold War ended It can be terminated with 60 days notice  or modified by negotiation  Duties would apply immediately upon termination 
While it is unclear if there will be a challenge  the discussions come just two years after the countries renegotiated terms with substantially higher price floors to prevent Russian steel being sold below cost  or dumped  in the U S  market  an official at the Commerce Department said 
 The Department currently has no plans to further amend or revoke this remedy   the official said 
Under the agreement  reference prices for Russian hot rolled steel products for the current quarter range from  554 61 per tonne to  709 90 per tonne 
The United States also has suspension agreements in place on imports of Russian uranium and carbon steel plate ",2014-06-17,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/russian-trade-deal-may-not-go-over-well-with-us-steel:-sources-290226,290226

171974,393490,NUE,Exclusive  Senator preparing new push against currency cheats in trade,news,"By Krista Hughes WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  lawmakers are preparing a new push to stop trading partners unfairly manipulating their currencies to gain an export advantage  a senior Democrat said on Thursday  Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow said she was working with colleagues from both parties on a possible standalone bill to stop currency cheats and also aimed to ensure that an ambitious Pacific trade pact includes strict currency rules   We are talking about the right time to introduce a bill   Stabenow said in an interview with Reuters   Our message is that we should not agree to any trade agreement that does not have strong currency enforcement   The planned push is a further complication for U S  officials already fighting opposition to fast tracking trade deals through Congress and worries about the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP    The TPP deal covers 12 countries representing 40 percent of the world economy  including Japan  whose yen currency has weakened due to the country s economic stimulus measures  Fresh demands from Congress would come at a delicate time for the TPP  which officials hope to wrap up within months after nearly five years of discussions  But U S  auto makers fear increased competition from Japan  and the American Automotive Policy Council  which represents Chrysler  Ford and General Motors   all based in Michigan   has said it will oppose a deal without strong currency rules  Democrat Sherrod Brown  who has introduced similar legislation in the past  is coordinating bipartisan work on a bill in the Senate and House lawmakers have also been consulted  Brown has championed U S  steel producers such as Nucor Corporation and AK Steel Corporation in trade cases against China  which companies also accuse of currency manipulation  Republican Pat Tiberi  who chairs the trade subcommittee of the House Committee on Ways and Means  said the possibility of a separate bill was still under discussion but the issue had traction from both parties  More than half the lawmakers in the last Congress signed letters calling for tough TPP currency provisions  including 199 current House members and 50 current Senators   I think there s bipartisan concern about currency manipulation   Tiberi said  although one had to balance the risk that including such rules would upset TPP partners  A Mexican official familiar with the negotiations said it looked too late to include a currency measure in the pact   But another senior TPP country official said a currency clause might be acceptable if it mimicked existing international covenants  like International Monetary Fund rules committing countries to eschew currency manipulation for competitive advantage    If it is just going be a copy paste of something else it s less serious   he said  Stabenow said lawmakers were still working out how best to push the issue in Congress  including the option of amending planned fast track legislation  which allows Congress to set negotiating goals in exchange for a yes or no vote   
 The push regarding Japan is to make this one of the criteria in the trade agreement and the broader issue is that we would be doing something legislatively that would more broadly impact China and other countries   she said ",2015-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/exclusive:-senator-says-preparing-new-push-against-currency-cheats-in-trade-324715,324715

Further  President Trump s plans for massive infrastructure spending   one of his key campaign promises   will be a catalyst for American steel makers given the expected increase in steel consumption  Notably  Trump s aggressive trade policies are anticipated to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry 
Steel Imports  Threat to National Security   Trump Slaps Tariff
In March  President Trump implemented a tariff of 25  on steel imports and 10  on aluminum imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico  to counter an  assault on the country  by foreign competitors  This is an attempt to reinforce the American steel and aluminum industries  which have long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and suffered significant reduction in production as well as employment 
This was the aftermath of the U S  Department of Commerce s investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 at the behest of the Trump administration  In fact  in January 2018  the investigating authority submitted reports to the President stating that the quantities of steel and aluminum imports  threaten to impair the national security   Notably  U S  steel imports were nearly four times the country s exports  Six basic oxygen furnaces and four electric furnaces have been closed since 2000 and employment has slumped 35  since 1998 
Tariffs a Relief for Steel Industry
The imposition of tariff on imports would improve domestic steel production from its present capacity of 73  to approximately an operating rate of 80    the minimum rate required for the long term viability of the industry  It will also lead to lower imports into the United States  which would in turn  will boost demand for American steel  This will provide the domestic players with more pricing power and help to level the playing field 
According to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers  total and finished steel imports have dipped 3 0  and 1 7   respectively  year over year in the first quarter of 2018  For 2018  annualized total and finished steel imports is projected to decline 8 8  and 7 6  year over year  respectively 
This is a major improvement from the 15  rise noted in total steel imports in 2017  Despite the U S  Department of Commerce s imposition of several duties on additional steel products  imports refused to abate last year due to foreign producers  overcapacity  Moreover  a delay in Section 232 investigation on steel imports by the U S  Department of Commerce also triggered a spike in steel imports in 2017 
Steel Production Expands at Solid Pace
Following an increase of 5 3  in world crude steel output in 2017  the momentum continues in 2018  Per the World Steel Association    WSA   global steel production improved 4 1  to 426 6 metric tons  Mt  on a year over year basis in the first quarter of 2018 propelled by higher output across all regions 
Steel production in Asia was pegged at 294 Mt in the quarter  an increase of 4 6  year over year  North America s crude steel production registered a 1 9  rise to 29 5 Mt in the quarter while the EU produced 43 1 Mt of crude steel  rising 0 9  year over year  China  the world s largest steel maker which accounts for around half of the global production  delivered a 4 5  rise in steel production to 74 Mt during the quarter

Where s the Industry Headed 
The WSA forecasts global steel demand to expand 1 8  in 2018 to 1 616 1 Mt as favorable global economic scenario  commodity prices and perked up investment will drive steel demand in both developed and developing economies  However  deceleration in China and weakened investment momentum due to higher interest rates has led to a weakened projection of 0 7  for 2019  As the China government continues to focus on shifting the growth driver toward consumption  investment is likely to further decelerate 
The outlook for steel demand in the United States is supported by strong demand and investment triggered by rising income and low interest rates  In the Eurozone  broadening recovery across countries  robust domestic demand  resumption in investment as well as pickup in non residential construction and strong manufacturing activities will lead to growth 
Recovery in oil and commodity prices has improved the outlook for the Middle East  Provided geopolitical stability can be achieved  steel demand outlook for the region could further improve driven by reconstruction demand  The mild recovery in Russia and Brazil is anticipated to continue and in other Latin American countries  recovery is underway and growth will likely pick if reforms are implemented 
India is anticipated to act as the next growth engine  given its progressing construction and manufacturing sectors along with rapid urbanization and structural reforms  The Indian economy is stabilizing from the impact of currency reform and GST implementation and steel demand is expected to accelerate gradually  mainly driven by public investment 
However  rising trade tensions  inflationary pressure and tightening of the United States and EU monetary policies may cause market volatilities and trouble highly indebted emerging economies  These factors are likely to dampen the steel industry s momentum  Meanwhile  the automotive and construction industries will continue to be the mainstays of the steel industry 
Some Stocks in Focus

Steel Dynamics  Inc   STLD  can be a solid addition to one s portfolio  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a long term estimated earnings growth rate of 32   Over the past 90 days  its estimates for 2018 and for 2019 have gone up 21  and 12   respectively  The company has an average positive earnings surprise history of 3 15  over the trailing four quarters  You can see

172022,393538,NUE,Here s How The Steel Industry s Getting Hot,opinion,"Steel is utilized in every important industry ranging from energy  construction  automotive and transportation  infrastructure  packaging and machinery  A favorable global economic scenario  commodity prices and perked up investment is expected to buoy steel demand in both developed and developing economies 
Consequently  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry  both in the short and long term  Here  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
The  Trump  Effect
After being in the dumps for a major part of 2016  steel stocks got a big boost following President Trump s win that November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending  The president s call for such spending is expected to lead to an increase in steel demand as it is a key component in many infrastructure products  Trump s  big  spending plans have thus painted a bullish picture for steel companies 
President Trump  on Mar 8  signed proclamations imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a major move to protect the domestic producers of these metals  rebuild the long struggling U S  steel and aluminum industries as well as safeguard American jobs 
Steel Import Drops  Respite to Beleaguered U S  Players
The tariffs are welcome news for American steel makers as it will lead to lower imports into the United States  which would in turn boost demand for American steel  This will provide the domestic players with more pricing power 
Per the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers  total and finished steel imports have dipped 3 0  and 1 7   respectively  in the first three months of 2018 compared with the prior year period  For 2018  annualized total and finished steel imports is projected to decline 8 8  and 7 6   respectively  from the prior year  Finished steel import market share was an estimated 26  in March and is estimated at 25  for the year 
On prospects of higher steel demand as a result of the latest U S  trade measures  United States Steel Corp   X  stated recently that it will restart one of its Granite City Works blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities  The company expects to call back around 500 employees starting this month  Both the blast furnaces of Granite City Works and its steelmaking facilities were idled in December 2015 in response to challenging market conditions  including unfairly traded imports 
Another U S  steel major  Nucor Corp   NUE  also recently announced that it will build a rebar micro mill in Florida  This  240 million investment will be Nucor s second rebar micro mill 
Moreover  the tariffs are anticipated to boost production capacity of domestic steel makers amid lower imports  The U S  Department of Commerce earlier stated that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80  operating rate from its present capacity of 73   This is the minimum rate needed for the long term viability of the industry 
Construction Sector to Remain Key Demand Driver
The homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy  as well as the steel industry  The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel  accounting for almost half of the total consumption  Positives like an improving economy  healthy job growth  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance 
The American Institute of Architects   AIA   anticipates spending in the non residential building sector to advance around 4  in 2018 and continue at that pace of growth through 2019  The recently enacted tax reform as well as Trump s promised infrastructure package will boost demand in the sector  Nucor and Commercial Metals Company  CMC  are the leading steel suppliers to the non residential construction sector 
Over the long haul  as the urban population increases worldwide  the requirement for steel to build skyscrapers and public transportation infrastructure should see an uptrend as well  Emerging economies will continue to be major catalysts  owing to the huge amount of steel needed for urbanization and industrialization  Hence  demand for steel is anticipated to remain robust in the years to come  Companies like United States Steel  ArcelorMittal  MT   Nucor and Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD  would gain from momentum in construction 
Automotive Sector Drives Steel Demand
The automotive sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials  The rising sales trend is anticipated to persist driven by falling fuel prices  low interest rates  enhanced job security  rising wages and household wealth  Moreover  the trend will be backed by improving consumer confidence  residual pent up demand  attractive deals and vehicle launches 
Moreover  the high average age of light vehicles on U S  roads is resulting in large replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers  The auto industry in Asian countries  particularly China and India  are also projected to flourish over the next five to seven years  China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market globally in terms of number of vehicles sold 
With automakers cashing in on strong demand  steel is anticipated to get a proportional boost in the years to come  ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  generate a large portion of their revenues from auto companies  Arcelor Mittal is expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high strength steels   AHSS   
Steady Growth in Developed Economies
Developed economies are expected to witness growth of 1 8  in steel demand in 2018  In the United States  strong demand and investment fueled by high confidence  rising income and low interest rates will drive steel demand  While rising investment is buoying the manufacturing sector  the construction sector looks good on rising housing prices and steady non residential sector growth 
The recent tax reform will also lead to higher investment and consequently boost steel demand  The announced infrastructure plan will be a catalyst for steel demand in the long term  In the EU  broadening recovery across countries  higher investments  pickup in non residential construction and strong manufacturing activities will be catalysts 
Developing Countries to Support Growth
Steel demand in developing economies  excluding China  is expected to increase by 4 9  and 4 5  in 2018 and 2019  respectively  Recovery in oil and commodity prices has led to a revival in steel demand in the Middle East  and if geopolitical stability is achieved  steel demand for the region will be driven by reconstruction activities 
Recovery in Russia will be supported by credit expansion  easing monetary policy and improving consumer and business confidence  In Brazil  recovery of construction activities has been sluggish while in other Latin American countries  recovery is underway and growth is likely to accelerate if reforms are implemented 
The Indian economy is stabilizing from the impact of currency reform and GST implementation last year  India  currently the fourth largest producer of steel in the world  is anticipated to record exponential growth in the future  This will be fueled by increasing urbanization  along with projected growth in the infrastructure  automobile and real estate sectors  The country s comparatively low per capita steel consumption and the anticipated rise in consumption owing to increased infrastructure construction  along with the thriving automobile and railways sectors  offer huge scope for growth

172023,393539,NUE,Will Tariffs On Steel Imports Revive The Steel Industry ,opinion,"The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the United States and emerging markets like India  However  steel stocks are plagued with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector should be wary of in the coming months and years 
Valuation Concerns
Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like steel  the steel pipe and tube and steel specialty have a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 20 2 and 14 3  respectively  higher than the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 11 7  Meanwhile  the steel producers industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 9 2  which compares favorably with the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 11 7  Overall  valuation looks expensive for the steel industry 
Expected Deceleration in China
In 2017  China s government stimulus measures helped lift the construction activity  However  investment continued to decelerate and steel demand showed only a moderate increase despite the boost  In 2018 and 2019  China s GDP growth is expected to decelerate mildly and as the government continues to focus on shifting the growth driver toward consumption  investment is likely to further decelerate 
In 2018  steel demand is likely to remain flat and contract 2 0  in 2019 due to a further slowdown in construction activity  The machinery sector is anticipated to deliver positive growth aided by a strong global economy while automotive and home appliances will decelerate 
Trump s Softening Stance Not a Good Sign
Following the tariff announcement  President Trump softened his stance by excluding Canada and Mexico   two major sources of steel imports to the United States   from the tariff orders  Moreover  the orders have provisions for other countries to apply for exemptions provided their imports do not hurt the U S  economy  leaving some wiggle room for U S  allies to seek concessions 
The President noted that Canada and Mexico represent  a special case   and will continue talks with them to address concerns  The exclusions of these countries are dependent on the outcome of the North American Free Trade Agreement   NAFTA   renegotiation talks that are underway 
Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States  accounting for roughly 16  of total U S  steel imports in 2017  per the U S  Census Bureau data  Mexico is the fourth largest exporter of the metal with around 9  market share  Together these countries represent roughly a quarter of U S  steel imports 
To make the matters more complicated  the Trump administration later added that it would temporarily exempt more countries from steel and aluminum tariffs  according to a proclamation released by the White House  The list includes the European Union  Argentina  Australia  Brazil  Canada  Mexico and South Korea  many of which have been in talks with the United States to win an exemption  However  the administration may impose import quotas on these countries to protect the domestic industries 
The Trump administration s gradually softening tariff stance is bad news for the domestic steel makers  More countries may seek exemptions for steel imports in the future that cannot be made in the United States  This may thwart the administration s efforts to curb the influx of cheaper imports and eventually hurt steel prices 
Risks of Trade Retaliation
Concerns over a full blown international trade war gripped the markets since the declaration of the metal tariffs  The U S  trade actions are likely to trigger a potential backlash from the affected countries and major foreign trade partners  The tariffs risk tit for tat retaliation measures on American exports  consequently hurting the U S  economy 
China imposed new tariffs on 128 US imports worth  3 billion in retaliation to the steel and aluminum tariffs recently  fueling fears of a trade war  While China only accounts for 2  of U S  steel imports  it is the world s biggest producer of steel accounting for around half of the global production  Beijing has been repeatedly accused of dumping excess steel capacity into global markets  Trump has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices  In fact  the President has plans to implement new tariffs on some  60 billion of Chinese imports 
Japan  the sixth largest exporter of steel to the United States  is also currently not on Trump s temporary exemption list  Japan s Minister of Economy  Trade and Industry  Hiroshige Seko earlier said that the United States  move to levy trade tariffs is  extremely regrettable  and could significantly unsettle global trade 
The EU had also threatened to impose tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles and other iconic U S  brands in retaliation to the Trump administration s tariff move  The 28 nation bloc recently published a list of U S  products worth around  3 4 billion on which it plans to impose trade penalties  Brazil  the second largest exporter of steel to the United States  with roughly 13  share of total imports last year  has also pledged to take  all necessary actions  to protect its interests 
Geopolitical Tensions
Performance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues  lower commodity prices associated with China s economic slowdown  and escalating political instability  Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East and Africa continues to have a negative effect  Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand 
Sluggish Momentum of the Auto Sector
In China  the automotive sector is expected to decelerate in 2019  Also  the automotive sector in both the EU and the US is expected to moderate due to saturation effect and rising interest rates 
Other Dampening Factors
An expected monetary tightening in the United States and the EU will lead to deceleration of steel demand growth in 2019  Improving investment sentiment and government stimulus has been beneficial to steel demand in Japan  However  the scope of growth will continue to be limited by structural factors such as an aging population  Further  despite improved consumer sentiment  steel demand growth in South Korea will be constrained by high consumer debts  weakening construction and a depressed shipbuilding sector 
Excess Capacity  Perennial Problem
The biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity  further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth  To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels 
The industry remains highly fragmented compared with other global businesses  However  the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace 
Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization
The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in the last three years  The average capacity utilization in the 2016 and 2017 was around 69  and 66   respectively   The average capacity utilization till March 2018 was around 73 6   an improvement from the 71  in the comparable period last year  Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive and rationalize operations  some major steel companies have resorted to idling steel plants 
Increasing Use of Aluminum in Auto Industry
Currently  steel is the major raw material for the auto industry  the second largest steel consumer  However  major automakers like Ford Motor Co   F   General Motors Company  NYSE GM   GM  and others are becoming increasingly aluminum intensive  given the metal s recyclability and light weight properties  The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is anticipated to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025  Hence  in order to remain competitive  the steel companies will have to come up with better and lighter varieties of steel 
Stocks to Steer Clear
The short term prospects are a bit clouded considering the headwinds plaguing the steel industry globally as discussed above  So  it would be prudent to stay away from steel stocks that carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank now  Particularly  we suggest staying away from Aperam S A   APEMY  which carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and Shiloh Industries  Inc   SHLO  which carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
The estimates for Aperam have declined 8  for fiscal 2018 and 9  for fiscal 2018  Shiloh Industries has witnessed a 13  drop in earnings estimates for fiscal 2018  The company also has a negative average earnings surprise of 43 48  in the trailing four quarters 
However  investors  who can look beyond the near term clouds to the industry s bright long term prospects  may consider buying some steel stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank 
We also recommend stocks such as Steel Dynamics  Inc   STLD   Ternium S A   TX  which sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE   NUE  which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

172056,393572,NUE,Are Trump s Steel And Aluminum Tariffs Good For America ,opinion,"President Donald Trump s proposed tariff on imported steel and aluminum  at 25 percent and 10 percent  is much more than a shot across the bow  Indeed  this could be the official kickoff of the trade war we all anticipated  The protectionist trade policy  announced last week as the president met with metals executives  raised fresh inflation worries and had an immediate impact on capital markets 
As expected  the winners were domestic steelmakers  AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS   the only manufacturer in North America that produces carbon  stainless and electrical steels  rose as much as 9 5 percent Thursday 
AK Steel CEO  praised Trump s decision  saying he fully supports  the actions he plans to take to stem the tide of unfairly traded steel imports that threaten the national security of our country  
Newport wasn t alone   vice president of steel giant Nucor  NYSE NUE   called the tariffs  a clear message to foreign competitors that dumping steel products into our market will no longer be tolerated  
Among the biggest losers from the news were automakers  which account for a little more than a quarter of steel demand in the U S   according to the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   That makes the industry the second largest consumer following construction  Ford  General Motors  NYSE GM  and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  NYSE FCAU  all fell more than 2 percent Thursday  and losses extended into Friday 
Get Ready for Higher Consumer Prices
To be clear  this is a huge deal  with serious inflationary implications  The U S  is the world s largest steel importer  so it s very possible we could see retaliation from multiple trading partners on exports ranging from Florida orange juice to Kentucky bourbon to Wisconsin cheese  It s hard to imagine a scenario where this is not passed on to consumers 
Trump was reportedly advised to exempt select allies  but it appears he s chosen a no exemptions option  Canada  the top supplier of steel and aluminum to the U S   was spared in 2002 when former President George W  Bush imposed tariffs as high as 30 percent on steel 
When a country  USA  is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with  trade wars are good  and easy to win  President Trump The country with which the U S  has the biggest trade deficit is China  In 2017  the deficit stood at  375 billion  which accounts for about 65 percent of the total U S  trade deficit  The tariff on steel and aluminum should have a negligible impact  however  as the U S  imports a relatively small percent of those metals from China 
Gold Has Done Well in Times of High Inflation
As I ve  one of the most prudent ways investors have positioned their portfolios in times of rising inflation is by adding to their gold exposure 
The chart below  courtesy of the  shows that annual gold returns were around 15 percent on average in years when inflation was 3 percent or higher year over year  between 1970 and 2017  In real  or inflation adjusted  terms  returns were closer to 8 percent  This is still higher  though  than average returns in years when inflation was lower 
According to the WGC   gold returns have outpaced the U S  consumer price index  CPI  over the long run  due to its many sources of demand  Gold has not just preserved capital  it has helped it grow  
The most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  shows that consumer prices rose 2 1 percent year over year in January  but as I said earlier real inflation could be grossly understated 
My Journey Through the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
Gold and metals were definitely top of mind last week at BMO Capital Markets Global Metals   Mining Conference  held in sunny Hollywood  Florida  I had the pleasure to be on a panel at the four day event  which was attended by more than 1 500 curious investors and advisors  representing approximately 500 different organizations from 35 countries 
The panel I was on focused on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies  which are reshaping how transactions are made and how companies raise funds across the globe  Startups raised more than  1 5 billion in February  the third straight month for initial coin offerings  ICOs  to generate over  1 billion 
Last year   6 5 billion was raised through ICOs  according to Token Report  and it looks as if that amount will be exceeded in just the first few months of 2018  As I wrote back in October  more and more companies are opting to raise funds through ICOs instead of going public to bypass many of the restrictive rules and costs associated with getting listed on an exchange  And unlike with private equity  smaller retail investors can participate  though I must stress that this is a very speculative trade 
The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   Jay Clayton  strongly agrees with that last point  In December  he issued a statement explaining why he believes certain ICOs should fall under the jurisdiction of federal securities law and  as such  be filed beforehand 
Up until this point  the agency has taken few actions  but it appears it s ready to start getting more aggressive against fraud  The  reported last week that the SEC has issued  dozens  of subpoenas and information requests to cryptocurrency firms and advisors 
You might think this would hurt cryptocurrencies  but the prices of a number of them were up following the news  Bitcoin jumped nearly 6 percent on Thursday  as the token has often been seen as a  safe haven  in the cryptocurrency market 
HIVE Involved in Minting Virgin Coins
As many of you reading this know  U S  Global Investors made a  in September  and as of today  it remains the only publicly listed company that s engaged in the mining of virgin tokens  HIVE and its partner Genesis Mining the world s largest cloud bitcoin mining company are the leading miners and owners of Ether  the  crypto fuel  for the Ethereum network  None of these assets has been used in any transaction  just as a newly minted U S  dollar  hot off the press  has never been used 
I continue to be optimistic about cryptocurrencies and see a very bright future for blockchain technology  The sentiment was similarly good among many of the attendees of last week s conference  It s only just the beginning

	Everyday seems to bring something new for the market to worry about  In just the past few sessions  we ve moved from a  trade war  with China  to the FBI s raid of President Trump s lawyer  and now it s all about Syria 
	The market has been holding up rather well amid all this consternation  it headed into today with gains in 5 of the last 7 sessions  But the major indices took a step back on Wednesday 
	The NASDAQ spent a good amount of time on the positive side as Facebook  NASDAQ FB  again moved forward while CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified for a second day on Capitol Hill  However  it had slipped 0 36  by the end of the day to 7069  Meanwhile  the S P was off 0 55  to 2642 2 and the Dow slipped 0 90  to 24 189 5 
	The main problem today came from President Trump s twitter once again  as he taunted Russia that missiles  will be coming  to Syria in response to that government s alleged chemical weapons attack on citizens over the weekend  As we ve seen with North Korea and China in the recent past  the market isn t a big fan of tough talk from the President  The market chopped in anticipation of bombs falling in Syria  While bombing isn t a huge negative for stocks  Russian involvement is  There has to be some agreement with Russia to take fear out of the marketplace  We will see what happens  but I m hoping to add to current positions before the weekend   said Jeremy in Counterstrike 
	And it didn t help that recently released FOMC minutes sounded rather hawkish to some and left open the possibility for more than just the three expected rate hikes this year 
	The editors can t wait until earnings season  It s expected to be a good one and might put more focus on the economy and the market if only geopolitical and Washington concerns can just cool off for a while  Surprise Trader is especially excited about the season  which is why Dave bought three names on Wednesday that have positive Earnings ESPs and report next week  The editor also took a double digit profit and bought a new holding in Momentum Trader

	  ETrade  ETFC    the online brokerage has beaten for ten straight quarters and is seeing earnings estimates rise for its next report after the bell on Thursday  April 19 
	  Nucor  NYSE NUE    this steel manufacturer is the riskiest play due to the China US trade ruckus  Nevertheless  it beat by 18  last time and the earnings strength is likely to continue when it reports before the bell on Thursday  April 19 
	Check out the full write up for more on all these moves  including the sale of Lamb Weston  LW  for an 8 3  return Technology Innovators  The portfolio swapped out cyber security names on Wednesday  Palo Alto Networks  PANW  was sold after it bought an Israel based security company in what Brian Bolan considers a defensive move designed to ward off any potential takeover overtures  The editor feels that the M A premium that pushed up the stock will be sucked out  Therefore  he decided to sell PANW now and bank a nice return of approximately 25   The new buy is Fortinet  FTNT   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  from the same industry that will be reporting earnings in about a month  Read the full write up for more Momentum Trader  It hasn t even been two months since being added  but Paycom  PAYC  is a big enough winner already that Dave would like to take some profit  He sold half the portfolio s allocation in this cloud based software solutions company on Wednesday and took home a solid return of about 23   Now he ll let the rest of the position run for a while 
	The editor also bought Vistra Energy  VST  today with a 12 5  allocation  He was surprised to see a utility stock make his screen  but this name seems to be breaking out and should continue to move higher in the intermediate term  Plus  rising earnings estimates has made it a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Read the complete commentary for more on these moves Home Run Investor  As he stated in Stocks Under  10 yesterday  Brian Bolan is looking to add more tech names right now  On Wednesday  he picked up ScanSource  SCSC   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  point of purchase tech provider that is pretty close to its 52 week low at  31 40  But the editor thinks the stock is on its way to getting back towards its highs of more than  45  Plus  it has a  wonderful valuation   Read more about it in the complete commentary

172060,393576,NUE,Here s Why Nucor  NUE  Could Be A Great Value Pick,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nucor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Nucor s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Nucor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Nucor stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nucor has a P S ratio of about 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nucor currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Nucor a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Nucor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives NUE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone up by 14 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNucor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 17  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1

172070,393586,NUE,United States Steel Corporation Daily Elliott Wave View,opinion,"United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X  is the second largest steel domestic producer behind Nucor Corporation  NYSE  NYSE NUE  and also the world s 24th largest steel producer 
Last year  Steel price surged higher reaching new all time high of 4772 in December gaining  60  before a correction took place  The price is expected keep rising in the coming years as the demand for steel in critical industries keeps increasing 
The world global steel production growth rate increased by 5 3  which is one of the major factors helping the related companies to continue its growth 

During this month  the United States Steel Corporation stock X price surged 30  breaking above 2017 peak as the move accelerated after the U S  Department of Commerce recommended metal import tariffs for the federal government 
The current Elliott Wave count for the stock is suggesting a  taking place from January 2016 low and it s also showing an incomplete 5 swing bullish sequence from May 2017 low  Both bullish cycles have a target around equal legs area  53   62 and as long as the stock remain above the recent February low  30 9 then it should continue it s move to the upside 
X Daily Chart 2 27 2018
Last year  despite X loosing more than 50  during the correction lower   we expected the stock to remain supported and continue the rally similar to the one from 2016 low as the commodity sector has ended a multi year correction from 2011 peak 
X Weekly Chart 24 6 2018
The current expected move higher in X will be supported by the fact that the  is also sharing the same bullish sequence from 2016 low and both instrument should be rallying together during 2018 before reaching the target higher then ending that cycle  Consequently  investors and trader can still look for buying opportunities in any steel stock like X or NUE in 3   7 or 11 swings ",2018-03-01,Elliott Wave Forecast,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-states-steel-corporation-daily-elliott-wave-view-200295260,200295260

172088,393604,NUE,Headwinds That Might Dent Steel Industry Growth,opinion,"The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the United States and emerging markets like India  However  steel stocks have to struggle with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector should be wary of in the coming months and years 
Valuation Questions
Steel stocks had a roller coaster ride this year  but the industry has been a strong performer since around mid June 2017 and has led the market since then  Year to date  the Zacks Steel industry is up  23  vs  the  18 9  gain for the S P 500 index in that time period 
The industry has historically traded at a discount to the broader market  on most traditional valuation metrics  likely reflecting the deep cyclical nature of its business  On a trailing EV EBITDA multiple basis  a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like steel   the Zacks Steel Industry  the medium level industry classification that includes steel makers as well specialty operators  is currently trading at 5 6X trailing 12 month EBITDA  at a discount to the S P 500 index s 11 7X multiple at present 
Over the last 10 years  the industry has traded as high as 28 1X and as low as 3 9X  with a median of 6 7X  As would be expected with all deep cyclical industries  valuation multiples top out at the bottom of business cycles and peak at the bottom  In other words  the industry is expensive when the multiple is at its low point  As you can see from the above 10 year history for this multiple  which is mirrored by other traditional multiples as well  the current multiple is closer to the bottom than to the top 
In other words  the industry s valuation can t be called cheap by any means  but it isn t stretched or expensive either 
Rise in Cheap Imports in the United States
The continued surge of steel imports in to the United States has hollowed out much of the domestic steel industry  Per the latest figures released by The American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    finished steel imports for the first 10 months of 2017 shot up 19 4  and 15 4  year over year  respectively 
Imports have captured almost 28  of the U S  market  year to date  The largest offshore suppliers were South Korea  Turkey  Japan  Taiwan and Germany  Steel imports had dipped briefly last year due to Commerce Department anti dumping and anti subsidy duties imposed on steel products from China and some other countries 
These cheap imports hurt the margins of American steel players like Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD   United States Steel Corp   X   ArcelorMittal  MT   AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  and Nucor Corp   NUE  
Geopolitical Tensions
Performance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues  lower commodity prices associated with China s economic slowdown  and escalating political instability  Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East and Africa continues to have a negative effect  Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand 
Can the Auto Sector Sustain the Momentum 
The global automotive sector is reporting a strong performance in 2017 with an especially strong performance in Turkey and Mexico  However  in the United States and China the auto sector could moderate and this trend is likely to extend to other countries in 2018 
Excess Capacity  Perennial Problem
The biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity  further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth 
To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and to raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels  The industry remains highly fragmented compared with other global businesses  However  the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace 
Impact of Low Oil Prices
The energy sector  which was once buoyant due to shale discoveries and rising production of crude oil  accounts for 10  of steel consumption in the United States  Steel is necessary to make rigs and transport oil  Steel demand from the energy sector is being impacted as exploration companies have reduced capital expenditure budgets in the wake of tumbling oil prices 
Steel products used by the energy industry are also known as oil country tubular goods  or OCTG   U S  Steel being the biggest supplier of these goods in North America is bearing the brunt of it 
Lower oil prices would urge energy companies to preserve capital to shore up their balance sheets instead of spending money on new exploration  Thus  leading suppliers to the energy sector  such as United States Steel and Tenaris S A  TS   are likely to be under pressure throughout the year 
Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization
The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in the last three years  The average capacity utilization in the 2016 was around 69   The average capacity utilization till October 2017 was around 72 7   Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive and rationalize operations  some major steel companies have resorted to idling steel plants 
Increasing Use of Aluminum in Auto Industry
Currently  steel is the major raw material for the auto industry  the second largest steel consumer  However  major automakers like Ford Motor Co   NYSE F   General Motors Company  NYSE GM   GM  and others are becoming increasingly aluminum intensive  given the metal s recyclability and light weight properties  The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025  Hence  in order to remain competitive  the steel companies will have to come up with better and lighter varieties of steel 
How to Play the Industry
The short term prospects are a bit clouded considering the headwinds plaguing the steel industry globally as discussed above  So  it would be prudent to stay away from steel stocks that carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank now  Particularly  we suggest staying away from stocks such as Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stocks such as Thyssenkrupp AG  DE TKAG   TYEKF  and Universal Stainless   Alloy Products  Inc   USAP  
The estimates for Thyssenkrupp AG have declined 2  for fiscal 2017 and 21  for fiscal 2018  Universal Stainless   Alloy Products has witnessed a 50  drop in earnings estimates for fiscal 2017  The company also has a negative average earnings surprise of 43 14  in the trailing four quarters 
However  investors  who can look beyond the near term clouds to the industry s bright long term prospects  may consider buying some steel stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank 
We also recommend stocks such as POSCO  PKX  and SSAB AB  SSAAY   both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

172112,393628,NUE,Steel Industry Stock Outlook   December 2017,opinion,"Steel is not only the world s most important engineering and construction material  but is also utilized in countless products given the metal s combination of high strength and a relatively low production cost  Consequently  it is considered a crucial element of economic growth Both advanced and developing economies are exhibiting stronger economic momentum this year  which bodes well for the steel industry  Further  President Trump s plans for colossal infrastructure spending   one of his key campaign promises   will be a catalyst for American steel makers as it is likely to have a beneficial effect on the U S  steel industry given the expected increase in steel consumption So it is safe to say a lot of hopes rest on the President  Notably  Trump s aggressive trade policies are also anticipated to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry  Moreover  the industry continues to benefit from the sustained healthy demand in the automobile and construction sectors Steel Production Expands at a Solid PacePer the World Steel Association s   WSA   data available til October 2017  global steel production surged a healthy 5 6  to 1410 metric tons  Mt  on a year over year basis propelled by higher output across all regions  Steel production in Asia was at 975 Mt in 10 month period  an increase of 6 0  year over year  North America s crude steel production registered a 4 1  rise to 96 5 Mt while the EU produced 140 8 Mt of crude steel  rising 3 7  year over year Steel production in the C I S  was at 85 2 Mt  a 0 4  rise year over year  China  the world s largest steel maker which accounts for around half of the global production  delivered a 6 1  rise in steel production during the first 10 months of the year Concerns about China s slowdown had dealt a massive blow to the global steel industry over the last couple years  with overcapacity and lower steel prices denting the margins of Chinese steel producers  Efforts have been undertaken to reduce overcapacity and upgrade production in China s steel industry to negate these factors  
To mitigate the impact of rebalancing  the Chinese government issued a number of mini stimulus measures  This led to a short term boom in infrastructure investment and the housing market  working in favor of the steel industry  Consequently  China s steel demand grew 1 3  in 2016 and the industry continues to witness strong steel demand so far in 2017 The country s steel exports slumped 31  for the first 11 months of 2017  per data released by the General Administration of Customs  Notably  November marks the 15th consecutive month in which Chinese steel exports have registered a yearly decline  Positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China is contributing to a decline in Chinese steel exports Further  China s actions to reduce excess steel supply are also expected to lend support to steel prices in 2017  The world s largest steel producer has pledged to cut steel production capacity by around 50 million Mt in 2017 to tackle pollution and curb excess supply Cheap Imports Continue to Hinder GrowthU S  steel mills remain impacted by depressed capacity utilization and a surge of unfairly traded imports  The domestic market continues to be inundated with cheap imports from overseas producers  especially China  According to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   total and finished steel imports for the first

States Steel Corp   X   AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS   Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD  and ArcelorMittal USA  a part of ArcelorMittal  MT   have been bearing the brunt of high levels of cheap imports  This

172113,393629,NUE,Steel Industry Poised On Automotive  Construction Sectors,opinion,"Steel is utilized in every important industry ranging from energy  construction  automotive and transportation  infrastructure  packaging and machinery  Expectations of increased infrastructure related spending in the United States have fueled steel company stocks to new highs  particularly following the November 2016 election 
There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry  both in the short and long term  Here  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
The  Trump  Card
After being in the dumps for a major part of 2016  steel stocks got a big boost following Trump s win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending in a Trump administration  The president s call for the massive infrastructure spending is likely to have a beneficial effect on the steel industry given the expected increase in steel demand as it is a key component in many infrastructure products  Trump s  big  spending plans have thus painted a bullish picture for steel companies 
Construction Sector Remains a Pillar of Strength
The homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy along with the steel industry  The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel  accounting for almost half of the total consumption  Positives like an improving economy  healthy job growth  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance 
The American Institute of Architects   AIA   anticipates spending in the non residential building sector to advance around 6  in 2017  Nucor Corp   NUE  and Commercial Metals Co   CMC  are the leading steel suppliers to the non residential construction sector 
Over the long haul  as the urban population increases worldwide  the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure should see an uptrend as well  Emerging economies will continue to be major catalysts owing to the huge amount of steel required for urbanization and industrialization  Hence  demand for steel is anticipated to remain strong in the years to come  Companies like United States Steel Corp   X   ArcelorMittal  MT   Nucor Corp  and Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD  would gain from momentum in construction 
Steel to Ride on Demand from Automotive Sector
The automotive sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials  The rising sales trend is anticipated to persist driven by falling fuel prices  low interest rates  enhanced job security  rising wages and household wealth  Moreover  the trend will be backed by improving consumer confidence  residual pent up demand  attractive deals and vehicle launches 
Moreover  the high average age of light vehicles on U S  roads is resulting in large replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers  The auto industry in Asian countries  particularly China and India  are also projected to flourish over the next five to seven years  China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold 
With automakers cashing in on strong demand  steel is anticipated to get a proportional boost in the years to come  ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  generate a large portion of their revenues from auto companies  Arcelor Mittal is expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high strength steels   AHSS   
Indian Steel Sector to Be a Major Driver
India  currently the fourth largest producer of steel in the world  is anticipated to record exponential growth in the future  This will be fueled by increasing urbanization  along with projected growth in the infrastructure  automobile and real estate sectors  The country s comparatively low per capita steel consumption and the anticipated rise in consumption owing to increased infrastructure construction  along with the thriving automobile and railways sectors  offer huge scope for growth 
India had a slowdown in economic activity in 2017  but accelerating government reforms are expected to bring about a better investment environment leading to growth in the coming years 
Steady Growth in Developed Economies
Developed economies are expected to witness a stable recovery momentum  Steel demand in these regions will grow 2 3  in 2017 and 0 9  in 2018  In the EU  steel demand recovery remains on track as concern about tensions within the region particularly over migration policies are receding and the economic recovery is broadening 
In the United States  the economy continues to exhibit robust fundamentals supported by strong consumer spending and rising business confidence  An improving job market and a strong housing sector along with President Trump s infrastructure push will support growth in steel demand 
Developing Countries Benefiting from Economic Reforms
The reform agendas in many developing countries such as Egypt  Brazil  Argentina  Mexico and India are expected to enhance growth potential over time  In the CIS steel demand is expected to strengthen in 2017 2018 and particularly Russia is likely to maintain its slow recovery  Turkish steel demand is anticipated to resume growth momentum in 2018  In Brazil  continuing depressed construction activity has hindered demand recovery in 2017  but a stronger revival is expected in 2018  Steel demand in the developing economies excluding China is expected to grow by 2 8  in 2017 and 4 9  in 2018 
All Eyes on Section 232
One of the major factors that fueled a recovery in the steel sector last year were favorable developments on a number of trade cases that led to a decline in steel imports  U S  steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel  The Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  in April 2017 
The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel  The U S  Department of Commerce has until mid January 2018 to conclude the investigation 
Recently  the U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   issued positive preliminary rulings on imports of corrosion resistant steel   CORE   and certain cold rolled steel flat products into the United States from Vietnam that are made from materials originating in China  The DOC has imposed heavy tariffs on these imports after finding that they have been skirting U S  anti dumping and countervailing duty orders  The ruling marks yet another victory for crisis hit U S  steel companies in their ongoing battle against unfairly traded  subsidized imports that continue to flood the American market 
Recovery in China to Aid the Industry
China s steel demand is expected to increase by 3 0  in 2017  The recent closure of induction furnaces will lead to a one off jump in measured steel use in 2017 to 12 4   China s economy expanded at an annual rate of 6 8  in the third quarter  a tad lower than the 6 9  growth witnessed in the second quarter  The International Monetary Fund   IMF   recently tweaked 2017 GDP growth forecast for China to 6 8  by 0 1   The upward revision reflects the stronger than expected performance in the first half of the year reinforced by previous policy easing and supply side reforms 
China s GDP growth had been caught in a downward trend since 2010 and hit a 26 year lowest with 6 7  last year  If this year s growth even beats 6 7  mark   it would mark the first rebound in seven years 
For 2018  although IMF expects China s growth to somewhat slow to 6 5   it is still 0 1  higher than previously forecast  Per the organization  the Chinese authorities will maintain a sufficiently expansionary policy mix  especially through high public investment  to meet target of doubling real GDP between 2010 and 2020  Furthermore  IMF attributed the global economic growth  particularly Asia s growth  to China s booming economy  It has raised growth prospects for emerging and developing economies by 0 1 percentage point for both 2017 and 2018 backed by a stronger growth projection for China 
Kobe Steel Data Fabrication Issue a Boon to Steel Players
Japan s third largest steel producer  Kobe Steel Ltd   is currently grappling with data fabrication issues  The scandal has strongly dented customers  confidence  who are now taking appropriate measures to check whether product specifications agreed on were met or not 
Per the latest data released by Kobe Steel  the falsified data regarding the product strength and other specifications  is likely to impact as many as 500 of its customers  Products that have come under scanner include steel wires and other steel products  copper products  aluminium  as well as aluminium forging and casting products  Steel wires are increasingly used in car engines and tyres while the aluminium products are used in bullet trains  In addition to the automotive and train manufacturers  the issue has led the company s aircraft manufacturer customers to assess the possible impact on their business 
With questions arising over the quality of steel produced by Kobe Steel  business scope for steel makers in the United States  Brazil and other nations have grown  Adding to the prospects is the declining steel export from China

172154,393670,NUE,Nucor  NUE  Down 9 3  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    Shares have lost about 9 3  in that time frame  underperforming the market 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Nucor s Earnings and Revenues Miss Estimates in Q2Nucor s second quarter 2017 profit came in at  323 million or  1 00 per share  compared to earnings of  243 6 million or  0 76 per share it registered a year ago  Earnings per share for the reported quarter  however  trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 07 Revenues climbed around 22  year over year to  5 174 8 million in the reported quarter  but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 307 8 million Operating StatsTotal steel mills shipments in the second quarter were 6 347 000 tons  up 7  year over year  Total tons shipped to outside customers were up 5  year over year to 6 748 000 tons  Average sales price in the quarter were up 17  year over year Steel mill operating rates rose to 90  in the reported quarter from 89  a year ago Segment HighlightsNucor witnessed decreased profitability in its Steel Mills segment  especially bar mills and sheet mills  in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter  hurt by challenging market conditions for hot rolled sheet products  The performance of plate mills improved on sequential basis The performance of Nucor s Raw Materials segment in the second quarter improved compared with the first due to improved performance of its DRI facilities Nucor also witnessed improved profitability in its downstream products segment on a sequential comparison basis in the second quarter Financial PositionNucor ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around  1 511 million  down roughly 15 2  year over year  Long term debt was  3 240 7 million  down around 25 3  year over year OutlookMoving ahead  Nucor expects earnings in third quarter 2017 to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first half 2017  The company continues to achieve greater penetration of the automotive market and expects to continue this trend for the remaining year  Nucor is also upbeat about improving prospects in the energy markets

172181,393697,NUE,Is Nucor Corporation  NUE  Stock A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nucor Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 66  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Nucor Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point However  the stock s PE compares slightly unfavorably with the Zacks classified Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 59  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Nonetheless  we should point out that Nucor Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 69  so it is fair to say that a slight value oriented path may be ahead for Nucor Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nucor Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 06  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 16 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years NUE is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nucor Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Nucor Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Nucor Corporation is just 1 06  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 88  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  NUE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Nucor Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives NUE a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and three downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 18 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNucor Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 24   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three years  the Zacks Basic Materials  Steel   Producers industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share

172183,393699,NUE,A Rising Tide Lifts All Steel Markets,opinion,"The steel market is doing rather well  particularly in the U S   but an improvement in demand is helping lift earnings in Europe  too 
The phrase  a rising tide lifts all boats  is probably true of steel companies   it is also true to say it doesn t lift all boats equally 
ArcelorMittal  NYSE MT   part way through a major re structuring program to re focus the business on value add growth areas and exit less attractive market segments  is doing rather well judging by both the share price and recent reporting 
The Northwest Indiana Times reported last week that the world s largest steelmaker grew its second quarter profit by 19  to  1 3 billion  lifting its first half profit to  2 3 billion  compared to just  696 million during the same period in 2016  
Demand in the U S    though it has been impacted by imports  the firm claims   was high  as the firm shipped 21 5 million tons of steel in the second quarter  a 2  increase over the first quarter  So far this year  however  its steel shipments in H1 declined by 2 4  to 42 5 million tons compared to the year before 
So  margins are up but volumes are down  North American shipments dropped 3 4  to 5 4 million tons and crude steel production fell 7 3  to 5 8 million tons  the Northwest Indiana Times reports  Yet  with sales prices up 5 7   sales values were up 3 3  to  4 6 billion in North America  leading to much improved profits 
Even United States Steel  NYSE X  is doing better  CEO Dave Burritt said U S  Steel saw  higher prices and volumes in all of our segments   Burritt also said management believes that if the steel market continues going as it is currently  it could earn as much as  1 70 per share this year   adding the caveat that unfortunately it doesn t see the market continuing in the same manner for the rest of the year 
Analysts are questioning whether the present share value is justified  suggesting after falling some 30  already this year it could have further to go 
Analysts such as Citi see major  downside  in 2018 and 2019 to U S  Steel s share price  predicting a loss for the year even though the first half has been relatively  for U S  Steel  strong 
Waning Optimism And What Comes Next
Some steel sector share prices were boosted earlier this year by the hope President Trump would pump billions into infrastructure  Then  as hopes faded for that outcome  they got a sugar rush from the prospect of trade measures to curb imports of foreign steel 
But the Motley Fool  quoting the Wall Street Journal last week  reported comments by the president suggesting he was kicking trade action into the long grass 
Trump said he does not want to impose tariffs and quotas on imported steel  at this moment   Objections from trade partners  who don t want their exports curbed   and from domestic steel users as well  who like the idea of cheap foreign steel  are sapping the administration s support for the trade action  It s hardly surprising  but until recently the steel lobby had been putting a powerful case for action  and it took time for counterarguments to gain traction 
The president went on to say that instead of imposing sanctions  very soon   as the steel industry was hoping  his staff will need to do  statutory studies   addressing the steel dumping  issue  And while the president promised action  fairly soon   he also said the administration plans to address health care reform  tax reform  and may even want to get an infrastructure bill passed by Congress before returning to the steel issue 
So  for the time being  forget about it    he has other fish to fry  seems to be the position 
Without curbs to imports  the view for steel companies  profits remaining robust becomes less compelling 
Companies like Nucor  NYSE NUE  and Arcelor will continue to do well  but others  like U S  Steel and AK Steel  NYSE AKS   will struggle later this year and into 2018 ",2017-08-02,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-rising-tide-lifts-all-steel-markets-200204882,200204882
172184,393700,NUE,Trade Featured As Dollar Drifts Lower,opinion,"The US dollar has a slightly lower bias today  but against most of the major currencies  it is consolidating within the range set at the end of last week  The main exceptions are sterling and the Canadian dollar  They had extended their pre weekend losses yesterday  and are trading within yesterday s range today  The news stream will be light in North America  with no market moving data on tap and no central bank speakers scheduled 
Equity markets are firm  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained about 0 15  to post its second consecutive advance after losing a little more than 0 5  in two sessions before last weekend  The minor gain is impressive given that Japan  Taiwan  Korean and Indian equity prices eased  Stock markets are mostly higher in Europe  but gains are minor  The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is slightly higher  Weakness in consumer names  materials  and real estate offsets gains in energy  utilities  industrials  and financials 
Bond markets are narrowly mixed  Australian and Japanese 10 year benchmarks changed by less than a basis point  New Zealand bonds remain strong  The 10 year yield fell another 6 5 bp to 2 83   The yield has fallen by nearly 20 bp in the past week  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets on Thursday  and many appear to be positioning more dovish rhetoric  European bond yields are little changed  though we note that Italy and Portugal are faring better than Spain  Meanwhile  US Treasury and UK Gilt yields are slightly firmer 
There are few option strikes that may be in play today  The  1 18 strike is on the bubble  There is a large A 2 5 bln option struck at  0 7950 that may influence activity today 
The data theme today is trading  Trade figures from Japan  China  and Germany have been reported  Japan and Germany reported June data  while China reported its balance for July 
Japan reported a JPY934 6 bln current account surplus  It was down from JPY1 653 trillion in May  There are strong seasonal influences in Japan s balance and that current account surplus typically narrows in June from May  However  a key takeaway is that 12 month average is improved to JPY1 697 trillion from JPY1 544 average last June  One of the most important characteristics of Japan s external surplus is that is not so much driven by trade  but by the primary income surplus  interest and dividends generated from overseas portfolio investment  
With the current account  Japan also reports details of its capital account  The highlights include news that Japanese investors turned cool toward Australian debt and sold the most in four years  On the another hand  they continue to buy US Treasuries  JPY1 1 trillion after JPY1 3 trillion in May   Meanwhile  Chinese investors sold JPY2 77 trillion of short term Japanese debt  which is most in over a decade 
China reported a  46 74 bln trade surplus for last month  This is down  1 6 bln from last July  but sequentially  it is the fifth wider surplus in a row  Both imports and exports slowed more than expected  Its 12 month average surplus stands at  37 76 bln vs   48 54 bln for the same year ago period  Exports rose 7 2  year over year after an 11 3  rise in June  Imports rose 11 0  after increasing 17 2  in June 
Some of the highlights include oil imports falling to their lowest level in six months  while iron ore import rose 7 5  in the first seven months of the year  Natural gas imports rose by more than a fifth  Exports to the US rose 8 9  year over year compared with a 19 8  pace in June  Of particular interest  China s steel exports fell by a third from a year ago  and are off nearly 30  in the first seven months of the year  China appears to have shuttered some capacity  while its domestic demand remains elevated due to efforts to upgrade its infrastructure  We note that the improved prices helped lift Nucor  NYSE NUE  profits in H1 to its highest since the recession and US Steel earnings exceeded expectations 
The Chinese yuan continued to strengthen today  The US dollar briefly dipped below CNY6 70 for the first time since last October  In addition to the broad US dollar weakness and news that China s reserves increased in July helping the yuan  the PBOC appears to be stingy in its open market operations  It has simply rolled over seven and 14 day reverse repos today and has failed to inject fresh funds  This has led to a drain of around CNY100 bln from the banking system 
German trade figures round out today s reports  German imports and exports were weaker than expected in June and this coupled with the softer PMI  and industrial output figures warn that the European engine has lost some momentum around mid year  Exports fell 2 8  in June  It is the first decline of 2017 and the most in two years  Imports fell 4 5   It is the largest decline in eight years  However  despite the short term vagaries  the trade balance is stable  The June surplus stood at 22 3 bln euro  up from 22 0 bln in May  Last June  the surplus stood at 24 5 bln euros  The 12 month moving average is 20 4 bln euros  little changed from the 21 0 bln euro average June 2016  The current account surplus  driven by the trade balance  is also remarkably steady ",2017-08-08,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-featured-as-dollar-drifts-lower-200205903,200205903

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Stocks to Buy with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio 

	You can simply arrive at a decision to  Buy  or  Sell  a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision 

	A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged through coverage ratios the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio the Interest Coverage Ratio 

Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense   

Why Interest Coverage Ratio 

	Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt 

	Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision 

	Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest 

	An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations  and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time 

What s the Strategy 

	Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a    of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results 

Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry Median

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median   Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history 

Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median   This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000   A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

VGM Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are seven of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening 

Build A Bear Workshop  Inc    NYSE        which operates as a specialty retailer of plush animals and related products  has a VGM score of  A   Its expected EPS growth rate for 3 5 years is pegged at 22 5   The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

172206,393722,NUE,Sequans Communications  American Eagle  United States Steel  Nucor And VanEck Vectors Steel ETF Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 25  2017   Sequans Communications  NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  American Eagle  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United States Steel  NYSE         Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE   NYSE        and VanEck Vectors Steel ETF  NYSEARCA        

	Here is a synopsis of all four stocks and one ETF 

   

Sequans Communications  NYSE       is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has style scores that may have you thinking twice about this stock  The Growth Style Score is a  D  while the Value Style Score is an  F    which is eerily similar to the grades I used to received when I was in school  I would tell my parents that the D s and F s meant I was  Doing Fine  but they didn t buy it 

	Sometimes I don t buy the style scores  but I always buy what the Zacks Rank is selling  Let s take a look at this stock and figure out why this is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and if it should be something on your radar 

Description

	Sequans Communications is a fabless designer  developer and supplier of 4G semiconductor solutions for wireless broadband applications  Solutions offered by the Company include baseband processor and radio frequency  or RF  transceiver integrated circuits  or ICs  along with signal processing techniques  algorithms and software stacks  Its solutions can be applied in devices like  smartphones  USB dongles  portable routers  embedded wireless modems for laptops  netbooks  tablets  and other consumer multimedia and industrial devices  consumer premises equipment  or CPE  such as residential gateways  and basestations  Sequans Communications S A  is based in Paris  France 

Recent Earnings

	On May 2  the company posted a loss of six cents  but the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for a loss of eight cents  The 2 cent beat was good for a 25  positive earnings surprise  As a result  investors pushed shares higher by more than 13  in the session following the report 

	This was the second beat in the last three quarters and helped drive analysts to decrease the loss per share they expect for this year 

Estimate Movement

	Back in January  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 was calling for a loss of 21 cents  That kicked higher to 20 cents in February and remained at that level through April  Following the better than expected results  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is now at a loss of 18 cents 

	As we are nearly in June  investors are beginning to look more at 2018 numbers and things are looking good in that department for SQNS  In December the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for a loss of 3 cents  but the current number is a gain of 2 cents  That is a big swing and investors love to be in the stock as it moves from a loss to a gain on the bottom line 

Valuation

	With negative earnings  the forward PE that we tend to rely on is not meaningful  The price to book multiple shows an absurdly highly 27x compared to a 4x industry average  This could be a result of different accounting standards  but more investigation is warranted 

	The key to me is the revenue and earnings growth the stock is set to see in 2017 and 2018  Analysts are projecting revenue growth of 45  this year and 55  next year  They are also looking for earnings growth of 45  this year and 108  next year  Both sets of numbers are many  many multiples of the industry average 

	With growth like that  for earnings and revenue  I am left to wonder how this stock has such a low style score  In any event  I see the growth coming and so do investors that like low priced stocks like this 

  

American Eagle  NYSE       is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and today it is the Bear of the Day  Let s take a look at the recent earnings  estimate moves and valuation 

Description

	American Eagle Outfitters is a specialty retailer of all American casual apparel  accessories  and footwear for men and women between the ages of 16 and 34 

Recent Earnings

	On May 17  the company reported earnings of  0 16 and that was 1 cent below the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Despite a solid sales number  investors dumped shares of AEO  sending them lower by more than 16  in the session following the report 

	This was the first earnings miss of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEO since 2011 

Estimates

	The reason for the stock being a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is usually found when looking at the earnings estimate moves  AEO had a Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 of  1 37 in December but that number slipped to  1 25 in March and is now down to  1 13 

	The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate has also moved lower  The number was at  1 39 in February and has now dropped to  1 17 

Valuation

	Retail stocks have been crushed over the last few months and AEO is no exception  The stock trades at just under 10x forward earnings  The price to book of about 2 is well below the industry average as in the price to sales multiple of 0 5x

172234,393750,NUE,Steel Industry Stock Outlook   May 2017,opinion,"Steel stocks were propelled  big league  following Donald Trump s election win in Nov 2016  following a torrid year before that  The change in momentum can basically be attributed to expectations of significant infrastructure spending under the Trump administration  While nothing concrete has materialized from the new administration  particularly on the infrastructure spending front  But the industry continues to benefit from the sustained healthy demand in the automobile and construction sectors 
The new administration s aggressive trade policies are also expected to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry  U S  steel makers recently applauded the Trump Administration s executive actions geared at improving duty collection along with identifying and addressing root causes of unfair trade practices that have cost the U S  government billions of dollars in lost revenues  The executive order directs U S  Customs and Border Protection   CBP   to chalk out a plan to lessen importer fraud and ensure adequate duty collection 
Per the World Steel Association s data available through Mar 2017  global steel production improved 5 7  to 410 metric tons  Mt   Steel production in Asia was at 280 6 Mt in the quarter  a 5 4  year over year increase  North America s crude steel production registered a 7 1  rise to 29 3 Mt in the quarter while the EU produced 42 5 Mt of crude steel  rising 3 8  year over year  Steel production in the C I S  was at 25 9 Mt  an increase of 4 0  year over year 
China  the world s largest steel maker  delivered a 4 6  rise in steel production during the first quarter  Economic slowdown in China had dealt a massive blow to the global steel industry  Overcapacity and lower steel prices have dented the margins of Chinese steel producers  To negate these factors  efforts have been undertaken to reduce overcapacity and upgrade production in China s steel industry 
China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 9  in the first quarter of 2017  a tad better than the 6 8  growth in the fourth quarter and coming ahead of expectations  This marked the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2015  The improvement is supported by faster rises in industrial output  retail sales and fixed asset investment while fiscal spending surged  For 2017  the Chinese government projects growth figure of 6 5  compared with the 6 7  expansion in 2016  which was the slowest growth in 26 years 
To mitigate the impact of rebalancing  the Chinese government issued a number of mini stimulus measures  This led to a short term boom in infrastructure investment and the housing market  working in favor of the steel industry and consequently  China s steel demand grew 1 3  in 2016  Although  the Chinese economic outlook seems stable now and the industry continued to witness string steel demand so far in 2017  This will eventually decelerate as the government tries to retighten real estate policies  The World Steel Association expects China s steel demand to remain flat in 2017 followed by a 2  dip in 2018 
The steel industry remains challenged by waning investments  turbulence in the financial market and geopolitical conflicts in many developing regions  Given the industry s 10  exposure to the energy sector  lower oil prices have weighed down prices of steel as well  Steel demand from energy companies continues to be weak due to declining capital expenditure budgets  United States Steel Corp   X   which is the biggest supplier to energy companies in North America  along with AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  and ArcelorMittal  MT   remains affected by the slowdown 
U S  steel mills remain impacted by depressed capacity utilization and a surge of unfairly traded imports  The domestic market continues to be inundated with cheap imports from overseas producers  especially from China  American steel makers including Nucor Corp   NUE   United States Steel  AK Steel  Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD  and ArcelorMittal USA  a part of ArcelorMittal  have borne the brunt of high levels of cheap imports  This has resulted in declining orders  idling of mills and layoffs across the board Consequently  U S  steel makers continue to actively press the U S  regulators to stop unfair trade practices and enforce new trade laws to rescue the crisis hit American steel industry Industry Ranking   Favorable 
Within the Zacks Industry classification  the        and    industries are grouped under the Basic Materials sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   We rank all the 265 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   
The bullish Zacks Industry rank of 35 carried by the Steel Producers industry is a testimony to the fact that it is back in favor  The favorable rank places the industry in the top 14  of the 250  groups enlisted  The steel pipe and tube industry has a rank 49  putting it in the top 19  bracket  The steel specialty industry is also enjoying a place in the top 43  with a rank 109  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Sector Level Earnings Trend   Positive
As per the Zacks Industry classification  the steel industries are grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector  As of Apr 28  70  of the sector participants on the S P 500 index have reported quarterly numbers  Earnings for these companies increased a solid 19 9  from the same period last year while sales improved 6 5  
As per our   the Basic Materials sector is one of the four sectors that are projected to witness double digit earnings growth in the first quarter  Overall earnings for the sector are anticipated to rise 16 9  while revenues are expected to increase 2 1  
Improved Performance 
The Steel industry as a whole has struggled this year after performing strongly in the post election period  The Zacks Steel industry is flat in the year to date period  underperforming the broader S P 500 index s  7  gain  This recent underperformance notwithstanding  the industry is up  8 4  since November 8th vs   11 5  gain for the S P 500 index and  7  gain for the Zacks Basic Materials sector  The industry has been losing ground since mid February on growing uncertainty about the administration s policy priorities 
What Lies Ahead 
After recording growth of 1  in global steel demand in 2016  the World Steel Association projects global steel demand to rise 1 3  in 2017  This will be followed by a 0 9  rise in 2018  In both the years  a cyclical upturn in steel demand is expected driven by an ongoing recovery in the developed economies and an accelerating growth momentum in the emerging and developing economies  The U S  is expected to continue to lead growth in the developed world thanks to strong fundamentals  newly announced measures related to fiscal stimuli and rising infrastructure spending 
The European economy  on the other hand  is on the road to recovery  Steel demand in the EU is expected to go up in 2017  This is a positive for companies like ArcelorMittal  which generates almost half of revenues from this region  United States Steel also has a significant presence in Europe  India is anticipated to act as the next growth engine  given its progressing construction and manufacturing sectors along with rapid urbanization and structural reforms 
Meanwhile  the automotive and construction industries will continue to be the backbones of the steel industry  Projection of earnings growth  favorable Zacks Rank also instils investor confidence in the space 
At this juncture  we recommend stocks such as ArcelorMittaland Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE   both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
ArcelorMittal has an expected long term EPS growth rate of roughly 11 51   It has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 143 80  in the trailing four quarters  The company s share price has gained 38 1  in the last year  outperforming the Steel Producers industry s increase of 25 5  
Nucor delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 11 63  in the past four quarters  The stock has an expected long term estimated growth rate of 12   Nucor has delivered a return of 27 8  over the past year  ahead of the Steel Producers industry s gain of 25 5  
However  we suggest staying away from or getting rid of Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stocks such as Haynes International  Inc   HAYN   The stock has delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 150 75  in the last four quarters  The company has also been witnessing downward estimate revisions lately

172235,393751,NUE,Steel Industry Back In Favor  Time To Buy ,opinion,"Steel is used in every important industry ranging from energy  construction  automotive and transportation  infrastructure  packaging and machinery  Expectations of increased infrastructure related spending in the U S  have thrust steel company stocks to new highs  particularly following the November election 
There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry  both in the short term and long term  Here  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Construction Remains a Pillar of Strength
The homebuilding market remains strong for the economy as well as the steel industry  The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel  accounting for almost half of the total consumption  Positives like an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance 
The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an economic indicator that provides an approximately 9 to 12 month glimpse into the future of non residential construction spending activity  has been at 50 or better for 20 of the last 24 months indicating reliable  manageable and sustainable growth in architectural activity  The American Institute of Architects  AIA  anticipates spending in the non residential building sector to advance around 6  in 2017  Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE   NUE  and Commercial Metals Company  CMC  are the leading steel suppliers to the non residential construction sector 
Over the long haul  as the urban population increases worldwide  the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure should see an uptrend as well  Emerging economies will continue to be major catalysts owing to the huge amount of steel required for urbanization and industrialization  Hence  demand for steel is expected to remain strong in the years to come  Companies like United States Steel Corp   X   ArcelorMittal  MT   Nucor Corporation and Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD  would benefit from the momentum in construction 
Automotive Will Provide Thrust
The automotive sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials  Besides giving a boost to the already rising U S  auto sales  cheap oil has backed a recovery in the European auto market  The rising sales trend is anticipated to persist on the back of falling fuel prices  low interest rates  enhanced job security  rising wages and household wealth  Moreover  the trend will be backed by improving consumer confidence  residual pent up demand  attractive deals and vehicle launches 
Moreover  the high average age of light vehicles on U S  roads is resulting in large replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  The average age is estimated to rise to 11 5 years by 2017 and 11 7 years by 2019 from 11 4 years at the end of 2013  according to forecasts by IHS Automotive  This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers 
The auto industry in Asian countries  particularly China and India  are also projected to flourish over the next five to seven years  China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold  With automakers cashing in on strong demand  steel is expected to get a proportional boost in the years to come  ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  generate a large portion of their revenues from auto companies 
Indian Steel Sector to Be a Major Driver
India  currently the fourth largest producer of steel in the world  is anticipated to record exponential growth in the future  This will be fuelled by increasing urbanization  and projected growth in the infrastructure  automobile and real estate sectors 
The country s comparatively low per capita steel consumption and the anticipated rise in consumption due to increased infrastructure construction  along with the thriving automobile and railways sectors  offer huge scope for growth  Steel demand in the sub continent is projected to grow backed by reforms to boost consumption and infrastructure investment 
Steady Growth in Developed Economies
Developed economies are expected to witness a stable recovery momentum  Steel demand in these regions will grow 0 7  in 2017 and 1 2  in 2018  In the EU  steel demand recovery remains on track  backed by resilient consumption and a mild recovery in construction  Eurozone monetary policy will remain on its current path  If political stability can be maintained  investment is anticipated to pick up and provide a further boost to the recovery   In the U S   an improving job market and a strong housing sector and Trump s infrastructure push will support growth in steel demand 
Imposing Anti Dumping Duties
U S  steel companies have been battered by a tide of cheap imports over the past few years that largely contributed to the slump in steel prices  Low costs of production have allowed overseas producers to sell products at cheaper rates  leading to an industry wide price decline  Big U S  steel producers U S Steel  AK Steel  Nucor  Steel Dynamics and ArcelorMittal USA retaliated by filing anti dumping petitions in Jul 2015 with the U S  International Trade Commission   USITC   and the DOC  alleging illegal dumping of cold rolled steel that is used to make automotive products and appliances  among others 
One of the major factors that have stimulated a recovery in the steel sector is favorable developments on a number of trade cases that led to a decline in steel imports  Affirmative rulings in these cases have been a positive catalyst for the U S  steel industry  Steel imports fell around 15  year over year in 2016 on the back of punitive trade actions that led to levy of tariffs on imports 
U S  regulators  in mid 2016  imposed a whopping final anti dumping duty rate of 209 97  on imports of corrosion resistant steel from China and also slapped a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on Chinese cold rolled steel  The DOC  in Sep 2016  also levied anti dumping duties on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries Moreover  the DOC  last month  issued positive final rulings in anti dumping duty investigations on imports of carbon and alloy steel plates from eight countries  The commerce department found that these exporters are selling these products in the U S  at unfairly low prices and  therefore  are subject to anti dumping duties  The U S  International Trade Commission   ITC   is scheduled to make final ruling on this case in May 
Also President Trump s announcement of an investigation into whether cheap steel imports from China and other nations are hurting national security has instilled optimism  Trump also said that  steel is critical to both our economy and our military  and it is a  historic day for American steel  
How to Play the Industry
As you can see  there are many reasons to be optimistic about the steel industry over the long haul  We particularly recommend stocks such as ArcelorMittaland Nucor Corporation  both flaunting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
ArcelorMittal has an expected long term EPS growth rate of roughly 11 51   It has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 143 80  in the trailing four quarters  ArcelorMittal s share price has gained 45 8  in the last year  outperforming the Steel Producers industry s gain of 28  
Nucor delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 11 63  in the past four quarters  The stock has an expected long term estimated growth rate of 12   Nucor has delivered a return of 30 1  over the past year  ahead of the Steel Producers industry s gain of 28  
Valmont Industries  Inc   VMI  is also a good pick  Armed with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   the stock has an estimated long term earnings growth of 10   It has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 4 37  in the last four quarters

172236,393752,NUE,A Grind Ahead For The Steel Industry,opinion,"The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the U S and emerging markets like India  However  steel stocks have to struggle with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector should be aware of in the coming months and years 
Valuation Questions
Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like steel  the     and    have a respective trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multipleof 24 72 and 19 52  respectively  higher than the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 10 8  Meanwhile  the  industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 6 79  which compares favorably to the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 10 8  Overall  valuation looks expensive for the steel industry 
A Rise in Cheap Imports in the U S 
A slump in the domestic property market  which accounts for a significant part of China s steel consumption  severe credit crunch and weak infrastructure investment are hurting steel demand in China 
China s steel exports crossed the benchmark of 100 Mt for the first time last year in the wake of shrinking domestic demand and a flagging economy  Notably  China is the world s top steel producer  contributing around half of the total global output 
The country has built up a massive excess capacity  posing a threat to the global steel industry  These cheap imports hurt the margins of American steel players like Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD   United States Steel Corp   X   ArcelorMittal  MT   AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  and Nucor Corp   NUE  
Slowdown in China
For 2017  the Chinese government projects growth figure of 6 5  compared with the 6 7  expansion in 2016  which was the slowest growth in 26 years While rebalancing progresses  the Chinese economy continues to slow down 
Geopolitical Tensions
Performance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues  lower commodity prices associated with China s economic slowdown  and escalating political instability  Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East  Africa continues to have a negative effect  Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand 
Excess Capacity  Perennial Problem
The biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity  further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth  To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and to raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels  The industry remains highly fragmented compared with other global businesses  However  the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace 
Impact of Low Oil Prices
The energy sector  which was once buoyant due to shale discoveries and rising production of crude oil  accounts for 10  of steel consumption in the U S  Steel is necessary to make rigs and transport oil  Steel demand from the energy sector is being impacted as exploration companies have reduced capital expenditure budgets in the wake of tumbling oil prices 
Steel products used by the energy industry are also known as oil country tubular goods  or OCTG   U S  Steel being the biggest supplier of these goods in North America is bearing the brunt of it 
Lower oil prices would urge energy companies to preserve capital to shore up their balance sheets instead of spending money on new exploration  Thus  leading suppliers to the energy sector  such as United States Steel and Tenaris S A  TS   are likely to be under pressure throughout the year 
In 2017 18 oil prices are anticipated to show a reasonable gain but any spike in oil prices to the levels seen in 2010 12 seems unlikely despite the recent OPEC agreement on oil production cuts 
Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization
The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in both 2014 and 2015  The average capacity utilization in the 2016 was around 69   Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive and rationalize operations  some major steel companies have resorted to idling their steel plants 
Increasing Use of Aluminum in Auto Industry
Currently  steel is the major raw material for the auto industry  the second largest steel consumer  However  major automakers like Ford Motor Co   F   General Motors Company  NYSE GM   GM  and others are becoming increasingly aluminum intensive  given the metal s recyclability and light weight properties  The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025  Hence  in order to remain competitive  the steel companies will have to come up with better and lighter varieties of steel 
How to Play the Industry
The short term prospects are a bit clouded considering the headwinds plaguing the steel industry globally as discussed above  So  it would be prudent to stay away from steel stocks that carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank now  Particularly  we suggest staying away from stocks such as Haynes International  Inc   HAYN   which carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Haynes International delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 150 75  in the last four quarters 
However  investors  who can look beyond the near term clouds to the industry s bright long term prospects  and may consider buying some steel stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank 
We highly recommend ArcelorMittal and Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  which sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

172241,393757,NUE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Steel Dynamics  United States Steel  ArcelorMittal  AK Steel Holding And Nucor,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 08  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Steel  Part 3  including Steel Dynamics Inc   NASDAQ        United States Steel Corp   NYSE         ArcelorMittal  NYSE         AK Steel Holding Corp   NYSE        and Nucor Corp   NYSE        

	Industry  Steel  Part 3

	Link  

	The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the U S and emerging markets like India  However  steel stocks have to struggle with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector should be aware of in the coming months and years 

Valuation Questions

	Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like steel  the       and      have a respective trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multipleof 24 72 and 19 52  respectively  higher than the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 10 8  Meanwhile  the  industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 6 79  which compares favorably to the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 10 8  Overall  valuation looks expensive for the steel industry 

A Rise in Cheap Imports in the U S 

	A slump in the domestic property market  which accounts for a significant part of China s steel consumption  severe credit crunch and weak infrastructure investment are hurting steel demand in China 

	China s steel exports crossed the benchmark of 100 Mt for the first time last year in the wake of shrinking domestic demand and a flagging economy  Notably  China is the world s top steel producer  contributing around half of the total global output 

	The country has built up a massive excess capacity  posing a threat to the global steel industry  These cheap imports hurt the margins of American steel players like Steel Dynamics Inc   NASDAQ         United States Steel Corp   NYSE         ArcelorMittal  NYSE         AK Steel Holding Corp   NYSE        and Nucor Corp   NYSE        

Slowdown in China

	For 2017  the Chinese government projects growth figure of 6 5  compared with the 6 7  expansion in 2016  which was the slowest growth in 26 years  While rebalancing progresses  the Chinese economy continues to slow down 

Geopolitical Tensions

	Performance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues  lower commodity prices associated with China s economic slowdown  and escalating political instability  Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East  Africa continues to have a negative effect  Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand 

Excess Capacity  Perennial Problem

	The biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity  further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth  To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and to raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels  The industry remains highly fragmented compared with other global businesses  However  the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace 

Impact of Low Oil Prices

	The energy sector  which was once buoyant due to shale discoveries and rising production of crude oil  accounts for 10  of steel consumption in the U S  Steel is necessary to make rigs and transport oil  Steel demand from the energy sector is being impacted as exploration companies have reduced capital expenditure budgets in the wake of tumbling oil prices 

	Steel products used by the energy industry are also known as oil country tubular goods  or OCTG   U S  Steel being the biggest supplier of these goods in North America is bearing the brunt of it 

	Lower oil prices would urge energy companies to preserve capital to shore up their balance sheets instead of spending money on new exploration  Thus  leading suppliers to the energy sector  such as United States Steel and Tenaris S A  TS   are likely to be under pressure throughout the year 

	In 2017 18 oil prices are anticipated to show a reasonable gain but any spike in oil prices to the levels seen in 2010 12 seems unlikely despite the recent OPEC agreement on oil production cuts 

Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization

	The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in both 2014 and 2015  The average capacity utilization in the 2016 was around 69   Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive and rationalize operations  some major steel companies have resorted to idling their steel plants

172264,393780,NUE,5 Best Ranked Liquid Stocks For Impressive Returns,opinion,The liquidity position of a company often indicates whether its business is going in a profitable direction  A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered to be ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash So  a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company s financial health Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Growth Style Score less than or equal to B Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Stocks with Exciting Interest Coverage Ratios

	A layman can easily dupe himself if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real time stock screen  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is essential for a better investment decision 

	Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the real picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here  the role of coverage ratios comes into play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations 

Why Interest Coverage Ratio 

	Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt 

	Debt  which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision 

Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense    

	The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest 

	An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations  and could default in repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time 

The Winning Strategy

	Apart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a    of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results 

Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry Median

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median   Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history 

Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median   This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

VGM Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are seven of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening

172298,393814,NUE,Will Nucor  NUE  Prove To Be A Suitable Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nucor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 26 08  This level compares unfavorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 28 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Nucor s current PE near its median over the past five years  which stands at 25 26   The current level is much below the highs experienced for the stock over the observed period Further  Nucor s PE also compares unfavorably with the highly volatile Zacks classified Steel   Producers industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 57  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  However  the graph below also makes it amply clear that Nucor s earnings and or price movement were comparatively less volatile than the industry at large Further  we should also point out that Nucor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 38   much lower than the current level  So it is fair to say that a more value oriented path may be ahead for Nucor stock in the near term  The falling forward PE multiple is a result of rising annual earnings estimates for Nucor  The bullish sentiment also reflects the fact that the company has provided an upbeat guidance for first quarter 2017  It sees higher profits for the quarter on improved performance in its Steel Mills unit PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nucor has a P S ratio of about 1 20  This is higher than the Zacks categorized Steel   Producers industry average  which comes in at 0 86 right now Notably  NUE is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nucor currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  Some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear  For example  the PEG ratio for Nucor is 1 20  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 25  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Nucor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives NUE a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  as mentioned earlier  the company s earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has moved north by 48 7  in the past month  while the next year estimate has moved higher by 10 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDespite boasting of a formidable industry rank  Top 9  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3 for the company somewhat dims the sparkle  Notably  over the past one year  the Zacks Steel   Producers industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below Nevertheless  Nucor remains committed to expand its production capabilities and grow its business through strategic acquisitions  It is also seeing continued momentum in the automotive market  Thus  though the company might be bit overvalued a right now  fundamentals indicate that it could be a compelling pick for the long term  So  value investors might want to wait for the price to correct downwards a bit first  before investing in this name Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

	Steel Stocks Hits Hard as Ruling on Imports Disappoints

	Steel stocks took a tumble yesterday after the anti dumping duty determinations of the U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   on imports of oil country tubular goods   OCTG   from South Korea fell short of market expectations 

	The DOC recalculated anti dumping duties on imports of OCTG   used mainly by oil and gas industries in drilling and extraction operations   from South Korea after concluding that steel producers of that country have been unfairly dumping these products in the American market  causing harm to U S  businesses and workers  The commerce department raised duties on OCTG imports to a range of 2 76  to 24 92  from the earlier range of 4  to 6 5  determined in Oct 2016 
	The DOC said that it has exercised its authority for the first time under a provision of the recently enacted Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015   TPEA   to address distortions in the market and calculate dumping margins that more accurately account for the unfair pricing practices of overseas exporters  The commerce department  in the Korean import case  found that prices of the hot rolled coil used to make OCTG were distorted 
	Per the DOC  imports of OCTG from South Korea were valued at an estimated  1 1 billion from Jul 2014 to Aug 2015  the administrative review period   representing 25  of all imports in that product category  American steelmakers have suffered heavily due to a torrent of OCTG imports  reflected by idling of mills and jobs losses 
	OCTG products  which play a pivotal role in building and maintaining the nation s energy infrastructure  are being illegally dumped at unfairly low prices in the American market which happens to be the most open and attractive market in the world and a hotspot for overseas steelmakers looking to capitalize on the country s booming shale oil and gas industry 
	However  the DOC s move disappointed investors  sending stocks of major steel makers tumbling yesterday  The negative sentiment was partly evoked by the comments of Axiom Capital analyst  Gordon Johnson  who said that steel market pundits were expecting higher taxes on South Korean imports 
	The markets were reportedly expecting duties of 30  to 40   Last month  Peter Navarro  the director of the White House National Trade Council   NTC    also officially asked the DOC for at least 36  tariff on South Korean OCTG imports citing a  particular market situation  as the reason for the tariff adjustment  As such  the DOC s duty revision on these imports was considered inadequate by the markets and also raised doubts about White House s protectionist policies 
	U S  Steel  NYSE         was the worst hit with shares sagging around 10   Moreover  AK Steel s  NYSE         shares tumbled roughly 7 5  while Nucor  NYSE           Commercial Metals  NYSE          and Steel Dynamics  NASDAQ          lost around 4 3   3 9  and 3 8   respectively 
	While both U S  Steel and ArcelorMittal hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   AK Steel  Nucor  Steel Dynamics and Commercial Metals carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see     
	Steel stocks  which had been in the dumps for most part of 2016  got a big thrust following Donald Trump s election win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending in a Trump administration 
	The steel industry is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of Trump s presidency  President Trump s call for  1 trillion of new infrastructure spending is likely to have a beneficial effect on the steel industry given the expected increase in steel consumption  Trump s  big  spending plans have thus painted a bullish picture for steel companies 
	Trump s aggressive trade policies are also expected to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry  U S  steel makers recently hailed the Trump Administration s executive actions geared at improving duty collection and further identifying and addressing root causes of unfair trade practices that have cost the U S  government billions of dollars in lost revenues  The executive order directs U S  Customs and Border Protection   CBP   to chalk out a plan to lessen importer fraud and ensure adequate duty collection 
	The steel industry has staged a recovery after being in a rut for long  The  industry has outperformed the broader market in the past year  The industry has gained around 20  in this period  higher than the S P 500 s corresponding return of around 12  

	One of the major factors that have fueled a recovery in the steel sector is favorable developments on a number of trade cases that led to a decline in steel imports  Affirmative rulings in these cases have been be a positive catalyst for the U S  steel industry  Steel imports fell around 15  year over year in 2016 on the back of punitive trade actions that led to levy of tariffs on imports 
	U S  regulators  in mid 2016  imposed a whopping final anti dumping duty rate of 209 97  on imports of corrosion resistant steel from China and also slapped a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on Chinese cold rolled steel  The DOC  in Sep 2016  also levied anti dumping duties on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries 
	Moreover  the DOC  last month  issued positive final rulings in its anti dumping duty investigations on imports of carbon and alloy steel plates from eight countries  The commerce department found that these exporters are selling these products in the U S  at unfairly low prices and  therefore  are subject to anti dumping duties  The U S  International Trade Commission   ITC   is scheduled to make its final injury ruling on this case in May Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside 
	Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more    

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations

172323,393839,NUE,Tailwinds Strong For U S  Materials,opinion,"Back in early 2016  when Donald Trump s victory in a contentious Republican Party primary still looked unlikely  the global commodity complex reached the bottom of the decline that had begun in mid 2014 
From that bottom  commodities rose unevenly through the rest of the year  Then they got another powerful impetus after the presidential election in November  Sentiment took a decisive turn to the positive among businesses and market participants  Many investors  consumers  and analysts seemed finally to break through the fear that the global economy was stalled in a prolonged disinflationary trend  Growth began to look possible again and  animal spirits  made themselves strongly felt 
Thus  there are two basic tailwinds behind materials  the turn of a global cycle  and now the arrival of a new administration    and along with it a new optimism about prospects for economic growth  As usual  many Wall Street analysts are cautious in integrating these new developments into their views  so when we look at stocks through their lens  they can seem to be fully valued  Still  we believe that further positive developments    the ongoing inflection in fundamentals  in the regulatory environment  and in psychology    will eventually be incorporated into analysts  models  and will support higher stock prices 
The U S  Is Best
U S  companies seem to us to be best positioned in this new environment 
In materials    steel  base metals  construction materials  and fertilizer  for example    we see particular positives for U S  producers who will benefit from a stronger U S  dollar  buying their inputs abroad and selling their goods in the United States 
U S  companies will also benefit from the new administration s policy priorities  Two new appointees    Wilbur Ross  the new administration s nominee for Secretary of Commerce  and Robert Lighthizer  the appointee for U S  Trade Representative    have deep business experience in the steel industry   Former Nucor  NYSE NUE  CEO Dan DiMicco is also one of the new president s key advisors  
New Regulators Bring New Strategies That Support the Shares of U S  Materials Companies
At Mr  Ross  confirmation hearing last week  the nominee said that he would not hesitate to initiate trade cases pre emptively  and noted steel and aluminum as industries of particular interest to him  In other words  he won t always wait for U S  companies to complain before acting   He believes that the Department of Commerce should pursue such a pre emptive strategy in order to signal its seriousness  He also indicated that he would reduce the time it takes to process cases when the alleged dumpers are being uncooperative and obstructing investigators  His inside knowledge of the business will make him wise to dumpers  stratagems  and we believe this will make him more effective than regulators who lack such detailed operational experience and competence 

U S  producers will benefit from this more vigilant and proactive defense  While they enjoy lower import prices  they will also enjoy pricing power when they sell into the U S  market  As the new administration s policies unfold  we believe a similar pattern will emerge in many industries 
In the meantime  the global tailwinds continue  with demand increasing for many commodities worldwide  In the U S  and elsewhere  policy talk continues to be a shift from monetary stimulus to fiscal stimulus  both tax cuts and infrastructure spending  Given the continuing clarification of supportive U S  trade policy  and the continued strengthening of economic growth and business psychology inflections in the U S  and elsewhere  we will like some U S  materials stocks on a correction    particularly fertilizer  steel  and aluminum 
Investment implications  Materials stocks began to rally in early 2016 after global commodities hit bottom and began to recover  That rally got a powerful impetus in November with the prospect of a new U S  administration and a more supportive and proactive defense of U S  companies against foreign firms engaging in dumping and other unfair practices  While U S  materials stocks have risen in price  we continue to see them as attractive in any correction    especially steel and aluminum  In our opinion  2017 is shaping up to be a year in which the astute selection of individual stocks  and concentration in sectors and industries with positive tailwinds  can outperform simply buying a broad index tracking fund ",2017-01-27,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tailwinds-still-strong-for-u.s.-materials-industries-200173784,200173784
172324,393840,NUE,Innovation Is Alive And Well In The Steel Industry,opinion,"Those not involved in the steel industry tend to look at large  integrated blast furnace steel plants as dated technology light years from the gleaming glass and concrete operations of IT or electronics  However  steelmakers are constantly striving for technological improvements 
In fact  the very marginal nature of steel production in the western world means that constant innovation is a necessity for a firm s survival  Comparisons between U S  Steel and Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE   illustrate this point  When U S  Steel was focused on cost reduction and rationalization at the turn of the century  Nucor was innovating and investing not just in alternative electric arc furnaces  but in direct casting and other downstream technologies  As a result  Nucor is now North America s most successful steel company but they re not alone in looking to technology for their future prosperity 
Continuous Casting
An interesting  in the Economist details efforts at a number of steel producers around the world to find a better alternative to the traditional blast furnace  The slab casting and re rolling route is epitomized by the likes of U S  Steel and the major Asian steel mills  For years  the only real challenger to this process was the electric arc furnace which enjoys the benefits of scrap as a raw material and greater flexibility and economies of scale allowing it to operate profitably on a fraction of the cost required throughout for a traditional blast furnace based integrated steel plant 
One of the major attractions most EAF plants have is that they produce final product by the continuous casting route  The liquid metal is taken from the refining vessel and  for flat rolled products  continuously cast into 80 120 mm thick slabs  which can then be further rolled to thinner gauges 
But both steelmakers and university research centers are working on techniques that would allow continuous casting direct to sheet gauges while maintaining quality standards sufficient even for automotive applications  One such project at the University of Warwick in Britain is developing new high tech steels specially for casting onto belts that then require relatively limited rolling to final gauge 
Belt Casting Process
Not surprisingly  Nucor has their own version of continuous casting to sheet called Castrip which employs a twin roll process taking semi solidified steel from the bottom of the mold and integrates it with a belt casting process that allows the plant to economically achieve a production run 500 000 metric tons per year from a compact 50 acre site compared to the demands the integrated mill that requires 5 000 acres and a minimum of 4 million metric tons a year to even turn a profit 
Plants in the UK  Europe and China are adopting the same technology and it s hoped the flexibility that comes from operating lower volumes while remaining economically sound will encourage steelmakers to produce closer to market and may even see a return of something like the integrated steel manufacturing and automotive assembly line pioneered by Henry Ford 100 years ago 
The reduction in energy usage  and potentially reduced transport costs  will dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of steel as a result  While carbon taxes are onerous now they are likely to be even more so in the future  It won t be long before someone thinks up the idea of ranking steel products by carbon impact  adding impetus to technologies that can significantly reduce heating  rolling and transportation in manufacture 
New technologies always throw up new challenges in the process of development and steel sheet from liquid metal has proved no different  According to the Economist  Salzgitter in Germany has been operating a single belt castor since 2012 making specialty steels  One of their biggest challenges was in keeping the sheet flat on the casting belt  Even small variations impact the quality of the finished sheet  Salzgitter achieves this by operating a vacuum under the plate  but McGill University in Montreal  Quebec  Canada  one of the pioneers of the new technology  achieved the same outcome with magnets 
Either way  it s hoped the belt casting or a combination of twin roll and belt casting will achieve much more than just cost reduction  The research center at the University of Warwick has managed to create advanced  low density steels that are stronger  lighter and more flexible than conventional steels  While the belt casting process opens the door for much wider sheets than the dimensionally constrained twin roller approach may allow 
It would seem innovation and technological development are alive and well in the steelmaking industry  and will likely not just maintain cost competitiveness but give the industry options to counter the threat from products like aluminum in the construction of automobiles

172325,393841,NUE,Nucor  Avon Products  Digital Ally  Alarm com Holdings And Ituran Location And Control Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 07  2017   highlights Nucor  NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Avon Products  NYSE AVP   NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Digital Ally  Inc   NASDAQ         Alarm com Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ        and Ituran Location and Control Ltd   NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	Headquartered in Charlotte  North Carolina  Nucor  NYSE        is a leading producer of structural steel  steel bars  steel joists  steel deck and cold finished bars  The company has approximately 200 operating facilities  They are also the largest recycler in the United States 

	The company has grown organically as well as through strategic acquisitions over the years  They currently operate in three segments   the Steel Mills segment  78  of total tons sold in 2016   the Steel Products segment  22   and the Raw Materials segment 

Solid Quarterly Results and Upgraded Guidance

	The company swung to profit in Q4  thanks to increased shipments and higher steel prices  During the quarter  earnings were  0 50 per share compared with a loss of  0 59 per share in the same quarter a year ago  Earnings were significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 34 per share 

	Sales increased approximately 14  year over year and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

	The steel producer expects Q1 as well as FY 2017 earnings to improve significantly from their 2016 levels 

Returning Cash to Shareholders

	The company continues to boost shareholder value through dividends and share buybacks  They have increased their base dividend for 44 consecutive years  irrespective of the commodity cycle  They retuned  4 0 Billion to shareholders during 2004 2008 up cycle and another  3 8 billion during 2009 2016 down cycle 

Surging Estimates

	Analysts have significantly raised their estimates for the company after strong earnings and upgraded guidance  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year are now  4 23 per share and  4 44 per share  up from  3 71 and  4 61  before the results 

  

	Headquartered in New York  Avon Products  NYSE        is the world s largest direct seller with about 6 million active independent sales representatives  Avon products include color cosmetics  skincare  fragrance  fashion and home products  under brand names like Avon Color  ANEW  Skin So Soft and Advance Techniques 

	In March last year  Avon split into two companies  Avon Products  a publicly traded company that operates in approximately 70 countries and New Avon LLC  a privately held company owned by Cerberus Capital Management  and operating in the US  Puerto Rico and Canada 

Disappointing Results

	The company reported adjusted earnings of  0 01 per share for Q4 missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 09  Revenues fell 2  year over year and were also short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

	The miss was attributed to a decrease in the number of selling representatives and currency headwinds 

Update on Transformation Plan

	The company also provided an update on the Transformation Plan  which was initiated in January 2016  and aims to achieve its long term goal of a targeted low double digit operating margin and mid single digit constant dollar revenue growth  The plan focuses on investing in growth  reducing costs and improving financial resilience 

Falling Estimates

	Analysts have been slashing their estimates after lackluster results  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and nest year have fallen to  0 28 per share and  0 36 per share  down from  0 37 and  0 50  before the results 

	The company has missed in three out of last four quarters with an average negative quarterly surprise of about 109  

	The following chart shows the negative earnings and price momentum for AVP

Who Should Worry About Axon s Body Armor Plans 

	In an unprecedented move  Axon Enterprise Inc  announced a program under which it will offer every police officer in the U S  a one year free trial of all its existing body camera products  full software suite and training support 

	The offering includes Axon Body 2 camera and Evidence com  Unlimited Pro  license  and docking station to securely upload footage 

	The company changed its name from TASER International  Inc  to Axon Enterprise  effective today 

	Presently  Axon is the leading dealer of body cameras in the U S   and is way ahead of smaller competitors like Seattle based VieVu and Digital Ally  Inc   NASDAQ        With this unconventional move  the company hopes to convert a number of trials into contracts  accelerate the market forward and ramp up revenues 

	If the strategy is as successful as the company expects it to be  Axon could quickly crowd out its competitors completely 

	Lawsuits are a common nuisance in the law enforcement body camera business and Axon has been involved in a couple of high profile ones  In 2016  Digital Ally filed a suit against Axon  alleging that the latter s camera systems for law enforcement infringe on its patented technology 

	In an ongoing lawsuit  Digital Ally claims that its patented auto activation technology  used in body cameras of law enforcement customers has been infringed by Axon  Digital Ally s revenues have been hurt in the recent fourth quarter and full year 2016 results  and the company blames Axon s misleading statements about its patents for the same 

	Digital Ally also accused Axon of engaging in improper  unethical and unfair competitive practices  Axon simply called the lawsuit frivolous 

	WestPark Capital analyst  Ishfaque Faruk  hypothesized that even if Digital Ally won the patent infringement lawsuit  Axon would either buy the smaller company or license its technology  Most likely  neither outcome would have a significant impact on Axon 

	So in any case  we believe that Digital Ally is exposed to substantial risk  particularly if Axon s strategy succeeds in expanding its market share 

	In light of the above risks  we have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for Digital Ally  The company s shares have had a tough run over the past one year  having declined 5 8  relative to the Zacks classified  industry s average positive return of 17 1  

	On the other hand  Axon s shares appreciated 17 7  over the same time  outperforming the industry by a slight margin  as you can see in the chart below  The stock s performance is in line with that of Alarm com Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ       and Ituran Location and Control Ltd   NASDAQ         which also surpassed the industry mark  You can see     

	Analysts also seem to have turned bullish on Axon in recent times  as the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s earnings estimates moved north over the past couple of months  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 increased 5 3  to 40 cents in the last 60 days 

	Conversely  Digital Ally seemingly holds no favor with analysts lately  as the company s loss estimates widened substantially over the past month  which makes its outlook even bleaker  With one downward revision compared with none upward in the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 widened from a loss of 29 cents a month ago to a loss of 80 cents today

172343,393859,NUE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Steel Dynamics  United States Steel  ArcelorMittal  Nucor And Tenaris S A,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   September 22  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Steel  Part 3  including  Steel Dynamics Inc      United States Steel Corp      ArcelorMittal     Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE        and Tenaris S A    

	Industry  Steel  part 3

	Link  

	The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the U S and emerging markets like India  However  steel stocks have to struggle with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 

A Rise in Cheap Imports in the U S 

	A slump in the domestic property market  which accounts for a significant part of China s steel consumption  severe credit crunch and weak infrastructure investment are hurting steel demand in China 

	China s steel exports crossed the benchmark of 100 Mt for the first time last year in the wake of shrinking domestic demand amid a flagging economy  Notably  China is the world s top steel producer  contributing around half of the total global output 

	The country has built up massive excess capacity  posing a threat to the global steel industry  The worsening gap between supply and demand  along with barely any sign of a recovery  further clouds the picture  The Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for the Chinese steel industry has stayed below the mark of 50 for the past two years  indicating a noticeable disparity between supply and demand  These cheap imports hurt the margins of American steel players like Steel Dynamics Inc      United States Steel Corp      ArcelorMittal    and Nucor Corp      

Slowdown in China

	As discussed above  demand in China has slowed down due to the country s tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment  China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the second quarter of 2016  flat with the first quarter  marking its slowest in seven years  For 2016  the government anticipates the growth rate to remain in the range of 6 5 7  

	While rebalancing progresses  the Chinese economy continues to slow down  Lower construction activities are leading to a slowdown in the manufacturing sectors  especially metal products  A recovery in the construction sector is not expected any time soon either  In fact  steel demand in China is projected to be in the negative territory with respective declines of 4  and 3  in 2016 and 2017 

Geopolitical Tensions

	Performance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues  lower commodity prices associated with China s economic slowdown  and escalating political instability  Russia and Brazil are experiencing severe contraction in steel demand  Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East  Africa continues to have a negative effect  Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand  In fact  the country s steel demand is estimated to contract 8 8  in 2016  followed by a recovery of 3 1  in 2017 

Excess Capacity   a Perennial Problem

	The biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity  further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth 

	To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and to raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels  The industry remains highly fragmented compared to other global businesses and the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace 

Impact of Low Oil Prices

	The energy sector  which was once buoyant due to shale discoveries and rising production of crude oil  accounts for 10  of steel consumption in the U S  Steel is necessary to make rigs and transport oil  Steel demand from the energy sector is being impacted as exploration companies have reduced their capital expenditure budgets in the wake of tumbling oil prices 

	Steel products used by the energy industry are also known as oil country tubular goods  or OCTG   U S  Steel being the biggest supplier of these goods in North America is bearing most of the impact 

	Steel demand from the energy sector could weaken even further in 2016  Falling oil prices would urge energy companies to preserve capital to shore up their balance sheets instead of spending money on new exploration  Thus  leading suppliers to the energy sector  such as United States Steel and Tenaris S A      could continue to be under pressure throughout the year 

Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization

	The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in both 2014 and 2015  The average capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016 was 67 6   Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive and rationalize operations  some major steel companies have resorted to idling their steel plants

Segment Highlights
Nucor saw improved performance in its Steel Mills segment in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter  The profitability of its sheet mills improved due to increased average selling prices  Although demand for cold rolled and galvanized sheet products has been strong  market conditions for the company s plate and bar mills remained challenging due to high levels of imports  Energy  heavy equipment and agricultural markets were weak while the automotive markets remained strong 
The performance of Nucor s raw materials segment in the third quarter of 2016  improved considerably from the sequentially prior quarter due to the improved performance of its direct reduced iron   DRI   facilities  However  the company saw decreased profitability for its steel products segment in the third quarter due to margin compression resulting from higher steel prices  It continues to see gradual improvement in non residential construction markets 
Financial Position
Nucor ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents climbing around 10 1  year over year to  1 704 7 million  Long term debt was  4 338 3 million  down around 0 5  year over year 
Guidance
Moving ahead  Nucor expects earnings in the fourth quarter to decrease on a sequential comparison basis mainly due to lower margins in the steel mills segment  with the most significant impact expected on the sheet mills 
The company expects the raw materials segment to return to a loss due to reduced transfer prices at the DRI facilities in the fourth quarter  The performance of the steel products segment has been forecast to decline due to year end seasonality NUCOR CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

172346,393862,NUE,4 Steel Stocks To Gain Under President Trump ,opinion,For the first time in a decade  heading into December  we see a credible long term investment case for steel equities  President elect Donald Trump s policies to spend big on the nation s infrastructure and trade protection plans should benefit the steel industry by both increasing demand and curtailing import supply Trump s win has brought back shine to steel stocks  dispelling the gloom plaguing them since 2010  Several analysts  in the meantime  have turned bullish on steelmakers in recent times  which call for investing in such companies Trump Win Makes Steel Shine AgainSteel stocks have been on a tear since Trump was elected as the 45th U S  president  Trump s plans of increased infrastructure spending and a further cut on China produced steel are reasons enough to invest in such stocks after almost 10 years Trump has vowed to  fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways  bridges  tunnels  airports  schools  hospitals   He has promised to double infrastructure spending than what his competitor Hillary Clinton had assured  This puts his proposed spending at around  550 billion  while Clinton had estimated  275 billion over the next five years  read more    Such stimulus plans would mean more steel consumption as it is an important component in many infrastructure products  while its demand is likely to increase by almost 20  annually for five years  This in turn will boost the top line of steel companies Trump  on the other hand  intends to impose a 45  tariff on Chinese imports in the U S   which will lend further protection to domestic steel companies  This has reversed the stance from bearish to bullish of a number of analysts last year U S  Imposes Duty on Chinese Steel ImportsEarlier this year  the government s initiative to penalize the dumping of steel by Asian countries worked in favor of domestic companies  The Commerce Department imposed import taxes as high as 522   which gave domestic companies a strong foothold This was mostly meant to punish Chinese steelmakers  who were dumping or selling steel at a loss to gain market traction  Lakshmi Mittal  CEO and controlling owner of ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    had said that the Chinese steel industry lost  10 billion last year  which sheds light on the dumping activities Steel Stocks on a TearExpectations of an increase in U S  demand for steel under Trump presidency have helped steelmakers stage a comeback  United States Steel Corporation   NYSE X    the once iconic American enterprise  skyrocketed more

172366,393882,NUE,Steel Industry Stock Outlook   September 2016,opinion,"Although the automobile and construction sectors persistently support demand  the steel industry is reeling from the economic slowdown in China  and the continued weakness in the manufacturing sector and the glut of foreign steel imports into the U S 
In the seven months of 2016  per the World Steel Association  global steel production decreased 1 2  to 929 6 metric tons  Mt  as production shrank across all regions  China  the world s largest steel maker  again disappointed with a 0 5  decline 
Economic slowdown in China has dealt a massive blow to the global steel industry  Overcapacity and lower steel prices are hurting margins of Chinese steel producers  To mitigate these factors  efforts have been undertaken to reduce overcapacity and upgrade production in China s steel industry 
China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the second quarter of 2016  unchanged from the first quarter  For the fourth quarter  the growth rate is expected at 6 5   Having stubbornly remained below 50 for the past two years  the Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for the Chinese steel industry has remained above 50 in July and August  A reading above 50 marks growth  while that below 50 indicates contraction  However  it is still too early to predict a recovery for certain 
Meanwhile  according to the World Steel Association s short range outlook published in April  steel usage in China is estimated to fall 4  in 2016  The severe depression in construction activities is leading to a slowdown in the manufacturing sectorsas well as to slower growth in the automotive sector  especially metal products  A recovery in the Chinese construction sector does not seem likely in the near future either 
In addition  the steel industry is challenged by waning investments  turbulence in the financial market and geopolitical conflicts in many developing regions  Lower oil prices have pulled down prices of steel as well  given the industry s 10  exposure to the energy sector 
Steel demand from energy companies continues to be weak due to declining capital expenditure budgets  United States Steel Corp   X   which is the biggest supplier to energy companies in North America  along with AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  and ArcelorMittal  MT   remains affected by the slowdown 
U S  steel mills remain impacted by depressed capacity utilization and a torrent of unfairly traded imports  The domestic market continues to be inundated with cheap imports from overseas producers  especially from China  American steel makers including Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE    NUE   United States AK Steel  Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD  and ArcelorMittal USA  a part of ArcelorMittal  have borne the brunt of high levels of cheap imports  This has resulted in declining orders  idling of mills and layoffs across the board 
U S  steel makers thus continue to actively press the U S  regulators to stop unfair trade practices and enforce new trade laws to rescue the crisis hit American steel industry  Consequently  steel market conditions have been recovering lately  driven by favorable developments on steel trade cases in the recent past  This has resulted in a year over year fall in steel imports in the first seven months of 2016  Steel prices also have rebounded partially of late  helped by punitive trade actions that led to levy of tariffs on imports 
Sector Level Earnings Trend
Within the Zacks Industry classification  the steel industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors   The sector put up a disappointing 11 6  year over year decrease in earnings on the scoreboard for the second quarter 
Though sector growth will remain in the negative territory in the third quarter  a dip of 2 3  projected for the quarter which is not that steep compared to the previous drop  However  a dramatic recovery is projected during the fourth quarter with an 18 8  growth  The sector will log growth of 14 7  and 8 4  in the first and second quarters of 2017 respectively   For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others  please read our  report  
Industry Ranking
Within the Zacks Industry classification  the  steel producers    steel pipe and tube  and  steel specialty  industries are grouped under the Basic Materials sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   We rank all of the 255 industries in 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available on the  page 
The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 255  companies is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  85 and lower  is positive  the middle one third  Zacks Industry Rank between  86 and  170  is neutral  while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  171 and higher  is negative 
The  steel pipe and tube  and  steel specialty  industries are currently in the middle tier both with Zacks Rank of  104  which translates into a neutral outlook  The  steel producers  industries  on the other hand  are relegated to the bottom tier with a Zacks Rank  189  exhibiting a negative outlook 
What Lies Ahead 
The World Steel Association expects global apparent steel use to dip 0 8  in 2016 to 1 488 Mt  after the 3  decline in 2015  The U S  steel industry continues to face the threat of cheaper imports in the wake of a stronger dollar and lower oil prices  Steel market conditions in the U S  have improved of late  driven by favorable developments on steel trade cases in the recent past 
Steel prices recovered during the second quarter of 2016  helped by punitive trade actions that led to a levy of tariffs on imports  U S  steel producers continue to actively press the U S  regulators to stop unfair trade practices and ensure a fairer and more competitive market for American steel makers and workers 
China will remain a deterrent factor as uncertainty persists related to the impact of government measures aimed at stabilizing the decelerating economy  The International Monetary Fund projects China s growth to slow down further to 6 2  in 2016 
Meanwhile  India is anticipated to act as the next growth engine  given its progressing construction and manufacturing sectors  rapid urbanization and structural reforms  The European economy  on the other hand  is on a slow road to recovery  Steel demand in the EU is expected to inch up 1 4  in 2016  This is a positive for companies like ArcelorMittal  which generates almost half of its revenues from this region  United States Steel also has a significant presence in Europe 
Although the steel industry will remain under pressure for some time  it is certainly expected to grow thereafter on the back of the automotive and construction industries  At this juncture  we recommend stocks such as ArcelorMittal  MT  which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Ternium S A   TX  which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
However  we suggest staying away from or getting rid of Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stocks such as LB Foster Co   FSTR  and Universal Stainless   Alloy Products Inc   USAP

Industry Ranking

	Within the Zacks Industry classification  the  steel producers    steel pipe and tube  and  steel specialty  industries are grouped under the Basic Materials sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   We rank all of the 255 industries in 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available on the page 

	The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 255  companies is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  85 and lower  is positive  the middle one third  Zacks Industry Rank between  86 and  170  is neutral  while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  171 and higher  is negative 

	The  steel pipe and tube  and  steel specialty  industries are currently in the middle tier both with Zacks Rank of  104  which translates into a neutral outlook  The  steel producers  industries  on the other hand  are relegated to the bottom tier with a Zacks Rank  189  exhibiting a negative outlook 

What Lies Ahead 

	The World Steel Association expects global apparent steel use to dip 0 8  in 2016 to 1 488 Mt  after the 3  decline in 2015  The U S  steel industry continues to face the threat of cheaper imports in the wake of a stronger dollar and lower oil prices  Steel market conditions in the U S  have improved of late  driven by favorable developments on steel trade cases in the recent past 

	Steel prices recovered during the second quarter of 2016  helped by punitive trade actions that led to a levy of tariffs on imports  U S  steel producers continue to actively press the U S  regulators to stop unfair trade practices and ensure a fairer and more competitive market for American steel makers and workers 

	China will remain a deterrent factor as uncertainty persists related to the impact of government measures aimed at stabilizing the decelerating economy  The International Monetary Fund projects China s growth to slow down further to 6 2  in 2016 

	Meanwhile  India is anticipated to act as the next growth engine  given its progressing construction and manufacturing sectors  rapid urbanization and structural reforms  The European economy  on the other hand  is on a slow road to recovery  Steel demand in the EU is expected to inch up 1 4  in 2016  This is a positive for companies like ArcelorMittal  which generates almost half of its revenues from this region  United States Steel also has a significant presence in Europe

172368,393884,NUE,Steel Industry Shows Resilience  Time To Invest ,opinion,"Steel is used in every important industry  from energy  construction  automotive and transportation to infrastructure  packaging and machinery  Over the past few years  the steel industry has been reaping the benefits of accelerating growth in the developing economies  Asia  particularly China  was the principal growth driver  However  the slowdown in China has added an element of uncertainty to the outlook 
Nevertheless  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry  both in the short and the long term  Here  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Construction Sector Remains a Pillar of Strength
Amid a volatile U S  stock market  uncertainty surrounding the Fed rate hike  aftermath of Brexit and volatile oil prices  the homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy and the steel industry as well  The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel  accounting for almost half of the total consumption  Positives like an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance in 2016 
The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an economic indicator that provides an approximately 9 to 12 month glimpse into the future of non residential construction spending activity  has been at 50 or better for 21 of the last 24 months indicating reliable  manageable  sustainable growth in architectural activity  The American Institute of Architects  AIA  anticipates spending in the non residential building sector to climb 8 3  this year followed by a 6 7  climb next year  Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE   NUE  and Commercial Metals Company  CMC  are the leading steel suppliers to the non residential construction sector 
The Dodge Momentum Index grew 1 3  in August to 134 9 from its revised July reading of 133 2  It is a monthly measure of the first report for non residential building projects in planning  which have been shown to lead construction spending for non residential buildings by a full year  The Index has increased for 5 straight months  marking the longest such streak since the end of 2012 into 2013  The Momentum Index is currently 16  higher over Aug 2015  suggesting that despite sluggish economic data and the uncertainty surrounding the November elections  developers are moving ahead with their plans for new projects 
The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  reported that the home builder sentiment index  HMI  for newly constructed single family homes in August rose two points to 60 from a downwardly revised reading of 58 in July  New construction and new home sales are on an upward trend which is helping to bolster builder sentiment 
Over the long haul  as the urban population increases worldwide  the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure should see an uptrend as well  Emerging economies will continue to be major demand drivers due to the huge amount of steel required for urbanization and industrialization  Hence  demand for steel is expected to remain strong in the years to come  Companies like United States Steel Corp   X   ArcelorMittal  MT   Nucor and Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD  would benefit from the momentum in construction 
Automotive Sector in Top Gear
The automotive sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials  Besides giving a boost to the already rising U S  auto sales  cheap oil has backed a recovery in the European auto market  The rising sales trend is expected to continue in 2016 on the back of falling fuel prices  low interest rates  enhanced job security  rising wages and household wealth  improving consumer confidence  residual pent up demand  attractive deals and vehicle launches 
Moreover  the high average age of light vehicles on U S  roads is resulting in large replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  The average age is estimated to rise to 11 5 years by 2017 and 11 7 years by 2019 from 11 4 years at the end of 2013  according to forecasts by IHS Automotive  This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers 
The auto industry in Asian countries  particularly China and India  are also projected to flourish over the next five to seven years  China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold  With automakers cashing in on strong demand  steel is expected to get a proportional boost in the years to come  ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corporation  AKS  generate a large portion of their revenues from auto companies 
Indian Steel Sector to Be a Major Driver
India  though currently the fourth largest producer of steel in the world  is expected to record exponential growth in the future  This will be fueled by increasing urbanization and projected growth in the infrastructure  automobile and real estate sectors 
The country s comparatively low per capita steel consumption and the anticipated rise in consumption due to increased infrastructure construction  along with the thriving automobile and railways sectors  offer huge scope for growth  In fact  as per the World Steel Association  steel demand in the sub continent is projected to grow 5 4  in 2016 through 2017 to attain a peak of 88 3 Mt in 2017 
Steady Growth in Developed Economies
Developed economies are expected to witness a stable recovery momentum  albeit at a slow pace  Steel demand in these regions will grow 1 7  in 2016 and 1 1  in 2017  In the EU  steel demand is recovering in tandem with generally improving economic sentiments and investment conditions  Demand is projected to grow 1 4  in 2016 and another 1 7  in 2017  In the U S   an improving job market and a strong housing sector will support growth in steel demand of 3 2  in 2016 and 2 7  in 2017 
Imposing Anti Dumping Duties
U S  steel companies have been hammered by a tide of cheap imports over the past few years that largely contributed to the slump in steel prices  Low costs of production have allowed overseas producers to sell their products at cheaper rates  leading to an industry wide price decline 
Big U S  steel producers   U S Steel  AK Steel  Nucor  Steel Dynamics and ArcelorMittal USA    retaliated by filing anti dumping petitions in Jul 2015 with the U S  International Trade Commission   USITC   and the DOC  alleging illegal dumping of cold rolled steel that is used to make automotive products and appliances  among others  The regulator found that imports of cold rolled steel flat products have caused or threatened to cause material injury to the U S  steel industry and thus imposed hefty anti dumping duty and countervailing duty on these imports 
In a similar development  earlier this month  The USITC made its final determinations on anti dumping and countervailing duty investigations on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries  Australia  Brazil  Japan  South Korea  the Netherlands  the U K  and Turkey  into the American market  Hot rolled steel is used in appliances  automotive products  heavy machinery  machine parts  commercial construction and transportation equipment 
As a result of the USITC s affirmative findings  the DOC will now issue countervailing duty orders on imports of hot rolled steel products from Brazil and South Korea and anti dumping duty orders on imports from Australia  Brazil  Japan  South Korea  the Netherlands  Turkey and the U K  These actions are expected to assist American steel makers defend their turf against illegally dumped steel products and improve the margins of steel companies 
How to Play the Industry
As you can see  there are many reasons to be optimistic about the steel industry over the long haul  We particularly recommend stocks such as ArcelorMittal which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Stocks such as Ternium S A   TX  and Angang Steel Company Limited  ANGGY  are also good bests with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
However  the glut in cheap imports and slowdown in China will continue to weigh on the industry  In this scenario  staying away from stocks with an unfavorable Zacks Rank should be the right strategy  We strongly suggest steering clear from or getting rid of stocks with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  including LB Foster Co   FSTR  and Universal Stainless   Alloy Products Inc   USAP

172369,393885,NUE,What s Ailing The Steel Industry ,opinion,"The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the U S and emerging markets like India  However  steel stocks have to struggle with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
A Rise in Cheap Imports in the U S 
A slump in the domestic property market  which accounts for a significant part of China s steel consumption  severe credit crunch and weak infrastructure investment are hurting steel demand in China 
China s steel exports crossed the benchmark of 100 Mt for the first time last year in the wake of shrinking domestic demand amid a flagging economy  Notably  China is the world s top steel producer  contributing around half of the total global output 
The country has built up massive excess capacity  posing a threat to the global steel industry  The worsening gap between supply and demand  along with barely any sign of a recovery  further clouds the picture  The Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for the Chinese steel industry has stayed below the mark of 50 for the past two years  indicating a noticeable disparity between supply and demand  These cheap imports hurt the margins of American steel players like Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD   United States Steel Corp   X   ArcelorMittal  MT   AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  and Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE    NUE  
Slowdown in China
As discussed above  demand in China has slowed down due to the country s tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment  China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the second quarter of 2016  flat with the first quarter  marking its slowest in seven years  For 2016  the government anticipates the growth rate to remain in the range of 6 5 7  
While rebalancing progresses  the Chinese economy continues to slow down  Lower construction activities are leading to a slowdown in the manufacturing sectors  especially metal products  A recovery in the construction sector is not expected any time soon either  In fact  steel demand in China is projected to be in the negative territory with respective declines of 4  and 3  in 2016 and 2017 
Geopolitical Tensions
Performance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues  lower commodity prices associated with China s economic slowdown  and escalating political instability  Russia and Brazil are experiencing severe contraction in steel demand  Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East  Africa continues to have a negative effect  Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand  In fact  the country s steel demand is estimated to contract 8 8  in 2016  followed by a recovery of 3 1  in 2017 
Excess Capacity   a Perennial Problem
The biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity  further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth 
To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and to raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels  The industry remains highly fragmented compared to other global businesses and the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace 
Impact of Low Oil Prices
The energy sector  which was once buoyant due to shale discoveries and rising production of crude oil  accounts for 10  of steel consumption in the U S  Steel is necessary to make rigs and transport oil  Steel demand from the energy sector is being impacted as exploration companies have reduced their capital expenditure budgets in the wake of tumbling oil prices 
Steel products used by the energy industry are also known as oil country tubular goods  or OCTG   U S  Steel being the biggest supplier of these goods in North America is bearing most of the impact 
Steel demand from the energy sector could weaken even further in 2016  Falling oil prices would urge energy companies to preserve capital to shore up their balance sheets instead of spending money on new exploration  Thus  leading suppliers to the energy sector  such as United States Steel and Tenaris S A  TS   could continue to be under pressure throughout the year 
Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization
The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in both 2014 and 2015  The average capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016 was 67 6   Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive and rationalize operations  some major steel companies have resorted to idling their steel plants 
Increasing Use of Aluminum in Auto Industry
Currently  steel is the major raw material for the auto industry  the second largest steel consumer  However  major automakers like Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co   F   General Motors Company  NYSE GM   GM  and others are becoming increasingly aluminum intensive  given the metal s recyclability and light weight properties  The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025  Hence  in order to remain competitive  the steel companies will have to come up with better and lighter varieties of steel 
Falling Iron Ore Prices
In the next few years  a wave of new supply of iron ore is slated to hit the market as the  big three  producers   BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited  BHP   Rio Tinto  LON RIO  plc  RIO   and Vale S A  VALE  are going gung ho with their expansion plans to improvement production capacity  Brazil and India will also step up their exports 
The combination of weak demand and oversupply will continue to exert pressure iron prices in the near term  The world s biggest iron ore exporter  Australia has cut its iron ore price forecast for 2016 to  44 2 a metric ton as the market fundamentals    slow demand growth and a well supplied market remain the same 
Companies like ArcelorMittal and U S  Steel meet their raw material requirements through their captive iron ore mines  While the steel operations of these two companies will reap the benefits of falling iron ore prices  profitability of their iron mining operations are likely to be affected by the same 
How to Play the Industry
The short term prospects are a bit clouded considering the headwinds plaguing the steel industry globally as discussed above  So  it would be prudent to stay away from steel stocks that carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank now  Particularly  we suggest staying away from Zacks Rank  4 stocks including POSCO  PKX   Companhia Sider rgica Nacional  SID   TimkenSteel Corp   TMST  and Olympic Steel Inc   ZEUS  
However  investors  who can look beyond the near term clouds to the industry s bright long term prospects  may consider buying some steel stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank  We highly recommend ArcelorMittal  carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Low PEG Stocks Value Investors Will Love 

Investment has never been as daring a task as it is today  with the world stock market shaken by multiple factors   economic or otherwise  So  the biggest challenge is how to keep our portfolio safe and lucrative 

If we have to go by Warren Buffet s formula  it is value investing that can offer the succor we need during tough times  Value investing has especially proven its worth during times of market crash or global downturn 

However  failing to choose the right value strategy  which gives investors a precise idea about the intrinsic value of a stock  may lead to traps  In other words  it could lead to a situation when these picks start to underperform  as those temporary problems which once drove the share price down may turn out to be endemic  To avoid such value traps  Buffet has advised investors to keep a focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  And here comes the significance of an out in the cold value investing metric  the PEG ratio 

The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth Rate

A lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors 

While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps finding the intrinsic value of a stock 

There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term 

Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration 

Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy 

PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median

P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median

Zacks Rank of 1 or 2   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success 

Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion   This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 20 000   A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5    Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness 

Value Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

Here are 5 of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening 

AngloGold Ashanti Ltd        This gold mining and exploration company currently carries a Zacks Rank  1 and a Value Style Score  B   The company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 27 6  

Companhia de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo       This popular name in the field of basic and environmental sanitation services in Sao Paolo currently holds a Zacks Rank  1 and a Value Style score  A   The company registered an earnings surprise of 20  in its last reported quarter 

Nucor Corporation       NUE is a steel and steel products manufacturer in the U S  This Zacks Rank  2 and Value Style Score  B  company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 27 6  

Seagate Technology plc       This worldwide provider of electronic data storage products can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  2 and Value Style Score  A  

Steel Dynamics Inc        This manufacturer and seller of steel products in the U S  holds a Zacks Rank  2 and a Value Style Score  A   The company has delivered an earnings surprise of 3 57  in its last reported quarter with a trailing 12 month earnings beat of 12 29

172384,393900,NUE,Commercial Metals Co  Downgraded To  Neutral  At Bank Of America Corp ,opinion,"Commercial Metals Company  NYSE CMC  was downgraded by equities researchers at Bank of America Corp  to a  neutral  rating in a report released on Wednesday 

The analysts wrote   We continue to think NUE represents a relatively attractive investment opportunity within our coverage  but expect limited catalysts on falling steel prices and more recent full valuation   analyst Timna Tanners wrote in a note Related Link  Barclays Adjusts Price Targets On AK Steel  CONSOL Energy  NYSE CNX  And OthersOn Thursday s second quarter call  the analyst said investors will focus on how much spare capacity Nucor  NYSE NUE  might be able to contribute to a relatively tight sheet market after the company reportedly operated at 105 percent of capacity at its sheet mills   We expect benign market commentary  similar to STLD  although our channel checks indicate gaps of  145 200 t on delivered sheet imports relative to domestic prices  We would be keen for an update on NUE s plans for cash use given its also substantial cash hoard of  2 3 billion as of Q116   Tanners noted Meanwhile  the analyst added that Nucor has more long products exposure than Steel Dynamics  but less than Commercial Metals Company  NYSE  CMC  at about 39 percent of 2015 sales  and has also been growing volumes in its fabricated segment Looking Forward NUE remains relatively defensive due to variable costs and LIFO earnings  which can help offset any hit from falling prices  It also tends to import scrap  so can benefit on the margin from a stronger dollar arbitrage on scrap costs   Tanners highlighted  That said  the analyst cut 2016 EPS view to reflect expected long product margin squeeze into the second quarter and lower volumes in the third  Tanners lowered 2016 EPS forecast to  2 40 from  2 45  The analyst also trimmed 2016 revenue estimate to  18 39 billion from  18 44 billion  Average selling prices can be supported for the near term from trailing contract prices  but we expect lower prices into Q4E on our view that lower global prices ultimately pressure a lofty U S  premium lower

172423,393939,NUE,Should Western Steelmakers Exit The Commodity End Of The Market ,opinion,"It s not an unreasonable question  Certainly in Europe  few if any steelmakers are making any money 
Capacity utilization is woefully low forcing steelmakers to fight for sales and depriving them of any price setting opportunities  Steelmakers and much of the media lay the blame on China s doorstep  Although over half of China s major producers made losses in 2015  exports soared by 20  to 112 million metric tons last year  more than the total output of the world s second largest producer  Japan 

Source  Financial Times
Meanwhile  Europe s steel demand is 25  lower than before the 2008 financial crisis according to the Financial Times and  although there has been some rationalization  it has been limited 
The Future of European Steel
Alessandro Abate  an analyst at Berenberg  is quoted by the FT with a hard hitting but no doubt accurate comment   The future of  European  steel lies in consolidation  If they don t do it now they should stop complaining about Chinese overcapacity  They need to lower costs and distribute the workload across the most efficient assets  
While there is much truth in this  the issue is probably more profound than just consolidation  Wolfgang Eder  chief executive of Voestalpine AG  LON 0MKX   an Austria based producer had this to say about it 
 The European cost structure does not allow you to produce steel commodities in a competitive way  When you look at the world  80  at least of the total steel production is commodities   meaning if steelmakers in developed markets continue to take on China s subsidized steelmakers in the commodity end of the market  they will continue to lose money 
In Eder s opinion  steelmakers need to develop flexibility   since it is a highly cyclical business   and focus on high quality  high technology steel products  Not surprisingly  he is pointing to his own firm as an example  To be fair he has a point  When British Steel and Hoogovens consolidated in the late 1990 s and Arcelor  NYSE MT  and Mittal Steel merged in the following decade it was all about size and economies of scale to pump out commodity steel products 
A Changing Industry
Meanwhile Voestalpine concentrated on downstream investment in processing and value add engineering capabilities  Today about two thirds of the group s  11bn revenue come from sales of engineered components  complete structures and high tech parts  such as for automobiles and aircraft  This has helped shielded Voestalpine from some of the downward pressure on prices from cheaper products from emerging market competitors 
Rivals see the logic  ArcelorMittal announced this week the introduction of their new automotive steel Usibor 2000 said to be one third stronger than those currently available for automaking and allowing car companies to reduce weight without making the switch to more costly aluminum 
Yet  such opportunities are limited  Niche areas by definition are  well  niche  so volumes are lower  When demand fluctuates running expensive blast furnaces can be a drain  they can t be turned on and off quickly yet require massive investment to build and represent a huge capital cost 
Historically  ArcelorMittal s approach of rolling such automotive sheet from blast furnace cast slab has been the accepted practice but in the U S  Nucor  NYSE NUE  has become the largest U S  steelmaker in part because of the greater flexibility the electric arc furnace production route allows them and  in part  through innovation 
EAF plants usually produce long products but Nucor rolls sheet used in demanding applications such as automotive steel from its EAF furnaces  Interestingly  one of the  solutions  proposed for saving TATA STEEL  NS TISC  U K  s Port Talbot steel mill is the replacement of the plant s blast furnaces with EAF technology  Such innovation may come too late for Port Talbot  but investment in downstream value add steelmaking technologies and processes remains the best long term solution for Europe s steelmakers

In the first quarter of 2016  per the World Steel Association  global steel production decreased 3 6  to 386 metric tons  Mt  as production shrank across all regions  China  the world s largest steel maker  again disappointed with a 3 2  decline 
Economic slowdown in China has dealt a massive blow to the global steel industry  Overcapacity and lower steel prices are hurting margins of Chinese steel producers  To mitigate these factors  efforts have been undertaken to reduce overcapacity and upgrade production in China s steel industry 
China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the first quarter of 2016  marking its slowest in seven years  For 2016  the government expects the growth rate to remain in the range of 6 5 7   Having stubbornly remained below 50 for the past two years  the Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for the Chinese steel industry rose to 57 3 in April  A reading above 50 marks growth  while that below 50 suggests contraction  which means that the PMI for the Chinese steel industry touched its peak since Mar 2013  However  it is still too early to predict a recovery for certain 
Meanwhile  according to the World Steel Association s short range outlook published in April  steel usage in China is expected to fall 4  in 2016  The severe depression in construction activities is leading to a slowdown in the manufacturing sectors  especially metal products  as well as to slower growth in the automotive sector  A recovery in the Chinese construction sector does not seem likely in the near future either

Industry Ranking
Within the Zacks Industry classification  the  steel producers    steel pipe and tube  and  steel specialty  industries are grouped under the Basic Materials sector  We rank all of the 257 industries under 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available on the  page 
The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257  companies is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  86 and lower  is positive  the middle one third  Zacks Industry Rank between  87 and  173  is neutral  while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  174 and higher  is negative 
The  steel pipe and tube  and  steel producers  are currently in the top most tier with respective Zacks Ranks of  63 and  78  which translates into a positive outlook  The  steel specialty  industries  on the other hand  are relegated to the bottom tier with a Zacks Rank  249  depicting a negative outlook 
What s in Store for the Industry 
The World Steel Association expects global apparent steel use to dip 0 8  in 2016 to 1 488 Mt  after the decline in 2015  The U S  steel industry continues to face the threat of cheaper imports in the wake of a stronger dollar and lower oil prices  However  the U S  Department of Commerce  DOC  has imposed a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on imports of cold rolled steel from China  The DOC also levied a massive final countervailing duty rate of 256 44  on Chinese imports  higher than the preliminary duty rate of 227 29  imposed in Dec 2015  This should prove to be a major boost for U S  steel companies in their battle against unfairly traded  cheap imports into the country s market 
China will remain a deterrent factor as uncertainty persists related to the impact of government measures aimed at stabilizing the decelerating economy  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  projects China s growth to slow down further to 6 2  in 2016  Moreover  currency devaluation would make Chinese exports competitive in the global markets  Thus  we foresee a further increase in Chinese steel exports this year  as the country seeks to increase overall exports to counter the domestic slowdown 
Meanwhile  much hope is pinned on India  which is expected to act as the next growth engine  given its progressing construction and manufacturing sectors  rapid urbanization and structural reforms  The European economy  on the other hand  is on a slow road to recovery  Steel demand in the EU is expected to inch up 1 4  in 2016  This is a positive for companies like ArcelorMittal  which generates almost half of its revenues from this region  U S  Steel also has a significant presence in Europe 
Although the steel industry will remain under pressure for some time  it is certainly expected to grow thereafter on the back of the automotive and construction industries ",2016-05-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/steel-industry-stock-outlook---may-2016-200132076,200132076

172455,393971,NUE,Will The Steel Industry Buckle Under These Factors ,opinion,"The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the U S  and emerging markets like India  However  steel stocks have to grapple with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
A Rise in Cheap Imports in the U S 
A slump in the domestic property market  which accounts for a significant part of China s steel consumption  severe credit crunch and weak infrastructure investment are hurting steel demand in China 
China s steel exports crossed the benchmark of 100 million tons for the first time last year in the wake of shrinking domestic demand amid a flagging economy  Notably  China is the world s top steel producer  contributing around half of the total global output 
The country has built up a massive excess capacity  posing a threat to the global steel industry  The worsening gap between supply and demand  along with barely any sign of a recovery  further clouds the picture  The Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for the Chinese steel industry has stayed below the mark of 50 for the past two years  indicating a noticeable disparity between supply and demand  These cheap imports hurt the margins of American steel players like Steel Dynamics Inc   STLD   United States Steel Corp   X   ArcelorMittal  MT   AK Steel Holding Corp   AKS  and Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE    NUE  
Slowdown in China
As discussed above  demand in China has slowed down due to the country s tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment  China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the first quarter of 2016  marking its slowest in seven years  For 2016  the government expects the growth rate to remain in the range of 6 5 7  
While rebalancing progresses  the Chinese economy continues to slow down  Lower construction activities are leading to a slowdown in the manufacturing sectors  especially metal products  A recovery in the construction sector is not expected any time soon either  In fact  steel demand in China is expected to be in the negative territory with respective declines of 4  and 3  in 2016 and 2017 
Geopolitical Tensions
Performance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues  lower commodity prices associated with China s economic slowdown  and escalating political instability  Russia and Brazil are experiencing severe contraction in steel demand  Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East  Africa continues to have a negative effect  Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand  In fact  the country s steel demand is expected to contract 8 8  in 2016  followed by a recovery of only 3 1  in 2017 
Excess Capacity   a Perennial Problem
The biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity  further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth 
To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and to raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels  The industry remains highly fragmented compared to other global businesses  and the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace Falling Oil Prices
The energy sector  which was once buoyant due to shale discoveries and rising production of crude oil  accounts for 10  of steel consumption in the U S  Steel is necessary to make rigs and transport oil  Steel demand from the energy sector is being affected as exploration companies have reduced their capital expenditure budgets in the wake of tumbling oil prices Steel products used by the energy industry are also known as oil country tubular goods  or OCTG   U S  Steel being the biggest supplier of these goods in North America is bearing most of the brunt 
Steel demand from the energy sector could weaken even further in 2016  Falling oil prices would urge energy companies to preserve capital to shore up their balance sheets instead of spending money on new exploration  Thus  leading suppliers to the energy sector  such as United States Steel and Tenaris S A  TS   could continue to be under pressure throughout the year 
Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization
The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in both 2014 and 2015  The average capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016 was 67 6   Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive and rationalize operations  some major steel companies have resorted to idling their steel plants 
Increasing Use of Aluminum in Auto Industry
Currently  steel is the major raw material for the auto industry  the second largest steel consumer  However  major automakers like Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co   F   General Motors Company  NYSE GM  and others are becoming increasingly aluminum intensive  given the metal s recyclability and light weight properties  The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025  Hence  in order to remain competitive  the steel companies will have to come up with better and lighter varieties of steel 
Falling Iron Ore Prices
In the next few years  a wave of new supply of iron ore is slated to hit the market as the  big three  producers   BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited  BHP   Rio Tinto  LON RIO  plc  RIO   and Vale S A  VALE  are going gung ho with their expansion plans to augment production capacity  Brazil and India will also step up their exports  The combination of weak demand and oversupply will continue to exert pressure iron prices in the near term 
Companies like ArcelorMittal and U S  Steel meet their raw material requirements through their captive iron ore mines  While the steel operations of these two companies will reap the benefits of falling iron ore prices  profitability of their iron mining operations are likely to be affected by the same 
Bottom Line
We have here discussed in details the headwinds plaguing the steel industry worldwide  But what about investing in the space right now   are there opportunities for the short term investors Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is shaping up for the future ",2016-05-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-steel-industry-buckle-under-these-factors-200132594,200132594

Chicago  IL   May 27  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Steel  part 2  including Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE       Commercial Metals Co     United States Steel Corp      ArcelorMittal     and Steel Dynamics Inc      

Industry  Steel  part 2

Link  

Over the past few years  the steel industry has been reaping the benefits of accelerating growth in the developing economies  Asia  particularly China  was the principal growth driver  However  the recent turnaround has rendered the scenario slightly concerning as China began to add an element of uncertainty to the outlook 

Nevertheless  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry  both in the short and the long term  Here we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 

Rebound in Construction Sector

The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today  accounting for almost half of the total consumption  Improved job numbers  a recovering economy and growing consumer confidence  moderating home price gains  affordable interest mortgage rates  rising rentals  rapidly rising household formation and a limited supply of inventory all point to continually strong demand trends in 2016 

The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an economic indicator that provides an approximately 9 to 12 month glimpse into the future of non residential construction spending activity  has lately remained over 50  Note that a score above 50 indicates an increase in billings  The American Institute of Architects  AIA  anticipates spending in the non residential building sector to climb 8 3  this year  Nucor Corp      and Commercial Metals Co     are the leading steel suppliers to the non residential construction sector 

The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  reported that the homebuilder sentiment index  HMI  remained flat for the fourth consecutive month in May at 58  This indicates steady growth in the sector driven by an improving job market and low mortgage rates 

Over the long haul  as the urban population increases worldwide  the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure should see an uptrend as well  Emerging economies will continue to be major demand drivers due to the huge amount of steel required for urbanization and industrialization  Hence  demand for steel is expected to remain strong in the years to come  Companies like United States Steel Corp       ArcelorMittal     Nucor Corp  and Steel Dynamics Inc     would benefit from the momentum in construction 

Booming Automotive Sector

The automotive sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials  Besides giving a boost to the already rising U S  auto sales  cheap oil has backed a recovery in the European auto market  The rising sales trend is expected to continue in 2016 on the back of falling fuel prices  low interest rates  enhanced job security  rising wages and household wealth  improving consumer confidence  residual pent up demand  attractive deals and vehicle launches 

Moreover  the high average age of light vehicles on U S  roads is resulting in large replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  The average age is expected to rise to 11 5 years by 2017 and 11 7 years by 2019 from 11 4 years at the end of 2013  according to forecasts by IHS Automotive  This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers 

The auto industry in Asian countries  particularly China and India  are also expected to flourish over the next five to seven years  China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold  With automakers cashing in on strong demand  steel is expected to get a proportional boost in the years to come  ArcelorMittal generates a large portion of its revenues from auto companies 

Indian Steel Sector to Be Major Driver

India is currently the fourth largest producer of steel in the world  The Indian steel industry is expected to record exponential growth in the future  riding on increasing urbanization and projected growth in the infrastructure  automobile and real estate sectors 

The country s comparatively low per capita steel consumption and the expected rise in consumption due to increased infrastructure construction  along with the thriving automobile and railways sectors  offer huge scope for growth  In fact  as per the World Steel Association  steel demand in the sub continent is projected to grow 5 4  in 2016 through 2017 to attain a peak of 88 3 Mt in 2017 

Steady Growth in Developed Economies

Developed economies are expected to witness a stable recovery momentum  albeit at a slow pace  Steel demand in these regions will grow 1 7  in 2016 and 1 1  in 2017  In the EU  steel demand is recovering in tandem with generally improving economic sentiments and investment conditions  Demand is projected to grow 1 4  in 2016 and another 1 7  in 2017  In the U S   an improving job market and a strong housing sector will support growth in steel demand of 3 2  in 2016 and 2 7  in 2017 

Imposing Anti Dumping Duties

U S  steel companies have been hammered by a tide of cheap imports over the past few years that largely contributed to the slump in steel prices  Biggest U S  steel producers   U S  Steel  AK Steel  Nucor  Steel Dynamics and ArcelorMittal USA  part of ArcelorMittal  retaliated by filing anti dumping petitions in Jul 2015 with the U S  International Trade Commission   USITC   and the DOC against eight countries  Brazil  China  India  Japan  the Netherlands  Russia  South Korea and the UK  alleging illegal dumping of cold rolled steel that is used to make automotive products and appliances  among others 

The petitions stated that an influx of subsidized imports of cold rolled steel from these foreign producers is causing serious injury to the country s steel industry as they are capturing an increasing share of the U S  market  thereby hurting production  shipments  selling prices and margins of U S  steel makers 

On May 17  The U S  DOC concluded that both China and Japan are selling these products in the American market below their fair values and therefore  would be subject to anti dumping duties 

The DOC thus imposed a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on imports of cold rolled steel from China  The department also issued its final rulings on countervailing duty investigations on imports of cold rolled steel from China  Moreover  it levied a massive final countervailing duty rate of 256 44  on Chinese imports  higher than the preliminary duty rate of 227 29  imposed in Dec 2015  The commerce department is now expected to issue its final rulings on imports of cold rolled steel from Brazil  India  Korea  Russia and the UK on July 13 

These actions are expected to assist American steel makers defend their turf against illegally dumped steel products and boost the margins of steel companies

U S  Thumps China with Heavy Tariffs on Steel Imports

The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   has made its final decision on anti dumping investigations on imports of corrosion resistant steel and concluded that China  India  Italy  South Korea and Taiwan are selling these products in the U S  market below their fair values and therefore  are subject to anti dumping duties  The ruling marks yet another major step in stemming the torrent of unfairly traded foreign imports 

Corrosion resistant steel is coated with a corrosion or heat resistant metal such as zinc and aluminum to prevent corrosion  thus extending the service life of the products made from the steel  It is used in making automobiles  trucks  appliances  and industrial and agricultural equipment 

The biggest U S  steel producers  in Jun 2015  filed anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions with the U S  International Trade Commission  USITC  and the DOC against five countries accused for illegally dumping cheap corrosion resistant steel 

The petitions  which were filed by six major U S  steelmakers including Nucor     U S  Steel     AK Steel     Steel Dynamics    and ArcelorMittal USA   a part of ArcelorMittal       charge that a deluge of significantly subsidized imports of corrosion resistant steel from China  India  Italy  South Korea and Taiwan are causing material injury to the U S  steel industry  The petitions also charge that these producers benefit from a number of countervailable subsidies provided by their respective governments 

Imports of corrosion resistant steel from China  India  Italy  South Korea  and Taiwan were valued at an estimated  500 3 million   219 6 million   110 million   509 1 million  and  534 4 million  respectively  in 2015  combined value of nearly  1 9 billion   These products are being illegally dumped by foreign steel producers in the American market at unfairly low prices that significantly undercut the prices of U S  steel makers 

The DOC  on Wednesday  imposed a whopping final anti dumping duty rate of 209 97  on imports of these products from China  This will hurt Chinese exporters including Yieh Phui  China  Technomaterial Co  Ltd and Jiangyin Zongcheng Steel Co  Ltd  India  Taiwan  South Korea  and Italy received anti dumping duties in the range of 3 05  to 92 12  

The commerce department also issued its final rulings on countervailing duty investigations on imports of corrosion resistant steel from the five countries  The regulator levied final countervailing duty rate in the band of 39 05  to 241 07  on Chinese imports  With respect to Taiwan  the DOC s final countervailing duty determinations were negative and hence  no countervailing duties were imposed on imports from that country 

The DOC will now instruct U S  Customs and Border Protection   CBP   to start requiring cash deposits based on the final anti dumping duty rates  The commerce department will also order the CBP to require cash deposits  based on the final countervailing duty rate  in applicable cases should the USITC issues an affirmative injury determination  The USITC is expected to make its final injury rulings on July 8 

The latest trade actions came after the DOC s affirmative final rulings on the cold rolled steel case  announced last week  The regulator  on May 17  levied a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on imports of cold rolled steel from China  The commerce department also levied a massive final countervailing duty rate of 256 44  on Chinese imports  The USITC is expected to make its final injury ruling on cold rolled steel case on June 30 

In Mar 2016  the DOC also imposed preliminary anti dumping duties on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries  A final ruling by the DOC on this case is expected in August 

China has reportedly criticized Washington s latest trade actions  calling them  harmful   The country s Ministry of Commerce said yesterday that it will take all necessary actions to gain fair treatment and protect the interests of Chinese steel firms 

The U S  steel producers are still struggling to cope with falling steel prices as a result of the combined impact of imports and overcapacity in the industry  Low costs of production have allowed overseas producers  especially China  to sell their products at cheaper rates  leading to an industry wide price decline 

China  which accounts for around 50  of global steel output  continues to pose a threat to the U S  steel industry  The Chinese steel industry continues to reel under massive excess steel capacity and sluggish domestic demand amid a cooling economy  China s economy rose at an annual rate of 6 7  in the first quarter of 2016  its slowest in seven years 

Beijing has been repeatedly criticized by the U S  and the European Union for dumping its excess steel capacity in the overseas markets at unfairly low prices  China s steel exports jumped 7 6  year over year in the first four months of 2016  per customs data   indicating sustained demand weakness at home 

The USITC  yesterday  launched a probe into the allegations contained in U S  Steel s complaint against Chinese steel producers  U S  Steel  in April  lodged a complaint with the USITC  asking the regulator to start an investigation against biggest Chinese steel producers and their distributors  The complaint alleges three clauses of action   illegal conspiracy to fix prices  theft of trade secrets and circumvention of trade duties by false labeling  U S  Steel is seeking the exclusion of all unfairly traded Chinese steel products from the U S  market 

Steel market conditions in the U S  have somewhat improved of late  thanks to favorable rulings on steel trade cases in the recent past  Domestic steel makers continue to actively press the U S  regulators to stop unfair trade practices and enforce new trade laws to rescue the crisis hit U S  steel industry

172458,393974,NUE,Tata Steel Might Accept A UK Pension Bailout,opinion,"There are seven suitors in the ring for the United Kingdom assets of Tata Steel  but is the Indian steelmaker possibly rethinking selling the unit off and planning to keeping the business 
A  quotes  sources close to Tata Steel  have claimed that Tata  even as it was going through the motions of the sale process   was evaluating  the performance of its U K  operations and the package of financial support that the U K  government offered 
Hit by cheap Chinese steel imports  as elsewhere in the world  in addition to supply glut  Britain s steel industry   In March this year  Tata Steel announced that it wanted to sell its remaining plants in the country  putting over 11 000 jobs at risk 
By May  there were seven suitors from across the globe including one from China  North America and even India itself who were knocking on Tata s doors  wanting to buy the U K  operations  With the deadline for potential buyers to make formal bids over  it passed on Monday   it was widely expected that a shortlist would be ready this week at Tata s board meeting  but that did not happen  The company has not given a timeline for when the sale process would be complete 
Why No Update 
U K  Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones met with Tata executives in Mumbai prior to the board meeting  Officially  it was not revealed what was discussed in this meeting 
But the Guardian report said Javid asked Tata to  consider keeping the business   As it is  the U K  government was willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to the buyer of Tata Steel U K   and was also looking at ways to restructure the pension scheme  which sits at the heart of the sale controversy 
The scheme had liabilities of an estimated  15 billion and costs more than  100 million a year to support  The Guardian report seemed to suggest that included in Javid s proposal was that the same terms would be extended to Tata Steel if it was prepared to hold its stake in the business 
Bailout To Stay 
Just prior to a referendum on British membership of the European Union  the U K  government wanted to avoid job losses  and so had offered financial support to help find a new buyer for Tata Steel U K 
At a press briefing  too  Finance Director Koushik Chatterjee said the management was looking  at continuing and sustaining the business   though he added a footnote   I don t think we have a case yet  
But some Tata insiders  according to the Guardian  did not rule out the possibility of Tata Steel staying on  Tata Steel was aiming for the end of June to complete the sale 
The bidders
Those who have expressed interested in Tata s U K  operations are 
Greybull Capital  which has already bought Tata s long products business  via a management buyout vehicle 
Excalibur Steel  led by Stuart Wilkie  the head of Tata s U K  strip steel unit  based in South Wales 
India s second biggest steel producer  JSW Steel 
China s Hebei Iron and Steel Group 
Endless  one of the U K  s largest turnaround specialists based in Leeds 
Liberty House  which has already taken over struggling operations such as parts of Caparo and Tata s Scottish plants 
South Carolina based Nucor  NYSE NUE   one of North America s largest recyclers and steelmakers 
On Wednesday  British Prime Minister David Cameron  on his way to a G7 meeting  said that his government was continuing to work towards trying to get a good outcome for Tata in South Wales  the sales process was under way  and there had been an encouraging number of serious offers ",2016-06-01,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tata-might-hang-in-and-accept-a-tata-steel-uk-pension-bailout-200133244,200133244
172477,393993,NUE,NUE  A Dividend Aristocrat Yielding 4 2 ,opinion,"Nucor  N NUE  has increased its dividend for 43 consecutive years   every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973  For a company operating in the often challenging steel market  such consistency is remarkable 
The stock also offers the fifth highest dividend yield  4 3   out of all the dividend aristocrats  perhaps making it an interesting candidate for investors living off dividends in retirement to consider 
While the stock is not in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio today  the company possesses several competitive advantages that dividend growth investors should be aware of 
Business OverviewNUE manufactures steel products in the U S  and Canada and began operating its first mini mill in the late 1960s  With production capacity that exceeds 27 million tons  NUE is the largest manufacturer of steel products in North America 
Some of the main products NUE produces are carbon and alloy steel  used in bars  beams  sheets  and plates   steel piling  steel joists  steel deck  concrete reinforcing steel  cold finished steel  and steel fasteners  Steel is sold into a variety of end markets  but non residential construction and automotive markets are the biggest drivers for NUE 
2014 sales by product type  sheet  32    bar  22    raw materials  15    downstream products  11    structural  10    plate  10   Business AnalysisNUE is in a tough business  The price of steel is extremely volatile  demand trends are unpredictable  raw material costs can significantly fluctuate  and many overseas competitors are happy to irrationally flood the market with supply 
So  how has NUE not only survived these challenges but also managed to raise its dividend with such consistency over the last 40  years 
In a commodity business such as steel  it s all about cost  NUE runs an extremely lean business model that has made it one of the lowest cost producers in the world 
Steel is generally manufactured in one of two ways  Traditional steel mills rely on iron ore  blast furnaces  and unionized labor  Mini mills such as NUE take a different approach  using recycled metal  steel scrap  and electricity to manufacture steel  These raw materials are usually cheaper than iron ore and require less labor and capital in their manufacturing process  Scrap prices also tend to move with steel prices  providing a bit of a hedge throughout the steel cycle  e g  if demand for steel falls  NUE s primary input cost will also likely fall in price  helping protect gross profit to an extent  
As a result  mini mills have more variable cost structures and production schedules that can be quickly adjusted up or down in response to market conditions  NUE also has a nonunion workforce that receives over 60  of its pay in the form of incentive bonuses  which protect the company s profits during periods of depressed demand 
While the majority of steel manufacturers in the U S  have transitioned to mini mills  one of the biggest players still uses blast furnaces   U S  Steel  However    recognizing their relative effectiveness and superior profitability 
As seen below  United States Steel Corporation  N X  burned through substantial cash during the financial crisis and was forced to cut its dividend Source  U S  Steel  Simply Safe Dividends
On the other hand  NUE s low cost  capital light  labor union free  and flexible mini mill model kept generating free cash flow throughout the entire period Source  Nucor  Simply Safe Dividends
NUE also reduces its cost structure and volatility by vertically integrating  it is the largest steel recycler in the country   The company has primarily used recycled metal and steel scrap to manufacture steel  but it has increased its use of direct reduced iron  DRI  as a raw material  recently building a DRI plant in Louisiana 
DRI allows the company to create higher quality products that are more profitable and less subject to import competition  These products are typically required to meet certain specifications  often need just in time delivery  and have less margin of error  i e  it would be costly for customers to return these products to China if they aren t made right the first time  
NUE is also the most diversified steel producer in North America  which reduces the company s dependence on any one end market  Its large size also provides economies of scale to further reduce costs  Essentially  NUE is the best house in a bad neighborhood Key RisksSteel is a commodity  and commodities are priced based on supply and demand  Companies that produce commodities are typically subjected to the market s ups and downs unless they can somehow constrain supply 
Unfortunately  the market for steel is global  and China is the biggest producer  According to World Steel   in 2014 
While NUE has one of the lowest cost profiles in the U S   there is little it can do to combat the Chinese producers that receive subsidies from China s government and have lower labor costs  Government subsidies allow them to dump steel in the U S  at extremely competitive prices  When the U S  market is seeing strong demand for steel  it is a magnet for foreign imports  which account for about one third of the U S  market 
The Wall Street Journal  that did a nice job covering the challenges faced by the two major remaining steel manufacturers in the U S   NUE and U S  Steel   It noted that surging Chinese steel production had pushed steel prices down by 23  since January 2015  causing NUE and U S  Steel to ask the government for protective import tariffs on steel from China and four other countries 
Most recently  NUE noted during its third quarter 2015 conference call that China s global steel exports surged by 27  in the first eight months of the year  They are on track to exceed 100 million tons  which is greater than the total U S  steel production in 2014  Many steel markets around the world are suffering from overcapacity  causing steel products from low cost countries such as China to flood the U S  and pressure profitability  Companies like NUE are crying for more import tariffs and greater government protection from illegally dumped imports  but these processes move very slowly 
The chart below shows the price of hot rolled band  HRB  steel over the last 15 years across several different regions  It highlights the cyclicality of steel prices and their current weakness as a result of import competition and soft demand trends  The dark blue line shows prices in the U S  and currently hovers around levels last seen during the financial crisis 
Source  SteelBenchmarker
Beyond international supply concerns  the automotive industry is one of the two largest markets for steel in the United States  Lighter weight materials such as hard plastics and aluminum are increasingly posing as threats to steel because they help with fuel efficiency and can be cheaper to use 
Of course  near term demand trends can also be volatile in major end markets such as construction and energy  As you can hopefully tell by now  investing in the steel industry can be quite the rollercoaster ride and is not for the faint of heart Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Despite some of the drawbacks of the steel industry  NUE s dividend appears to be quite secure and has a nice Safety Score of 74 
Over the last four quarters  NUE s dividend has consumed 76  of its earnings and 26  of its free cash flow  As seen below  the company s payout ratios have been volatile over the last decade but increased meaningfully from about 15  in 2005 to around 60  last fiscal year  NUE grew its dividend faster than its earnings over this period  For a cyclical company  its payout ratios are getting to be on the higher side of what we prefer  but we will see that it s less of a concern with NUE s business model  which generates reliable cash flow in most environments Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As we have noted  NUE is a cyclical business  We can see that the company s sales and earnings fell more than 50  in fiscal year 2009 as global steel markets collapsed  They also rebounded strongly in 2010 and 2011  underscoring the violent swings the steel market can take Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite the swings in steel prices and demand  NUE s low cost operating model and variable cost structure has enabled it to respond extremely well to periods of low demand  As seen below  NUE has generated free cash flow in nine of its last 10 fiscal years 
Importantly  NUE s annual dividend payments total  1 50 today  We can see that the company s current dividend would be covered by the company s free cash flow generation in each of the years during the financial crisis   2 52 in 2009   1 75 in 2010   While industry conditions could always surprise to the downside  NUE seems to be in good shape to keep paying its dividend under most worst case scenarios for the steel industry Source  Nucor  Simply Safe Dividends
Companies with strong competitive advantages typically earn high returns on their invested capital  We can see that NUE enjoyed excellent returns from 2005 through 2008 when steel prices were higher and its customers were healthier  Since then  the market has mostly remained oversupplied and caused NUE s returns to fall to a more reasonable level that suggests an average moat Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Given the cyclicality of NUE s business model  paying attention to its balance sheet is realty important  If steel markets drop even further and credit markets tighten  NUE could be forced to reduce its dividend to make principal and interest payments on its debt 
NUE s balance sheet looks alright  The company has about  2 billion in cash on hand compared to  4 4 billion in debt  Even with earnings looking depressed  the company could cover its entire debt with cash on hand and two years of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   Morningstar has also given NUE an  A   credit rating Source  Simply Safe Dividends
NUE s dividend looks reasonably secure  especially for a cyclical steel company  Its payout ratios don t provide as much flexibility as other companies  but these figures are currently being calculated during a time of extremely depressed steel prices  Importantly  the company s low cost business model has helped it generate free cash flow in practically all macro environments  and its balance sheet is reasonably healthy Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
NUE s dividend Growth Score of 7 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is very weak  While the company has increased its dividend every year since it started paying dividends in 1973  43 straight years   its dividend growth over the last five years has been very underwhelming 
As seen below  NUE s dividend has grown less than 1  per year during its last five fiscal years  For a dividend aristocrat  this is disappointing and reflects the challenging steel markets that NUE has dealt with over this time period Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Going forward  we expect NUE s dividend growth to remain very low until steel markets recover  assuming they eventually do   Thereafter  we still wouldn t expect dividend growth to exceed 3 5  per year  which is also the growth rate we expect the company s earnings could experience longer term ValuationNUE trades at about 16x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 4 2   which is meaningfully higher than its five year average dividend yield of 3 2   Cyclical stocks like NUE typically look cheap when their earnings are peaking and expensive when their earnings are nearing a trough  investors are pricing in higher earnings in the coming years  
With steel prices near their 2008 09 low  investors are hopeful that macro conditions are about as bad as they can get for NUE  If they are right and steel prices rally sharply by 30   the stock will likely do quite well 
Longer term  however  it seems unlikely that NUE will grow its earnings by more than 3 4  per year  The steel market is too saturated and competitive  and NUE is already the largest player in North America  Under those earnings growth assumptions  the stock s total return potential appears to be about 7 9  per year 
It s very important to keep in mind that cyclical stocks are usually volatile  While NUE s long term earnings growth might be 3 4  per year  growth will not be linear  Earnings could fall 35  one year  double the next  and contract by 15  in the third year  The stock will whip around as well  For these reasons  we view most mature commodity stocks like NUE as  trading stocks  that do not fit as well with our buy and hold investment philosophy ConclusionNUE has the fifth highest yield  4 2   of all the dividend aristocrats  While the dividend payment looks reasonably safe  the steel market has become increasingly challenged  There are numerous global competitors  e g  China  with deep  government subsidized pockets that can ship cheaper steel to the U S  and pressure industry pricing  While NUE s operations are very efficient and management is doing all of the right things  it ultimately has no control over the headwinds facing its business 
Steel prices do appear unusually depressed at the moment and could unexpectedly rebound to drive the stock higher in the near term  but that is not the game we try to play with our dividend growth investing  We will stick with some of our favorite blue chip dividend stocks instead ",2016-01-28,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nue:-a-dividend-aristocrat-yielding-4.2-382168,382168
172478,393994,NUE,Steel Executives  Global Overcapacity Still At Crisis Levels,opinion,"The top steel executives in the U S  called the fight against cheap steel imports a  war  in the American Iron   Steel Institute s annual press conference at its general meeting in Salt Lake City  Utah  The picture they painted was bleak 
Domestic steel capacity utilization averaged just 70  in 2015  It s still only at 71 3  capacity utilization for Q1 of this year  They also said 13 000 steel jobs have been lost in the past year  All pointed the finger at global overcapacity 
Crisis Levels

 Global overcapacity has been a problem for a long time but  today  it is a crisis   said John Ferriola  chairman  president and CEO of Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  and the newly elected chairman of the AISI for 2016   This overcapacity  combined with declining demand from countries like China is fueling continued high levels of dumped and subsidized imports into the U S  market  China has subsidized the growth of its steel industry through grants  low interest loans  free land  low priced energy and other raw material inputs  Simply stated  the Chinese government is a company disguised as a country and they are waging economic war on the United States  

Thomas J  Gibson  president and CEO of AISI  called upon other steel making nations to take action to eliminate global steel overcapacity  Gibson also said the U S  government should vigorously enforce trade laws to fight against the dumping of cheaper steel products and the implementation of market distorting policies and practices by other steel producing nations  particularly China 
China Still a Non Market Economy
The executives also said that China must continue to be treated as a non market economy for anti dumping purposes according to the World Trade Organization 

 Granting of  market economy  status to China before it has truly become one will undermine the effectiveness of U S  trade laws   Gibson said   In the meantime  China has claimed that it should be automatically granted the status upon completion of 15 years of its accession to the WTO in December this year  Leading manufacturing associations have already opposed that  stating that China has not met the basic requirements set forth by the U S  statutes and the Department of Commerce  

Hacking and Intellectual Property
U S  Steel CEO Mario Longhi addressed what he called a separate issue from market economy status and illegal dumping   his company filed last week  alleging that a Chinese hacker stole U S  Steel s intellectual property regarding a high strength automotive alloy  The information  allegedly  allowed China s Baosteel to offer the same product

U S  Slams China with Massive Duties on Steel Imports

The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   made its final determinations on anti dumping investigations on imports of cold rolled steel from China and Japan yesterday and concluded that both countries are selling these products in the American market below their fair values and therefore  are subject to anti dumping duties 

The DOC  on Tuesday  imposed a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on imports of cold rolled steel from China  Chinese companies did not respond to the DOC s request for information and thus  got punished with big tariffs  Japanese exporters including JFE Steel Corporation and Nippon Steel   Sumitomo Metal Corporation received a final duty of 71 35  
	The commerce department  yesterday  also issued its final rulings on countervailing duty investigations on imports of cold rolled steel from China  The DOC levied a massive final countervailing duty rate of 256 44  on Chinese imports  higher than the preliminary duty rate of 227 29  imposed in Dec 2015 
	This will badly hit Chinese exporters such as Angang Group Hong Kong Co   Ltd   Benxi Iron and Steel  Group  Special Steel Co   Ltd  and Qian an Golden Point Trading Co   Ltd  who failed to respond to the DOC s requests for information  Beijing has reportedly criticized these punitive trade actions  calling them  excessive  
	Combined exports of cold rolled steel from China and Japan to the U S  market were valued at an estimated  410 9 million in 2015 
	Yesterday s final rulings mark another victory for crisis hit U S  steel companies in their ongoing battle against unfairly traded  cheap imports that continue to make inroads into the American market 
	The biggest U S  steel producers   U S  Steel     AK Steel     Nucor     Steel Dynamics    and ArcelorMittal USA  a part of ArcelorMittal       filed anti dumping petitions in Jul 2015 with the U S  International Trade Commission   USITC   and the DOC against eight countries  Brazil  China  India  Japan  the Netherlands  Russia  South Korea and the UK  alleged for illegally dumping cold rolled steel that is used to make automotive products and appliances  among others 
	The petitions charge that an influx of subsidized imports of cold rolled steel from these foreign producers is causing significant injury to the country s steel industry  These imports have captured an increasing share of the U S  market  thereby hurting production  shipments  selling prices and margins of U S  steel makers 
	The USITC terminated the investigation on imports from the Netherlands in Sep 2015 after concluding that the quantity of imports of cold rolled steel from the country was negligible and hence did not cause or threatened to cause injury to the U S  industry 
	The DOC will now instruct U S  Customs and Border Protection   CBP   to start requiring cash deposits based on the final anti dumping duty rates for cold rolled steel imports from China and Japan  The commerce department will also order the CBP to require cash deposits  based on the final countervailing duty rate  should the USITC issues an affirmative injury determination 

The commerce department is now expected to issue its final rulings on imports of cold rolled steel from Brazil  India  Korea  Russia  and the UK on July 13  The USITC is also expected to make its final injury ruling on China and Japan on June 30 
	U S  steel companies have been hammered by a tide of cheap imports over the past few years that largely contributed to a slump in steel prices  These producers are struggling to cope with lower steel prices as a result of the combined impact of imports and overcapacity in the industry  Low costs of production have enabled foreign producers  especially China  to sell their products at cheaper rates  leading to an industry wide price decline 
	China has been repeatedly slammed by the U S  and the European Union for dumping its excess steel capacity  backed by unfair government subsidies  in the overseas markets at low prices amid weakening domestic demand 
	China  which accounts for around half of global steel output  continues to pose a threat to the global steel industry  The Chinese steel industry continues to reel under massive excess capacity and worsening gap between supply and demand with barely any signs of recovery 
	China s total steel exports clocked 112 4 million tons in 2015  per data released by the General Administration of Customs   topping 100 million tons for the first time  Notwithstanding a recovery in domestic steel prices  the country s steel exports jumped 7 6  year over year in the first four months of 2016  per customs data   signalling continued demand weakness at home 
	In April  U S  Steel lodged a complaint with the USITC  asking the regulator to start an investigation against biggest Chinese steel makers and their distributors  The company has accused these producers and distributors for unfair competition and is seeking the exclusion of all unfairly traded Chinese steel products from the U S  market 
	Nevertheless  steel market conditions in the U S  have somewhat improved of late  driven by favorable rulings  that led to levy of tariffs on imports  on steel trade cases in the recent past 
	The DOC  in Dec 2015  slapped preliminary anti dumping duties on imports of corrosion resistant steel from China  India  Italy and South Korea including a staggering anti dumping duty rate of 255 80  on imports of these products from China  Final determinations on this trade case is expected in Jul 2016 
	The DOC  in Mar 2016  also imposed preliminary anti dumping duties on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries  A final ruling by the DOC on this case is expected in August 
	Positive final rulings in these trade cases will ensure a fairer and more competitive market for U S  steel makers and workers and also help in restoring fair trade conditions for steel products made in America

172502,394018,NUE,Steel Gets Real,opinion,"Since we remain ever vigilant on DumpWatch here at the Metalminer week in review  we couldn t help but be proud of India  US steelmakers and even the EU who grew a spine and said  no mas  to illegal dumping of steel from several nations  principally China  The petitioning nations  steel industries deserve mad props for standing up for their markets 
China  you see  threw down the gauntlet two weeks ago when Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said the rise in steel exports from his country was due to higher global demand and was a natural result of Chinese steel products having  strong export competitiveness  
 Export competitive  steel rod just looking for a new home somewhere other than China 
Ya Down With OPM  Other People s Markets  
Producing steel for overseas consumption to meet demand would be one thing but  as the American Iron   Steel Institute has long protested  China s steel companies are subsidized at the state and national levels meaning they can often undercut prices in countries they export to by charging cost or even less than the cost of production thanks to the subsidies and what some say is a purposely devalued currency 
So  by calling Chinese steel  export competitive  Danyang was  essentially  saying  bring it  to all of the nations whose shores China exports its rebar  H beams and coil products to  So  when six producers with major US operations  including Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE    ArcelorMittal USA  Steel Dynamics and U S  Steel Arcelormittal  NYSE MT    brought an anti dumping action against China and four other nations this week over corrosion resistant steel  they were saying  in international trade terms   oh it s already been brung  China  
You Just Got Served
The US case  however  is the least of Chinese steel companies such as Baosteel s worries  as final rulings by the Commerce Department and US International Trade Commission aren t expected until mid 2016  India has fast tracked its beef with China s dumpers and is already collecting duties  And they didn t stop there  Malaysia and South Korea get their own duties when they try to bring that wack  cheap stainless steel into India 
Anti dumping tariffs ranging between  180 and  316 per metric ton for industrial grades of stainless steel have been imposed and are being collected at India s borders as we speak  Not only are the duties already imposed  but N C  Mathur  president of the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association  ISSDA  also said they were  long overdue  
Oh  snap 
Right now  India is just collecting duties on hot rolled coil products from the three countries but Mathur added that they might add cold rolled tariffs  too  if the dumpers don t step off  Okay  so he didn t say  step off   but the message was very clear as the tariffs were set for five years 
Keepin  Electrical Steel Real
Prior to this week of anti dumping actions  the European Union got in on the action by imposing duties of 28 7  from Chinese companies  including Baosteel and Wuhan Iron and Steel Corp over imports of grain oriented electrical steel  GOES  and of 22 8  from South Korean producers such as POSCO  NYSE PKX   Even US producers such as AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS  got hit with 22  tariffs  Once again proving that dumping steel in somebody else s backyard ain t nothin  to mess around wit

172503,394019,NUE,Nucor Has Difficult Time Competing In Today s Steel Environment,opinion,"Nucor  N NUE  has paid increasing dividends every year since 1973 
The company s long history of steady growth is an anomaly in the volatile steel industry 
Nucor operates differently from other steel companies  What sets Nucor apart is the way it treats its employees 
The company has not laid an employee off in about 30 years  That fact alone speaks volumes about the company  Nucor rewards its employees based on how productive they are   giving out generous bonuses to productive employees 
It should surprise no one that Nucor is non union  This is a critical advantage the company has over its competitors 
Nucor s primary competitive advantage is its employee compensation system  This results in more efficient and productive employees  and a more productive business in general 
Despite the company s unique employee based competitive advantage  Nucor has struggled over the last several years 
In 2006  Nucor had earnings per share of  5 73  In fiscal 2014  earnings per share were just  2 22  The company isn t expected to break earnings per share highs set in 2006 until around 2019  according to Value Line    that s 13 years of no growth 
What happened to Nucor  First  the company s earnings and revenue fell off a cliff during the Great Recession  Secondly  imported steel is cheaper than domestic steel 
Imported Steel Overview
The amount of steel imported into the United States since 2009 has steadily increased  To be fair  some of this is due to greater demand for steel in the United States 
To a large extent  however  steel imports are rising because international steel tends to be significantly cheaper than domestic steel  The image below shows rising steel imports since 2009 
 Source  October 2015 Steel Industry Executive Summary  page 4
The image below shows the top 6 countries from which the United States imports steel through the first 8 months of 2015 
 Source  October 2015 Steel Industry Executive Summary  page 3
Together  Canada and Mexico make up 21 1  of steel exported to the United States  These two countries are protected under NAFTA   United States businesses will have to compete with these two countries regardless of any new protectionist policies 
 American Iron and Steel Institute 

 The steel industries in China  India  Russia  Brazil  Indonesia and Turkey are either heavily subsidized or owned  at least in part  by the government 

Brazil  China  and Turkey together accounted for 27 7  of imported steel in the first 8 months of fiscal 2015 
China in particular produces large amounts of cheap steel  Here s how China produces cheap steel according to the  

 Many assume that China s cost advantage in manufacturing comes from cheap labor  But in China s burgeoning steel industry  our research suggests  massive government energy subsidies  not other factors  keep prices down 

Large subsidies help China  and other countries  to produce cheap steel  United States firms   including Nucor   cannot match the price of this cheap steel 
Does It Matter 
For every industry outside of steel  low steel prices are beneficial for the United States economy  The lower the price of steel  the more construction projects can be undertaken in a wide variety of industries 
Every industry except the steel industry benefits from foreign countries subsidizing steel production  It s like an indirect transfer of money from foreign governments to the United States 
For the steel industry  low steel prices are very bad  They destroy the domestic steel industry s ability to compete with foreign products  For Nucor  the amount and price of imported steel matters a great deal 
Protectionist policies in the United States matter to the extent one feels it is important to protect the domestic steel industry from subsidized international competition at the detriment of other industries  like construction and oil and gas  
A Brief History of Steel Protectionism
In 2002  the United States passed significant steel tariffs of 8  to 30   Before 2002  tariffs were between 0  and 1  
To put it mildly  this level of protectionism did not go over well with the rest of the world  By December of 2003  the tariffs were lifted due to pressure primarily from Europe and Japan 
Another Round of Protectionism
The recently passed Senate Customs Bill is kicking off a new wave of steel protectionism in the United States  The bill will allow new tariffs for imported steel that is significantly below the market price 
Most of the important steel companies in the United States  including Nucor  have filed a petition to enact tariffs for  unfairly  imported steel from China and other countries 
The Department of Commerce has started an investigation into the  unfair  importing of more than  2 billion in steel from seven countries 
Australia
Brazil
South Korea
The Netherlands
Britain
Japan
Turkey
It is interesting to note that China is not on the list 
Nucor knows how to play the regulatory capture game  The company has spent over  1 million a year on lobbying each year beginning with 2007  It is likely not a coincidence that lobbying spending increased as soon as the company s profits began to decline following 2006 highs 
Nucor s Investment Case
Recent history has proven that Nucor has a difficult time competing in today s steel environment 
The company has a potential catalyst in the latest round of steel protectionism 
Unfortunately  if history is any guide  this latest round of protectionism will not last  The 2002 wave of tariffs was short lived due to strong pressure from foreign countries   including many of the United States  closest allies in Europe and Japan 
Nucor does not have the continuous yearly growth  since 2006  that most Dividend Aristocrats show  The company is much riskier than the average Dividend Aristocrat  As a result  Nucor is not a good fit for the long term dividend growth investor

172518,394034,NUE, Wuhan Iron and Steel  A Classic Case ,opinion,China is proud of its steel industry   Since the days of Mao Zedong  the steel industry has been seen in China as a sign of the country s industrial virility and investment has been a priority of previous  if not the present  five year plans   But you can have too much of a good thing  and an interesting article by John Gapper in the FT suggests China s steel industry is way past the point of too much   Taking Wuhan Iron and Steel  WISCO  as an example  the article looks first at the vast scale of Chinese steel mills  Having absorbed competitors  WISCO has doubled its size in five years  becoming the world s sixth largest steel group by tonnage  From a profitability perspective  though  it is a massive failure   its shares trade in Shanghai at a fifth of the value four years ago during the post stimulus euphoria  as output continues to rise  as steel prices fall   Wuhan Iron and Steel  A Classic Case WISCO is typical of state owned steel enterprises in China  Employing 300 000 people directly or indirectly in the Qingshan plant alone  it is a major part of the local economy of Wuhan  a rapidly expanding city of 10 million in Hubei province  The local province supports the company because of its pivitol role in employment in the area  even though the firm and steel industry overall desperately need to cut capacity   China produced 720 million tons of steel last year  but according to Gapper  is making at least 20 percent too much steel  Unfortunately  in spite of Beijing s urgings  there is no appetite for rationalization  At best  the largest buy out the smallest and call it  sustainable consolidation   but capacity isn t being cut  it s just being shielded in ever larger  too big to fail  state enterprises   Globalize  Y all  According to the article  China would like the problem to be taken off its hands by turning WISCO and the other top five Big Steel companies   including Baosteel of Shanghai and Hebei Iron and Steel   into global companies  It would like other countries to let them go global  through mergers and acquisitions  maybe take over or merge with a U S  Steel or a Nucor  In this light  Anshan Iron and Steel s 14  stake in Steel Development of Mississippi  with plans to build five mills  could be seen as a Trojan horse  But expansion abroad would simply export China s problem onto some else s doorstep   The Bottom Line Supported by low interest rate loans from state owned banks  tax breaks and other forms of official support  China s state owned steel companies have grown into ailing inefficient behemoths  Rather than a token of China s virility  they are an example of all that is bad about state sponsored investment  Unfortunately  rather like Western banks  they are considered too big to fail and with little appetite to reform  consolidate or re structure  the industry expansion overseas is seen as a desirable alternative   at least from Beijing by Stuart Burns,2013-06-24,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wuhan-iron-and-steel:-a-classic-case-172696,172696
172519,394035,NUE,Bye  Buy America  In Nucor s Backyard  China Steel in US Bridges,opinion,In the first quarter of 2013  Chinese steel companies shipped 480 095 tons of steel to the U S   up 33  from a year earlier  By contrast  total U S  steel imports for the same period fell by 17  to 10 6 million tons  the International Business Times tells us  in a recent  on the penetration of Chinese steel into the US steel market  The reason seems simple  a recent survey of American buyers of steel used in construction found that prices for Chinese made steel are 25 percent lower  According to a WSJ   most of the steel from China now goes into building projects like bridges and buildings  in direct competition to US champions such as Nucor Steel  Calls for infrastructure spending have therefore not benefitted domestic steelmakers to the extent that was hoped or intended  What s the biggest insult to injury lately  In one of the most blatant examples of the benefits of US infrastructure investment going abroad last year  New York s Metropolitan Transportation Authority awarded a  235 7 million contract to repair the Verrazano Narrows Bridge to a contractor in California  who in turn subcontracted the fabrication of steel decks for the bridge to China  The contractor  Tutor Perini Corp   subcontracted the fabrication of steel decks for the bridge to China Railway Shanhaiguan Bridge Group  which the MTA says is using 15 000 tons of steel plate made by China s Anshan Iron   Steel Group  The decks will replace the bi level bridge s concrete upper roadway  And therein lies an example of at least part of the problem  Not Just Prices of Steel This isn t simply a matter of the steel price although that does come into it   When it comes to bridge building in the U S   Bill McEleney of the National Steel Bridge Alliance  whose members make bridges and bridge parts  is quoted in the IBT as saying  many U S  companies can build bridges  but not many are experienced with the flat deck design being used these days to build or renovate heavily trafficked bridges by Stuart Burns,2013-06-26,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/bye,-buy-america-in-nucor’s-backyard,-china-steel-in-us-bridges-172874",172874
172520,394036,NUE,Can US Steel  Aluminum Industries Survive Foreign Attacks ,opinion,"Cheap steel products have been flowing into the United States from China  South Korea  India and elsewhere  making it much tougher for any domestic steel producer price increases to stick   and it looks as though it may be impossible to stem the tide of flooding imports anytime soon 
Record steel import numbers are harming the likes of AK Steel  NYSE AKS   Nucor  NYSE NUE  and other producers  and foreign producers such as Vallourec and Tenaris getting more capacity online in the US surely isn t helping  According to  by John Miller of the Wall Street Journal   First quarter steel imports by U S  companies rose 36  from a year earlier to 10 6 million metric tons  according to research firm Global Trade Information Services  That was the highest level since the record 13 million tons reached in 2006  
According to another  by the Economic Policy Institute and law firm Stewart and Stewart  some 583 600 total jobs  including more than 200 000 in related manufacturing sectors  are at risk of going  poof  if imports dethrone the competitiveness of domestic steel production 
The US steel industry is not the only one being hit   aluminum imports are also at record highs 
US aluminum imports surged in March to 264 100 tons  the highest since August of last year  up 11  from February and 14  higher than March 2013  As Stuart reported last week   interestingly  inflows from Russia  the home of UC Rusal  the world s largest primary producer  were particularly dramatic  partially reversing a years long decline  
Over 44 000 metric tons arrived in March  more than double March 2013 levels and up 52  from February  according to Stuart s article 
Which Other Countries to Blame 
Back to steel  China and Korea accounted for more than three fourths  77 9 percent  of the growth in global steel exports between 2003 and 2012  Imports of Chinese steel by South Korea and Japan rose sharply between 2009 and 2012  Korea and Japan  in turn  are themselves major exporters to the U S 

Source  Economic Policy Institute

The government on Tuesday said China s crude steel production rose 2  last month to a record daily average of 2 3 million metric tons  The previous record was set in March  China s steel exports reached 62 3 million tons last year  just shy of the record set in 2007  as reported by the WSJ s John Miller 
India has its own overcapacity problems  and in an upcoming report for MetalMiner  Sohrab Darabshaw writes   Lately  a clampdown on illegal iron ore mining had forced Tata Steel and many other Indian steel companies onto their back foot  and looking to foreign shores to pump up their revenues   Over half of Tata Steel s earnings come from outside India

Low iron ore prices will redefine how steelmakers compete  Input costs will remain a key driver of competitiveness but will diminish in relative importance 
Conversion costs are increasingly critical  Firms with low conversion costs such as Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  and Ternium SA  NYSE TX  are poised to benefit in the new competitive landscape 
Vertical integration loses its strategic appeal  Upstream exposure has always meant higher earnings volatility  fixed costs variable prices   but the downside wasn t apparent amid high iron ore prices 
Vertically integrated steelmakers will suffer margin contraction  Falling iron ore prices portend lower steel prices but provide no cost relief for vertically integrated players such as CSN and U S  Steel  Over the long term  Morningstar analysts expect steel demand growth and better leverage over fixed costs to be the saving grace for these otherwise challenged companies 
Morningstar analysts believe that concerns about ArcelorMittal s upstream investments are overstated  allowing for a very attractive entry point on a promising turnaround story 
The research piece follows Morningstar s expectations for a decline in iron ore prices to  70 per ton by 2017

172539,394055,NUE,Steve Palmer  Don t Be A Retail Lemming Buy At The Bottom ,opinion,A short term investor s trash is a long term investor s ticket to returns  and with resource stocks hitting all time lows during a time of robust commodity prices  now is the time to snap up promising energy companies  Steve Palmer asserts  As a founder of AlphaNorth Asset Management  of one of Canada s market leading investment firms  Palmer has a practiced eye for spotting winners in a troubled market  He shares his picks in this interview with The Energy Report  The Energy Report  In your  last July  you talked about how market volatility was challenging investors in small cap Canadian resource stocks  Have prospects changed since then  Steve Palmer  The resource market has been volatile for a while  I was bullish last July  and I m still bullish  stocks are that much cheaper now  TER  What s your global outlook for resource stocks  SP  Economic growth is accelerating  worldwide  The three largest drivers of global growth are the U S   Japan and China  The gross domestic product growth rates of these three economies will continue to increase into 2014  Of the three countries  China is the largest contributor to global growth  It just has a huge  growing demand for energy  particularly for oil and gas  and it imports a lot of energy resources  Given this global backdrop  the outlook continues to be very good for energy commodity prices  and that factor will support the coming resurgence in resource equities  TER  Your AlphaNorth Growth Fund has about 19  invested in energy stocks and about 51  in materials  What accounts for this distribution ratio  SP  There s no great science behind it  I do not pay close attention to the exact weightings between those two areas  A lot of the investment research that we do is based on assessing specific bottom up company fundamentals  It just so happens that over the last few quarters  we have identified names in the materials sector that offer better risk versus reward  They are the names that have performed the worst over the last year  so we think that there s significant potential for those stocks to rally going forward  TER  Do you short firms as well as go long  SP  Sometimes  But we primarily invest on the long side  There s far more money to be made on the long side than in shorting companies  TER  What s your hedging strategy  SP  When we believe that the market is subject to potential correction  or that it is overvalued  we do look to hedge some of our exposure  And when we come across a specific company that seems ridiculously priced  we will consider shorting it    TER  Which energy firms in your portfolio have the best performance    SP  The best performer for us is probably a recent addition  Iona Energy Inc   INA TSX V   It is a Canadian oil and gas producer  It recently made an acquisition in the North Sea that will significantly bump up its production  Production results on its Huntington asset are imminent  Premier Oil  PMO LSE   which has a 40  working interest on the asset  has suggested that flow rates could exceed initial guidance by 20   Iona s growth profile is expected to increase to over 6 000 barrels oil equivalent per day  6 Mboe d  in 2013  primarily due to the additional oil coming on line from Huntington  The company could earn  0 25 share this year  which would equate to less than three times its price earnings ratio  P E   It s trading at an enterprise value per flowing barrel of around  45 000  and if production at Huntington does exceed guidance  it would be even cheaper    TER  Last July  you said that uranium was a reasonable investment  Is that still true    SP  Yes  I still like uranium in the long term  Japan will restart its reactors  and China is building a significant number of new nuclear reactors  These two factors will drive the uranium price higher  Also the Russian U S  Megatons to Megawatts program to dismantle warheads to retrieve uranium and sell it to the U S  is ending  The program s goal to eliminate 500 metric tons of warhead material will be completed in 2013 That decreases the supply  and will drive up the price    TER  Is your fund invested in uranium firms    SP  We have an investment in Ur Energy Inc   URE TSX  URG NYSE MKT   That s one of the few uranium companies that operate in the U S  It has an in situ uranium mining project in Wyoming  It has received all permits and is expected to begin production in H2 13  Thus far  the company is on budget and on schedule  It has secured four offtake agreements that account for 30 50  of production  and has an exclusive marketing agreement with Nucor Corp   NUE NYSE   Contracts have been secured significantly above the current spot prices and above long term prices as well  Management estimates that the operating cost per pound could be below  15  the preliminary economic assessment uses  16 12 lb   making it one of the lowest cost producers  Total capital costs of the plant and well fields are just  31 million   31M   adding to the robust economics of the project  We expect production to be around 500 000 lb this year and to ramp up to 1 lb next year  We anticipate a rerating of the stock once it becomes a producer    TER  To what do you attribute the low level of prices for uranium over the last year    SP  Many investors believe that the resource cycle is over  so at the present time  the movement is mostly momentum and liquidation selling  There are a lot of redemptions from resource funds  It s kind of a snowball effect  The resources have performed poorly  The typical retail investor chases performance  so he sells more at the lows  Then when the markets rise  the investors pile in  like they re piling into anything with a yield right now  some of the fixed income products are hitting all time highs  And investors are selling the resources as they hit new lows  It s all liquidity driven    TER  Yet  in this atmosphere  you remain consistently bullish    SP  I ve been early in calling the bottom for the resource stocks before  That was the case in 2008  and the current situation is very similar in terms of the junior resource market  We were proven to be correct when the market rallied significantly in 2009 and 2010  I believe that will occur again this time  and that we are once again at a major market bottom    TER  How have your funds fared in comparison to benchmarks over the last year or so    SP  The AlphaNorth Partners Fund  which is our flagship hedge fund  has done quite well considering the state of the junior markets  The Toronto Stock Exchange Venture Index  TSX V  is the benchmark I use  which is down 58  in the last two years  Our Partners Fund was actually up 2 4  in 2011 and down 6 8  last year  Our Growth Fund  which is a mutual fund that focuses on small and mid cap Canadian equities  has a significant weighting in the resource space  It has more or less mirrored the returns of the TSX V since its launch in July of 2011    TER  Given the volatility and uncertainty of the small cap resource market  what methods do you primarily look at when deciding whether or not to pick up a stock    SP  Management is important  On the energy side  we look at the ratio of price to cash flow relative to the peer group  We look at the growth prospects  We look at the ratio of price to flowing barrels of oil equivalent  Those are the main factors    TER  How do you assess management    SP  We look at the managers  track records  and how much skin in the game they have in terms of an equity holding in the company  We typically meet management to discuss the business plan and the prospects prior to investing    TER  What are the advantages or disadvantages of owning small cap equities in today s market    SP  Over the longer term  small cap equities outperform other asset classes  and that s been proven historically  Today  the large cap equities are doing very well  They have recovered  The U S  major indices are at all time highs or very close  The European indices are all doing very well  The Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX  has rallied  but it is lagging behind the other exchanges  The TSX V  which is largely resource based  is hitting new lows  There continues to be a huge disconnect in resource equities relative to growth potential and commodity prices  But as the larger cap names become more fully valued  or more expensive  investors will start to look at underperforming smaller companies that have better risk reward profiles    TER  What about oil and gas    SP  Everyone was negative when gas was at  2 per thousand cubic feet   2 Mcf   I like to be contrarian whenever possible  so I wasn t particularly negative at that point  I knew that the price would recover  And it is now back to  4 Mcf  The U S  inventories have come a long way over the last few months in terms of getting back to normal levels  A few months ago  gas inventories were 30  above the five year average  now they are below the average inventory for this time of year  Energy names have been caught up in the negative investor sentiment  even though the commodity prices have done quite well  Natural gas has gone to  4 Mcf  and West Texas Intermediate is trading at roughly  95 per barrel   95 bbl   which is quite a good price historically    TER  Do you think that the inventory will build up in North America  and that the U S  will become an oil and gas exporter    SP  Maybe over the longer term  There s a trend toward that  but U S  growth is accelerating  The economy is doing much better  and that is going to increase the demand for energy    TER  What about alternative energy sources  Do you see any growth there    SP  Yes  I do  That s one of the factors that is helping the U S  to be more self sufficient on the energy front  as some of these alternative sources are displacing what otherwise would be demand for oil and gas    TER  Do you see wind or solar as more worthy of attention from investors    SP  I assess the alternatives more from a company specific level  One must be very careful with some of these industries  because they do not make sense from a financial point of view without government assistance  I try to avoid situations where an alternative energy firm is completely dependent on government policies to make money  as policies can change overnight  If a firm is relying on tax credits to compete  that adds a lot of risk to its profile    TER  But the large oil and gas companies also access tax advantages and subsidies of various sorts  Could those go away as well    SP  It s always a risk  but the oil and gas industry is so much bigger  It is a very powerful lobbying group  Consequently  it s a lot harder for the government to change oil policies than it is to change the policies affecting niche areas like solar or wind    TER  Do you have any parting comments about why you re bullish  and why people should follow your lead    SP  I m bullish on small caps because they are the best performing asset class over the longer term  Yes  they are volatile  but if investors with long term time horizons can initiate positions during periods of significant market weakness  they can dramatically increase their returns  That s what we have right now  We ve had a period of significant market weakness  yet commodity prices are fairly robust  and the large cap equities are doing quite well  I see the present time as a very attractive opportunity    TER  When should people sell small caps    SP  They should sell small caps when they re hitting new highs and everyone is talking about them  or when they become fundamentally fully valued  that is  when the valuation metrics like the price to cash flow and price to earnings ratios go higher than their long term averages    TER  It was nice talking to you again  Steve    SP  Thanks     is a founding partner  president and chief investment

172556,394072,NUE,Steel Prices Keep Dropping  US Mills Bank On AHSS For Auto Industry,opinion,Steel prices keep dropping across the globe in 2012  from the US steel market to the Chinese steel market and everywhere in between  Steel producers  profits  consequently  have been ailing If you re a steel investor  you re shaking your head right about now  If you re a steel buyer  however  you may be sitting pretty  And  if you re a steel buyer in the automotive industry  you may be well positioned to take advantage of the lower steel prices  considered by many to continue through 2012   MetalMiner s Automotive MMI   a metals price index specifically designed to track the prices of metals used in the auto industry  thereby gauging the health of the industrial sector  increased in August   one of only two indexes to increase  out of a total of 10 MMIs This came from a number of factors  including increasing auto sales in July overall  and specifically an increase in HDG prices  We saw steel prices trough a few weeks ago  and though they have not increased significantly  we can see a floor to prices and that provided the greatest support to the Automotive MMI    said Lisa Reisman  executive editor of MetalMiner  upon release of the report   We do  however  remain cautious as we continue to monitor consumer demand trends  US steel mills  however  continue to push their wares   and their benefits   on the auto industry According to a report by Steel Business Briefing via the American Iron and Steel Institute  mills want car companies to realize that lightweighting can be  to a certain extent  achieved with advanced high strength steels  AHSS    compared to aluminum The green benefits of using AHSS over aluminum  according to mill spokespeople quoted in the article  should be considered from beginning to end of the entire supply chain  as opposed to the final product affecting increased fuel efficiency in individual vehicles Severstal  AK Steel and Nucor are all hopeful  According to the article  Severstal s auto customers project a five fold increase in AHSS demand  AK Steel   a producer of electrical steels as well   is also banking on AHSS  plopping its money into AHSS R D  and Nucor has invested roughly  1 billion in its industry leading recycled steel initiatives that hope to prove how much greener steel production is than aluminum production  As much as steel producers are playing up AHSS demand as part of their strategy  analysts  views on the US steel industry and steel prices are still a bit dark   with the effect of China s steel production moves on US mills  recovery  things may not get too much better for US producers in 2012  Overall  though  steel buyers   and especially those sourcing steel for the auto industry   should check out their existing contracts  keep up on their steel price indexes  and keep an eye out on the next few months You never know  if consumer sentiment picks up and sales continue looking healthy  the automotive sector could see sustained growth   and with it  higher prices of steel By Taras Berezowsky,2012-08-15,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/steel-prices-keep-dropping,-us-mills-bank-on-ahss-for-auto-industry-133043",133043
172557,394073,NUE,Don t Push The Panic Button On Rare Earths  Lisa Reisman,opinion,Lisa Reisman describes herself as a  classic libertarian   but the managing editor of MetalMiner com nonetheless believes government has a role to play in protecting and developing domestic supplies of critical metals  In this exclusive Critical Metals Report interview  Reisman argues for private public partnerships and explains why today s low prices don t faze her or surprise her  The Critical Metals Report  Lisa  many of the companies in the rare earth elements  REE  space are trading near 52 week lows  Has the bubble burst or is this a consolidation  Lisa Reisman  To some extent  the bubble has burst  But this is true for a number of commodities  not just REEs  The current lows are directly related to the same policy changes that caused the upswing in the first place  When China  the 800 pound gorilla in the sector  shifted to a policy limiting exports  buyers tended to hit the panic button and bought forward for a long period of time  Prices got a boost at the time  but those large buyers were then out of the market while they subsisted off their stockpiles  Thus  we would expect the stocks of the REE producers to fall a little bit  TCMR  The MetalMiner IndX on MetalMiner com tracks a number of markets  such as aluminum  raw steel  rare earths  precious metals  renewables  copper  automotive and construction  By far the worst performing index is REEs  it has lost almost half of its value  Why  LR  There is an adage that goes  nothing kills high prices like high prices   When things begin to get frothy  people get nervous and sell  Investors use the opportunity to take some profit  The REE prices got too frothy  This is a spot market  the published prices tell you what current demand looks like  And it is looking dour  The same is true for other metals  For most of them  the slope in the aggregated chart is down to the right  Also  when people start to panic over export controls  they start to look for product substitutes and alternative materials  That cannot be done across the board or quickly in all cases  but where it can be done  it is done  This creates demand destruction  To some extent  that is what we are seeing in REEs  TCMR  How much of a role does China s economic slowdown play in REEs  price weakness  LR  It plays a significant role  Many of the large buyers  like the original equipment manufacturers  OEMs   have bought or are buying forward  Once the big companies are taken care of  who is left in the REE spot market  The companies that did not plan ahead  often smaller companies  are the only ones buying in the spot market right now  TCMR  The U S   the European Union and Japan are quietly fighting with China through the World Trade Organization  WTO  over China s export restrictions  What do you think is the likely outcome  LR  I think the WTO will rule in favor of the Western nations by finding that some of the export restrictions  or perhaps the way China has implemented them  violate WTO rules  But China is holding fast and makes some valid points in its defense  The environmental factors  China asserts  are a legitimate rationale for export limitations  TCMR  If that happens  will China change the way it does business  LR  It might not be business as usual for China  but China will look for other levers to manipulate and it will attack the problem from a different direction  China is enough of a player in every market that when it decides to buy or not  it will affect pricing  The real question for the WTO goes beyond REEs  It hears cases over steel and aluminum quite often  In general  China does not play by the same set of rules as everyone else  That has to come to an end at some point  TCMR  How are manufacturers that use REEs responding to supply risk  LR  The largest OEMs the Boeings  Apples and HPs of the world have very extensive supply risk management strategies in place  They track  rank and rate all the materials they buy  The aerospace sector has been brilliant in identifying sources of supply around the world  The Toyotas of the world are looking not only at the supply end  but also on the recycling end to bring materials back  They are rethinking the whole supply chain  Things get a little more dicey among the middle market and smaller firms  Some of them face tremendous risks for not thinking through the supply options for REEs  For example  I spoke at an event over a year ago on base metals markets  But peoples  questions centered on REEs  It was obvious that REE price spikes were making these companies frantic and export price controls put tremendous strains on their businesses because they were not prepared with alternative sources  It s not a clean division by company size  but you see different levels of sophistication amongst companies in terms of how they handle supply risk  TCMR  Do you believe REE prices will stabilize where they are now or is there room for more downward momentum  LR  When I look at the REE trend line  I do not see a floor  A floor would be a flat line for a couple of months  Instead  we see a steady descent with a little upward blip in April and May  Since May  the numbers have continued to fall  I am not suggesting prices will move down again in September  but the fact that we have not seen a floor tells us that further weakness remains  TCMR  Will the heavy rare earths  HREEs  find the floor faster than other REEs  LR  That is possible  The place to look  particularly with HREEs  is their end use applications  the wind energy industry or the magnets used in hybrid electric vehicles  Some of those end uses look good  the U S  auto market for electric vehicles seems to be holding its own from a demand standpoint  However  the energy tax credits for the wind industry in the U S  are set to expire  which may decrease HREE use  TCMR  Other critical metals are experiencing price corrections or price weakness tantalum and manganese  for example  What is happening with their prices  LR  A lot of what has happened with tantalum prices is the result of the Dodd Frank Act  The Dodd Frank financial reform legislation contains a clause that requires firms to show that they are not obtaining certain minerals from  conflict regions   The minerals include gold  tin  tungsten and tantalum  And the  conflict regions  are not necessarily entire countries  but can be regions within a country  Now that the rules have been published requiring third party formal audits  e g   attest services   the market for these metals will begin to stabilize  Uncertainty forced companies to stop sourcing these minerals from the DRC altogether  Purchasing behavior shifts as a result of policy changes  but now that the rule has come out  companies know where they can source materials and we suspect prices will stabilize  A company can buy tantalum from the Democratic Republic of Congo  DRC   It just cannot buy tantalum mined in a conflict region within the DRC  Prior to the publishing of the rule  the company may have panicked and decided to source its tantalum from Brazil or China  That starts to create havoc with pricing  By changing companies  behavior  Dodd Frank has had an effect on tantalum prices  Companies in search of safe supplies are buying forward or on contract  or they are buying less  There is no more spot buying from Joe Trader  That puts pressure on prices  TCMR  Are there similar problems with manganese  LR  To some extent  yes  although manganese is not a conflict mineral  It is  however  mimicking the REE markets because China also closely controls manganese supply  Because the U S  is not producing a lot of these metals  we are beholden to Chinese policies  China of course wants prices to be higher  TCMR  Do you believe the U S  government should get involved in developing domestic supplies of critical metals  LR  As a classic libertarian  I do not want government involved in much of anything  However  to the extent that some of these metals play a role in national security  the answer is yes  There is a compelling reason for the government to get involved  The U S  needs to make sure it has clean lines of supply  Domestic mining is one great solution because we are sitting on some of these minerals  But I also support identifying alternative sources of supply and opening up other channels  We should be creating closer private public partnerships with junior mining firms in Canada and other friendly regions  The government certainly could be more mining friendly  For example  American Manganese Inc   AMY  AMYZ  2AM  has mines here in the U S  From a strategic and military standpoint  we ought to foster the development of a junior mining firm like American Manganese so it can get to market faster  And it goes beyond manganese  The steel producer Nucor Corp   NUE  had to cope with complicated and uncoordinated rule making and different agencies in the permitting process at its DRI facility in Louisiana  The federal government needs to create more streamlined rules  I do not mean we should skirt environmental laws just make them more effective  Rather than taking a  why should we do this project  approach  the Environmental Protection Agency could shift its attitude to  is there any reason why we should not do this project   TCMR  Are there other companies that could benefit from government taking a more active role in fast tracking projects or declaring certain metals strategic assets for development  LR  The American Resources Policy Network uses a pyramid to illustrate the priorities for each strategic metal  Once you ve located the metal in the pyramid  you need to look at the companies in the space  For example  Commerce Resources Corp   CCE  D7H  CMRZF  comes to mind as a tantalum miner  We have next to no domestic supply  but Commerce Resources is pretty far along in its process  It would benefit from streamlined rules and public private partnerships  Dozens of other junior mining firms would also benefit  That approach is popular in Canada and Japan  The Japanese government brought together junior mining firms from Canada with the largest Japanese end users and paired them up  like a matchmaker  The U S  government does not do that  TCMR  The sector s biggest player  Molycorp Inc   MCP   recently announced it will raise almost  600 million through equity and bond financing  But it recently missed the Street s Q2 12 targets by a fair margin  What happened there  LR  Wall Street s expectations do not always reflect what is happening in the industrial market  The Street is unhappy because it invented earnings targets for Molycorp based on last year s frothy price scenarios  Molycorp is sitting on the most amazing book of business of any metal producer in the U S  Everything it produces is booked out and sold going forward  Molycorp is in an envious position compared to other producers  TCMR  Will Molycorp s struggles keep investors away from the sector  LR  That is a different question and the answer could be yes  Molycorp has been the golden child of the REE industry  If you look back a few years  the green economy has not quite developed as people had expected  In the last four years  natural gas production has been the biggest winner  not wind energy  With the expiration of the tax credits  people are not buying and building windmills in the same volume as they were two or three years ago  Other trends are not exactly on target either the move to hybrid electric vehicles and small cars  for example  I think Molycorp is modeling what is happening with all these trends  But overall  it remains in a great position  TCMR  Why should investors in companies that are developing critical metals assets or projects remain optimistic  LR  Investors in general focus on the short term  When they see low REE prices  they hit the panic button  That is why they might be more negative on the sector  We look at the world in terms of control of these key metals  Do we want to be beholden to one country  and a communist country at that  When you see countries controlling more than 90  of the global supply of something  to me that is a no brainer  It tells me just how important it is to support these junior mining firms  You also need to look at the domestic end use need  Yes  we all like our iPhones and our iPads and such  But we also need REEs for weaponry  satellite systems and for our national defense  That is why I am focused on the long term  We need to stay optimistic and not be so sensitive to what the prices do next quarter  Ultimately  the passage of these rules will create a more level playing field among producers and suppliers of these minerals  Legitimate and legal sources of supplies coming from locations outside of the prohibited conflict zone stand to gain  or have already seen some benefit  as companies have already started to shift supply sources Those that would have received an immediate benefit will already be in the production phase of their projects  Newer projects may also see some lift  particularly if metal shortages ensue though we don t see material shortages for these materials in the short term  TCMR  Lisa  thank you for your time and your insights   is co founder and

172558,394074,NUE,Tantalum Producer s Perspective On New Dodd Frank Conflict Minerals Rule,opinion,Though not typically prone to cynicism  when the phones started ringing with producers willing to share their perspectives on the conflict minerals rule recently passed by the SEC  one can t help but think the rule may appear one sided  i e  not favoring  illegitimate  sources of supply or producers  Certainly  companies are struggling now to interpret the conflict minerals rules and implement its mandates  and this is destined to become a top priority for thousands of manufacturing organizations  MetalMiner spoke with two producers of different metals for their reaction to the new rule   Global Advanced Metals  GAM   a tantalum producer  and Nucor  a steel producer   This is Part One of a two part series   Not having rules has led to a lack of action by some parties   said Andrew O Donovan  president of Global Advanced Metals   It allowed certain companies that continued to source  conflict  material to continue to prosper and created an uneven playing field and disadvantage for those who are responsibly sourcing tantalum  On the other hand  many manufacturers began moving down the path of sourcing conflict free minerals as soon as President Obama signed the Dodd Frank bill into law  Some  like GAM  self imposed purchasing policies on this issue long before then O Donovan shared that many of GAM s direct customers have moved in the direction of the rule anyway  but farther down the supply chain he saw a different reaction   A large number of our customers  customers have been slow to move on this issue   he said   When some sit on the fence  it discourages those that are doing the right thing   That leads to an uneven playing field Some have criticized the legislation as harming the artisanal mines  as the first comment below this recent MetalMiner post mentions in great detail   O Donovan had this to say about the impact on legitimate mines  As a significant player within the tantalum industry however  we  like many  share a responsibility to try to ensure that legitimate DRC trade and mining  at fair pay and under correct working conditions  can continue  Until recently  very few  if any  mechanisms to ascertain  good  from  bad  material existed within the DRC or central Africa generally  Most recently  efforts by a number of organizations to do just that are taking root  The Solutions for Hope project for example  in which GAM is participating  is a pilot program to channel  conflict free  material from the DRC  through processors such as GAM  and on through component  and finished electronic device manufacture  The goal of all such initiatives is to establish legitimate and free trade at a fair market price with DRC artisanal mines  That is not an easy target to reach  but any effort toward that goal is worth pursuing  The Scrap Metal Sticking PointThough companies like Global Advanced Metals may appear an obvious  winner  with the conflict minerals rule  many may not know that the rules could have placed severe limits on all domestic metal recycling  had Nucor not taken a proactive stand in explaining to the SEC how the rule would impact EAF producers By Lisa Reisman,2012-09-06,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tantalum-producer’s-perspective-on-new-dodd-frank-conflict-minerals-rule-135404,135404
172563,394079,NUE,How Conflict Minerals Rules Affect Steel Scrap And Gold Supply Chains,opinion,The Scrap Metal Sticking Point Though companies like tantalum producer Global Advanced Metals may appear an obvious  winner  with the conflict minerals rule  many may not know that the rules could have placed severe limits on all domestic metal recycling  had Nucor not taken a proactive stand in explaining to the SEC how the rule would impact EAF producers EAF production methods  used by Nucor  represent approximately 62 percent of all US steelmaking capacity as of 2011   We fought for a recycling exemption   said Jennifer Diggins  director of public affairs for Nucor   We believed the final rule should recognize the impossibility of tracing the elements in our scrap back to their original source  A piece of scrap may be recycled dozens of times and over the course of the past hundred plus years  The SEC conceded that point and amended the rule  which a created far less burdensome final rule  Under the final rule  the SEC will require a reasonably designed  good faith inquiry only to determine whether its minerals are from recycled or scrap sources  Additional due diligence and furnishing a Conflict Minerals Report will not be required unless a company has reason to believe that its conflict minerals may not have been from recycled or scrap sources As a result  the SEC stated that they believe that  the magnitude of the cost savings for issuers with conflict minerals from recycled or scrap sources will be greatest for companies that use exclusively scrap and recycled materials   Certainly the SEC likely didn t intend to shut down all recycling   Diggins said   We applaud them for recognizing the importance of recycling metal  which will hopefully increase the extent to which these materials are recycled   The more you recycle  the less you have to mine   she concluded What About Gold Supply Chains Gold and its supply chains represent  to some extent  greater complexities for one key reason  One of the main end uses of gold   jewelry   has a supply chain dominated by retailers  but  manufactured  by smaller mom and pop type operations  Based on how the rules are set up  if you are a re seller   and you have no control over the specification   you don t have to report and those products should not be captured by the rule   said Michael Littenberg  partner at Schulte Roth   Zabel LLP When asked what had changed from the proposed rules to the final rule  Littenberg said   to the extent that something is branded but the public company didn t have any influence over the manufacturing process  the company does not have to report  He predicts the rules won t apply to a large chunk of the industry  However  he suggested   It will be an interpretive question   for example  what does it mean to have control over the design  That remains unanswered  The Silver LiningThough some would argue that no silver lining exists when new regulations impose compliance burdens on a manufacturing base  others are not so sure   There is a school of thought that says at the end of the day   manufacturers  will learn more about their supply chains as well as how to make this pay for itself  supply chains will become more efficient   argues Littenberg Another silver lining could be that the goal of the legislation   having a positive effect on the ground in the DRC and surrounding region   could actually be met  unlike similar legislative attempts   We d concur with Littenberg s stance   though we wouldn t want to argue that point to the electronics or aerospace industries right now By Lisa Reisman,2012-09-06,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-conflict-minerals-rules-affect-steel-scrap-and-gold-supply-chains-135405,135405
172569,394085,NUE,Japan s Trade Deficit  A Boon For U S  LNG ,opinion,As global shipping continues to reach for the max    Panamax  Panamax Max  Post Panamax  Post Panamax Plus and New Panamax  to be exact  in addition to other massive container ships plying the global seas these days    our focus shifts to the liquids that have been traveling to Japan more and more Namely crude oil  liquefied petroleum gas and liquefied natural gas  LNG   as the country has needed to beef up its fuel supply after the tsunami in the spring of 2011 precipitated the Fukushima disaster    and systemic shutdowns of much of the country s nuclear power reactors So what does that mean for the future of U S  LNG exports  and for U S  manufacturing New HighTurns out that Japan s monthly trade deficit has hit a new high  Reports put the shortfall at 1 63 trillion yen  US 17 4 billion   the worst ever monthly deficit  Although exports rose  including more shipped auto parts  imports increased 7 3  primarily due to Japan s fuel needs In fact  Japan s trade deficit for 2012 hit a new high as well    6 927 trillion yen   78 24 billion   According to a Reuters report  Japan  the world s third largest oil consumer  brought in 2  more crude in 2012 over 2011  at a rate of 3 66 million barrels per day  Imports of thermal coal were up 6 5  year on year  while liquefied petroleum gas imports rose 5 8  However  LNG imports shot up 11 2  in 2012 over 2011  proving to be a record high   In terms of currency value  that represents a whopping 25 4  increase  What s That Mean For U S  Exports Japan is the number one importer of LNG in the world    and the U S  is their primary supplier According to EIA data  Japan is by far the number one export market for US LNG on a volume basis since the 1970s  and blows away Brazil  the only other importer of U S  LNG aside from Mexico  between June and November 2012  for example  Total U S  exports to Japan in that timeframe stand at 6 55 billion cubic feet Brazil s imports  by comparison  total 2 64 billion cubic feet Historically  however  U S  exports of LNG to Japan are at their lowest point in decades  as the EIA graph below shows Although Japan wants to increase its imports based on recent power capacity struggles    Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will press President Obama for even more soon   U S  manufacturers may want to keep global LNG exports to this trend   Besides  who can say whether Japan s power shortcomings will last indefinitely  The HurdleThe primary reasons for this include natural gas being cheaper and burning cleaner   Mills in the U S   such as Nucor  are already making use of natural gas to their competitive advantage   But the main hurdle is that hardly any U S  liquefaction facilities exist yet According to this article  LNG exporting infrastructure is a big issue   All LNG that the U S  currently produces comes from a terminal in Alaska  Recently  BP signed a 20 year contract to ship LNG from a terminal in Freeport  Texas  which should begin in 2017 with the completion of facility construction  in Louisiana   The destination of what the Louisiana plant produces  Japan So the question lingers  should free trade reign  or should the U S  hang onto its cheap fuel ,2013-02-21,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/japan's-trade-deficit:-a-boon-for-u.s.-lng-156272,156272
172587,394103,NUE,3 High Yielders That Profit From Falling Natural Gas Prices,opinion,By now  you ve probably heard about the biggest story in energy  New drilling technologies in natural gas exploration and production have opened the floodgates to new supplies  creating all kinds of possibilities for consumers and investors   See  for an example of what I m talking about    But this natural gas revolution has so far been a mixed blessing for producers  as natural gas prices have gone into a tail spin  From highs of  8 per million Btu  British thermal units  four years ago  natural gas prices at the wellhead have plummeted to a recent  2 per million Btu  the lowest point in more than a decade As expected  major natural gas producers are feeling the pain  Well known natural gas players such as Chesapeake Energy  NYSE  CHK   for instance  have lost 50  of their share price in the past 12 months alone  although  to be fair  some of that has to do with bad press regarding revelations of some of management s practices      The good news is that in the investment world  for every loser there is also a winner  So you should be thinking about buying shares of the dozens of other stocks that can profit from unusually low natural gas prices     Among the top beneficiaries of this trend are chemical and fertilizer producers  which are now seeing their operating costs drop as a result of the lower feedstock prices and energy costs  since many electric utilities are replacing their aging coal burning units with new gas fired plants    If you believe that natural gas will remain at historically low prices for the near future like I do  then you should look into these three high dividend paying stocks  since they re well positioned to reap the benefits of low cost natural gas     1  Dow Chemical  NYSE  DOW  Yield  4    Dow is a diversified chemical maker that generates  60 billion in annual sales and operates worldwide  The company makes and supplies raw materials to the specialty chemical  advanced materials  electronics  energy  agriculture and plastics industries  Natural gas accounts for 20  of Dow s operating costs  so falling gas prices are likely to drive significant margin expansion and profit growth for the company    Dow s earnings per share  EPS  rose 29  in 2011 to  2 54 compared with the  1 97 seen in 2010  The gain came as a result of the company s feedstock advantage  record sales in emerging markets and a  2 3 billion reduction in debt  Although restructuring charges and weakness in Europe will possibly limit Dow s 2012 earnings growth to single digits  analysts expect the company to post 29  growth in 2013 and deliver annual growth averaging at least 11  for the next five years     Dow cut its dividend for the first time ever  by two thirds during the recession in 2009  but began increasing payout again in 2010  The company raised its dividend 67  last year and another 28  this year  The new forward annual dividend of  1 28 yields roughly 4   Dow produces robust operating cash flow   4 billion in the past 12 months  and keeps payout low  less than 40  of fiscal 2011earnings   so there should be plenty of room for additional dividend growth   2  Terra Nitrogen Co  LP  NYSE  TNH  Yield  8    Low natural gas prices are also welcome news for nitrogen based fertilizer producer Terra Nitrogen  which makes fertilizer by converting natural gas into ammonia and adding urea  Terra s fertilizer is used primarily by corn farmers  who got an early start to planting this year because of the mild winter  This has resulted in tight fertilizer supplies and rising prices     Lower feedstock costs made Terra very profitable in 2011  The company s income more than doubled to  508 million compared with the previous year  and EPS soared to  15 33 from  8 01  Distributions per share nearly tripled from  5 01 in 2010 to  13 91 in 2011  and Terra has declared a first quarter 2012 distribution of  4 53   18 12 annualized   The company has no long term debt  a remarkable 100  12 month return on assets  ROA  and cash flow that exceeds  29 a share    In the past five years  Terra has delivered 17  yearly growth in distributions and yields averaging 8 5   Reflecting the company s strong near term prospects  the share price is up nearly 60  in the past 12 months  but the yield is still relatively rich at 8    3  Nucor Corp   NYSE  NUE  Yield  4    Nucor is an  11 3 billion company and one of the largest U S  steel producers and recyclers  The company plans to increase profits by using natural gas as an energy source instead of coal or oil  It has also cited low natural gas prices as a key driver behind its move to build a new steel plant in Louisiana  which is expected to start operations in mid 2013     Nucor should also benefit from higher steel shipments  which rose 13  in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of stronger than expected automotive sales and solid demand for farm equipment  The company is also growing by acquisition  It just announced plans to acquire Skyline Steel LLC from ArcelorMittal  NYSE  MT  for  605 million     Analysts say Nucor can produce 59  earnings growth next year and 9  yearly growth for the next five years     Nucor has been paying dividends for 39 years  The company cut dividends by 40  during the recession  but has increased payments by 4  since 2009  The latest increase was a 1 cent hike last September to a  1 46 annualized rate  yielding 4 1   The payout ratio is a bit high at 61   but Nucor has consistently strong cash flow   1 2 billion in the past 12 months  and cash on hand exceeding  2 4 billion to support the dividend through good times and bad    Risks to Consider  All three of these stocks are extremely cyclical  Dow and Nucor could be hurt if Europe falls into a recession  Terra s distributions are affected by corn production and prices    My top pick overall is Terra Nitrogen because of its generous distributions as well as forecasts for steadily increasing corn consumption and prices through 2019 by the U S  Department of Agriculture  Dow is my top choice for investors who desire dividend growth  because of the company s commitment to rapidly restoring its dividend to pre recession levels  For investors who want safety  Nucor rates highly since more than 55  of the company s steel production is contracted on a long term basis  which helps deliver predictable revenue and profits   BY Lisa

172602,394118,NUE,These 2 Dividend Aristocrats Have The Best Earnings Growth,opinion,Are you searching for dividend paying stocks you can depend on   The Dividend Aristocrats is an elite group of dividend stocks  created by Standard   Poors  whose members have increased their dividends for at least the last 25 consecutive years   In fact  some of them have done so for many more years than that  This group lost a few members during the economic downturn  so it s quite a testament to the earnings power and management of those stocks that not only survived the crisis  but also managed to increase their dividend payouts during it We looked for stocks within this group who had consistent earnings growth  good mgt  metrics  and valuations that haven t gone sky high  via the rally of the last few months  and we found these 2 impressive companies from 2 different sectors and industries  Nucor Steel  and VF Corp Earnings   Valuations  These are 2 of the very few Dividend Aristocrats stocks which achieved strong growth not only in their most recent fiscal year  but also impressive quarter over quarter earnings and sales growth  AND  have strong growth forecasts for their next fiscal year  NUE looks undervalued vs  its Steel   Iron industry peers  on a PEG  P E  and Price Sales basis  but is pricier on a Price Book basis  VFC s earnings industry comps also look superior Their projected Next Fiscal Year EPS growth is lower than the industry avg   since the industry is bouncing back from very poor growth in the most recent fiscal year and most recent quarter   Having gained over 26  in the past 6 months  VFC s share price gains have pushed its valuations higher as well  particularly Price Sales Dividends  With its above avg  dividend  NUE is listed in the Industrials section of our    Both of these stocks have upcoming March ex dividend dates Covered Calls  If you want to increase your yields over the short term  selling covered call options can offer you some lucrative additional income  In addition to often paying you fat premiums  selling options is a way to generate quick income from stocks that you own or wish to buy  Both of these 2 covered call trades feature high options yields  and have strike prices that are higher than their respective stocks  current share prices  The higher strike price gives you the possibility of potential price gain profits  in addition to your dividend and call option income  If you re more bullish about a stock  you may want to sell covered calls at a higher strike price   the difference between the strike price and the stock s cost equals your potential price gain  or assigned yield These two 3 5 month trades have call options that outpay the dividends by up to 6 times Performance   Technical Data  Both NUE and VFC have been among the best stocks to buy for price gains over the past few months  but NUE is still down for the past year Cash Secured Puts  Since these stocks are near their 52 week highs  you may want to consider another strategy  selling cash secured puts  in order to achieve a lower break even  The VFC   145 put option is below VFC s current price  and gives you a break even of approx  6  below VFC s price  The put options pay out up to over 8 times more than the dividends do over this short term If you want to be even more conservative  and get a lower break even price  you can sell cash secured put options at a strike price even further below the stock price  which won t pay you as much of a put premium  unless you sell them further out in time  Generally  the further out in time you sell an option  the higher premium payout you ll receive Financials   Not much to complain about with these financial figures  excepting Nucor s lower operating margin  which is probably due to them using scrap metal as their feedstock Company Profiles Nucor   Established in 1940  Nucor is the largest steel producer in the US  and is the largest recycler of scrap steel in

fuel an expansion in operating margins to 15   Over the next five years  VFC s goal is to grow its international revenues by 15  annually to comprise 40  of total revenues  VFC also expects 15  growth
