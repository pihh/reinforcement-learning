199171,420687,AMAT,Why Applied Materials Stock Jumped 86 4  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  climbed 86 4  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  after there were signs of renewed demand for the semiconductor equipment leader s wares as industry spending began to rebound  The top tech stock absolutely smashed the S P 500 s roughly 29  return in the process 

So what
To be fair  we should note that Applied Materials stock effectively rebounded from a nearly 40  drop in 2018  amid persistently weak demand in the broader semiconductor space  Shares currently trade almost exactly even with their March 2018 high as of this writing 
But it certainly helped that Applied Materials shares started 2019 on a high note  rising more than 19  in January alone after multiple analysts offered prescient bullish notes highlighting its status as a key beneficiary should the industry enjoy a steady rebound as the year wore on 
And that s exactly what happened  The rally gained steam in May after Applied Materials posted better than feared fiscal second quarter 2019 results  with revenue and adjusted net income declining by  just  23  and 47  year over year  respectively 
Fast forward to Applied Materials  most recent  fiscal fourth quarter 2019  results    which caused another 9  single day pop in November    and its situation has obviously continued to improve  Fiscal Q4 sales fell slightly to  3 75 billion  and adjusted net income per share declined a modest 11  to  744 million  down 6  on a per share basis to  0 80  
Now what
In that quarter s earnings press release  Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson credited the company s relative outperformance to a  healthy uptick in demand for semiconductor equipment  combined with strong execution across the company  
 The semiconductor industry is increasingly adopting a new playbook for improving chip performance  power  area  and cost   Dickerson added   and we are investing in unique solutions to enable our customers  success in the AI Big Data era  
Investors should receive fresh color on Applied Materials  latest performance when it releases fiscal first quarter 2020 results in mid February  But there s no denying that Applied Materials  business is in a much better place today than it stood a year ago  And its share price responded accordingly in 2019 ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph5a5,2057685

this earnings season and would follow the  1 7  decline in S P 500 earnings in the preceding period  2019 Q3   Please note that the anemic earnings growth pace in 2019 is primarily because of tough

companies have publicly acknowledged But the full extent of the virus outbreak will only become clearer over time  We don t know at this stage whether the outbreak s negative impact will be a one quarter phenomenon or it will seep into the following periods as well This week s docket of earnings releases include a number of companies whose results can be expected to be significantly exposed to

	We re coming back from the best week of the year so far  which saw the NASDAQ jump 4  while the S P and Dow rose 3 2  and 3   respectively 
	Let s not expect a repeat of that performance  especially since all bets are off on Fridays during these coronavirus concerns

199212,420728,AMAT,Applied Materials does not expect memory chip recovery before 2020,news,"By Ayanti Bera and Sayanti Chakraborty
 Reuters    Applied Materials Inc  O AMAT  beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday but the chip gear maker cautioned that recovery in the memory chip market is unlikely before 2020 
The company  whose results are often seen as a barometer for the semiconductor industry  said spending by memory chip customers was lower in the third quarter  compared with a year earlier 
 We don t expect to see a recovery in 2019  we see it as a 2020 event     We expect to see NAND  flash memory chips  first then followed by DRAM   Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said on a post earnings call with analysts 
Betting on rising demand for memory chips used in data centers  5G phones and AI powered devices  Applied Materials early last month agreed to buy Japanese peer Kokusai Electric for  2 2 billion from KKR   Co Inc  N KKR  
Santa Clara  California based Applied Materials  shares  which had gained 44  this year  were last down 1 6  in extended trading

The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Applied Materials is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Applied Materials  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Applied Materials
For the fiscal year ending October   2020  this maker of chipmaking equipment is expected to earn  3 81 per share  which is a change of 25 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Applied Materials  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 15 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Applied Materials to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/applied-materials-amat-upgraded-to-strong-buy-heres-why-200504452,200504452
199233,420749,AMAT,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Applied Materials  AMAT ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   This company  which is in the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This maker of chipmaking equipment has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 49  
For the last reported quarter  Applied Materials came out with earnings of  0 80 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 76 per share  representing a surprise of 5 26   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 70 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 74 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 71  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Applied Materials lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Applied Materials currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 89   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 12  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-applied-materials-amat-200504519,200504519

199235,420751,AMAT,Applied Materials  AMAT  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  reports results for the quarter ended January 2020  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of chipmaking equipment is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 12 billion  up 9 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 95  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Applied Materials 
For Applied Materials  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 89  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Applied Materials will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Applied Materials would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering a surprise of  5 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Applied Materials appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/applied-materials-amat-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200504927,200504927

3  Will Oil End the Week Up

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT    Qorvo   NASDAQ QRVO   and Fortesque Metals Group   OTC FSUGY   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Shake the Snow in Your Crystal Ball  Global Week AheadIn this Global Week Ahead  we see off the final trading days of 2019 After that  we experience the first trading days of 2020  Those two trading days come after a Wednesday New Year holiday  of course Not surprisingly  we have a fair share of year ahead prognostications to peruse As one part of that journalistic production line  I got this 2020 outlook from CNBC  and reordered it for equity traders  1  Watch for more of a  Santa Claus  rally in the coming weekOn the near term horizon  stocks have a good chance of rising into the final day of this year  based on history  The S P 500 ended the past week with a  0 6  gain  at 3 240 and could keep rising in a late December  Santa rally  According to Bespoke  in the 21 years since 1928 that the S P 500 was up more than 20  for the year  it gained an average  1 3  in the final week of the year and was higher four out of five times So far  the S P is having its best year since 2013  But if its gain rises above  29 6   it will be the best year since 1997  2  As a backdrop  Wall Street expects the bull market to continue in 2020As stocks close out 2019 with potentially the best gain in decades  strategists expect Wall Street s bull market to continue in 2020 as long as it appears President Donald Trump will be re elected Analysts see the possibility of a slight pullback early next year  after this year s 29 2  surge so far in the S P 500 But the market is still expected to go higher  with analysts targeting an average 3 320 for the S P by the end of 2020  according to a CNBC survey Stovall said the strong 2019 performance of both stocks and bonds bodes well for next year  when looking at history going back to 1976  Since then  the S P 500 has averaged a  12 9  gain The Barclays  LON BARC  Aggregate bond index  representing a diversified bond portfolio  was up  8 5  for 2019  above its average 7 5  return  he said Following years in which both stocks and bonds make above average returns  the stock market has done even better The S P is up  14  in the next year and rises 82  of the timeBonds averaged gains of  8  in the next year and rose 10 of 11 times  Bonds increase in value when yields fall 3  How to factor in a Presidential election  Since World War II  the average gain in the fourth year of a presidential term is  6 3   and it s up 78  of the time   said Sam Stovall  chief investment strategist at CFRA The price gain in the S P is even better  with an average  6 6  gain if it is a Republican seeking re election  and the market has been higher each of the six instances of this since World War II  4  Big long term risks in 2020  a rise in consumer inflation  high P E ratiosStovall said beyond the election  another risk for next year could come from the Fed  if inflation readings begins to rise  Another risk is if we see the economy start to show signs of recovery too swiftly and start to see inflation numbers creep higher  investors will start to worry that not only is the Fed done cutting but they may have to think about raising rates again   said Stovall Stovall said the other challenge for stocks will be to see if fundamentals can catch up with now much higher price to earnings ratios  We re already at 19 times forward earnings  My feeling is we either start to see a dramatic acceleration of earnings growth expectations or we have to digest these gains   he said  Maybe it won t happen until the beginning of January  but I think we re getting ahead of ourselves  Analysts say there could also be other unanticipated events  like a new round of trade anxiety  but the belief for the most part is the White House will do its best to keep the economy on a positive track There is a concern that investors could miss out if they are too worried about the election  which already has strategists assessing how different sectors could be hit by Democratic candidates  The headlines and the anxiety that can typically come around an election have been pulled forward  and my fear is it will lead to inaction  said Cayman Wills  global head of equities at J P  Morgan Private Bank  Wills said in a recent interview that she is fairly optimistic for next year  We ve been focusing more on longer term themes that can get clients invested and engaged that go beyond the election cycle  and you don t lose out on potential returns  she said Top Zacks  1 Rank

199256,420772,AMAT,What Makes Applied Materials  AMAT  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Applied Materials currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here

199288,420804,AMAT,Applied Materials  AMAT  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Applied Materials basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Applied Materials imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Applied Materials
This maker of chipmaking equipment is expected to earn  3 66 per share for the fiscal year ending October   2020  which represents a year over year change of 20 4  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Applied Materials  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10 6  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

199370,420886,AMAT,Should Value Investors Buy Applied Materials  AMAT  Stock ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company to watch right now is Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   AMAT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and an A for Value  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 12 72  which compares to its industry s average of 16 55  Over the past year  AMAT s Forward P E has been as high as 13 93 and as low as 7 38  with a median of 10 20 
We should also highlight that AMAT has a P B ratio of 4 83  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 7 76  Over the past 12 months  AMAT s P B has been as high as 7 23 and as low as 4 17  with a median of 4 95 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  AMAT has a P S ratio of 2 49  This compares to its industry s average P S of 3 08 
Finally  our model also underscores that AMAT has a P CF ratio of 10 30  This data point considers a firm s operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook  AMAT s P CF compares to its industry s average P CF of 18 30  AMAT s P CF has been as high as 14 13 and as low as 7 57  with a median of 9 56  all within the past year 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in Applied Materials s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  AMAT looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-06-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-applied-materials-amat-stock-200434934,200434934
199371,420887,AMAT,Is Applied Materials  AMAT  Stock Outpacing Its Computer And Technology Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors interested in Computer and Technology stocks should always be looking to find the best performing companies in the group  Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors  but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole  One simple way to answer this question is to take a look at the year to date performance of AMAT and the rest of the Computer and Technology group s stocks 
Applied Materials is one of 634 companies in the Computer and Technology group  The Computer and Technology group currently sits at  6 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  AMAT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT s full year earnings has moved 1 24  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Our latest available data shows that AMAT has returned about 28 22  since the start of the calendar year  Meanwhile  the Computer and Technology sector has returned an average of 17 45  on a year to date basis  As we can see  Applied Materials is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
Breaking things down more  AMAT is a member of the Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry  which includes 5 individual companies and currently sits at  186 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 31 33  so far this year  so AMAT is slightly underperforming its industry in this area 
Going forward  investors interested in Computer and Technology stocks should continue to pay close attention to AMAT as it looks to continue its solid performance ",2019-06-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-applied-materials-amat-stock-outpacing-its-computer-and-technology-peers-this-year-200434910,200434910
199372,420888,AMAT,Mettler Toledo  MTD  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Mettler Toledo International  MTD   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  863 72 in the previous session  Mettler Toledo International has gained 49 3  since the start of the year compared to the 20 3  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 33 1  return for the Zacks Instruments   Scientific industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 9  2019  Mettler Toledo reported EPS of  4 1 versus consensus estimate of  4 06 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 77  
For the current fiscal year  Mettler Toledo is expected to post earnings of  22 7 per share on  3 04 billion in revenues  This represents a 11 71  change in EPS on a 3 42  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  25 32 per share on  3 2 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 52  and 5 25   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Mettler Toledo may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Mettler Toledo has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 37 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 34 7X versus its peer group s average of 20X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 72  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Mettler Toledo currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Mettler Toledo meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Mettler Toledo shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Mettler Toledo Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Mettler Toledo have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Thermon Group Holdings  THR   Ciena  CIEN   and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 10  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Mettler Toledo  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mettlertoledo-mtd-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200436463,200436463

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Applied Materials  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry  posted revenues of  3 54 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 83   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 57 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Applied Materials shares have added about 26 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 7  
What s Next for Applied Materials 
While Applied Materials has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Applied Materials was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

199394,420910,AMAT,Are Investors Undervaluing Applied Materials  AMAT  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   AMAT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and an A for Value  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 13 24  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 16 97  Over the past year  AMAT s Forward P E has been as high as 13 93 and as low as 7 38  with a median of 10 20 
Another notable valuation metric for AMAT is its P B ratio of 4 94  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 7 79  Over the past year  AMAT s P B has been as high as 7 90 and as low as 4 17  with a median of 5 08 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  AMAT has a P S ratio of 2 43  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 99 
Finally  investors should note that AMAT has a P CF ratio of 10 38  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  AMAT s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 18 27  Within the past 12 months  AMAT s P CF has been as high as 15 92 and as low as 7 57  with a median of 9 67 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that Applied Materials is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  AMAT feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-05-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-applied-materials-amat-right-now-200423513,200423513

199403,420919,AMAT,Earnings Preview  Applied Materials  AMAT  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of chipmaking equipment is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  45 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 48 billion  down 23 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Applied Materials 
For Applied Materials  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Applied Materials will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Applied Materials would post earnings of  0 79 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 81  delivering a surprise of  2 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Applied Materials doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-applied-materials-amat-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200419573,200419573

199413,420929,AMAT,Analysts Estimate Applied Materials  AMAT  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of chipmaking equipment is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 79 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 72 billion  down 11 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 37  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Applied Materials 
For Applied Materials  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Applied Materials will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Applied Materials would post earnings of  0 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 97  delivering a surprise of  1 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Applied Materials shares have added about 24 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 8  
What s Next for Applied Materials 
While Applied Materials has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Applied Materials was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Recent Report
I see the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 79 by  0 02 for a 2 5  positive earnings surprise   That is good to see  but Wall Street cares more about what you will do than what you have done  
The company guided next quarter EPS of  0 62 to  0 70 and that was well below the  0 78 estimate at the time   In fact  the number for this quarter was  0 82 60 days ago and came in by a penny as of 30 days ago   A week ahead of earnings the number was  0 78 so you can see estimates were softening ahead of the report 
The next quarter has also seen a shift lower in estimates with the Zacks Consensus Estimate dropping from  0 90 to  0 78 over the last 90 days 
Implied Earnings Growth
The full year earnings estimate for fiscal 2019 has dropped from  3 64 to  3 23  and that will send you to the low end of the Zacks Rank   
There is hope though  as fiscal 2020 is looking for  3 94 in EPS so there is some implied earnings growth ahead for AMAT

199432,420948,AMAT,Applied Materials  AMAT  Dips More Than Broader Markets  What You Should Know,opinion,"Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  closed at  34 94 in the latest trading session  marking a  0 88  move from the prior day  This change lagged the S P 500 s 0 25  loss on the day  At the same time  the Dow added 0 04   and the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 53  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the maker of chipmaking equipment had gained 2 38  over the past month  This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector s loss of 3 92  and the S P 500 s loss of 2 35  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from AMAT as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be November 15  2018  In that report  analysts expect AMAT to post earnings of  0 96 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 3 23   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  4 billion  up 0 85  from the year ago period 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AMAT  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3 09  lower  AMAT currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Valuation is also important  so investors should note that AMAT has a Forward P E ratio of 8 37 right now  This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 10 54 
Investors should also note that AMAT has a PEG ratio of 0 97 right now  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  The Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication was holding an average PEG ratio of 0 97 at yesterday s closing price 
The Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 198  which puts it in the bottom 23  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

199433,420949,AMAT,Applied Materials  AMAT  Tops Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 97 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 96 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 93 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 04   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of chipmaking equipment would post earnings of  1 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 20  delivering a surprise of 3 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Applied Materials  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry  posted revenues of  4 01 billion for the quarter ended October 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 28   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 97 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Applied Materials shares have lost about 34 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 1  
What s Next for Applied Materials 
While Applied Materials has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Applied Materials was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 95 on  3 99 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 21 on  17 09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication is currently in the bottom 16  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2018-11-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/applied-materials-amat-tops-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200359758,200359758
199434,420950,AMAT,Turning Brexit Into The Most Destabilizing Event Since 1992,opinion,"Overview  It is the height of irony or tragedy that what was offered as a non binding referendum on UK s membership in the European Union to bring the country  or at least the Tory Party  together is actually the most destabilizing event since the UK unceremoniously quit the European Exchange Rate Mechanism more than a quarter of a century ago  Sterling has stabilized for the moment  but reports indicate that Prime Minister May is unlikely to survive a vote of confidence  Asian equities were mostly higher  but Japan and Taiwan markets were dragged down by the chipmakers following the more news from NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   European shares are firmer  and the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is about 0 3  higher  leaving it around 1 65  lower on the week  US shares are trading lower  and the S P 500 will begin the session off about 1 8  for the week after gaining about 4 5  over the past two weeks  Bond markets are mixed  Yields slipped in Asia  and the 10 year JGB yield has finished the week below 10 bp  the previous BOJ cap  Core bond yields in Europe are slightly firmer  with the UK s 10 year Gilt yield up a couple of basis points after falling 13 bp yesterday  The US 10 year yield has not risen since November 8 but is threatening to end the streak today  In the foreign exchange market  the US dollar is little heavier against most of the major currencies  but the Australian and New Zealand dollars which are paring this week s gains  Oil is trading higher for the third consecutive session

Many participants want to believe that the bellicose rhetoric from the White House is part of the way it negotiates and that an agreement with China is likely  After not formally engaged in talks in recent months  the resumption of discussions last week is spun as  increasing efforts   The same people who negotiated the agreement earlier this year  which was later rejected by Trump  are leading the talks now  China formally responds to US and stakes out its position as it has been for some time  and investors are told they are compromising  On the other hand  as US importers tried to build up some inventory ahead of new tariffs  the US bilateral trade balance with China widened to new a new record and some cite this as evidence the US is losing the trade war  Separately  China has reduced the tariff on US LNG to 10  from 25   ostensibly because it was hurting itself 
US Commerce Secretary Ross  who reports suggest may be replaced soon  offered a bit of realism amidst the inflated hopes  Ross indicated that when Trump and Xi meet at the month end G20 meeting  only a broad framework of talks can be agreed  meaning that no deal will be struck  The US is prepared to raise the 10  tariff on  200 bln of Chinese goods to 25  on January 1  Trump also threatened to slap another tariff on the remaining Chinese imports but has yet to formally start the process  Meanwhile  a clash between Kudlow and Navarro over China has seen the former come on top of the skirmish but is not seen effecting Trump Administration s position  Note that Vice President Pence is delivering a speech over the weekend on what the administration has dubbed the Indo Pacific  In a series of speeches  Pence has laid out a view of the strategic not simply trade challenge China poses  Although the US administration may not recognize the importance of words  it seems to be unrealistic to think its adversary s share this penchant  It seems unreasonable to expect Chinese officials to negotiate in good faith with continued threats 
The dollar was straddling the JPY114 area to start the week and is finishing new the lows of the week a little above JPY113  where an  830 mln option is set to expire today  The technical indicators warn a break is likely in the coming days  and the next immediate target is near JPY112 50 80  The Australian dollar was turned back from  0 7300 yesterday  and it is consolidating today  There are A 980 mln options at  0 7275 that will be cut today  Given that many players see the Aussie as a proxy for China  we suspect it is vulnerable to disappointing news on the trade front  A break of the  0 7160 area would be seen as confirmation of that a top is in place 
Europe
Brexit remains the main issue  Four ministers resigned yesterday  and Gove turned down the top Brexit job because May refused his demand that he try renegotiating with the EC  The EC also has rejected a re opening of negotiations at this juncture  Raab  who helped negotiate the  deal  resigned shortly after it in protest  which befuddled observers  The unionist party from Northern Ireland  DUP   which provided the Tories with the votes to secure a majority after it failed to do so on its own in last year s election  has reportedly  Telegraph  threatened to pull its support unless May is replaced  Other reports suggest that there are enough signatures  1922 Committee  to hold a confidence vote  The Tories are in disarray  A loss of a confidence vote would likely trigger new elections  and the prospects of a Labour led government scares investors  It will take a few days for the situation to clarify  
Sterling reached roughly  1 2725 yesterday  the low for the year is near  1 2660  and has recovered to about  1 2835 today  apparently as some momentum players book some profits ahead of the weekend  There are nearly GBP400 mln on an option at  1 2765 and another GBP950 mln at  1 28 that expire today  Although the volatility and uncertainty will deter many participants  look for corrective upticks above  1 2850 to be pounced upon by the bears 
The euro needs to finish the North American session today above  1 1335 or it will extend its losing streak for the fifth consecutive week  The single currency has advanced for only one week since September 21  The euro briefly poked above  1 1360 but has been sold off in the European session  There is a  1 1340 option for about 750 mln euros that expires today and 1 4 bln euros at  1 1300 that also will be cut

Quietly and without much fanfare  investors  expectations for Fed policy next year is being scaled back  Over the past week  the implied yield for next June and December have eased by around a dozen basis points  Roughly half of the decline can be accounted for by shifting expectations for as early as Q1 19  The implied yield of the April contract fallen about seven basis points this week  Fed Chair Powell s speech this week acknowledged potential headwinds that could emerge next year  but he gave no reason to think the Fed would not hike next month and the early part of next year  The April fed funds futures contract was already moving higher before Powell spoke and is taking a six day rally into today s session 
Separately  some are playing up yesterday s comments by the Fed s Bostic and Kashkari  Both expressed concern about the slowing of world growth as a reason to give the Fed pause  Yet these are among the most dovish regional presidents  who have opposed every rate hike or nearly so  The foreign slowdown story is only their latest arguments  And part of the problem with the global slowdown story is that the contraction in the world s third and fourth largest economies  Japan and Germany respectively  were anomalies and both economies appear to have resumed their expansion at the start of Q4 
The US reports October industrial production and manufacturing output  Both are expected to have increased by 0 2   It tends not to move the markets  The Treasury s International Capital  TIC  report will be released after the markets close today  Consider that the TIC data has tracked an average inflow of  106 bln a month this year through August  compared with an average of almost  36 bln a month in 2017  Some observers prefer to focus on long term instruments  The average of long term inflows is almost  60 bln a month through August  a little more than twice the average of the same period in last year 
Mexico s central bank hiked the overnight rate yesterday by 25 bp to 8 00  as widely expected  The accompanying commentary was hawkish and the central bank staked out a position independent and antagonistic to the new government  which has yet to take office  Another rate hike at the next meeting  December 20  appears largely discounted  One board member called for a 50 bp hike  In the unusually pointed statement  the central bank argued that it had to take action because of the policy uncertainty  including the cancellation of the  13 bln project to build a new airport  that undermined the peso  The depreciation of the peso poses a risk to the central bank s anti inflation efforts 
Ten new projects may put to voters by the end of the month  Meanwhile  the resignation of the deputy governor of the central bank  reportedly for health reasons  means that AMLO will be able to name two of the five board members in the first few weeks of his term  which begins next month  The US dollar tested the MXN20 50 area  a five month high Tuesday and Wednesday and found support yesterday near MXN20 20  which may denote the near term range  We like it higher ",2018-11-16,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/turning-brexit-into-a-dogs-breakfast-200359897,200359897

199460,420976,AMAT,The Covered Strangle  Selling Both Call And Put Options,opinion,"Why not sell both covered calls and cash secured puts on the same stock  I ve been asked this question numerous times  There is actually a strategy that incorporates both BCI go to strategies into one overall game plan  It is known as the covered strangle 
Components of the covered strangle

Buy stock
Sell call option
Sell put option

The top two components represent the covered call aspect and the last is where we sell the cash secured put 
Goals
We are looking to generate monthly cash flow while at the same time positioning ourselves to buy a stock at a  discount  should the share price expire below the put strike  Inherent in this plan is that we are willing to own twice as many shares as we currently own even if share price moves below the put strike 
Obligations  assuming no exit strategy intervention 

Sell stock if share price moves above the call strike
Buy stock if share price moves below the put strike

Risk
The risk is to the downside only  If there is price decline below the put strike  we double our position with half purchased initially and the other half at the put strike  Share price can move to zero  Of course  we always have our exit strategy arsenal to mitigate losing positions 
Strike price selections
We start by determining our 1 month  or other time frame  time value return goals  in my case it s 2    4   We use the Ellman Calculator to determine which strikes will fall into this range  We then fine tune our selections with these guidelines 

The more bullish we are  the deeper out of the money calls and closer to the money puts are selected
The less bullish we are  the closer to the money calls and deeper out of the money puts are chosen

All strikes must offer our initial time value return goals 
Real life example with Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT 

The yellow fields in this  highlight the out of the money  57 00 call  with AMAT trading at  56 69  and the out of the money  55 00 put  The bid prices  circled in red  are  1 90 and  1 36 respectively 
Maximum profit
The formula to determine maximum profit  Call premium   Put premium   share appreciation to the call strike
The cost basis is the mid point between the cost of shares initially purchased and the  put strike   put premium  
Let s calculate per share 
   1 90    1 36     0 31    56 69     55 00    1 36   2
 3 57  55 17   6 47 
Discussion
For those investors looking to generate monthly cash flow while at the same time positioning to buy that same stock  at a discount  and doubling our position size  the covered strangle may be an appropriate strategy to initiate

Materials Inc    NASDAQ AMAT    TriNet Group Inc    NYSE TNET    Stepan Company   NYSE SCL   and Allegion plc   NYSE ALLE   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Impressive Liquid Stocks for Marvelous ReturnsInvestors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions  Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth  However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining

	Those Syrian Russian fears that hurt the market yesterday sure didn t last long  The major indices enjoyed a very respectable rally on Thursday due  in part  to another tweet from President Trump stating that bombs may not be falling as soon as previously expected  It was a different message than yesterday s tweet that missiles  will be coming  to Syria in response to that government s alleged chemical weapons attack on citizens over the weekend

approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that rake in higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength

199487,421003,AMAT,Is Applied Materials  AMAT  A Strong Growth Stock ,opinion,"The goal of many retail investors today is to be the first to catch the next big trend in growth investments  Historically  big tech companies  and recently  cryptocurrencies  have taken the investing world by storm  making it increasingly difficult to see through to the light that is subtle stocks with strong steady growth 
Semiconductor equipment  an industry many retail investors have never looked into  may provide the answer for those looking for a strong growth option 
Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT       a major wafer fabrication company  is taking the charge  and  B  grades for Growth and Momentum based on our Style Scores system show just how strong this company is  These factors  and the company s strong record  combine to give Applied Materials an  A  overall VGM grade 
Now that we ve shown you that Applied Materials is a well rounded option  we can dive into why this could be the need to know pick for those seeking strong growth options 
Fundamentals  
Most growth investors base their financial decisions on proven growth and momentum in previous quarters and years  as well as the promise of strong future growth 
For those who like to see proven results  Applied Material s share prices have jumped from  53 04 to  58 47  or 10 2   in the past 12 weeks  With it stock price having moved up 320  from where it was five years ago  it is easy to see why this steadily surging tech company appeals to investors looking for strong momentum 
To appease those on the other side of the coin  Applied Materials boasts a current quarter earnings growth estimate of 43  and a current year growth estimate of 35 5  
Looking into its revenue stream and sales estimates  we continue to see strong signs of growth in the short and long run  Sales estimates for the current quarter are calling for growth of 25 5   with next quarter estimates projecting 18 6  growth and full year estimates calling for 19 6  improvement 
If this isn t enough to convince you that the company is growing steadily and will continue to do so  one should consider that EPS growth for the next three to five years is expected to come in at an annualized rate 13 3   a strong statistic for those seeking long term investments 
Combine this with the company s surprisingly low P E ratio of 12 0 compared to the industry average 16 5  and we have a simultaneous great deal  something that is not usually seen with such growth options 
Meanwhile  earnings estimate revisions have been unanimously positive for the current and next quarter  with only one negative revision for the current year out of the seven total  showing strong analyst sentiment 
These factors help to push Applied Materials to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and make it an option or growth investors to seriously consider 
The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All
Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2018-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-applied-materials-amat-a-strong-growth-stock-200302812,200302812
199496,421012,AMAT,Applied Materials  AMAT  Hits Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Applied Materials  Inc   NASDAQ AMAT    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 34 67  over the past month  AMAT hit a new 52 week high of  61 76 in the previous session  Applied Materials has gained 20 52  since the start of the year compared to the 9 16  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 20 24  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 14  2018  Applied Materials reported EPS of  1 06 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 97 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 47  
For the current fiscal year  Applied Materials is expected to post earnings of  4 39 per share on  17 39 billion in revenues  This represents a 35 08  change in EPS on a 19 61  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 55 per share on  18 67 billion in revenues  This represents changes of 3 64  and 7 37   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Applied Materials may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for AMAT  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Applied Materials has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 03x current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 16 71x versus its peer group s average of 17 06x  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 17  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Applied Materials  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Applied Materials currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Applied Materials fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though AMAT shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Applied Materials Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Applied Materials have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including     and   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 1 89  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMAT  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/applied-materials-amat-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200297334,200297334
199507,421023,AMAT,Applied Materials Nears Strong Short Level,opinion,Shares of Applied Materials  Inc   NASDAQ AMAT  have surged in recent days from a low pivot of  45 00 back to nearly  57 00  This surge has yielded a possible short trade at  57 00 based on a resistance trend line  Note the chart below ,2018-02-21,Gareth Soloway,https://www.investing.com/analysis/applied-materials-amat-nears-strong-short-level-200292811,200292811
199515,421031,AMAT,Should You Buy Applied Materials  AMAT  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT   closed relatively flat on Tuesday  just one day before the semiconductor equipment supplier is scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings results  As a leading supplier to the red hot chip manufacturing industry  Applied serves as a bellwether for the entire technology sector  and its report should attract plenty of attention on Wall Street 
Applied Materials is one of the world s largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor  LCD  and solar PV cell manufacturers  The company also provides equipment used in the production of coatings for flexible electronics and services related to manufacturing processes and installation 
The strength of the semiconductor industry over the past two years has well documented  and that means that suppliers like Applied Materials have benefitted too  In fact  shares of AMAT have moved about 40  higher in the past 52 weeks alone 
But what does Applied Materials have in store for its latest report tomorrow  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Outlook
Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  we expect Applied Materials to report adjusted earnings of  0 97 per share and revenues of  4 10 billion  These results would represent year over year growth of 44 8  and 25 2   respectively 
But of course  earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Applied reports on Wednesday  It will also be important to track the company s performance in its different business segments to get a better sense of what is driving growth right now 
To prepare for this  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file  The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
Our consensus estimate file is calling for AMAT to post total revenues of  2 84 billion in its Silicons division  which would represent growth of 32 1  from the year ago period  The Silicons division includes Applied s semiconductor focused products and is the company s largest in terms of revenue  Last quarter  Applied witnessed growth of just 14 1  in this segment 
Meanwhile  our consensus estimates are projecting that AMAT will post total Services revenues of  791 million  That would mark growth of about 13 7  from the year ago quarter  In the previous quarter  Applied saw growth of 19 9  in this unit 
Earnings ESP
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Applied Materials surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Just one day before its report  AMAT is sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of 0 57   This is because the company s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at  0 98 per share  meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus  This improved outlook is a good sign heading into the report 
Price Performance and Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of AMAT s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices Applied Materials  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Applied Materials has an impeccable earnings surprise history and has not missed our consensus estimates since 2013  We have also witnessed the stock respond pretty well to these positive surprises  although this is far from a guarantee 
Another thing to remember is that Applied will likely be taking a huge one time charge related to the recent U S  tax reform bill  This will result in a significant difference between GAAP and non GAAP results  but the overall impact of tax reform could lead to favorable earnings guidance for the next few quarters

199526,421042,AMAT,Nikon  NINOY  Q3 Revenues Decrease Y Y  Forecast Raised,opinion,Nikon Corporation s   OTC NINOY   third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings increased significantly over the comparable quarter last fiscal  as the company generated a net profit of  8 4 billion   74 3 million  against a loss of  7 9 billion last year Operating income for the fiscal third quarter came in at  18 4 billion   162 8 million   versus an operating loss of  8 6 billion in the year ago quarter For the first nine months of the fiscal  net profit attributable to owners increased 57  to  22 3 billion   199 1 million  compared with year ago quarter  Earnings per share for the first nine months of the fiscal improved 56 6  year over year Further  operating income increased 123 1  year over year to  41 4 billion  supported by strong performance in the Precision Equipment and Imaging Products businesses Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter  Nikon s net sales decreased 11 5  year over year to  196 8 billion   1 74 billion   The top line was negatively impacted by decline of sales volume of digital camera interchangeable lens type  compact digital cameras as well as FPD lithography systems Nikon Corp  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   For the first nine months of the fiscal  net sales fell 7 2  to  525 2 billion   4 69 billion   due to negative growth in Imaging Products Business as well as in Precision Equipment Business  year over year For the quarter  sales for the Precision Equipment Business recorded a decline of 33 6  year over year to  48 1 billion   425 7 million   Revenues were offset by decline in sales volume of FPD lithography systems  Operating income at the segment rose to  8 4 billion  against an operating loss of  10 6 billion in the prior year period  Operating income for the segment increased significantly on the back of improved performance in the semiconductor lithography system field The Imaging Products Business witnessed a decline in sales as the top line shrunk 5 3  year over year to  116 billion   1 03 billion   However  operating profit recorded an increase of 95 2  to  16 2 billion compared with  8 3 billion in the prior year period  The unit s operating profit improved on account of favorable response to the D850  a digital SLR camera in the market Sales for the Healthcare Business recorded an increase of 6 1  year over year to  14 billion   123 9 million   The units  revenues were driven by impressive sales of ultra wide field retinal imaging device in Europe and the United States  The segment recorded an operating loss of  1 billion  wider than the loss of  0 7 billion in the prior year period  The figure was dragged by upfront investments in new businesses The Industrial Metrology and Others delivered sales of  18 7 billion   166 4 million  in the quarter  up from sales of  14 2 billion recorded in the year ago period  This segment also recorded an operating profit of  1 6 billion  higher than the profit of  1 billion in the prior year period Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Dec 31  2017  Nikon s cash and cash equivalents were  386 7 billion   3 4 billion   up from  316 7 billion recorded a year ago Total liabilities as of Dec 31  2017  came out to be  557 billion   4 9 billion   up from  480 2 billion as of Mar 31  2017 GuidanceConcurrent with its earnings release  Nikon raised the guidance for fiscal 2018  The company now expects net sales to come at around  720 billion  up from previous forecast of  710 billion  The company anticipates sales and profit in the Imaging Products Business to be stronger than previously expected  Precision Equipment business profit is anticipated to rise in both FPD lithography system field as well as semiconductor lithography system field  However  in the Industrial Metrology and Others profit is expected to decline due to high restructuring expenses  This apart  the company raised forecast for operating profits  from  45 billion to  53 billion Restructuring Plan   Business SegmentsEarlier  Nikon unveiled a plan to undertake company wide structural reform  as it seeks to enhance operational profitability and create value The restructuring was prompted by the fact that Nikon has not been able to derive value from its existing businesses  The company s Imaging Product business has been grappling with foreign exchange headwinds In light of the above scenario  Nikon planned to discontinue the current  Medium Term Management Plan Update   Instead  it has initiated a company wide restructuring to help shift to a strategy which pursues profit growth instead of revenue growth The plan includes reassessment of the strategy of the Semiconductor Lithography and Imaging Product Businesses  Additionally  Nikon intends to optimize manufacturing  sales and R D on a global basis along with streamlining and optimizing workforce  As part of the initiative  Nikon stated it will be declaring a voluntary retirement program for about 1 000 employees Further  Nikon restructured its business segments during the fiscal second quarter  The company integrated two of its business units  Microscope Solutions BU and Medical Business Development Division into Healthcare BU  which falls under a separate  new segment named the Healthcare Business  Also  the Industrial Metrology BU was reclassified under the new Industrial Metrology and Others segment  along with Customized Products BU  Glass BU  and Encoder BU The business structure was reorganized to facilitate collaboration and streamline operations Our TakeNikon remains bullish on its Healthcare business along with Industrial Metrology and Others businesses  It expects these segments to act as strong growth drivers  going forward  The reorganized business structure is likely to facilitate collaboration as well as streamline operations However  poor performance from Imaging Products business and Precision Equipment business remain headwinds  Also  high R D expenditure and investments related to the medical business are escalating operational costs  consequently putting pressure on margins Nikon currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks to ConsiderA few better ranked stocks in the same space include Aspen Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AZPN    Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT   and MKS Instruments  Inc    NASDAQ MKSI    While Aspen

The upside in comparable sales was driven by high single digit growth in Health   Wellness as well as Sleep   Respiratory Care  while Domestic Appliances and Personal Care recorded growth in mid single digit  On a geographic basis  double digit growth in Asia Pacific and India  high single digit growth in Central   Eastern Europe and China  bolstered revenues in the quarter Diagnosis

revenues declined 5  year over year  while comparable sales grew 2  for the quarter  Comparable sales growth was primarily driven by high single digit growth in Healthcare Informatics as well as low single digit growth in Patient Care   Monitoring Solutions On a geographic basis  while mid single digit growth was posted mature geographies  mid single digit decline was witnessed in growth geographies  Double digit growth in India and high single digit growth in North America proved conducive to sales  which was somewhat offset by double digit decline in Middle East   Turkey and Africa Revenues in the HealthTech   Other segment continued to show weakness  shrinking 22 2  to  119 million   140 1 million   The decline in this segment can mainly be attributed to lower royalty income during the quarter Since the third quarter of 2017  Philips has been reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations Liquidity   Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Dec 31  2017  Philips  cash and cash equivalents declined to  1 939 million   2 322 7 million  from  2 334 million a year back  The company s long term debt rose to  4 044 million   4 844 3 million  compared with  4 021 million a year ago Diligent Cost Savings ProgramsPhilips has been gaining significantly from its DfX program  along with other productivity and savings programs  These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company  while accelerating growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution During the reported quarter  the company achieved procurement savings of  81 million  driven by the DfX program  while other productivity programs also resulted in a savings of  52 million  Overall  the company generated an impressive annual savings of  483

scenario and combining with the company s strong order book  Philips projects full year sales growth of 4 6   The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year Our TakeIn the past couple of years  Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider  Further  the company s transformation from a hardware oriented to a software driven business  with a higher margin and recurring revenue model is impressive  The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long term growth driver  going forward Moreover  the company remains optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis   Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends as Image Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment sales are acting as major profit churners  Further  the company s ardent lookout for strategic acquisitions has enabled it to strengthen core business  This apart  the company is strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change initiative programs   namely Accelerate  End2End productivity  and Design for Excellence   implemented earlier

199608,421124,AMAT,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Vishay Intertechnology  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  Applied Materials And Ford Motor,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 8  2017   Stocks in this week s article Vishay Intertechnology  Inc    NYSE VSH    Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V    NYSE F    Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT   and Ford Motor Company   NYSE F   Add Value to Your Investment with These Low P CF StocksInvestors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks  But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch When it comes to the investment market  experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would recommend Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  as one of the key metrics  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric  when the most widely used metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  what makes P CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly reflecting the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  However  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  Then again  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves For the rest of this

Our  explained some of the important differences between investing and trading  We used Bitcoin as a specific example  If you missed it  a glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  Pullback Fear  Consider Uncorrelated Stocks
Just as a broken clock is right twice a day  pundits warn relentlessly of the next big stock market pullback  until one finally arrives  And considering our almost uninterrupted rally since the depths of the financial crisis more than eight years ago  it s understandable that some stock market participants are nervous 
Historically  investors have been able to take some risk off the table by investing in bonds  And since the early 1980 s  investors have enjoyed the benefits of sinking interest rates  i e  when interest rates go down  bond prices go up   But now the tables are turned  interest rates are low and they re rising this is a decidedly less attractive situation 
Investment strategies that are less correlated with the overall market  and still offer attractive returns  are compelling because they can significantly reduce risk while simultaneously making money One of the benefits of our trading strategies is their low correlation with the overall stock market  more on this later  
Something New More Data
This week we re implementing something new for our readers  We re including a table summarizing the results for our models  which work well when combined  The tables show the actual client results after commissions and fees  I watch this every day  and now readers can see it as well   We ll share additional information  including test data  with those interested in investing  For our weekly updates  we use only real time results 

The results in the table above include all of the positions  10 for Road Runner and Athena  16 for Holmes  and 20 for Felix   not just the specific stock examples we discuss in the Stock Exchange every week  and sorry Oscar  you have too many individual stocks and trades to be part of this approach   We ve included six months of data since that is the shortest real time record we have  All of the models are expected to perform well over longer time periods  Holmes  for example  has returned over 22  in the last eighteen months 
Very importantly  the following correlation matrix shows the attractively low correlation of our strategies versus the market  as measured by the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   

Unlike most equity strategies  our approach has a very low correlation to the market  This is an attractive quality because it can reduce risk  as measured by volatility  while simultaneously keeping returns high  So if you are fearing a market pullback  our lower correlation strategies can be attractive and worth considering 
Expert Picks from the Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by   aka Mark Hines   Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas 
RoadRunner  This week I like Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   I like to buy stocks that are at the bottom of a rising channel  and if you look at the chart below you can see why I like Applied Materials 

Blue Harbinger  Interesting pick Road Runner  Applied Materials  price has been increasing significantly since the start of 2016  And considering your momentum driven strategy  I can see why you think it may be going higher  From a fundamentals standpoint  the company supplies manufacturing equipment to the semiconductor industry  and this is an industry with tremendous long term growth potential  Not only the continued proliferation and complexity of smart phones  but also artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things   IoT   will help this entire industry grow for many years to come 
RR  That s nice  Blue Harbinger  that you re looking  many years  into the future  but my typical holding period is only about 4 week  I ll be in an out long before  5g  networks ever arrive 
BH  4 weeks Road Runner  Really  And what will you do if the market turns south  like so many pundits and prognosticators are warning 
RR  First of all  I don t let emotions like fear and greed impact my decisions  I am a data driven model  I m totally objective  And second of all  when my strategy is combined with the our other models  some of which are NOT momentum driven  we do quite well  as the early table in this report shows 
BH  I m impressed with your results so far  but more data is always nice  And if you change your mind  here is a look at some helpful fundamental data in the following Fast Graph from Chuck Carnevale it s good stuff 

RR  Thanks  How about you Holmes  What have you got this week 
Holmes  In a rare twist  I don t have any new picks for you this week  I m usually able to find something attractive  but I don t force things when the opportunity is just not there 
BH  Wow that is a rare twist  You ve usually got something  How about you  Athena  Do you have anything for us this week 
Athena  This week I like RH  NYSE RH   formerly Restoration Hardware   I utilize a momentum strategy  my average holding period is 1 month  I use stops to control risks  and I exit when my price target is achieved  You can see RH s recent performance in the following chart  It s above its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  and it s got room to run 

BH  Interesting pick  Athena  If you recall  Road Runner basically hit a home run with RH when  during the week of August 25th  he typically holds for 4 weeks   And you also picked this one back in mid July  How did that work out for you 
Athena  Last time I picked RH it worked out just fine  My recent track record is included in the table earlier in this report  and my 3 month record  i e  since my last RH pick  is very strong 
BH  The CEO of this company keeps   He recently owned over 2 2 million of the company s 21 million shares outstanding  Insider buying can be a good sign  Fundamentally  this company s profit margin has been thin  but revenues remain strong  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Athena  Thanks for that information  I usually hold for about 1 month  so check back with me then  How about you Felix  what have you got for us this week 
Felix  This week I ran the most liquid stocks in the Russell 2000 small cap index through my model  and I have included the top 20 in the table below 

BH  I see RH made your list  I suppose that makes some sense considering you and Athena are both momentum traders 
Felix  True  I am a momentum trader  But I tend hold things longer than the other traders  66 weeks on average  I exit when my price target is reached  and I control risk by monitoring macro factors and using stops 
BH  RH has been an interesting one to follow considering the volatile price and the signifcant share buybacks  Thanks for sharing all 20 of those stocks  I see some names on there I recognize  and a few that I will look into  Anyway  how about you  Oscar  Have you got anything for us this week 
Oscar  This week I have provided a ranking of the high volume ETFs  They re included in the following table 

BH  That is interesting  I recognize almost all of the ETFs on your list  except for Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares  NYSE TZA  I had to look that one up  It s the Drexion Small Cap 3X Bear ETF   Considering you follow a momentum strategy  I can see why some of those ETFs make sense on your list  but some seem like an anomoly to me 
Oscar  You are correct  I am a momentum trader  but my average holding period is typically about 6 weeks  I rotate into another sector when it s time to exit  and I also use stops to conrol risk 
BH  Thanks for sharing your list Oscar  I always enjoy hearing about what is interesting to you

199621,421137,AMAT,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Applied Materials  Kemet And Vishay Intertechnology,opinion,For Immediate Release Chicago  IL   November 1  2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT    Kemet Corp    NYSE KEM   and Vishay Intertechnology  Inc    NYSE VSH   3 Stocks that Know How to Beat EarningsWe can t get enough of earnings season here at Zacks  It s like having Christmas four times a year  There are both pleasant surprises and huge disappointments as companies release their results to investors  And it also refreshes the data of our Zacks Rank  This earnings season isn t expected to be as impressive as the last two  but the market seems optimistic that it will be solid enough to justify the market s valuations  Sheraz Mian offered an in depth look at this earnings season in his recent  article But earnings season is unpredictable both in the numbers that are reported and in the market s reaction to them  Its not just about finding companies that beat expectations  You need to find stocks that will advance AFTER a strong report  One of the best places to look for these earnings superstars is Zacks   screen  As the name implies  this screen seeks out Zacks Rank  1s  Strong Buys  with positive surprises and upward earnings estimates  These stocks are the best positioned to outperform in the near and longer terms Below are two stocks that look set for solid reports and one that has already done so  But remember  there are dozens of names that passed this screen s criteria  So after reading these profiles  make sure to go to  to look up the other names and the parameters  If you re not a ZP member  earnings season is a great time to sign up Applied MaterialsThere was once a time when this semiconductor equipment supplier was primarily driven by PC demand but no longer  You don t get to be a leader in your field with a nearly  60 billion market cap by focusing on just one area  And if the company is right  then it s growth potential is just beginning As recently stated at its  2017 Analyst Day   Applied Materials is entering into  a new era of computing   and it plans to use materials innovation to spark new breakthroughs in areas like the Internet of Things  big data and even artificial intelligence In fact  AMAT expects non GAAP earnings per share of  5 08 for fiscal 2020  which would mark an amazing improvement from  1 75 last year But the foundation for this proposed future growth is being laid right now  such as in its fiscal third quarter report  AMAT reported earnings per share of 86 cents  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 16th straight quarter  Net sales climbed 33  year over year to  3 74 billion Looking toward the fiscal fourth quarter  which will be reported on Nov 16   AMAT sees net sales between  3 85 billion and  4 billion  averaging to a 19  improvement from the previous year  Non GAAP earnings per share are expected to jump approximately 36  to between 86 cents and 94 cents This fiscal year ends this month  and AMAT currently has a Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 23 per share  The result has improved by 3 5  over the past 2 months  Going forward  earnings are expected to grow nearly 14  to  3 68 for next fiscal year  ending October 2018   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this period has gained 10 8  in the past 60 days Kemet Corp Kemet Corp  is what investors dream about  Shares of this passive electronic components supplier have soared nearly 300  so far this year  and it recently pushed its way into the S P SmallCap 600 index  KEM is a player in two of the fastest growing sectors of the U S  capacitor industry  solid tantalum capacitors and multilayer ceramic capacitors  As a member of the Electronics   Miscellaneous Components industry  the company is part of a space in the top 28  of the Zacks Industry Rank   but it s blowing the doors off that industry s comparatively meager 36 6  advance YTD  But can this momentum continue If earnings estimates are any indication  and we know they are   then KEM should have plenty of running room in the future  It may have soared triple digits this year  but its still only at about  24 and has a positive Earnings ESP for the report coming on Nov 2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending March 2018  hasn t moved very dramatically in the past 2 months  but has soared 63 9  from 3 months ago Next fiscal year ends in March 2019  so its still a far way off  Yet  earnings estimates are already expected to grow 5 7  to  1 68 per share  which has advanced 43 4  in 3 months Much of the spike in shares and earnings estimates can be traced back to the April acquisition of NEC TOKIN Corp In its fiscal first quarter report  KEM announced its fifth straight positive surprise  Earnings per share of 33 cents surged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 65   The average surprise over the past four quarters is also 65   Net sales of  274 million were up  76 5 million year over Vishay Intertechnology  Inc We were feeling pretty good about Vishay Intertechnology s third quarter report on October 26  given that this leading manufacturer of discrete semiconductors and passive components had beaten estimates in five of the previous six quarters  And the company didn t disappoint Adjusted earnings per share of 42 cents jumped past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 5  and trounced last year s 25 cents  Even with a rare miss in the fourth quarter and a match in last year s third quarter  VSH still has a positive earnings surprise of nearly 6  in the past four quarters  Looking forward  the company says it is well positioned to capitalize on expected strong growth in automotive markets for years to come VSH is a leading manufacturer of discrete semiconductors and passive components  which puts it in a space  Semiconductor   Discretes  that s in the top 3  of the Zacks Industry Rank  It s got the seventh spot out of 256 industries with a year to date advance of almost 30    FYI   discretes  are semiconductors that perform rudimentary electronic functions  The company provides one of the most comprehensive electronic component lines in the world  which has been a big help at earnings time  It enjoyed continued strong demand from virtually all its markets in the third quarter  helping revenues reach  678 million from last year s  592 million  The industrial and automotive markets were especially solid  Revenues are expected between  645 million and  685 million in the fourth quarter Earnings estimates have only moved higher a few pennies since the report  but that s likely to change moving forward for this underfollowed stock  The last report prompted a sharp rise in expectations that can still be seen  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has jumped 13 1  in the past three months to  1 38  Earnings are expected to gain a further 6 5  next year to  1 47  which is up nearly 15  in 90 days

199717,421233,AMAT,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include Include AppFolio  Applied Materials  FormFactor And TriNet Group,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 18  2017   Stocks in this week s article include AppFolio Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ APPF        Applied Materials Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ AMAT        FormFactor Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ FORM       and TriNet Group Inc   NYSE    NYSE TNET       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Top Liquid Stocks to Buy for Marvelous ReturnsLiquidity indicates a company s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash So  a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company s financial health Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Growth Style Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only eight Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified

199723,421239,AMAT,4 Top Liquid Stocks To Buy For Marvelous Returns,opinion,Liquidity indicates a company s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash So  a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all

added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks

s projected range of  215  225 million  Also  it grew 23 1  on a year over year basis and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  216 million comfortably  Solid demand of all product lines across each end market proved conducive to top line growth The company s Enterprise Technology segment continued to fare remarkably well  with revenues soaring a whopping 48 5  year over year to  113 9 million  The striking growth was fueled by the entire UniFi product family  Disruptive pricing and higher average selling prices of recently launched products also drove the top line  Moreover  high demand for

199763,421279,AMAT,Pitney Bowes  PBI  Hit By Rising Expense  Poor End Markets,opinion,"Earlier this month premium global eCommerce solutions provider  Pitney Bowes Inc    NYSE PBI    reported its second quarter 2017 results  which came in below expectations  The company reverted to its dismal earnings miss trend after posting a solitary earnings beat last quarter  Further  investors were miffed as the company tweaked its full year 2017 guidance 
Year to date  the stock has lost 13 9   in stark contrast to the  s average positive gain of 21 6  

Also  analysts are showing no favor toward the stock as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2017 earnings has gone down from  1 75 to  1 72  Given its array of problems  we believe that Pitney Bowes investors are in for an even bumpier ride  Let s take a deeper look at factors plaguing the company 
Lingering Softness in Mailing Business
Prolonged weakness in the company s North American mailing business is proving to be a significant drag on the top line  During the second quarter of 2017  Small and Medium Business   SMB   Solutions revenues dipped 3  year over year to  436 4 million  The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business  down 1   and International Mailing Business  down 11   
This segment continues to suffer from lower recurring revenue streams and rental revenues  Additionally  a waning recurring revenues trajectory and poor equipment sales are making matters worse  Uncertain global economic environment is expected to impact production mail and software businesses in the near term  thereby limiting the company s growth momentum 
Precipitous Decline in Software Sales
Though Pitney Bowes adopted multiple measures to boost profits at the software segment  its taking much longer than expected for the results to show  In general  licensed software businesses are always susceptible to swings based on large transactions  Given the scale of Pitney Bowes  business  it remains vulnerable to those swings 
Currently  the company is focusing on driving growth by penetrating into new areas  However  this has put the margin performance under pressure in the short run 
Escalating Costs
Pitney Bowes has been experiencing a surge in its operating expenses on account of ERP implementation in the U S  and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising and marketing strategies for strengthening brand value  The company expects marketing expenses to be up on a year over year basis 
In addition  it expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program  related to digital capabilities enhancement  for entire 2017  Also  capital expenses associated with the ERP project remain a drag  Til the benefits of ERP materialize  the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company is expected to incur higher capital expenses that might exert pressure on margins 
Stocks to Consider
Some stocks in the broader sector include Applied Optoelectronics  Inc    NASDAQ AAOI    Red Hat  Inc    NYSE RHT   and Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT    While Applied Materials sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Red Hat and Applied Materials hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Applied Optoelectronics has a whopping average earnings surprise of 21 0  for the trailing four quarters  beating estimates all through 
Red Hat  Inc  has a robust earnings surprise history  with an average positive surprise of 11 1   driven by consecutive earnings beats over the trailing four quarters 
With four back to back beats  Applied Materials has an average positive surprise of 3 5  for the trailing four quarters

Top 5 ROE Stocks to Buy as Global Markets Remain Edgy

	The equity markets remained relatively skittish in the past few days as various geopolitical issues took the center stage  These included President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris accord  a breakdown in relationship between Persian Gulf countries with severance of Qatar ties and a deadly terror attack in London   the third in less than three months  As sublime tensions continue to raise an element of caution  investors are on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that will offer high returns 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE 
	ROE Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters Used for Screening
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment

199843,421359,AMAT,Applied Materials  Is AMAT A Solid Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Applied Materials  Inc    NASDAQ AMAT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Applied Materials has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 78  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 27  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Applied Materials  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 19 99 over the past five years  Moreover  the current multiple stands way below the highs for the stock  suggesting it to be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer   Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 92  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Applied Materials has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 49  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Applied Materials stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Applied Materials  P CF ratio of 16 62 is much lower than the Zacks classified Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry average of 29 48  which indicates that the stock is quite undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Applied Materials currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Applied Materials a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Applied Materials is just 0 93  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 03  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Applied Materials might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives AMAT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Notably  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  as the current quarter and full year have seen eight and twelve estimates go higher in the past sixty days  respectively  Further  both the current quarter and full year estimates didn t witness any downward revisions in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 22 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased about 10   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Applied Materials  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineClearly  Applied Materials is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Apart from a solid Zacks Rank  the company also flaunts a robust industry rank  Top 6  out of over 250 industries   In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks classified Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry has crushed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best

Bet on These 5 Liquid Stocks for Solid Returns

	Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash  Liquid stocks have always been in demand owing to their potential to provide maximum returns 

	A company with a favorable liquidity position always has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently 

	Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners 

Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks

	Liquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity 

Current Ratio   It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered to be ideal 

Quick Ratio   Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable 

Cash Ratio   This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash 

	So  a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company s financial health 

Screening Parameters

	In order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient 

	In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen 

Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  

Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  

Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see

5 Top Ranked Liquid Stocks to Buy Now

	Liquidity indicates a company s ability to meet its short term debt obligations  Thus companies with favorable liquidity positions are poised to provide significant returns during any circumstances  However  companies with high liquidity may not always be financially strong  It may also indicate that the company is failing to utilize its assets efficiently  It is therefore important to also focus on efficiency alongside liquidity to build a profitable portfolio 

Liquidity Ratios

	Liquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity 

Current Ratio   It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered to be ideal 

Quick Ratio   Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable 

Cash Ratio   This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using cash 

	So  a ratio of greater than 1 is always desirable but it may not always underline a company s financial health 

Screening Parameters

	In order to avoid selection of inefficient companies  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Since this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be called efficient 

	In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too  we have added our proprietary  to the screen 

Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3
	 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency 

Asset utilization greater than industry average  
	 Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  

Zacks Rank equal to  1
	 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    

Growth Style Score less than or equal to B

	 Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 handily beat other stocks  

	Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700stocks to only eight 

	Here are five stocks from the list 

WellCare Health Plans  Inc   NYSE      provides managed care services targeted exclusively to government sponsored healthcare programs  WellCare Health Plans has a Growth Style Score of  A  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 40

199900,421416,AMAT,Applied Materials  Agrium  Pfizer And KB Home Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   May 26  2016    highlights Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT     as the Bull of the Day and  Agrium    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE     and  KB Home    

Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  

  

Few companies have managed to surprise this earnings season and soar higher following the release of their results  However  one that definitely was an exception to this rule was Applied Materials    

This technology company provides services  manufacturing equipment  and software to companies in the semiconductor  display and solar PV industries around the globe and it edged out earnings estimates for its most recent quarter  The company then saw shares surge by double digits following this bullish release and a solid outlook  which was in stark contrast to many companies this earnings season which beat estimates and actually fell on their reports 

AMAT is now up about 24  in the past three months  which is roughly triple the S P 500 in the time frame  And with this type of outperformance  investors have to be wondering if this trend can continue heading into the summer 

The price action is definitely a concern for those considering jumping in now  but the PE is still below 16  and the growth outlook remains robust  Additionally  analysts seem to be believers in the stock  as they have been ratcheting up estimates lately  a potentially great sign for AMAT investors 

Recent Estimates

In just the past week  seven estimates have marched higher for the current quarter and the next quarter  while we have seen a similar amount move higher for the full year and the next year time period too  And best of all  not a single estimate has moved lower  suggesting universal agreement from analysts on AMAT s near term prospects 

But not only have estimates moved higher  but the magnitude of these revisions have also been impressive  In the past week  the current quarter consensus estimate has surged by over 30   while the full year has seen a 16  move in the past week alone too 

And with a great history in earnings season which includes meeting or beating estimates every time since August 2013  it is pretty clear that AMAT knows how to manage expectations  In fact  that miss in August of 2013 was the only such time that AMAT has failed to meet or beat the consensus estimate in the past five years 



  



We last wrote up Agrium    as a  Bear of the Day  about a month ago  and since then  the company has posted a fresh earnings report  The company actually  estimates in its release a few weeks ago  including a surprise profit 

While this appears bullish  it is important to note that sales struggled in several major segments  and overall gross profit was sharply lower when compared to the year ago time frame  Additionally  AGU ratcheted down expectations for its full year profit  pushing down EPS estimates to between  5 25  6 25 a share  down from their prior view of  5 50  7 00 a share  And while AGU boosted the range of crop nutrient sales a tad to the optimistic side  the company did cut full year potash production levels too 

Given these numbers  it shouldn t be too surprising that AGU finds itself back in bear of the day territory  In fact  analysts have once again embarked on a series of estimate cuts which could continue to spell doom for AGU shares in the near term 

Recent Estimates

In the past thirty days  five estimates have gone lower for the current quarter  while not a single one has been revised higher  We see a similar trend for the current year and next year time frames too  with six estimates going lower in the past thirty days and not a single one higher 

The magnitude of these cuts has also been pretty severe  as the current quarter and current year consensus estimates have fallen by over 7  in the past few months  Meanwhile  the next quarter period is especially poor  with the consensus falling by about 27  in the past two months alone 

Thanks to these big cuts in expectations  current quarter and current year growth rates are expected to come in at  15  for each time period  Additionally  the next quarter period is looking at a nearly 42  drop in earnings  when compared to the year ago time frame 

With this kind of outlook  a strong earnings beat is pretty meaningless as investors are focusing in on the future instead  And it definitely doesn t seem great for this company  or the industry at large  given that it has a bottom 10  industry rank as well 

No wonder we currently have AGU as a Zacks Rank  5  strong sell  and are looking for more underperformance from this stock in the near term
