14340,235855,NOC,S P 500 snaps win streak as Middle East tensions push down Wall Street,news,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK  Reuters    Wall Street s major indexes fell from record highs on Friday after a U S  air strike in Iraq ratcheted up tensions in the Middle East and a bigger than expected contraction in the U S  manufacturing sector raised concerns of slowing economic growth 
Friday s decline put the benchmark S P 500 in the red for the week  snapping a five week winning streak for the index 
Demand for safe haven assets soared as Iran vowed revenge for the killing of Qassem Soleimani  head of its elite Quds Force  in an air strike authorized by U S  President Donald Trump 
In a further blow to U S  market sentiment  data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that U S  factory activity contracted in December by the most in more than a decade 
 There was a reinforcement of weak manufacturing activity and then you had the geopolitical spark   said Michael Antonelli  market strategist at Robert W  Baird in Milwaukee   That s on top of the sentiment that the market has been overbought

106663,328178,NOC,Will Northrop Grumman Stock Be a Top Performer Again in 2020 ,news,"Following the announcement last week that a U S  drone attack had killed a top Iranian general  defense stocks got a tidy boost of between about 3  and 7   Northrop Grumman Corp   NYSE  NOC  scored one of the biggest boosts with a share price gain of 5 4  on Friday  January 3  Northrop Grumman stock came within a hair s breadth of posting a new 52 week high  Lockheed Martin Corp   NYSE  LMT   Boeing Co   NYSE  BA   Raytheon Corp   NYSE  RTN   General Dynamics Corp   NYSE  GD  and Northrop Grumman are the world s five largest weapons makers  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported in December that these five firms alone accounted for  148 billion of 2018 global military spending of  420 billion  Recent Events in Iran In June  Iran shot down a U S  RQ 4A Global Hawk drone built by Northrop Grumman  The Iranians claimed the drone was flying over the country s air space  U S  officials said the drone was flying over international waters in the Strait of Hormuz  a crucial shipping route in and out of the Persian Gulf div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  Last week  a U S  MQ 9 Reaper drone launched from Iraq killed Iranian Lieutenant General Soleimani near the Baghdad airport  The missile strike was ordered after U S  officials determined that Soleimani was planning an imminent attack on U S  forces In December  a U S  civilian contractor in Iraq was killed in a rocket attack on a U S  base near Kirkuk  The attack was launched from Iraq  U S  officials blamed the attack on a paramilitary group  the Hezbollah Brigades  known to be backed by Iran  Within days  the U S  conducted airstrikes against multiple locations  killing some 25 people and wounding dozens of others  The missile attacks against the Hezbollah Brigades led to the storming of the U S  embassy in Baghdad on December 31  The embassy siege ended on January 1 with no loss of life on either side  The Iraqi parliament passed a nonbinding resolution on January 6 rescinding the country s 2014 approval for the United States to help rid Iraq of Islamic State  IS  terrorists On January 7  Iran responded to the killing of Soleimani  Iranian armed forces launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U S  bases in Iraq  As of early Wednesday morning  no American or British casualties related to the attacks had been reported  Iran has claimed that at least 80 U S  troops were killed Iran s Missile CapabilitiesThe type of ballistic missile used in Wednesday s attack has not been specified yet  According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies  Iran s missile arsenal comprises eight short range and medium range missiles The country s long range ballistic missiles are capable of flights of around 1 200 miles  Iran s lone cruise missile has a range of around 1 500 to 1 900 miles  Iran currently does not have an intercontinental ballistic missile  How Investors Are Interpreting These EventsIn the first four trading days of 2020  Northrop Grumman stock was up 9   Lockheed Martin was up nearly 6 5   and Raytheon was up about 3 1  in the same period  Defense technology firm L3Harris Technologies Inc   NYSE  LHX  traded up 7 5   These gains are based on investors  belief that the United States and Iran will continue flying drones and shooting missiles at each other without causing massive civilian casualties  Not exactly a hot war  but a warm one  Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps issued a statement claiming responsibility for Wednesday s missile launch  The statement appeared to say that if the United States does not retaliate  the shooting could end The U S  Department of Defense budget for 2020 is set and includes  71 5 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations  OCO   According to the Congressional Research Service  since 2001 Congress has authorized  2 trillion for OCO  There is no statutory limit on how OCO may parcel out its funding  Congress and the president are required by law  however  to designate what the funds are to be used for Proponents of OCO spending point to its flexibility in response to events  Critics condemn OCO as a loophole for  replacing combat losses of equipment  resupplying expended munitions  and transporting troops through war zones   Replacing military equipment and weapons used in the Middle East falls clearly under the rubric of the OCO For example  replacements for Northrop Grumman s Global Hawk drones could be paid for out of the  71 5 billion in 2020 OCO funding  That spending would be over and above Northrop products already included in 2020 spending  The same would be true for other suppliers related to the current fighting between Iran and the United States Northrop Grumman s consensus 12 month price target jumped by  5 a share following the Iranian attacks on the two U S  bases in Iraq  That implies a share price gain of around 9  in the year ahead  well below the 2019 gain of around 40   Are analysts just being cautious

106664,328179,NOC,Analysts Estimate Northrop Grumman  NOC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Northrop Grumman  NOC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3  
Revenues are expected to be  8 83 billion  up 8 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 92  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman 
For Northrop Grumman  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northrop Grumman will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of  4 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 49  delivering a surprise of  15 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Northrop Grumman doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-northrop-grumman-noc-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200501105,200501105

106668,328183,NOC,Morgan Stanley  2 Best in Class Defense Stocks to Own  and 1 to Sell ,opinion,Since Trump won the election in 2016  the iShares U S  Aerospace   Defense exchange traded fund  ITA  has risen by over 70   Geopolitical uncertainty  alongside a massive increase in military spending have been good news for defense stocks According to Buckingham Research Group analyst Richard Safran  the rally is set to continue in 2020  The analyst believes the fear of a possible left leaning presidency s negative impact on the sector is exaggerated  He said   Although the 2020 elections remain an overhang on Defense stocks  we think the risks are way overstated and have hampered Defense multiples from expanding despite continued end market growth  Investment bank Morgan Stanley recently reviewed the defense sector stocks under its coverage  and using TipRanks  Stock Comparison tool  we lined up 3 of the tickers alongside each other to get the lowdown  The word on the Street is that the outlook appears rosy for two  while one demands more caution from investors  Let s take a closer look L3Harris Technologies  LHX One of 2019 s success stories  L3Harris is in fact a new company   the result of a merger last June between L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation  The company s share price appreciated by 47  in 2019  and 2020 has started in much the same vein  It is up by 13  year to date The company provides various products and services to the defense industry  including C6ISR systems  wireless equipment  tactical radios  avionics and night vision equipment  amongst others  The merger has significantly bolstered L3Harris s proposition  as it took two midsize defense companies and created a larger beast capable of competing for large Pentagon contracts that  otherwise  would have been out of reach for both Alongside the merger  2019 s market beating performance was instigated by a series of estimate beating reports and strong sales growth  So  now that L3Harris is no longer trading at such a bargain price  does it remain a tantalizing proposition in 2020 It does  according to Morgan Stanley s Matthew Sharpe  Sharpe thinks  LHX remains a peer leader on topline growth  Sharpe noted   Post the LLL HRS merger  we believe LHX sets itself up as a leading Defense Prime with wide ranging capabilities from radios to small satellites  Given above average potential around sales growth  margin expansion  FCF generation  and capital returns  alongside a leadership team that has previously executed  we see no reason why the legacy HRS premium valuation should not be retained  at 5 6  FCF versus 2021 at  7    Bottom line  then  Sharpe keeps his Overweight rating along with the price target of  259  This conveys the analyst s confidence L3Harris can add a further 16 5  to the share price over the coming months   To watch Sharpe s track record  click here The Street is on the bullish side  too  7 Buys and a single Hold coalesce into a Strong Buy consensus rating  The average price target comes in at  247 86 and indicates possible gains of 11    See L3Harris stock analysis on TipRanks Northrop  NOC With annual revenue of more than  30 billion  global aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman is one of the world s largest weapons manufacturers  Like L3Harris  Northrop outperformed the market last year  adding 43  to its share price along the way  It has kept up the pace in 2020  too  the heightened tension between the US and Iran  and the fear of a looming war have been good news for the company  In fact  Northrop just this month notched an all time high  closing January 16th s session trading at  383 78 As befits a multinational the size of Northrop  the company is involved in large scale development programs  Northrop is currently developing the B 21 Raider  a long range strategic bomber which will replace its own B 2 Spirit  the world s only known stealth bomber  The company is also involved in NASA s Space Launch System program  for which it is producing the solid rocket boosters Additionally  in December  following Boeing s removal of its bid for the coveted GBSD  Ground Based Strategic Deterrent  contract  Nothrop remains the sole bidder for the development of the intercontinental ballistic missile system  worth a purported  63 billion Following 2019 s consistent execution  in which the company beat earnings estimates in all 4 calendar reports  Sharpe expects the upcoming report to show  improved revenue growth relative to prior quarters   The analyst predicts expansion of 9  year over year to  8 9 billion Sharpe added   We believe NOC is well positioned given its longer duration capability and high end technology focus  that is well aligned to the NDS  including the Prime position on B 21   50B    pursuit of GBSD    85B   and acquisition of Orbital ATK    9B  for space  As such  in ecting revenue and margin potential  along with portfolio shaping opportunities  via Technology Services   and an easing investment cycle support an attractive FCF yield come 2021 at  7   Sharpe  then  reiterates an Overweight rating on the weapons manufacturer  alongside a  449 price target  The figure implies further upside potential of 18 5  Looking at the consensus breakdown  it appears the bulls have it  With 4 Buys and a single Hold  the word on the Street is that NOC is a Strong Buy  At  425 80  the average price target presents possible upside in the shape of 11 33    See Northrop stock analysis on TipRanks Perspecta Inc  PRSP Like the two previous companies on our list  Perspecta s 2019 involved upward movement  A very healthy addition of 55  over the year has been followed with a further 7  year to date  What sets the government IT firm apart  according to Sharpe  is the outlook for the year ahead Sharpe expects quarterly results to exhibit a  sequential deceleration in topline growth to  2    The reason is mainly down to Perspecta s loss of the NASA NEST program  last year the company lost out to Leidos for Nasa s  2 9 billion enterprise IT contract  All eyes are now focused on whether Perspecta can hold onto its lucrative NGEN contract with the U S  Navy Department  The contract will expire in September with formidable competitors General Dynamics and Leidos hoping to replace Perspecta  Losing the contract could cost the company 10 15  of revenues  driving FY21 growth rates negative and potentially pressuring margins due to cost absorption Sharpe said   Our view for the company over the near  to mid term highlights a number of challenges that contrast with the broader environment  where we see more attractive opportunities with lower risk  Firstly  PRSP has a signi cant amount of concentration at a contract level  introducing elevated recompete risk to the pro le that drives a particularly wide range of potential outcomes  In addition  the company has an elevated leverage pro le that limits shareholder returns over the coming years as it focuses on paying down debt  Lastly  with respect to EBITDA  the company is earning mid teen margins  in contrast to competitors at closer to HSD levels  indicating the company could be over earning  Sharpe  then  kept an Underweight rating on PRSP  along with his price target of  23  The implication  Possible downside of 19  over the next 12 months The Street s take is slightly more positive  Perspecta s Hold rating breaks down into a Buy  a Hold and a Sell  each  With the average price target coming in at  27 33  the analysts foresee downside of nearly 6  in the year ahead   See Perspecta s price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks ,2020-01-29,TipRanks,https://invst.ly/pol0-,200502861

focus on performance  innovation and agility  It s the dedication of our employees to these priorities that enables us to meet the commitments we make to our shareholders and our customers Turning to our results  We met our guidance for segment OM and exceeded our adjusted EPS and cash guidance  Our new business capture drove a 21  backlog increase in 2019  providing a strong foundation for future growth  2019 sales grew 12  to  33 8 billion  benefiting from a full year of Innovation Systems as well as continued growth at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems  Full year sales reflect double digit growth on the F 35 program and growth in restricted activities at all four sectors  Restricted work accounted for more than a quarter of 2019 sales  a double digit increase over 2018  Our segment margin rate for the year increased to 11 6   Strong program performance and cost synergies more than offset margin pressure from early phase development work  Adjusted earnings per share also exceeded guidance at  21 21 for the year Turning to cash  I want to congratulate the team on a very strong year  Fourth quarter cash from operations totaled  2 5 billion and free cash flow was approximately  2 billion  For the full year  cash from operations increased to  4 3 billion and free cash flow was more than  3 billion exceeding the top of our guidance range  Strong cash  and that will enable effective capital deployment  We invested  1 3 billion in our businesses through capital expenditures  strengthened our balance sheet by retiring  500 million of debt and returned  1 6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases We increased our quarterly dividend by 10  last May and reduced our weighted average share count by approximately 3   Business capture was a key highlight of 2019 performance  Net awards totaled more than  45 billion or 1 3 times sales and we delivered double digit backlog growth at all four sectors  At the macro level  defense spending continues to be a national priority  The fiscal year 2020 investment counts are up 3  to  251 billion  This increase shows the emphasis being placed on modernization as called for in the national defense strategy The development of capabilities to counter peer adversaries continues to be a priority  Our customers are increasingly focused on rapidly evolving multi domain peer threats in areas like space  hypersonics and missile defense  Our growing share of restricted work demonstrates that our customers are turning to Northrop Grumman for these capabilities  In 2019  restricted awards totaled nearly  11 billion with approximately  7 million for restricted space In addition to restricted awards  we received several multi billion dollar awards for large legacy franchise programs like F 35 and E 2D  We also received awards to transition development programs like Triton  GATOR  IBCS and Kirkham toward full rate production  We re also pursuing and winning the early phase development work that is the seed corn for the next generation of franchise programs  A good example is AARGM ER  a high speed long range missile  which we expect to be our global customers air to ground weapon of choice to defeat modern air defense systems We also won large competitive award to supply new targets and countermeasures to test the Ballistic Missile Defense System  And we expect a solid year for award in 2020  On January 1st of this year  we began operating in a new sector structure to further align our unique capabilities in space  missile  counter hypersonics  cyber and stealth  It s the next logical step after the acquisition of Orbital ATK to enable capture of revenue synergy and drive profitable growth In the new structure  we re bringing together and integrating the relevant capabilities to solve many of the nation s toughest problems  We also introduced our new Defining Possible brand to reinforce the value we re providing through performance  agility and innovation  Discovery and innovation are at the heart of what we do  We show our customers what is possible and then deliver through performance framework and culture  that balance agility and affordability with quality and safety We are investing in innovative concepts and technologies that align with the priorities of our customers  I m pleased with the progress we are making and I ll share four example of demonstrations we completed in the fourth quarter  each of which offers innovation to support our customers  vision for future operations First  as we work closely with the department on the joint all domain command and control effort  we are leveraging our experience with the Army s IBCS  We recently conducted a successful test using air and ground based sensors against multiple fast moving airborne targets  We are using agile development methods to integrate sensors and the sectors  to rapidly and more precisely address new complex threats Second  we participated in the first advanced battle management system demonstration  using feeds from multiple domains to find  track and destroy cruise missiles  Here  we integrated the communication suite necessary to connect the F 22 and the F 35 platform  enabling this integrated battle management solution The third example is our development and integration of a world record 150 kilowatt class high energy laser weapon system on board the USS Portland  The laser system is undergoing final verification testing before deploying later this year  At which time the Navy will gain at the  Phonetic  experience with directed energy systems and support the future fleet operations And lastly  we successfully flight tested a rapid prototype  conventionally configured hypersonic ground launch ballistic missile in response to an urgent capability request from DoD  The launch vehicle met a highly aggressive eight month design integration and launch schedule achieving flawless flight results  These accomplishments are the result of our investments to address our customers  emerging requirements with the agility they require These investments  our solid 2019 financial results and successful business capture provide a strong foundation for continued growth and sustained performance  Our 2020 guidance calls for sales to grow to between  35 3 billion and  35 8 billion with a segment operating margin rate of 11 3  to 11 5   We expect 2020 adjusted EPS will range between  22 75 and  23 15  After capital spending of approximately  1 35 billion  we expect free cash flow of  3 15 billion to  3 45 billion 2020 guidance contemplates that we are selected for the next phase of the GBSD program  in accordance with the Air Force s current acquisition timeline  which calls for an award in August  We submitted our proposal in December and we are in active discussions with the Air Force as they work through the source selection process  We are continuing to perform well  on the technology maturation and risk reduction phase of the contract  And together with our nationwide team  we are investing in technologies and facilities necessary to be ready for day one of EMD  We anticipate that EMD phase of this multi billion dollar decades long recapitalization of the nation s ICBM defense capability would be accretive to 2020 sales and slightly dilutive to OM rate  as well as free cash flow due to higher capital expenditures Ken will review the detailed guidance for the sectors  But I wanted to provide some context around 2020 sector performance  First  sector guidance under the new structure is consistent with the trends  we ve been talking about in our businesses  We expect Space Systems will be our fastest growing sector  beyond 2020  in addition to GBSD  we have large opportunities in space rearchitecture  hypersonics  intermediate range ballistic missiles and national space launch In civil space  we re well aligned for NASA s Artemis program  For aeronautics systems  we have resonant technology and integration expertise in critical domains like stealth and autonomy to support growth over the long term  On an apples to apples basis  the businesses comprising aeronautics grew backlog 24  in 2019  which provides a solid foundation for sustained growth For Mission Systems  competitive opportunities in airborne and ground based radar systems create opportunity for enhanced growth  In addition  Mission Systems  advanced capabilities and domain expertise are key competitive differentiators that we leverage across the entire company as we pursue new business  Mission Systems will continue to have attractive top line growth coupled with strong margin rates And for Defense Systems  over the long term  key growth drivers include high speed weaponry programs like AARGM ER and our C2 in cross domain C2 programs  We expect stable to growing revenue from legacy technology services businesses as their focus on the defense and intelligence markets continue to generate results So in summary  we had strong performance in 2019  And we expect continued top line growth and sustained performance in 2020 and beyond  We also expect continued strong cash generation that will support our capital deployment strategy and create value for our shareholders and customers I ll turn the call over to Ken now for a more detailed discussion of our financial results  guidance and trends  Ken Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Kathy and good morning  everyone  I also want to congratulate the team on strong performance this year  I ll spend a few minutes on 2019 results and discuss our 2020 guidance in more detail  We will be providing guidance in our new sector structure with some broad year over year trend information  Our first quarter earnings release in April will include a schedule that we cast prior period results for comparison  Referring to sides five and six in our PowerPoint deck  I ll turn to sector results Aerospace Systems sales rose 10  for the quarter and 6  for the year  largely due to higher levels of restricted activity  In addition  sales were higher in both periods for all three business areas  restricted activities  F 35 production increases and higher E 2D volume are the growth drivers of manned aircraft  Next Gen OPIR activities were a growth driver at space  autonomous systems reflect higher volume across several programs including Global Hawk and Triton  AS operating income increased by 9  in the quarter and 2  for the full year  Fourth quarter operating margin rate was comparable to last year  2019 operating margin rate of 10 3  reflects lower net favorable EAC adjustments related to several programs nearing completion Turning to Innovation Systems  Fourth quarter sales rose 9  and full year sales increased 10  on a proforma basis  Sales were higher at all three business areas for both periods  In space  this was driven by higher volume for National Security Satellite Systems  At Flight Systems  fourth quarter growth reflects higher volume  on propulsion systems and full year results reflect increased volume on aero structures and launch vehicles Higher volume on tactical missiles and subsystems including GMLRS and our new AARGM ER program drove higher defense sales in both periods  Fourth quarter operating income increased 20  due to improved performance at Flight Systems and Space Systems  For the full year  operating income totaled  671 million or 11  margin rate  which exceeded our guidance Turning to Mission Systems  Fourth quarter and full year sales rose 6  and 5  respectively  Like AS and IS  all three business areas with the Mission Systems had higher sales in both periods  At advanced capabilities  higher volume for restricted activities and Marine Systems drove growth in both periods  And the fourth quarter also benefited from higher volume on Poland IBCS as that program ramps up  Growth at Cyber and ISR was driven by higher volume for space and restricted programs  And at sensors and processing  fourth quarter growth reflects higher volume for airborne radar programs  For the full year  sensors and processing sales growth is being driven by higher volume for airborne radars and new restricted programs Mission Systems  fourth quarter operating income rose 13  and operating margin rate increased 90 basis points to 14   For the full year  operating income rose 8  and operating margin rate increased 40 basis points to 13 4   exceeding our guidance  Mission Systems  margin rate reflects improved performance on advanced capabilities and sensors and processing programs as well as a  20 million gain on sale of property  Technology Services  fourth quarter and full year 2019 sales were 4  lower as expected  Fourth quarter 2018  Phonetic  sales included an approximately  30 million favorable EAC adjustment for completion of an IT outsourcing contract The 2019 year over year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by this adjustment and completion of the JRDC and KC 10 programs  partially offset by growth in other programs  Technology Services  fourth quarter operating income declined 8  and operating margin rate was 10 4   Again  the quarter over quarter comparison reflects the favorable Q4 2018 impact of items related to the close out of the state IT outsourcing contract  For 2019  operating income increased 3  and operating margin rate increased 80 basis points to 11 1   exceeding our high 10  guidance At the total Company level  2019 segment operating income increased 13  to  3 9 billion and segment operating margin rate was 11 6  versus our mid 11  guidance  Total operating income was approximately  4 billion with an operating margin rate of 11 7   This was largely due to unallocated corporate expense  which came in lower than we expected due to  89 million benefit for resolution of a cost claim accounting matter which was not contemplated in our guidance A couple of comments on our mark to market adjustments  Our discount rate declined 92 basis points to 3 39   which drove a  4 billion increase in our pension liability  We also changed our assumptions to reflect updated Society of Actuaries mortality data as well as an updated evaluation of our planned population  This increased our pension liability by  800 million  These increases were partially offset by planned asset returns that exceeded assumptions  increasing assets by approximately  3 billion  So that s how we get to the  1 8 billion pre tax expense  Our CAS prepayment credit is approximately  1 6 billion as of January 1st of this year Turning to cash  as is our typical pattern  we had a strong fourth quarter  For the year cash from operations was approximately  4 3 billion and after capital expenditures of about  1 25 billion  our free cash flow grew 18  to more than  3 billion  exceeding our guidance Now  looking ahead 2020  I ll mention that our new sector and reporting structure is laid out on slide 11 of the PowerPoint deck  I ll refer you to a discussion of sector guidance on slide 12  At Aeronautics Systems  we expect solid mid single digit sales growth to the mid to high  11 billion range with a low to mid 10  margin rate  stable versus 2019  About half of the 2020 sales growth is expected from a restricted program and manned aircraft  and we also expect mid single digit growth on the F 35 program For Defense Systems  we expect sales to be comparable to 2019 in the mid  7 billion range as Lake City transition offsets growth in other areas of the business  We expect an operating margin rate in the mid 10  range  up slightly from 2019  At the new Mission Systems sector  we expect solid mid single digit sales growth to the high  9 billion range with a low 14  margin rate  Sales growth is supported by F 35 activities and production ramps in GATOR  Kirkham  SABR as well as restricted development work  The 2020 margin rate expectation at MS is down slightly due to the  20 million gain on property sale in 2019 and the changing mix that reflects a growing percentage of development work At Space Systems  we expect low double digit sales growth to the low  8 billion range  with a low to mid 10  margin rate  This represents continued strong margin rate performance  I would note that Space System sales and margin rate guidance contemplate more early phase development work  including GBSD  which is expected to be accretive to sales but slightly dilutive to the margin rate of the existing portfolio Our sector guidance rose up to 2020 sales of  35 3 billion to  35 8 billion and I would note that under the new structure  we expect inter segment eliminations to decline to about  1 8 billion  I would point out that first quarter 2020 sales are expected to be a bit less than 25  of full year sales as Mission Systems and Space Systems revenue is weighted toward the second half of the year We expect segment operating margin rate of 11 3  to 11 5   We expect 2020 total operating margin rate will range between 10 8  and 11  reflecting  390 million for the operating portion of the net FAS CAS pension benefit and unallocated corporate expense of approximately  565 million  which includes  315 million non cash intangible asset amortization and PP E step up depreciation and  250 million of other estimated unallocated items Moving to pension  Slide 13 provides our 2020 pension assumptions  These assumptions exclude any 2020 mark to market impact  Slide 14 summarizes our pension estimates for years  20 through 2022  And slide 15 summarizes sensitivities to changes to our 2020 assumptions  Our guidance assumes  500 million of interest expense  De minimis interest income had an effective tax rate of approximately 16 5  I ll remind you that our 2019 reported effective tax rate reflected the mark to market expense  So please don t use that as a baseline as you think about our 2020 effective tax rate  Based on all that  we expect adjusted earnings per share will increase to a range of  22 75 to  23 15 or about 8  growth at the midpoint EPS growth reflects higher sales and higher segment operating margin    operating income as well as pension benefit  partially offset by higher corporate unallocated expense and a higher tax rate  I d also note EPS guidance is based on  168 million weighted average shares outstanding  a reduction from 2019 of about 1   For 2020  after capital expenditures of approximately  1 35 billion  we expect free cash flow will range between  3 15 billion and  3 45 billion or about 9  growth at the midpoint Capex includes the required early capital investment for GBSD  And we expect that cash flows will continue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year  I ll also mention that our cash continues to be driven significantly by operations with net pension defined as CAS less funding expected to be about 11  at the midpoint of implied 2020 cash from operations  Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in our businesses  strengthening the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a competitive dividend  In addition  we do have  1 billion of debt maturing this fall  which we are currently planning to retire In summary  we expect to continue strong value creation through a combination of growth  performance and robust cash generation  as well as thoughtful capital allocation I think we re ready for Q A  Todd Todd Ernst    Treasurer and Vice President of Investor RelationsRegina  please open the line for Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J P  Morgan Seth Seifman    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  Thanks very much  Good morning  So I just wanted to ask maybe one question  Ken about working capital  look like very strong performance in the quarter and whether you expect working capital to grow in 2020  It looks like it was maybe even down a hair in 2019 and whether you think you can keep it flat or not  And then secondly  you mentioned the  1 6 billion CAS credit and it looks like over the next three years  that pretty much gets eaten up and so should we assume in the out years  beyond your forecast that CAS and contributions are roughly in line Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Thanks  Seth  I ll start with the working capital question and then head to pension  I would say from a working capital perspective  we did have better than expected performance in 2019  We ve been really focused on working capital and trying to maximize the benefit there  And we did see that that performance exceeded our expectations in 2019  so we re pleased about that As we look at our ability to generate cash in 2020  we re certainly looking at kind of the growth of the Company  the strong margin profile  delivering the ability to convert that margin in the cash as the primary driver of the cash flow growth  but certainly managing working capital as efficiently as possible will be a part of that as well So I think that  from a working capital perspective  it s something where    it s not going to be a headwind  We don t necessarily expect the continued tailwind that we had in 2019  But as we look at 2020  I think that strong growth and converting our margins into cash is probably the biggest driver of cash  and again  strong performance by the team in 2019 and we look forward to maximizing again in 2020 From a pension perspective  you re correct Seth  the current assumptions on pension would result in the prepayment credit getting burned down in 2022 and that would therefore  result in CAS and funding being pretty similar as we look beyond 2022  And I would just comment that  as we look at the pension assumptions we ve laid out for  20   21 and  22  we ve got a scenario where generally the cash    net pension cash  CAS less funding is in a relatively in a box I would say  There s not a lot of    lot worse it can get  You ll notice that in 2022  CAS is about  150 million   160 million greater than funding  And I would say that as we look at our performance  it is kind of in a box And on the opportunity side  if we can outperform or other assumptions change  then we have the ability to drive down that  22 funding that is required under the current assumptions OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  guys  Good morning   Technical Issues Todd Ernst    Treasurer and Vice President of Investor RelationsOperator  can you clear the line with Ron  It s been static OperatorThe line has been cleared  Your next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystThank you very much  Kathy  you mentioned restricted    the restricted portfolio is about a quarter of the business and it grew double digits in 2019  so you re clearly taking share  How long do you think that s sustainable and what are parts of the business that are may be underperforming your expectations and do they expect to pick up Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThanks  Sheila  I did mention restricted being a key growth area  both in our sales in 2019  as well as the awards that we received of  11 billion of awards and  7 billion of that coming in restricted space  So we clearly still see Space been a growth driver for us into the future  And we also had noted in our third quarter call  that we had received  1 3 billion in awards in hypersonics  We continue to see that as a growth area for the business as well  And I mentioned in my comments today  a demonstration that we conducted in the fourth quarter in hypersonic missiles as well So those are a couple of the areas that I would note as key growth drivers going forward in our restricted portfolio  As I look across the business  we clearly have headwinds as we exit the Lake City contract this year  We have noted  that s about  300 million of headwind in 2020  We basically now have exited the small caliber ammo business  and so that s a headwind that will largely be behind us as we get past 2020  And so as we look at Aeronautics  Mission Systems and Space  we see strong growth expected in each of those sectors  Aeronautics and Mission in the mid to high single digit bases  the low double digits  it s Defense Systems where we have those Lake City headwinds  that we see more of a stable growth profile  but really not looking at any part of the portfolio is underperforming with those headwinds being the exception in small caliber ammo Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystYes  Good morning Kathy  Ken  And Kathy  just kind of going back to the legacy Innovation Systems segment  I know it s now obviously Space  but we ve been tracking the kind of the synergy number that you had laid out previously and then also the revenue synergy  I think was something that originally it wasn t a number that got quoted  but maybe just talk about some of the opportunities you re seeing there and how that s progressing  Thanks Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWe ll do  Thanks  Peter  So in cost synergy  I noted in my comments that we exceeded our cost synergy target in 2019 and that helped us to generate higher than expected segment operating margin rate  So that area of our commitment is certainly one where we feel we did what we said we were going to do and even have some opportunity to over perform in driving cost out of the business  And that not only generates near term margin  but it also helps us to position the business more competitively to win in the future  which gets to the part of your question around revenue synergy We have been realizing revenue synergy ahead of the estimates we had in the by plan for the Orbital ATK business  And we see that continuing as we look out into the future  I had noted previously that space and missiles are the two areas where we are seeing the greatest synergy and I gave a few examples in each including AARGM ER which I talked about again today  and the opportunity that we see there not just domestically  but also internationally  We still see those two areas  Space and Missiles being the ones that will be the key drivers of revenue synergy over the plan OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystThanks so much  Good morning Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Rob Robert Stallard    Vertical Research    AnalystKen  a quick question for you on capital deployment  You commented that you intend to pay off  I think it s a  1 billion of debt later this year  I was wondering if you could walk us through the thinking on that because obviously with interest rates being very low  you ve already got a strong balance sheet  wouldn t that make sense to keep the debt  refinance the debt  and perhaps return more cash to shareholders Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Let me walk through that  And as we look at 2020 in our capital deployment plans we continue to think about it in the same way we have historically and that is invest in the business which we re doing in 2020  including what we expect to invest in GBSD as Kathy talked about  certainly  paying a competitive dividend and then also managing the balance sheet and share repurchase  And we ve got an amount of repurchase that we re planning for 2020 And with that behind us  we ve got the cash to pay off the debt  As we look forward  there is more debt that s coming due and we ll certainly evaluate whether or not we continue to delever through paying off debt  where we just delever through growing our EBITDA  And I wouldn t necessarily assume that because we re paying off the 2020 debt  that means that we re going to continue to pay off more debt  We ve got optionality and obviously  we ll continue to evaluate what the best use of the cash is  as we look at all those options of capital deployment  But  we re in a good position with our strong cash flow  being able to deploy all of those avenues of capital deployment OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystThanks  good morning Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  David Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentGood morning David Strauss    Barclays    AnalystWanted to ask about capex  it sounds like GBSD is adding a bit to that this year  maybe 50 basis points as a percent of sales  I think you previously talked about capex stepping down in  21 to like 2 5  of sales  How does GBSD kind of an impact that  Ken  Thanks Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Let me start on that one  From a capex perspective  we were at 3 7     around 3 7  of revenue in 2019  We had talked about the profile that we were expecting as we were looking forward into  20 and  21  For 2020  we have updated our outlook to include GBSD that s for capex as well as revenue certainly at the high end of the guide  And that was not included in the numbers that we talked about last fall  So the GBSD now included  we re looking at capex of about  1 35 billion for 2020 and probably  1 35 billion for 2021  And then kind of continuing to decrease as a percentage of sales beyond that  And then maybe would also just note that as we look at 2020  we do have the capex and for GBSD and only maybe  250 million or so of sales given the award expected to come in August OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentGood morning Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystKathy  just wanted    I thought I d ask you about open architecture  which I think you ve discussed in the past  but was wondering if you might walk through how you re positioning Northrop to benefit from DoD s increased emphasis on that design paradigm  And do you think you can leverage that to drive market share gains at Mission Systems over the long term Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThanks for the question  I m glad that you picked up on that  Rob  because we have been talking about it for a while  Particularly as we discussed what we have done on IBCS as the program  but I ve also talked about that being more of an architecture and we re now beginning to demonstrate that to the Department of Defense as we participated in demos in the fourth quarter at least two of them The one  I noted around IBCS for joint all domain command and control  as well as the one that we did to connect F 22 and F 35 in Communications to enable the battle command systems  So as we think about what the future holds  the ability to have an architecture that rapidly integrate both sensors and the sectors and allows the departments to tie these systems that has been built in more of a stovepipe fashion to communicate and to share information will be critical to their vision for future operations  And we are able to rapidly do this  because we have been working for    in these open architectures for a number of years  and we have ready to go solutions that enable this demonstration of capability OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi Jonathan Raviv    Citigroup    AnalystHey  good morning  everyone  Just thinking about the GBSD being a mean    the major change I think from the 3Q outlook in the fall  I think you talked about mid single digit sales and flat margin  GBSD is less than 1  of sales  but segment margin is now down in 2020  Can you just sort of put all those pieces together for us and sort of add a little more color as to what s going on with 2020 versus what you said in the fall and then really what s the opportunity to accelerate on simply GBSD  going forward  Thank you Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Jon  let me start on that one  I would say that  as we look at 2020 based on the guide that we ve laid out  you call it 4 5  to 6  or so growth given the range  And again  that does include GBSD proceeding as expected in the August timeframe  From a margin perspective  I would say that  as we think about it in the new sector structure again  Aeronautics would be relatively comparable to 2019  Space Systems will be down a little bit  some of that is GBSD and some of that is just other mix changes as it continues to win new business and take on additional development work  and as we talked about a low double digit growth rate there at Space Systems At MS  we did have the property gain in 2019  So we see that is having a little bit of an impact on margins at MS  We mentioned that would result in a little bit of a margin reduction into 2020 on a comparative basis  And then at the new Defense Systems  we are projecting that margin will be slightly up  and as that business performs well  So  look  we always incentivize the team to perform and to outperform our peers and we look forward to a 2020  where the team will hopefully continue to step up to the challenge as we re seeing them do  and drive the best margin outcome that we can get to Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentAnd Jon  I believe the second part of your question was around the possibility of acceleration of award on GBSD  So let me just comment briefly on that  As you know  the Air Force has made it clear that GBSD needs to be in fielding in 2029 and at the time to do so is short and it s essential that we get started on the critical requirement  So  we ve been investing in the people and facilities that we need  to ensure that our team is ready to start upon awards and that we could support efforts for an accelerated award schedule  if they are able to do so OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen Cai von Rumohr    Cowen and Company    AnalystTerrific  thank you very much  So could you update us on your strategy in hypersonics  I think at one point you talked about focusing predominantly on propulsion  Are you also going for major push in the systems integration role  And then  maybe update us on the outlook for counter hypersonics  Thanks Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYes  So in hypersonics  we do have a dual path strategy  The first being to support all of the primes in propulsion and we ve talked openly about the relationship that we have with both Lockheed and Raytheon in that regard  We also are a system integrator and the demonstration that I mentioned in my comments earlier in the call was an example of where  we were the integrator for that demonstrator  So we do see ourselves following both paths  We want to be a good provider to the primes in propulsion and that means making investments that support multiple technology paths  but at the same time we do have the capability ourselves to prime efforts and be an integrator for certain types of systems I also will talk briefly about counter hypersonics  and there we see really our expertise in Space and the capabilities that we haven t faced being a key enabler to the future hypersonic    counter hypersonic mission set  And we have looked at the Space business that we are assembling and view ourselves as both the capable prime and payload provider in that space  So again  a similar strategy that we can be both a merchant supplier to other primes with payloads of importance in that space  but also the ability to integrate systems and provide end to end capability ourselves OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Doug Harned    Bernstein    AnalystThank you  Good morning Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Doug Doug Harned    Bernstein    AnalystIf I go back a few years and look at Autonomous Systems  my understanding was that  a big advantage that Northrop Grumman had was on its common operating systems  that they could be applied to multiple programs  play in many different classes of UAVs  But today  it appears that the dominant autonomous programs are still really built off of HALE Systems  Global Hawk variance  Triton So  is there a broader platform for growth in Autonomous Systems that we are yet to see  because either they are in early stage development or they are restricted or is    or should we think of this is still likely to grow off of these large HALE Systems in the future Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo  Doug  we certainly do see growth opportunity in HALE Systems  I would also point to examples of where we re working in the medium altitude space programs like Fire Scout  And then  we have also areas of new technology developments that will allow us to scale these systems  down even further But  I would suggest that the high altitude that you hear us speak about in the context of surveillance is the best coverage that can be provided  And so it s quite economical for these high altitude systems at least in the surveillance mission to fly in high range  So  it all depends on the mission requirements and that s what drives the system design  but we do have systems architectures that allow us to scale as the mission requires OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  Hope that this connection is a little better Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat is better  Ron Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYeah  great  cool  thanks  So Kathy  just a big picture question for you  you ve been in the roll now for a little over a year  and when you think about where that Northrop Grumman is now  is it where you want it to be  And if it s not  what are some of the challenges you see for you over the next couple of years Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWell  thanks for the question  Ron  I appreciate the opportunity to talk about both my macro assessment and outlook  I am pleased with where we are  One of my priorities when I stepped into the role was to orient the team toward several high growth campaigns and align our investments there  We of course  more recently have aligned the organization to execute that strategy And as I look to the evidence of success  I d point to the backlog growth that we saw in 2019  I would also say that  being ahead on our revenue synergy projection came from a lot of hard work from the team on a successful Orbital ATK integration  but also very rapidly integrating them into our strategy for the mission campaigns and the growth that we see there I also focus the team on performance and agility  and there  we continue to perform well on our programs  even as we take on a number of new development efforts and scale production  which are difficult challenges  but they come with the opportunity of long term sustained growth as well as strong operating margins  And I m pleased with what the team is doing there  because it s laying the foundation not only for our near term future  but our long term future We realize the cost synergy from a successful Orbital ATK integration and again  while that s generating some short term margin enhancement  really  the opportunity there is that we re more competitive over the long term with better rates  And just overall  I feel that we ve  over the last year enhanced our competitiveness The demonstrations that I talked about were very rapidly put together as a result of making smart technology investments  understanding the missions that would be needed by our customers under the national defense strategy and rapidly aligning our portfolio to bring forward technologies that meet those needs  So overall  I feel good about where we are and I think we re deploying our capital in a way that not only invest in the business that returns a lot of the cash we re generating to shareholders and positions us well for future optionality OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystThanks  Good morning  I had two questions related to margins  The first one is on R D  it looks like it was up a couple of  100 million or 25   Just curious what that looks like for 2020 and which business absorb that  And then on EAC  it looks particularly low  but the margins actually were pretty in line  despite that low EAC contribution  So I m curious  did you change the booking rates underlying on a systematic basis similar to kind of what you did in 2015 to reduce some of the volatility  Thanks Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMyles  let me take those questions at least to start  From an R D perspective  the biggest impact of the additional R D was the full year of NGIS  You remember  we closed that acquisition in June of 2018  So  we only had a little more than six months of their R D and certainly IS is a strong investor in technology and R D to drive that future growth So that s the biggest impact  I would say that  this is a company that s always invested in R D  and certainly as we look at our growth here and our ability to grow over the long term  I think the fact that we continue to invest in R D through the downturn as one of the    one of the strengths that drives us today and we will continue to do that  So I m not going to put a number on it for 2020  but continued strong investment in the technology that will drive the growth that Kathy has been talking about  is certainly where we re thinking about it From your question on the EAC perspectives  I would just say that look  a lot of the EAC adjustments are about timing  And as we think about 2019 and strong margin performance  some of that did come out of some of the more mature programs where we have a bit of a stronger baseline margin rate rather than seeing it come through adjusted or EAC adjustments and that s really how we think about the business  is what the programs can deliver and how the programs can perform rather than any EAC adjustment  So as we look at 2020 and the programs in the sectors  we see continued strong performance and that s how we generate that segment margin rate that we talked about in our guidance Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentAnd Myles  this is Kathy  As we look at net EAC adjustments in recent years  we had a high water mark in 2018 with over  0 5 billion of net favorable adjustments this year   480 million  still very strong and so looking at our program performance and just one indicator of that is our net EAC adjustments and feel that we ve been doing quite well over the last couple of years OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everybody Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    AnalystGood morning  Kathy  could you talk about E 2 for a minute  Just give us an update on where you are in terms of total program size and margins  And then can you talk about growth in the program as you portion it out between domestic and international opportunities through both new potential customers and upgrades  Thank you Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentAbsolutely  So as we look at the program  both domestically and internationally  we see growth  we are delivering more E 2Ds to the Navy  We also have the Japan orders that we booked in 2019  which will be deliveries over the next several years  I ll ask Ken to give you some more of the specifics on the financials  both revenue and margin rate expectations Ken Bedingfield    Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHunter  I would just say that as we look at our awards and backlog in 2019 E 2D contributed over  5 billion of awards as we look at both the Navy as well as Japan orders  And it s a solid contributor to revenue as well around  1 5 billion in sales and strong margins  So  really a solid program for us and one that we see as contributing nicely to our growth at Aeronautics in 2020 as well OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  good morning  everyone Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentGood morning Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs    AnalystSo  you know  a lot of things below the top line matter  profits and returns on capital matter  obviously  but when we speak to investors  there is still just a lot of focus on the top line because of there seems to be a differentiation in the programs we ve won and what you ve put in the backlog  And so we kind of hear    hear two camps  one is  yes  they have the programs  but it s very diversified and there s always moving pieces  So they re just going to grow top line 5  forever And the second camp is  no  you have to be patient  and all of the large new wins start to ramp 2021 and beyond and the growth rate is going to accelerate significantly  And so can you speak to which of those it is  And those 5     or 5  for 2020  does that meet the criteria of outpacing your end market or does that definition that you ve provided in the past mean something much faster Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo  let me take a crack at that in two ways  First  as we think about outpacing the end market  The investment accounts in the 2020 budgets are up 3  and we re projecting a 5  growth  So if you looked in the near term  you could suggest that that is out growing  But as you and I both know  it takes a while for backlog in these long cycle businesses to manifest in sales and so that goes to the promise that it does take a while  these awards that we ve booked in 2019  will come into sales over a multi year period  and therefore  is derisking growth in those out years and creating the opportunity for acceleration of growth The    to answer your question a little more explicitly in our portfolio  we have opportunities like GBSD which will    if awarded to us creates a sizable ramp over the next several years  So just have the opportunity to create an outsized growth for our portfolio  We also have talked about Space and we see Space is one of the fastest growing elements of the budget  but those awards are not yet manifesting themselves in sales and we have other awards that we anticipate this year depending on how successful we are  that also creates opportunity for outpaced growth So  I think the scenario that you paint is one  where there absolutely is opportunity for us to continue over the long term to outgrow the budget growth  but that requires us to continue to win business  execute it successfully just like any other organization and you will make the assumptions as to the confidence that you have that we do not Todd Ernst    Treasurer and Vice President of Investor RelationsOperator  we have time for one more question OperatorOur final question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystJust made it then  Thanks  everybody Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentHi  Carter Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystHi  Kathy  Question on the bookings  I m not sure I heard it correctly  but it sounded like you said  7 billion of the  11 billion were restricted space and if    that s in the legacy restricted space organization that would be a very large  very large book to bill  So I wondered if that was broad based or if there was anything chunky in there that we should consider as transformational in terms of how you think about the growth rate  Just  any color you can provide there would be appreciated Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYes  I did say that of the  11 billion in restricted award  7 billion was in sales  and that spanned the three sectors in the 2019 structure  that operated in Space  so Aerospace Systems  Mission Systems and Innovation Systems  all contributed to that  7 billion of awards that I mentioned  As we look forward in the new operating structure  all of those businesses will be together in Space Systems Todd Ernst    Treasurer and Vice President of Investor RelationsI d like to turn the call over to Kathy for closing remarks Kathy Warden    Chairman  Chief Executive Officer and PresidentVery good  Well  thank you  everyone for joining us on today s call  I want to conclude by just reiterating my thanks to the team  for an outstanding 2019  We re positioned well as we start the year in 2020  with the backlog growth that we ve experienced  the strong performance and our commitment to continued thoughtful capital deployment that allows us to grow this business for the long term for our shareholders  So thank you  all for being with us today  We look forward to talking to you after our first quarter Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  59 minutesCall participants

106675,328190,NOC,Northrop Grumman  NOC  Beats Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Northrop Grumman  NOC  came out with quarterly earnings of  5 61 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 78 per share  This compares to earnings of  4 93 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17 36   A quarter ago  it was expected that this defense contractor would post earnings of  4 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 49  delivering a surprise of 15 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Northrop Grumman  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  8 72 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 21   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 16 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Northrop Grumman shares have added about 11 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Northrop Grumman 
While Northrop Grumman has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Northrop Grumman was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  5 48 on  8 52 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  22 99 on  35 77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Aerospace   Defense is currently in the bottom 30  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northrop-grumman-noc-beats-q4-earnings-estimates-200503083,200503083
113056,334571,NOC,Northrop Grumman Gives Investors Little to Get Excited About in 2020,news,"Northrop Grumman s  NYSE NOC  arsenal of space  electronics  and aviation assets has made it one of the highest fliers among defense stocksin recent years  and at first glance the company s latest quarterly results give no reason to believe the momentum is slowing 
But a deep dive into the numbers  coupled with tepid guidance for 2020  tell a different story  Here s why shares of Northrop Grumman  despite the strength of the company s portfolio  seem a poor bet to continue to outperform their peers in the quarters to come 
Earnings helped by nonoperating items
Northrop Grumman on Jan  30 reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings of  5 61 per share  easily beating the  4 77 consensus  But revenue came in at  8 7 billion   250 million shy of analyst expectations  and the earnings beat appears to be driven by corporate items including a favorable resolution of a cost accounting matter  On an operating basis  earnings appear to have missed estimates by at least  0 10 per share on weakness in aerospace systems and technology services 
For the full year  Northrop Grumman generated revenue of  33 8 billion  up 12  year over year but below the  34 billion the company was projecting 12 months ago  Total operating margin for the year came in at 11 7   down from 12 6  a year prior 

Book to bill    a ratio of orders received to amount billed    was 1 3 times for the year  a solid number though shy of the 1 42 times rival Lockheed Martin posted earlier in the week  But Northrop Grumman was able to grow its backlog by an impressive 21  in 2019  compared to Lockheed Martin s 10  growth  establishing a roadmap for future growth  And Northrop Grumman also seems to be performing well in what are often more lucrative areas like espionage and space  The company won  11 billion worth of restricted  or classified  awards  including about  7 billion from space 
Northrop Grumman is at the heart of the Pentagon s  500 billion push to modernize the nuclear triad  as the lead contractor on the  50 billion B 21 bomber program and the presumptive winner of a  60 billion contract to replace the Air Force s intercontinental ballistic missile 
On a post earnings call with investors  CEO Kathy Warden said   We are investing in innovative concepts and technologies that align with the priorities of our customers   including laser weaponry  battle management systems and sensors  and hypersonic missiles 
A 2021 growth story 
But for all of the impressive wins Northrop Grumman has enjoyed  growth has been hard to come by  The company expects sales growth of 4  to 6  in 2020  for total revenue of  35 3 billion to  35 8 billion  which is just shy of analysts   35 95 billion consensus expectation  Operating margin is expected to come in between 11 3  and 11 5   little changed compared to 2019 
There is at least a bit of downside risk to that estimate  as Northrop Grumman s guidance assumes the Air Force follows through on its previously announced timeline for the new ballistic missile and makes an award by August  Northrop Grumman is the assumed winner  but grumblings from Boeing about how the bidding process played out could delay or even derail the process 
In 2020  the company also expects about a  300 million hit as it exits the small caliber ammunition business it acquired as part of its 2018 acquisition of Orbital ATK 
Northrop Grumman  in part  is a victim of the government s long range procurement strategy  it should see more of the benefits of all of its wins starting in 2021 when B 21 production work begins to ramp and the ballistic missile work  assuming it comes through  shifts into gear 
Great company  expensive stock
Shares of Northrop Grumman have had a great run over the past five years  easily outpacing not just the S P 500 but an index of defense stocks as well  But given the high valuation and fears that the Pentagon budget has peaked for this cycle  it is time to get choosy about defense stocks 

NOC vs  the indexes data by YCharts
Northrop Grumman currently trades at an enterprise value more than 14 7 to expected EBITDA  the highest ratio among defense primes and well above the 10 times multiples of Raytheon and General Dynamics  That s a rich price to pay to wait for an expected 2021 uptick  especially when there are more attractive defense stocks to buy right now 
There is nothing wrong with Northrop Grumman  and no reason for current holders to sell the stock  But there also seems to be no compelling reason to buy in right now ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqz98,2075650

LinkSpace s RLV T5 rocket blasted off in a desert in western Qinghai province at 0230 GMT  It flew as high as 300 meters  984 feet  before returning to the launchpad on its own after 50 seconds  CEO Hu Zhenyu  26  told Reuters 
The Beijing based company aims to launch its next generation RLV T16 next year that will be capable of reaching an altitude of up to 150 kilometers  Hu said 
The RLV T5 previously hovered 20 meters and 40 meters above the ground in two tests in March and April respectively 
China envisions constellations of commercial satellites that can offer services ranging from high speed internet for aircraft and rural areas to tracking coal shipments and commuter traffic 
Reliable  low cost and frequent launches will be key  with recoverable or partially recoverable rockets like the Falcon 9 from Elon Musk s SpaceX one pathway to eventually affordable satellite deployment missions 
SpaceX has already used recoverable rockets on a number of orbital missions since a historic launch early in 2017  spurring Europe  Russia  Japan and China to speed up their own research into the technology or at least consider studying it 
LinkSpace s test flight on Saturday came on the heels of a historic delivery of a satellite into orbit last month by privately owned Chinese firm iSpace 
Beijing based iSpace told Reuters last week that it was also planning to launch a recoverable rocket  in 2021 
The reusable design of its next generation rocket could lead to a predicted cost reduction of 70   iSpace estimated 
LinkSpace previously told Reuters it hoped to charge no more than 30 million yuan   4 25 million  per reusable launch

SYDNEY  Reuters    Cyber attackers spent months targeting personal information of students and employees at one of Australia s most prestigious universities  a report into a 2018 breach released on Wednesday said  although the identities of the culprits remain unknown 
The Australian National University  ANU  said in June that attackers had managed to breach its cyber defenses in late 2018  potentially gaining access to sensitive data that included students  bank account numbers and passport details going back 19 years 
The ANU is one of Australia s highest ranked universities  with alumni including former and current members of the country s government   stoking fears that the attackers had been looking for potential leverage against high ranking individuals 
Heightening those concerns  an assessment conducted by U S  defense contractor  Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC  concluded the attackers ignored typical targets such as academic research to go after the personal information of students  current and former  and former employees 
 In addition to their efficiency and precision  the  attackers      demonstrated an exceptional degree of operational security that left few traces of their activities   the report said 
ANU Vice Chancellor Professor Brian Schmidt told Reuters there was no evidence on who the attackers were 
While investigators now believe the attackers obtained less than 1  of the 200 000 records kept on the server  and the data has not yet been released on the dark web   they do know which records were compromised 
 This wasn t a smash and grab  It was a diamond heist   said Schmidt 
 It was an extremely sophisticated operation  most likely carried out by a team of between five to 15 people working around the clock  
The ANU breach came amid a spate cyber attacks  including one against Australia s parliament and three largest political parties that Reuters reported was attributed to China by local intelligence 
China has denied responsibility for the attacks 
But Canberra is worried about cyber attacks  particularly attempts on Australian universities 
Many Australian universities remain financial dependent on foreign students   they are worth about A 35 billion   23 45 billion  a year to the Australian economy  with Chinese students accounting for about a third of that figure 
The ANU generated A 249 million   167 million  from overseas students in 2017  about 20  of its revenue  the university s annual report shows 
Australia said in August it will now require local universities to work with security agencies to ensure they are adequately protected against undue attempts of interference 
The Northrop report said the attack on ANU begun with a spear phishing email on Nov  9  2018 to a senior staff member 
The attackers had intermittent access to university records for about three weeks  the report says  before being cut off in December ",2019-10-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/hackers-targeted-personal-data-held-at-top-australian-university-report-1991803,1991803

113111,334626,NOC,Trump says Iran may have shot down U S  drone by mistake,news,"By Roberta Rampton  Phil Stewart and Parisa Hafezi WASHINGTON DUBAI  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump played down Iran s downing of a U S  military drone on Thursday  saying he suspected it was shot by mistake and that  it would have made a big difference  to him if the remotely controlled aircraft had been piloted  While the comments appeared to suggest Trump was not eager to escalate the latest in a series of incidents with Iran  he also warned that   This country will not stand for it    Tehran said the unarmed Global Hawk surveillance drone was on a spy mission over its territory but Washington said it was shot down over international airspace   I think probably Iran made a mistake   I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down   Trump told reporters at the White House   We had nobody in the drone  It would have made a big difference  let me tell you  it would have made a big  big difference  if the aircraft had been piloted  Trump said as he met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Oval Office  The United States  which called the event an  unprovoked attack  in international air space  is pursuing a campaign to isolate Iran to contain its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and limit its role in regional wars   The incident was the latest in an escalating series of incidents in the Gulf region  a critical artery for global oil supplies  since mid May including explosive strikes on six oil tankers as Tehran and Washington have edged towards confrontation  It was unclear how the United States might respond and U S  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi  the top Democrat in Congress  said Washington had no appetite for war with Iran   It s hard to believe it was intentional  if you want to know the truth  I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that day   Trump said  referring to the drone shooting   The Trump administration called top congressional leaders to the White House for a briefing later on Thursday on Iran  a source with knowledge of the meeting said  Iran has denied involvement in the tanker attacks  but global jitters about a new Middle East conflagration disrupting oil exports have triggered a jump in crude prices  Saudi Arabia  Washington s main gulf ally  said Iran had created a grave situation with its  aggressive behavior  and the kingdom was consulting other Gulf Arab states on next steps  Tensions with Iran flared with Trump s withdrawal last year from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and have worsened as Washington imposed fresh sanctions to throttle Tehran s vital oil trade  Iran retaliated earlier this week with a threat to breach limits on its nuclear activities imposed by the deal   SPY  DRONE  Iranian state media said the  spy  drone was brought down over the southern Iranian province of Hormozgan  which is on the Gulf  with a locally made  3 Khordad  missile  A U S  official said the drone had been downed in international air space over the Strait of Hormuz  through which about a third of the world s seaborne

Bill Urban  a spokesman for the U S  military s Central Command  said Iran s account that the drone had been flying over Iranian territory was false   This was an unprovoked attack on a U S  surveillance asset in international air space   Urban said  The drone  he added  was downed over the Strait of Hormuz at approximately 2335 GMT   in the early morning hours of local time in the Gulf  Separately  a U S  official told Reuters on condition of anonymity the debris field from the drone was in international waters in the Strait and U S  naval assets have been dispatched to the area   Iran s foreign ministry said the drone had violated Iranian air space and warned of the consequences of such  illegal and provocative  measures  Independent confirmation of the drone s location when it was brought down was not immediately available   A Iranian Revolutionary Guards statement said the drone s identification transponder had been switched off  in violation of aviation rules and was moving in full secrecy  when it was downed  Iranian state broadcaster IRIB reported  IRANIAN  RED LINE   Our air space is our red line and Iran has always responded and will continue to respond strongly to any country that violates our air space   Ali Shamkhani  secretary of the Supreme National Security Council  told Iran s Tasnim news agency  The Global Hawk s manufacturer   Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC   says on its website that it can fly for over 24 hours at a time at altitudes higher than 10 miles  16 km    Upping the ante in its dealings with Iran  Washington said on Monday it would deploy about 1 000 more troops  along with Patriot missiles and manned and unmanned surveillance aircraft  to the Middle East on top of a 1 500 troop increase announced after the May tanker attacks   The Trump administration sought on Wednesday to rally global support for its pressure on Iran by displaying limpet mine fragments it said came from an oil tanker damaged in the June 13 attacks  saying the ordnance closely resembled mines publicly displayed in Iranian military parades  European diplomats have said more evidence is needed to pinpoint responsibility for the tanker strikes   U S  sanctions have hammered Iran s economy  scuttling its oil exports and barring it from the dollar dominated global finance system  That undoes the promise of trade rewards from the 2015 deal to curb its nuclear ambitions  Trump has sent forces including aircraft carriers  B 52 bombers and troops to the Middle East over the past few weeks  Iran said last week it was responsible for the security of the Strait of Hormuz  calling on American forces to leave the Gulf

earths capability in a race to secure stable supply of the specialized material amid the country s trade conflict with China  which controls the rare earths industry  according to a government document seen by Reuters   The push comes weeks after China threatened to curb exports to the United States of rare earths  a group of 17 minerals used to build fighter jets  tanks and a range of consumer electronics   The Pentagon wants miners to describe plans to develop U S  rare earths mines and processing facilities  and asked manufacturers to detail their needs for the minerals  according to the document  which is dated June 27  Responses are required by July 31  a short time frame that underscores the Pentagon s urgency  The U S  government s fiscal year ends in September  The U S  Air Force  which is part of the Pentagon and created the document  confirmed the document s existence  The Pentagon s headquarters did not respond to a request for comment   The responses will be reviewed by two government contractors  including  Northrop Grumman  Corp  NYSE NOC   which did not respond to requests for comment   The government wants to know how much of these minerals we could eventually be producing  and how soon   said Anthony Marchese  chairman of Texas Mineral Resources Corp  which is working to develop the Round Top rare earth deposit in the state s western edge  Several miners  though  declined to comment when asked if they will reply to the Pentagon  a sign of the sensitivity around rare earth mine development during the ongoing U S  China trade dispute  The document does not directly promise loans  grants or other financial support to U S  rare earths projects  But the Pentagon s request is derived in part from the Defense Production Act  DPA   a 1950s era U S  law that gives the Pentagon wide berth to procure equipment necessary for the national defense   Some type of financial assistance is ultimately expected for the industry after the Pentagon reviews the responses  according to industry analysts and consultants  CHINA DOMINATES Although China contains only a third of the world s rare earth reserves  it accounts for 80  of U S  imports of minerals because it controls nearly all of the facilities to process the material  according to U S  Geological Survey data  It is unclear how much money the U S  military will spend to boost America s rare earths industry as the DPA does not set a financial limit  The June Pentagon letter notes that government investments usually range from  5 million to  20 million per project   The overall goal is to secure and assure a viable  domestic supplier  of rare earths  for the long term   according to the nine page document  The Air Force Research Laboratory  which drafted the request  said it wants information related to U S  rare earth  shortcomings  risks  and opportunities which may be addressed by investments  by the military   There is no guarantee that any submitted topic will  receive military support  Diana Carlin  the Air Force s executive agent program manager for the DPA program related to procurement  said in an emailed statement to Reuters   James Litinsky  co chairman of MP Materials  which owns the Mountain Pass mine in California  said the United States needs  a sustainable supermajor for the Western supply of these minerals   A supermajor would be a large producer that dominates the global industry   MP Materials  the only existing U S  rare earths facility  ships its ore to China for processing and has been subject to a 25  tariff since last month  Some industry analysts have called for the Pentagon to broaden the scope of its study and commit to direct government funding of rare earth magnet and motor manufacturing  much like China s government   The U S  government doesn t have a holistic approach to the entire rare earths supply chain  even now  and that s a problem   Jack Lifton  an industry analyst with Technology Metals Research LLC  said in an interview this week  BILLS IN U S  SENATE The Pentagon s request builds on several executive orders from President Donald Trump on strategic minerals  which he has said are critical for national defense  Several U S  senators have sponsored legislation in recent weeks designed to boost domestic production of lithium  rare earths and other strategic minerals  On Thursday  U S  Senator Marco Rubio  a Florida Republican  introduced a bill that would let rare earths producers form cooperatives  avoiding U S  antitrust statutes  None of the bills have passed yet  The Pentagon has also held talks with rare earths suppliers in Malawi and Burundi  department officials told Reuters last month   There s a heightened sense of urgency on developing a rare earth supply

BEIJING  Reuters    Beijing based startup iSpace is planning up to eight commercial rocket launches next year  after last week becoming China s first privately funded firm to put a satellite into orbit  its executives told Reuters 
iSpace s success has turned up the heat on the country s other 15 plus startups to develop vehicles capable of delivering satellites into orbit  Since late last year  two other firms have attempted but failed 
 Graphic  China s long march to space    
China envisions constellations of commercial satellites that can offer services ranging from high speed internet for aircraft to tracking coal shipments  Reliable  low cost and frequent deployment by private firms will be key 
 If you don t have a rocket that can go into orbit  that shows that you don t have a product  What business model can you speak of then   iSpace s Vice President for Finance Huo Jia said in an interview on Tuesday 
 The threshold for orbital launches is extremely high  and 99  of companies will fail   Huo said  predicting only one or two firms in China would be successful in the next five to 10 years 
Clients from Singapore  Italy  Spain  Hong Kong and Sri Lanka  as well as mainland customers  have already either signed up for a spot on iSpace s rockets or expressed interest 
iSpace is open to both private and government clients 
 It s the same for us whether it s a private or a state owned company   Vice President for Marketing and Communications Yao Bowen said 
The price tag to launch a rocket is 4 5 million euros   5 million   Yao added 
That compares with the  25 million to  30 million needed for a launch on a  Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC  Innovation Systems Pegasus  a commonly used small rocket 
Since its founding in late 2016  iSpace has completed six rounds of fund raising totaling over 700 million yuan   102 million   The last round took place in June 
To help develop the Hyperbola 2  which will also be a reusable rocket  iSpace will  definitely  complete a large round of fund raising later this year  Huo said  declining to give more details 
Many of iSpace s rivals are designing cheap  disposable boosters  Only one other firm   LinkSpace   aims to build reusable rockets that return to Earth after delivering their payload  much like the Falcon 9 rockets of Elon Musk s SpaceX 
The reusable design of Hyperbola 2 will cut costs by 70   Huo said 
iSpace estimates a first launch of its reusable rocket in 2021

such hardware can be found in China s state research institutes or the military  the government directly supports private firms by allowing them to launch from military controlled facilities  But it s still a high risk business  and one unsuccessful launch might kill a company   The biggest problem facing all commercial space companies  especially early stage entrepreneurs  is failure  of an attempted flight  Liang Jianjun  chief executive of rocket company Space Trek  told Reuters  That can affect financing  research  manufacturing and the team s morale  he added   Space Trek is planning its first suborbital launch by the end of June and an orbital launch next year  said Liang  who founded the company in late 2017 with three other former military technical officers   Despite LandSpace s failed Zhuque 1 orbital launch in October  the Beijing based firm secured 300 million yuan in additional funding for the development of its Zhuque 2 rocket a month later   In December  the company started operating China s first private rocket production facility in Zhejiang province  in anticipation of large scale manufacturing of its Zhuque 2  which it expects to unveil next year   STATE COMPETITION  China s state defense contractors are also trying to get into the low cost market   In December  the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp  CASIC  successfully launched a low orbit communication satellite  the first of 156 that CASIC aims to deploy by 2022 to provide more stable broadband connectivity to rural China and eventually developing countries  The satellite  Hongyun 1  was launched on a rocket supplied by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp  CASC   the nation s main space contractor  In early April  the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology  CALVT   a subsidiary of CASC  completed engine tests for its Dragon  China s first rocket meant solely for commercial use  clearing the path for a maiden flight before July   The Dragon  much bigger than the rockets being developed by private firms  is designed to carry multiple commercial satellites  At least 35 private Chinese companies are working to produce more satellites   Spacety  a satellite maker based in southern Hunan province  plans to put 20 satellites in orbit this year  including its first for a foreign client  chief executive Yang Feng told Reuters   The company has only launched 12 on state produced rockets since the company started operating in early 2016   
 When it comes to rocket launches  what we care about would be cost  reliability and time   Yang said ",2019-04-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/chinas-rocket-startups-go-small-in-age-of-shoebox-satellites-1847304,1847304

113241,334756,NOC,3 Defense Stocks Could Rise On Escalating U S  Iran Tensions,opinion,"Tensions between the United States and Iran are at new highs after Iran launched 15 ballistic missiles at U S  forces in Iraq on Tuesday  Jan 7 
This attack on two military bases was an act of retaliation for a drone strike ordered by U S  President Donald Trump late last week in Iraq that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani  widely seen as Iran s second most powerful figure behind Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
Even before Iran responded to the drone strike  the U S  was deploying roughly 4 500 soldiers  as well as a wide array of ships  planes and other weapons to the region  
Further escalation in the U S  Iran conflict would likely benefit the prices of these three defense sector stocks 
1  Raytheon  Largest Guided Missile Producer
Raytheon  NYSE RTN  is the fourth largest military contractor as well as an industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in weapons  military and commercial electronics  The defense giant saw its 2018 annual revenue rise to  27 1 billion  87  of which came from arms sales and defense contracts 
With the hostility between Washington and Tehran threatening to turn into a full blown war  it makes sense for this major U S  defense contractor to be on our radar 
The Waltham  Massachusetts based firm is the largest producer of guided missiles and a leading manufacturer of missile defense systems  Raytheon s portfolio includes radars and ballistic missile interceptors  such as the Patriot missile system  It also makes a wide range of air to surface  surface to air  air to air  and surface to surface precision guided missiles 
Raytheon has a market cap of  63 3 billion and shares closed at  226 54 on Tuesday  not far from the recent record high of  232 43 reached on Jan  6 

The technology and innovation leader next reports earnings on Jan  24  Consensus calls for earnings per share  EPS  of  3 12 for the fourth quarter  up 6  from earnings of  2 93 per share in the year ago period  Revenue is forecast to increase 8  from the same period a year earlier to  7 98 billion 
2  Lockheed Martin  Leading F 35 Fighter Jet Manufacturer 
 Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   headquartered in Bethesda  Maryland  is by far the largest defense contractor in the world and the Pentagon s primary provider  The aerospace and defense juggernaut saw its 2018 annual revenue climb to  53 8 billion  88  of which came from sales of military services 
It s no surprise that Lockheed Martin made our list  considering its position as a global manufacturing leader of a wide range of military services  including fighter jets  combat ships  hypersonic missiles and missile defense systems  The corporation brought in  53 8 billion in sales in 2018  the majority of it from its aeronautics and defense businesses  
Lockheed is best known as a developer and manufacturer of a wide range of military aircraft  including the F 16  F 22  and F 35 fighter jets  of which the U S  military is the primary buyer  The F 35 fighter jet is Lockheed s biggest growth driver and accounts for about a third of the company s total revenue 
Shares ended at  414 50 yesterday  within sight of their all time peak of  417 00 touched on Jan  6  The company has a market cap of  116 5 billion 

The arms behemoth is projected to report fourth quarter results on Jan  23  Consensus estimates call for the company to post earnings of  5 04 per share  while revenue is forecast to grow approximately 6  from the same quarter a year earlier to  15 25 billion 
3  Northrop Grumman  Major Player In Global Drone Market
 Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC  located in Hawthorne  California  is the third largest weapons manufacturer and military services provider  The company raked in  30 1 billion in revenue in 2018  84  of which were from defense contracts 
As a major subcontractor on Lockheed s F 35 and producer of drones such as the Global Hawk  Northrop Grumman is well positioned to profit from elevated tensions in the Middle East 
The aerospace corporation has the largest share of the drone market and makes the RQ 180 stealth drone  which can evade radar  as well as the  120 million RQ 4 Global Hawk  which can reach up to 60 000 feet  In addition  the company is known for its B 2 stealth bomber line and is leading the development of the B 21 Raider a long range  stealth bomber capable of delivering conventional and thermonuclear weapons 
Shares settled at  374 97 last night  just below their record high of  383 89 scaled on Sept  26  Northrop Grumman has a valuation of  63 2 billion 

The global security provider is expected to publish fourth quarter earnings on Jan  30  Consensus calls for EPS of  4 77  while revenue is expected to rise about 8  from the same period a year earlier to  8 85 billion ",2020-01-08,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-defense-stocks-could-rise-on-escalating-usiran-tensions-200497129,200497129
113242,334757,NOC,Iran Retaliates With Missile Strike  3 Defense Stocks To Buy,opinion,Iran executed a ballistic missile attack targeting two Iraqi airbases that were hosting U S  and allied troops late in the night on Jan 7  More than dozen missiles were launched in retaliation to the U S  airstrike on Baghdad airport that killed Iran s top commander General Qasem Soleimani As expected  defense stocks jumped once the share market opened on Jan 8  as this missile attack once again intensified the long standing tiff between the United States and Iran A Longstanding ConflictCross border tension between America and Iran started long back in 1953  when reportedly  British and U S  intelligence agencies orchestrated a coup to oust Iran s democratically elected prime minister  Mohammad Mossadeq  as per a BBC report   The tiff mitigated  to some extent  at least  under President Barack Obama  when in 2015 Iran signed the much awaited nuclear accord  promising to limit its nuclear activities However  the relation between these two nations soured again when in May 2018  under President Trump  the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal  Moreover  economic sanctions were imposed on Iran that ultimately led to a recession  The situation further worsened in May 2019  when the United States tightened the sanctions targeting Iran s oil exports The recent killing of General Soleimani brought the government at its wits end and the nation s commanders vowed to take revenge in the form of direct military action against the United States  The latest missile strike on an Iraq base seems to be in line with thepromise made by Iran s leaders United States  StanceSurprisingly  President Trump appears to have taken a defensive approach while addressing the Iran missile attack issue  Per major reports  Trump did not mention any military retaliatory action against Iran  following the latest strikes  stating that Iran to him appears to have stepped down from executing any further military action against the United States However  Trump announced that his administration would once again slap Iran with more sanctions and demanded that U S  allies leave the nuclear deal so a new pact can be negotiated  Now this will be a more strategic way to penalize Iran  which might once again enrage its leaders  leading to aggressive military action  In the event of such escalated action  the United States might strike back Defense Stocks to BuyIn response to Iran s threat of revenge following Soleiman s death  the United States sent 3 000 more troops to the Middle East and advised its citizens to leave Iraq  Per the latest reports  Trump has not mentioned whether these troops will be withdrawn or not So the possibility of a war between the United States and Iran still exists  Such a scenario will boost U S  defense stocks  missile manufacturing stocks in particular  as missiles have always played a vital role in cross border tiffs Considering this  we have hand picked three U S  stocks that are either missile makers or offer significant missile defense systems  These stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and thus should find a place in an investor s portfolio  They also boast

113260,334775,NOC,Bull Of The Day  Northrop Grumman  NOC ,opinion,"With an annual budget north of  4 4 trillion  The U S  is the largest single consumer of virtually everything it purchases  The defense portion of U S  expenditures naturally rises in time or war  but with conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan greatly reduced  had settled into a range between  560 and  600 billion annually during the second term of the Obama administration 
As of 2016  the United States accounted for more than a third of global defense spending and it s been on the rise since then 
President Trump campaigned on a promise to  rebuild our depleted military  and in office  he s living up to that promise 
Trump signed into law the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act  committing  716 billion to defense spending during the fiscal year  Even when other budget consideration remain unresolved  Congress and the President have an easy time agreeing on defense spending 
Texas Republican Rep  Mac Thornberry  chairman of the House Armed Services Committee suggested that even higher defense budgets are on the horizon  saying of the 2019 allocation   The first job of the federal government is to defend the country  We re doing that on about 15  of the federal budget  but we ve cut too much in the past eight years and we have to make up for some of the ground that s been lost  
Northrop Grumman Corporation  NYSE NOC   supplies a wide range of Military systems to the U S and also other countries  The business is broken down into four main categories   Aerospace Systems  Mission Systems  Technology Services and the newly acquired Innovation Systems 
In the Aerospace division  Northrop produces aircraft  spacecraft  high energy systems and microelectronics  Mission Systems makes military radar  sensors and related products  Technology Services works on the entire lifecycle of civil and defense platforms through a wide range of services  including logistics  security  network operations and integrated air and missile defense serving not only the U S government and other Sovereign nations  but also municipalities like the state of Virginia  Finally  Innovation Systems was borne from the acquisition of Orbital ATK and is a leader in space  defense and flight systems 
Defense stocks are also generally defensive stocks  providing stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall stock market  With a beta of 0 76  NOC shares tend to move considerably less than the broad markets  especially during times of turmoil  In fact  periods of armed conflict   which cause significant uncertainty for most stocks   are actually the best times for defense companies as nations expand their offensive capabilities and refresh depleted resources 
Another positive aspect of the defense sector is that these companies generally have an easier time passing along cost increases to their customers than other industrial companies  When rising steel  oil or labor costs increase the price of finished goods  ordinary consumers can much more easily choose to delay the purchase of an automobile or even a tractor  but the government can t necessarily put off defense purchases  Defense companies are also naturally resistant to trade wars and tariffs  because governments are unlikely to enact tariffs on goods and services of which they themselves are the purchasers 
 
In their most recent earnings report  NOC handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates of  4 74 share in earnings  with  5 49 share in earnings on sales of  8 48B 
Analysts expect  20 38 share in earnings in full year 2019 and  23 01 in 2020  Both have been revised upward several times over the past quarter 
Northrup Grumman is a Zacks Ranks  2  Buy  
Northrop also pays a 1 5  dividend  and has over  2 5B in Free Cash Flow to back it up 
There s one more story that bodes well for the futures at Northrop Grumman  The most recent defense budget bill also provided the framework for the development of an additional branch of the US military   the Space Force 
The establishment of the Space Force will likely be a windfall for Northrup Grumman  It s a fair bet that a company with Northrop s expertise in the space sector would make it a natural choice for the goods and services the new division would require  Until we know more about the ultimate size and shape of the Space Corps  this is a non quantifiable wildcard  but one with the potential to create a strong tailwind for the company 
In an investing environment that includes all sorts of apparently hidden risks   trade wars  rising commodity prices  increased labor costs  etc   there are some companies that appear particularly well equipped to weather the storm  With the support of a Presidential administration devoted to increased defense spending  Northrop Grumman belongs in any well diversified portfolio

113262,334777,NOC,Raytheon  RTN  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Shares of Raytheon  RTN  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  230 in the previous session  Raytheon has gained 3 7  since the start of the year compared to the 4 1  move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the 3 7  return for the Zacks Aerospace   Defense Equipment industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 24  2019  Raytheon reported EPS of  3 08 versus consensus estimate of  2 85 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 56  
For the current fiscal year  Raytheon is expected to post earnings of  12 87 per share on  29 35 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  14 per share on  31 4 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 8 35  and 6 96   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Raytheon may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Raytheon has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 17 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18X versus its peer group s average of 15X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 66  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Raytheon currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Raytheon meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Raytheon shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Raytheon Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Raytheon have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including VirTra Systems  VTSI   Leidos Holdings  LDOS   and Northrop Grumman  NOC   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 38  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Raytheon  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2020-01-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/raytheon-rtn-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200496587,200496587

113304,334819,NOC,5 Best Stocks With Strong Sales Growth To Buy Right Away,opinion,Solid sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of winners in the stock market  The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted into growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  This is because investors want to ensure that the business has the capability of generating more sales over time Flat or declining sales indicate obstacles for the company and limit the scope for sustained growth  Companies with top line pressure may generate near term profit but that doesn t ensure enough growth to attract investors Without impressive top line growth  the bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term  While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs  sustainable growth in the bottom line usually requires robust sales performance However  sales growth alone doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits So  taking a company s cash position along with its sales number into consideration can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Also  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or

113305,334820,NOC,NOC Or LMT  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Aerospace   Defense sector have probably already heard of Northrop Grumman  NOC  and Lockheed Martin  LMT   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that NOC has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
NOC currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 32  while LMT has a forward P E of 18 16  We also note that NOC has a PEG ratio of 1 32  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 56 
Another notable valuation metric for NOC is its P B ratio of 6 11  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  LMT has a P B of 28 14 
Based on these metrics and many more  NOC holds a Value grade of B  while LMT has a Value grade of C 
NOC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that NOC is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-11-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/noc-or-lmt-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200487117,200487117

California home  some of them shackled to furniture  were getting food and treatment after being rescued from a  horrific  ordeal that could leave them scarred for years  authorities said on Tuesday  Police were investigating the circumstances under which the parents   David Allen Turpin  57  and Louise Anna Turpin  49   had subjected their children to abuse behind the doors of their darkened  foul smelling home  Captain Greg Fellows of the Riverside County Sheriff s Department said   The couple  who three times had traveled to Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows at an Elvis chapel  was arrested on Sunday  Each was charged with nine counts of torture and 10 counts of child endangerment and held on  9 million bail  with a court hearing scheduled for Thursday  Authorities were alerted after one of the children  an emaciated  17 year old girl  called police after escaping through a window of the house in Perris  a city about 70 miles  115 km  east of Los Angeles   I wish I could come to you today with information that would explain why this happened   Fellows said  explaining the investigation was ongoing   But we do need to acknowledge the courage of the young girl who escaped from that residence to bring attention so they could get the help they so needed   The teen used a deactivated cellphone to call police  Fellows said  Cellphones deactivated for service can still make calls to the 911 emergency number  police said  Police said they found three of the couple s 13 children  who range in age from 2 to 29  chained inside the filthy residence in a suburban housing tract   Police noticed the children were malnourished  Fellows said  calling conditions  horrific   Even so  he said  the mother appeared  perplexed  about why the police were there   If you can imagine being 17 years old and appearing to be a 10 year old  being chained to a bed  being malnourished  and injuries associated with that   Fellows said   I would call that torture    Authorities were seeking court authorization to take custody of the children  The state Child Protective Services agency was assisting in an investigation   Some of the children were being fed and were in stable condition at a hospital  officials said  The family has lived at the house since 2014  where the parents home schooled their children  Fellows said  Six of the couple s children are minors  while the other seven are over 18  according to neighbors  meaning they are adults under the law  Kimberly Milligan  50  who lives across the street from the family  said she only saw the infant in the mother s arms and three other children since she moved in across the street two years ago  describing them as small and pale    Why don t we ever see the kids   Milligan said she asked herself   In hindsight  we would have never thought this  But there were red flags  You never don t hear or see nine kids   Two years ago  while walking around the neighborhood admiring Christmas lights  Milligan said she had encountered three of the Turpin children and complimented them on the manger with a baby Jesus set up outside the house  She said the children froze  as if by doing so they could become invisible    Twenty year olds never act like that   she said   They didn t want to have a social conversation   Nicole Gooding  35  who has lived in the neighborhood for three years  said the first time she saw the family was two months ago when the mother and children were cleaning up their yard  which was full of weeds and overflowing trash cans    I had never seen them at all until that day   she said  MARRIAGE RENEWAL VOWS The parents home schooled the children strictly and required them to memorize long passages from the Bible  David Turpin s parents  James and Betty

spoke highly of their children  A Northrop spokesman declined to say whether Turpin was currently employed there   We are deeply troubled by the nature of the allegations against Mr  Turpin   Northrop s Mark Root said in a statement  David and Louise Turpin appeared to have had marriage renewal ceremonies at least three times  in 2011  2013 and 2015  at an Elvis Presley themed chapel in Las Vegas

113359,334874,NOC,Northrop s pricey purchase of Orbital ATK is worth it  investors say,news,"Northrop Grumman   s  NYSE NOC   9 2B purchase including debt of Orbital ATK  NYSE OA  was appreciated by investors of both companies  which ended today s trade with respective 3 3  and 20 2  gains 
Analysts say the proposed deal would help NOC produce and launch large and small spy and communications satellites and develop new high speed weapons and missile defense systems  and should clear the bar with regulators since there s little overlap in the companies  businesses 
The acquisition gives NOC  more options in DoD growth segments  such as missile defense and space   and  exposure to the munitions refill cycle for both U S  and some foreign military sales   Cowen analysts say 
Defense is a hot sector amid a likely meaningful pickup in defense spending after years of sequestration amid North Korea concerns  and while  buying at the top isn t usually a great M A strategy    this is one case where the revenue opportunities for the combined company are pretty clear and likely to win over investors   Bloomberg s Brooke Sutherland writes 
Even with NOC paying a premium over OA s record stock price   it s still offering a cheaper multiple than what United Technologies  NYSE UTX  is paying for Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL   and the revenue benefits there are much murkier   according to Sutherland

113383,334898,NOC,What Makes Northrop Grumman  NOC  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Northrop Grumman  NOC  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Northrop Grumman is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Northrop Grumman imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Northrop Grumman
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this defense contractor is expected to earn  19 64 per share  which is a change of  7 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Northrop Grumman  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

Valued at  434 4 million  the deal is expected to be completed by September 2020  Through this contract  Electric Boat will also provide all engineering and related lead yard support necessary for direct maintenance and support of Virginia class ship specifications 
The majority of the deal will be executed in Groton  CT 
Virginia Class Submarines Recent Developments
General Dynamics is the lead contractor of the Virginia class submarine program  its largest program in 2018 and the largest contract in its backlog  The company s Marine Systems segment that manufactures these submarines had a year end backlog totaling  8 8 billion for 11 Virginia class submarines  scheduled for delivery through 2023 
Since the delivery of the lead Virginia class submarine  General Dynamics has substantially reduced the cost and delivery time for these submarines from 84 months to 66 months alongside improving mission capability and ship construction quality  Moreover  the company is also developing the Virginia Payload Module  VPM  for the fifth block of Virginia class submarines  scheduled to begin construction in 2019  The VPM will support the Navy s fleet plans providing significant upgrades in size and performance 
What Favors General Dynamics 
General Dynamics  one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines  enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor  Moreover  the United States is strategically strengthening its naval power by upgrading missile submarines amid rising geo political tensions across the world 
Inevitably  demand for its technical expertise and other support services required for the proper functioning of submarines also remains high  As a result  defense giants like General Dynamics enjoy a smooth flow of contracts  like the latest one 
Looking Ahead
Per a report by Globaldata firm  the global submarine market is expected to witness CAGR of 3 4  from 2019 to reach a value worth  31 3 billion in 2023  The global submarine market is expected to be led by North America  which will account for almost half of the global spending  with revenue share of 49   With General Dynamics being a prominent U S  submarine maker  such projections  should benefit the company in the coming days

113388,334903,NOC,Northrop Grumman  NOC  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Northrop Grumman  NOC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27 5  
Revenues are expected to be  8 55 billion  up 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 21  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman 
For Northrop Grumman  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 26  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Northrop Grumman will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of  4 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 06  delivering a surprise of  9 05  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

113402,334917,NOC,Exclusive  Lockheed nears  37 billion plus deal to sell F 35 jet to 11 countries,news,"By Mike Stone  Reuters     Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  is in the final stages of negotiating a deal worth more than  37 billion to sell a record 440 F 35 fighter jets to a group of 11 nations including the United States  two people familiar with the talks said  This would be the biggest deal yet for the stealthy F 35 jet  set to make its Paris Airshow debut this week   The sale represents a major shift in sales practices from annual purchases to more economic multi year deals that lower the cost of each jet   The pricing of the jets was still not final  although the average price of the 440 jets was expected to be  85 million  the people said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly  The multi year deal for the fighters will consist of three tranches over fiscal years 2018 2020   A Lockheed representative said the U S  company does not discuss negotiations on contracts and said any deal involving a  block buy  would be announced by the U S  government  A representative for the customers including the United States did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday  Last week  representatives from 11 F 35 customer nations met in Baltimore  Maryland to discuss terms and toured a  Northrop Grumman  Corp  N NOC  facility in Maryland that provides equipment for the jet  Those nations included Australia  Denmark  Israel  Italy  Japan  the Netherlands  Norway  Turkey  South Korea  Britain and the United States  The memorandum of understanding being negotiated between Lockheed and the customers aims to procure 135 or more jets in fiscal year 2018 for delivery in 2020 for about  88 million per jet  the people said   In the subsequent fiscal years  2019 and 2020  procurement would ramp up to 150 or more jets per year   The average price in 2019 could be  85 million for the F 35  A  variant and could drop below  80 million in 2020  the people said  That would mark the lowest price ever paid for an F 35  making this deal an important step in reducing the overall cost of each jet   The F 35 has been widely criticized for being too expensive  including by U S  President Donald Trump and other U S  officials who have criticized the Pentagon s most expensive program for delays and cost overruns  Recently  a quarter of the operating F 35 fleet was grounded until further notice because of irregularities in the pilots  oxygen supplies  REDUCING COSTS The memorandum of understanding will guarantee contracts will take place in each successive future year  This allows the manufacturing group led by Lockheed to take advantage of greater economies of scale  reducing the cost of each jet  They have been working to reduce the cost of the jets through streamlining the supply chain and purchasing materials in bulk  Recently revised estimates indicate the U S  Defence Department expects to spend  379 billion  down from  391 billion  to develop and buy 2 443 of the supersonic warplanes through 2039  one of the people said   This is part of an ongoing process  If it gets done  it would be a plus for Lockheed  allowing for better long term production management   said Robert Stallard  an analyst at Vertical Research  The F 35 comes in three configurations  the A model for the U S  Air Force and U S  allies  the B model  which can handle short take offs and vertical landings for the Marine Corps and the British navy  and the carrier variant F 35C jets  In February  the Pentagon agreed to a deal for the tenth batch of the fighter aircraft and agreed to pay below  95 million per jet for the first time  compared with  102 million in the previous purchase which was the lowest price up until that point   Around that time the Pentagon said the price of a jet could fall 16 percent to around  80 million in future purchases   The F 35 business accounts for about 37 percent of Lockheed s total revenue  During the first quarter  Lockheed s revenue from its aeronautics business increased 8 percent to  4 1 billion  led by higher sales of the F 35  Lockheed executives have estimated that a multi year deal will save about  2 billion for the nations that choose to participate in the multi year purchase

113411,334926,NOC,Should Value Investors Pick Northrop Grumman  NOC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Northrop Grumman Corporation   NYSE NOC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Northrop Grumman has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 19  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 26  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Northrop Grumman s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 70  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Northrop Grumman has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 91  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company s share price will likely appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Northrop Grumman has a P S ratio of about 1 92  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 22 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years NOC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Northrop Grumman currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Northrop Grumman a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Northrop Grumman is 1 52  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 08  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 13 93  which is better than the industry average of 14 27  Clearly  NOC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Northrop Grumman might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives NOC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  While the current quarter has not seen any estimate revisions in the past sixty days  the full year estimate has seen two upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and Consensus    Even though Northrop Grumman has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNorthrop Grumman is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a solid industry rank  among the Top 3    Northrop Grumman looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this stock a compelling value pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of

WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Department of Defense and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  announced on Friday an agreement worth about  8 5 billion for 90 F 35 jets  the lowest price to date for the Pentagon s most expensive program 
The deal for the tenth lot of the stealthy fighter aircraft brings the price per jet to below  95 million for the first time  compared to  102 million in the previous batch  a savings of  728 million 
This is more than the  600 million that U S  President Donald Trump claimed on Monday he had been able to shave off from the F 35 program  which he had described as  out of control  in December 
Lockheed Martin said in a statement that  President Trump s personal involvement in the F 35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price  
The price per jet has been steadily declining as production ramps up  and defense analysts have said the discount hailed by Trump was in line with what had been flagged by Lockheed and Pentagon officials for months 
 The increase in the number of aircraft in this agreement enables us to reduce costs by taking advantage of economies of scale and production efficiencies   Lockheed said 
Lockheed  the prime contractor  and its partners including  Northrop Grumman  Corp  N NOC   United Technologies Corp s  N UTX  Pratt   Whitney and BAE Systems Plc  L BAES  have been working on building a more cost effective supply chain to fuel the production line in Fort Worth  Texas 
Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan  who runs the F 35 program for the Pentagon  said on Dec  19 the cost per plane should decrease about  6 to 7 percent  for the latest contract 
Friday s announcement said the cost of the F 35 A conventional takeoff and landing version of the jet had dropped 7 3 percent since the previous order

was negated by continued trade war skirmishes with China and softness in the European economy  With China devaluating its currency against the U S  dollar to negate the effects of the proposed tariffs and President Trump pledging to take  stern action   the markets bore the brunt of the geopolitical crisis and its cascading effect on the bilateral trade  As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they can benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE    A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for

113482,334997,NOC,3 Defense Stocks To Dodge The Trade War,opinion,"The Aerospace Defense industry has been an incredible performer so far this year  up 37 7  compared to a 12  gain for the S P 500  This uptick has been partly due to increasing global tensions  and therefore increased demand for military equipment 
U S  defense spending has increased each of the past 5 years  with the 2020 budget set to rise to between  733 billion and  750 billion  In 2019  the DoD s budget is  693 billion  International turmoil has the DoD especially focused on being ready to meet new threats  With aerospace at the forefront of the DoD s strategic priorities  firms in this industry are perfectly poised to benefit from procurement and advancement of military technology 
With the trade war impacting a large segment of the stock market  investors are likely looking for safe havens  While 2018 s steel tariffs have impacted the industry by raising steel prices  these prices have since fallen almost back to pre tariff levels  Tariffs on Chinese goods have not affected the defense market as much as other industries  due to the defense industry relying exclusively on domestic suppliers and manufacturers 
Below are three attractive aerospace defense equipment manufacturers that are fairly isolated from the trade war  These companies will likely benefit from increased government spending in this sector as well 
Teledyne Technologies Incorporated   NYSE TDY  
Teledyne shares are up 40 9  YTD  outperforming the broader Aerospace Defense industry  Teledyne is an industrial conglomerate that manufactures products in four focus areas  Instrumentation  Digital Imaging  Engineered Systems  and Aerospace and Defense  Aerospace is the most directly impacted by defense spending and makes up 24  of sales  but the other three areas also sell significant amounts of equipment to the government

Teleydne is currently a Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   as all estimates have been raised significantly within the past 30 days  During Teledyne s Q2 earnings call on July 24th  the company raised its full year 2019 earnings outlook by  0 21 to the range  9 86 to  9 96 per share 
Northrop Grumman Corporation   NYSE NOC  
Northrop shares are up 48 5  YTD  just recently passing through record highs set early 2018  Northrop Grumman is one of the world s largest weapons manufacturers and military technology providers  its largest divisions are Aerospace and Mission Systems  Northrop does not just sell its products to the U S  It currently sells to and services in 25 countries  although it needs government approval to do so 
Earnings estimates show a 27 52  decline in this quarter from last year  However  last year s Q3 earnings were abnormally high  a 77 7  increase over Q3 2017  Fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to drop by 7 97  from last year  but revenues are projected to rise by 13 01   Fiscal 2020 projections show earnings increasing by 14 04  to  22 39  Northrop currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   due to upward earnings revisions for full year 2019 and 2020 
TransDigm Group Incorporated   NYSE TDG  
Shares of TransDigm Group are up 51 7  YTD  easily beating both its industry and the S P 500  TransDigm manufactures commercial and military aerospace components through 35 different business groups  35  of its business comes from defense spending  its fastest growing segment by revenue  while the rest comes from commercial customers  Most of the company s products are highly engineered and proprietary  setting TransDigm apart from most parts manufacturers

113522,335037,NOC,NOC Vs  LHX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Aerospace   Defense stocks are likely familiar with Northrop Grumman  NOC  and Harris  LHX   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Northrop Grumman has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Harris has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NOC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
NOC currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 44  while LHX has a forward P E of 22 72  We also note that NOC has a PEG ratio of 1 40  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  LHX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 84 
Another notable valuation metric for NOC is its P B ratio of 6 26  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  LHX has a P B of 6 69 
These metrics  and several others  help NOC earn a Value grade of B  while LHX has been given a Value grade of D 
NOC has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LHX  so it seems like value investors will conclude that NOC is the superior option right now ",2019-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/noc-vs-lhx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200450740,200450740

113524,335039,NOC,Northrop Grumman  NOC  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Northrop Grumman  NOC   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  363 41 in the previous session  Northrop Grumman has gained 47 6  since the start of the year compared to the 24 2  move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the 21 2  return for the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 24  2019  Northrop Grumman reported EPS of  5 06 versus consensus estimate of  4 64 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 66  
For the current fiscal year  Northrop Grumman is expected to post earnings of  19 59 per share on  34 01 billion in revenues  This represents a  8 16  change in EPS on a 13 01  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  22 27 per share on  36 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 13 67  and 5 85   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Northrop Grumman may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Northrop Grumman has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 18 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 13 6X versus its peer group s average of 13 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 48  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Northrop Grumman currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Northrop Grumman fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Northrop Grumman shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Northrop Grumman Stack Up to the Competition

113550,335065,NOC,Drones emerge from shadows to become key cog in U S  war machine,news,"By Josh Smith KANDAHAR  Afghanistan CREECH AIR FORCE BASE  Nevada  Reuters    When U S  drones obliterated a car carrying Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour last month  it was the kind of targeted killing that unmanned aircraft are best known for  But 15 years after a drone first fired missiles in combat  the U S  military s drone program has expanded far beyond specific strikes to become an everyday part of the war machine  Now  from control booths in the United States and bases around the Middle East  Afghanistan and parts of Africa  drone crews are flying surveillance missions and providing close air support for troops on the ground   In the wars we fight  this is the future   said drone pilot Lieutenant Shaw  as he stood in a hangar at the Air Force s drone base in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar  Crews spoke to Reuters on condition that only their first names and rank be used to identify them  The increased use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  UAVs  in a wide range of battle applications comes as the United States looks to reduce the number of soldiers fighting abroad  The U S  military declined to provide statistics breaking down drone activity into types of missions  but dozens of interviews with people working in the secretive programs show UAVs have become an integral tool on the battlefield  That is likely to raise further objections from critics who say drones often miss their intended targets  can only partly relay what is happening on the ground and encourage warfare with impunity waged by people at computer screens far from danger  In Afghanistan  the United States has around 9 800 troops left and plans to cut the level to 5 500 by early 2017  At its peak a few years ago  the U S  military had around 100 000 soldiers there  yet the dramatic decrease does not mean the conflict is winding down  In fact  the Taliban insurgency is as potent now as at any time since 2001  DRONES TAKING OVER As part of its expanding program  the Air Force aims to double the number of drone squadrons over the next five years  Even some proponents  like retired Lieutenant Colonel T  Mark McCurley  a former Air Force drone pilot  say over reliance on remote killing and electronic intelligence has hurt efforts on the ground   Too often  remotely piloted aircraft are being used as a tool to wantonly kill individuals  rather than as one of many tools to capture and shut down whole terrorist networks   he said  Central to the shift toward remote operations is Afghanistan  where weak local forces  a dwindling troop presence and rugged terrain have made it something of a testing ground  Drones there log up to eight times as many flight hours as the few remaining manned fighter aircraft  They also release more weapons than conventional aircraft  Reuters reported in April  For the first time  the top Air Force general in the country was trained as a drone pilot before he deployed  a move he said reflected the importance of unmanned aircraft in the broader military mission   Our airmen are flying persistent intelligence  surveillance  reconnaissance  and strike missions all across Afghanistan   Major General Jeff Taliaferro told Reuters in Kabul  referring to the drone program   They re performing everything from counterterrorism to base defense  and really it s a capability a lot of our missions have come to rely on   RAPID EXPANSION The latest generation of drones carries more and bigger weapons and an expanding payload of hi tech sensors designed to handle a wider range of missions for the conventional military  The number of hours flown by the Air Force s newest attack drone  the MQ 9 Reaper  more than doubled globally between 2010 and 2015  to nearly as many hours as F 16 fighter jets  according to statistics from the Air Force Safety Center  In a plan announced late last year  the Air Force proposed roughly  3 billion in funding to expand its attack drone force further  adding 75 of the latest Reaper aircraft  It already fields at least 93 Reapers and 150 of the older MQ 1 Predators  both built by General Atomics  as well as 33 much larger Global Hawk surveillance UAVs  manufactured by  Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC   The U S  Army also operates a fleet of roughly 130 MQ 1C Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft  an upgraded version of the Predator  and all military services have thousands of smaller  mostly unarmed surveillance drones  One challenge for the U S  military is recruiting enough staff to operate a growing fleet and expanding range of roles  As many as 3 500 new personnel may be added to a workforce of roughly 1 700 pilots and sensor operators in a bid to expand the program and relieve stress and overwork  according to proposals released by the Air Force s Air Combat Command  FULL CIRCLE While Afghan missions are flown via satellite link by pilots at bases in the United States  aircraft take off and land under the control of crews deployed to the airfields in Afghanistan  As a steady procession of Reapers rolled down the runways and into the bright Afghan sky  operators at Kandahar described life in on of the fastest changing sectors of the military   My old job was going away  while this field is rapidly expanding   said Captain Bryan  a pilot who used to fly KC 135 refueling aircraft  Kandahar s role as a drone center in Afghanistan brings the drone full circle  Fifteen years ago  a U S  drone made history over Kandahar when it fired the first weapon deployed by unmanned aircraft in combat  during a failed attempt to kill then Taliban leader Mullah Omar in the first days of the U S  led operation that ousted the hardline Islamists from power  On its way back to base  the drone fired its second missile at Kandahar airfield  then suspected of being occupied by Taliban and al Qaeda fighters  At the height of the NATO coalition mission  Kandahar  which is also a civilian airport  hosted a range of military aircraft including F 16 fighter jets and C 130 cargo planes  Now  the only attack aircraft deployed here are about two dozen drones  Squeezed into sand colored shipping containers just off the tarmac  pilots and sensor operators flip through checklists amid an array of monitors  touch screens  radio consoles and a secret chat system with which they talk to pilots in the United States  At the beginning of the year  the squadron at Kandahar began flying new  extended range Reapers  usually carrying four Hellfire missiles  one 500 lb GBU 12 bomb and an external fuel tank under the wings  That load has allowed the aircraft to be used for more than just hunting individuals  including close air support for troops fighting on the ground   ANYTHING BUT A VIDEO GAME  Almost 8 000 miles away  pilots sitting at another sun bleached desert base  this time in the United States  are among the crews that take over a few minutes after takeoff and guide the aircraft during the mission  Sitting in dark  air conditioned booths at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada  pilots and sensor operators work closely with large teams of intelligence analysts who sift streams of real time data transmitted by the drones on the other side of the planet  While air strikes often grab the headlines  the vast majority of missions in Afghanistan involve hours of mind numbing surveillance and intelligence gathering  crews say  The most revolutionary aspect of unmanned aircraft  crews add  is the combination of weapons and surveillance capabilities  which often provide more information than analysts can process  At Creech  crews handle nearly half of all the Air Force s 60 global drone flights on any given day  
 For us it s anything but a video game   said Captain Tim  a pilot based at Creech  addressing one of the main criticisms leveled at the drone program   From here you re having an impact on the battlefield  ",2016-06-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/drones-emerge-from-shadows-to-become-key-cog-in-u.s.-war-machine-406914,406914
113551,335066,NOC,Pentagon unveils new cost cutting initiatives for F 35 fighter jet,news,"By Andrea Shalal
FARNBOROUGH  England  Reuters    The U S  Defense Department on Monday extended by two years a project that has cut the cost of  Lockheed Martin  Corp s  N LMT  F 35 fighter plane by more than  1 million per jet  and kicked off a similar project to cut operating and maintenance costs 
The Pentagon s F 35 program office is working closely with industry to drive down the cost of the jets   now running just over  100 million per jet   to around  85 million by 2019 
The F 35 program is the Pentagon s costliest arms program  The U S  military plans to spend  379 billion to buy a total of 2 457 F 35 warplanes over the next decades 
Under the Blueprint for Affordability cost cutting program first announced two years ago  Lockheed and its key suppliers   Northrop Grumman  Corp  N NOC  and Britain s BAE Systems Plc  L BAES  were due to invest  170 million in new technologies  materials and processes to lower production costs 
They are due to recoup their initial outlays from the government once the accrued savings are verified  Specific programs included boosting efficiency through improved tooling  automating production by introducing robotics  and even modifying assembly instructions 
The project funded 193 separate initiatives  of which 75 were still in process  The investments are expected to save  1 15 million per aircraft in the ninth production lot  and  1 7 million in the 10th  Over the life of the program  the changes will save around  4 billion  according to the F 35 program 
Over the next two years  the companies have agreed to invest  24 million left over from the original program  and up to  170 million more on continued work to lower the cost of the jets  the program office said 
In addition  the three companies agreed to invest up to  250 million in projects aimed at cutting the cost of operating and maintaining the jets  with a goal of saving  1 billion over a five year period  the F 35 program office said 
Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said the extra investment by industry would help the military bridge to an F 35 block purchase planned in coming years for international customers that could cut the cost of building the jets by over  2 billion 
Kendall told reporters that the department was  basically ready to move forward  on the block buy  initially with a group of other countries  and then later with the U S  military 
 We d like to see that proceed as soon as possible   he said   We think we re basically ready to move forward on that  
Kendall said the separate program to cut operating costs would help the Pentagon achieve its goal of lowering the overall lifecycle cost of the program   now estimated to be over  1 trillion through 2070   by 30 percent 
Bennett Croswell  who heads the military engines business of Pratt   Whitney  a unit of United Technologies  NYSE UTX  which makes the F135 engine that powers the F 35  said his company would also set new cost cutting targets after completing the engine s development program by the end of this month 

He said the new program would involve Britain s Rolls Royce Holdings Plc  L RR   which makes the lift fan for the F 35B model  which can land vertically like a helicopter ",2016-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pentagon-unveils-new-cost-cutting-initiatives-for-f-35-fighter-jet-413586,413586
113552,335067,NOC,Dallas police chief says armed civilians in Texas  increasingly challenging ,news,"By Ernest Scheyder DALLAS  Reuters    The Dallas police chief stepped into America s fierce gun rights debate on Monday when he said Texas state laws allowing civilians to carry firearms openly  as some did during a protest where five officers were killed  presented a growing law enforcement challenge  Dallas Police Chief David Brown also gave new details about his department s use of a bomb carrying robot to kill Micah Johnson  the 25 year old former U S  Army reservist who carried out last Thursday s sniper attack that also wounded nine officers  A shooting in Michigan on Monday underscored the prevalence of gun violence in America and the danger faced by law enforcement  even as activists protest against the fatal police shootings of two black men last week in Louisiana and Minnesota  Two sheriff s bailiffs were shot to death at a courthouse in St  Joseph in southwestern Michigan  and the shooter was also killed  Berrien County Sheriff Paul Bailey told reporters  By Monday evening  protesters were marching again in several large American cities  including Chicago  Sacramento  and Atlanta  where news footage showed a number of protesters being arrested after street demonstrations north of downtown   President Barack Obama and others reiterated their calls for stricter guns laws after last month s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando  Florida  but many conservatives responded that such measures could infringe on the U S  Constitution s protection of the right to bear arms   Texas is known for its gun culture and state laws allow gun owners to carry their weapons in public  Some gun rights activists bring firearms to rallies as a political statement  as some did at Thursday s march in Dallas   It is increasingly challenging when people have AR 15s  a type of rifle  slung over  and shootings occur in a crowd  And they begin running  and we don t know if they are a shooter or not   Brown said   We don t know who the  good guy  versus who the  bad guy  is  if everybody starts shooting    Seeing multiple people carrying rifles led police initially to believe they were under attack by multiple shooters  Brown did not explicitly call for gun control laws  but said   I was asked  well  what s your opinion about guns  Well  ask the policymakers to do something and I ll give you an opinion    Do your job  We re doing ours  We re putting our lives on the line  Other aspects of government need to step up and help us   he said   SIMPLY MISTAKEN  Rick Briscoe  legislative director of gun rights group Open Carry Texas  said Brown was  simply mistaken  in viewing armed civilians as a problem   It is really simple to tell a good guy from a bad guy   Briscoe said   If the police officer comes on the situation and he says   Police  put the gun down   the good guy does  The bad guy probably continues doing what he was doing  or turns on the police officer   Police used a  Northrop Grumman  Corp  N NOC  Mark5A 1 robot  typically deployed to inspect potential bombs  to kill Johnson after concluding during an hours long standoff there was no safe way of taking him into custody  Brown said   They improvised this whole idea in about 15  20 minutes   Brown said   I asked the question of how much  explosives  we were using  and I said      Don t bring the building down   But that was the extent of my guidance   The incident is believed to have been the first time U S  police had killed a suspect that way  and some civil liberties activists said it created a troubling precedent  Brown said that  in the context of Thursday s events   this wasn t an ethical dilemma for me   The attack came at the end of a demonstration decrying police shootings of two black men in Baton Rouge  Louisiana  and near St  Paul  Minnesota  Those were the latest in a series of high profile killings of black men by police in various U S  cities that have triggered protests  In the shooting near St  Paul  the Star Tribune newspaper reported that the officers had pulled over 32 year old Philando Castile because one of the patrolmen thought he and his girlfriend matched the description of suspects involved in a robbery  In Dallas  a vigil was held for the slain officers on Monday evening  In Chicago  images and footage on social media and news stations showed about 500 protesters marching through downtown after holding a quiet sit in in Millennium Park that spilled into the streets and a rally near City Hall  In Atlanta  media footage showed a number of handcuffed protesters being loaded onto a police bus surrounded by armed officers and emergency vehicles with lights flashing  Television station WSB TV reported that police started arresting demonstrators marching on Peachtree Road at about 8 30 p m  In Sacramento  about 300 people were marching peacefully on Monday evening  Earlier in the day  in an incident not linked to protests  Sacramento police said officers fatally shot a man carrying a knife after he charged at police  Johnson was in the U S  Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015 and served for a time in Afghanistan  He had been disappointed in his experience in the military  his mother told TheBlaze com in an interview shown online on Monday   The military was not what Micah thought it would be   Delphine Johnson said   He was very disappointed  Very disappointed   The Dallas police chief  who is black  urged people upset about police conduct to consider joining his force  
 Get off that protest line and put an application in  and we ll put you in your neighborhood  and we will help you resolve some of the problems you re protesting about   Brown said   Additonal reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin  Texas  Fiona Ortiz and Justin Madden in Chicago  Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles  and David Beasley in Atlanta  Writing by Daniel Wallis  Scott Malone and Eric M  Johnson  Editing by Will Dunham  Peter Cooney and Paul Tait ",2016-07-12,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/mayor,-protest-leader-condemn-violence-at-minnesota-demonstration-413491",413491

113598,335113,NOC,5 ROE Stocks To Profit As Fed Fueled Rate Cut Hopes Soar,opinion,The U S  equity markets gained momentum yesterday as leading benchmark indices hit record high on expectations of a Fed rate cut as early as this month  Despite the resumption of U S  China trade talks and a strong June jobs report  slower business investment and low inflation rates were cited as the primary reasons for Fed s accommodative monetary policy  This  in turn  keeps intact broad based Wall Street expectations of around three interest rate cuts this year   As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they can benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE    A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength    Zacks Rank

NASDAQ JBLU   Add These 5 Stocks with Solid Sales Growth to Your PortfolioSales growth is a vital metric for any company  as it is an important part of growth projections and is instrumental in strategic decision making  By observing this key metric over a period of time  one can clearly understand a company s growth trend Sales growth is crucial to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and unimpressive financial results  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  however  they need to show accelerated growth to attract new investors Further  in an improving economy  lack of sales growth most likely indicates that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is required to support profitability Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy Strong liquidity position and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors

113603,335118,NOC,Northrop Grumman  NOC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Northrop Grumman  NOC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 1  
Revenues are expected to be  8 40 billion  up 18  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman 
For Northrop Grumman  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northrop Grumman will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of  4 59 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 06  delivering a surprise of  10 24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Northrop Grumman doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northrop-grumman-noc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200440703,200440703

113626,335141,NOC,U S  senator introduces bill to speed electronic warfare weapons,news,"SAN DIEGO  Reuters    U S  Senator Mark Kirk on Wednesday introduced legislation that would give the Pentagon more flexibility in funding electronic warfare programs and speed often sluggish acquisition times 
Current acquisition rules make it tough for the U S  military to quickly procure and field electronic warfare weapons systems before they are overtaken by developments around the world 
Kirk  an Illinois Republican and retired naval intelligence officer  said the bill would help the U S  military accelerate work on electronic warfare weapons and stay ahead of other countries that are rapidly developing their own capabilities 
 It is critical our military dominate the offensive and defensive ends of electronic warfare   Kirk said in a statement   The need for enhanced electronic capabilities is even more pronounced on today s battlefield  
Senator Kristen Gillibrand  a New York Democrat  is co sponsoring the bill 
The bill would amend the fiscal 2016 defense policy bill to include electronic warfare  or EW  under the Pentagon s Rapid Acquisition Authority  RAA  program  That program lets program managers waive some acquisition rules to more quickly field technology 
It would also allow the department to use different contract types  including those used for commercial items  when it buys EW weapons 
The bill also includes directives for the Pentagon s new joint Electronic Warfare Executive Committee  which is headed by Air Force General Paul Selva  vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  according to a Kirk aide 
The bill directs the committee to provide a strategic plan for the services to work together on electronic warfare systems  and tackle acquisition and budget processes  bolster training  fill capability gaps and advance offensive capabilities 
Kirk is expected to discuss the legislation during a visit to a  Northrop Grumman  Corp  N NOC  facility in Rolling Meadows  Il  on Friday  the aide said ",2016-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-senator-introduces-bill-to-speed-electronic-warfare-weapons-383226,383226

113634,335149,NOC,TXT Or NOC  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Aerospace   Defense stocks are likely familiar with Textron  TXT  and Northrop Grumman  NOC   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Textron and Northrop Grumman are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
TXT currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 02  while NOC has a forward P E of 16 40  We also note that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1 12  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  NOC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 28 
Another notable valuation metric for TXT is its P B ratio of 2 31  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NOC has a P B of 6 18 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to TXT s Value grade of B and NOC s Value grade of C 
Both TXT and NOC are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that TXT is the superior value option right now ",2019-06-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/txt-or-noc-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200435651,200435651
113635,335150,NOC,Will Northrop Grumman  NOC  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Northrop Grumman  NOC   which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry 
This defense contractor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10 51  
For the most recent quarter  Northrop Grumman was expected to post earnings of  4 59 per share  but it reported  5 06 per share instead  representing a surprise of 10 24   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 45 per share  while it actually produced  4 93 per share  a surprise of 10 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Northrop Grumman lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Northrop Grumman currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 08   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

113716,335231,NOC,TXT Vs  NOC  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Aerospace   Defense stocks are likely familiar with Textron  TXT  and Northrop Grumman  NOC   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  both Textron and Northrop Grumman are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
TXT currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 16  while NOC has a forward P E of 15 49  We also note that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1 05  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  NOC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 21 
Another notable valuation metric for TXT is its P B ratio of 2 16  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NOC has a P B of 5 84 
These metrics  and several others  help TXT earn a Value grade of B  while NOC has been given a Value grade of C 
Both TXT and NOC are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that TXT is the superior value option right now ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/txt-vs-noc-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200430983,200430983

113778,335293,NOC,Lockheed  Pentagon ink  4 7 billion deal for eighth batch of F 35 fighters,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Pentagon said on Friday it had awarded Lockheed Martin Corp  N LMT  a contract valued at  4 7 billion for an eighth batch of F 35 fighter jets that lowered the average price per jet by 3 5 percent from the last contract  and 57 percent from the first batch 
The Pentagon s F 35 program office said the deal includes 29 jets for the United States and 14 for five other countries  Israel  Japan  Norway  Britain and Italy 
Once production of those jets is completed  more than 200 F 35s will be in operation by eight countries  according to the office that runs the  399 billion F 35 program for the Pentagon 
The Pentagon has signed a separate contract valued at  1 05 billion for an eighth batch of engines built by Pratt   Whitney  a unit of United Technologies Corp  N UTX   to power the jets  Pratt last month said the contract would lower the cost of the engines between 3 5 percent to 4 5 percent 
The program office said the new contract reduced the cost of the A model airframe built for the Air Force  without the engine  to  94 8 million 
The cost of the F 35 B model  which can take off from shorter runways and lands like a helicopter  would be  102 million  without an engine  while the Navy s C model or carrier variant would be  115 7 million  it said 
The Pentagon does not provide detailed cost breakdowns for Pratt s F135 engine  given the company s concerns about proprietary data  but U S  officials have said they expect the cost of the aircraft  with an engine  to drop to about  80 million to  85 million by 2019 
Lockheed s F 35 program manager  Lorraine Martin  said the latest contract showed the company was making steady progress in reducing the cost of the most advanced U S  warplane 
Lockheed and its key subcontractors  Northrop Grumman Corp  N NOC  and BAE Systems Plc  L BAES   as well as Pratt  are all investing in various measures aimed at simplifying production of the jets and reducing the cost to build and operate them 
But the biggest driver in cutting the cost of the planes is the number of jets ordered in any given year 

Lockheed had hoped to finalize orders for two dozen more F 35 jets for Israel this year or early next  but Israel may halve that order to around 10 to 15 jets  a cabinet minister told Reuters earlier this week

113807,335322,NOC,U S  says  not giving up  on bringing F 35s to UK air show,news,"By Andrea Shalal FARNBOROUGH England  Reuters    The U S  and UK militaries are  not giving up  on bringing the Lockheed Martin  N LMT  F 35 Joint Strike Fighter to Britain for a high profile air show this week after an engine fire prompted a fleetwide grounding  a top U S  official said Monday 
 We re not giving up yet  We still have a few more days left to try to get the airplane over here   Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan  the Pentagon s F 35 program chief  told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow 
U S  Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall said the United States and other countries involved in the multinational F 35 program remained committed to the program despite the June 23 failure of the Pratt   Whitney  N UTX  F135 engine on a U S  Air Force jet that has grounded the entire F 35 fleet 
Kendall said he remained hopeful the grounding order could be lifted in time to bring jets to the Farnborough air show that began Monday and runs through Sunday  but said no decision had been made at this point 
He said there was growing evidence that the failure of the engine   triggered by excessive rubbing in the third stage of Pratt s F135 engine   was not a systemic design flaw affecting the whole fleet  But he said officials were still trying to understand why the engine broke up 
The United States  newest combat jet missed a British military show last week where it was to make its international debut  and it remains unclear if it will be able to appear at the Farnborough show 
Kendall and Bogdan were joined at a news conference at the show by top executives from the biggest contractors on the program   Lockheed  Pratt  Northrop Grumman Corp  N NOC   and Britain s BAE Systems  L BAES   as well as the acquisition chiefs of the U S  Air Force and Navy 
Kendall said no similar problems had been found on any of the other 98 engines in service  and underscored that the program was still in the development stage when technical problems are meant to be found and fixed 
 It s unfortunate timing   he told the news conference   but it s not a major setback  
U S  officials said they expected to adopt a more streamlined process for the different military services and countries to report mishaps and accidents after early delays in sharing information about the June 23 incident 

Kendall said he was satisfied that Pratt and the other parties involved were providing information for investigators as they worked to understand and resolve the incident

113811,335326,NOC,Exclusive  Lockheed  suppliers brainstorm how to lower F 35 operating costs ,news,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Lockheed Martin Corp met with 90 key suppliers last week to brainstorm ways to lower the long term cost of operating and maintaining the F 35 fighter jets from the Pentagon s current forecast of  1 02 trillion through 2065 
Top officials from the Pentagon s Defense Contracts Management Agency and the Defense Contracts Audit Agency were also on hand during two days of talks in Fort Worth  Texas 
Tom Owen  vice president of F 35 sustainment strategies for Lockheed  told Reuters the meeting was  an initial  early step  toward mapping out specific measures to cut the plane s hefty sustainment costs 
 We are laser focused on identifying the cost drivers for the F 35 air system and what we can do to reduce those costs as much as possible   Owen said  noting that industry government relations were more collaborative than in past years 
 It s in everybody s interest to make this aircraft more affordable to build and more affordable to sustain   he said 
The trillion dollar so called  sustainment  price tag for the Joint Strike Fighter  the Pentagon s costliest weapons program  comes on top of the  399 billion projected cost of developing and buying 2 457 jets for the U S  military in coming decades 
Lockheed  the prime contractor on the program  and key suppliers Northrop Grumman Corp and Britain s BAE Systems last month said they would spend  170million over two years to reduce the cost of producing the warplanes to under  80 million each by 2019 
But the longer term cost of flying and servicing the planes continues to vex the Pentagon  the contractors  and engine maker Pratt   Whitney  a unit of United Technologies Corp  which has a separate contract with the government for the F135 engines that power the new warplane 
Owen said suppliers at the meeting heard  encouraging words  from U S  Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan and other government officials about the program  despite an engine failure that grounded the fleet for over three weeks this summer 
One idea discussed in Fort Worth was the use of multiple year contracts  and eventual adoption of performance based logistics contracts  under which the supplier would be responsible for maintaining weapons and ensuring certain reliability levels  rather than paying for item by item repairs 
Such deals give incentives to suppliers to drive costs down even further  Owen said 
Multi year contracts would make it easier for suppliers to invest in process and hardware improvements  he said 
Owen said Lockheed hoped to gradually shift into such arrangements with the government and its suppliers in coming years  but would need approval from Congress and the Pentagon 
F 35 program officials also met with representatives from the Pentagon s Defense Contracts Management Agency and the Defense Contracts Audit Agency  said Joe DellaVedova  a spokesman for the F 35 program office 
It was critical for the program to create  the right framework  to help drive costs lower  he said 
Mark Buongiorno  who heads Pratt s domestic and after market business development  said production and sustainment of theF135 engine were closely integrated since original and replacement parts could be ordered together   We have one supply chain and that allows us to leverage the overall volume  which benefits the  war on cost  and drives down the price   Buongiorno said 

He said Pratt was also in talks with the Pentagon about a performance based logistics system  which could help lower costs across the board

113812,335327,NOC,Obama orders review of police use of military hardware,news,"By Steve Holland and Andrea Shalal  EDGARTOWN Mass  WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Barack Obama has ordered a review of the distribution of military hardware to state and local police out of concern at how such equipment has been used during racial unrest in Ferguson  Missouri   The president ordered the examination of federal programs and funding that enable state and local law enforcement to purchase such equipment  a senior Obama administration official said on Saturday   Images of police wielding military style guns and armor have shocked many Americans following clashes that were triggered by the fatal shooting of a black teenager  Michael Brown  by a white police officer in Ferguson two weeks ago   Obama wants to know whether the programs  which were expanded after the Sept  11  2001  attacks  are appropriate and whether state and local law enforcement are given proper training  the official said   The review will be led by White House staff including the Domestic Policy Council  the National Security Council  the Office of Management and Budget  and relevant U S  agencies including the Departments of Defense  Homeland Security  Justice and Treasury  and conducted in coordination with Congress   Obama signaled he would review the programs at a White House news conference on Monday when he said he wanted to make sure police were purchasing equipment they actually needed because there is  a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we don t want those lines blurred    A growing number of lawmakers have voiced concern about the militarization of U S  police forces through programs administered by the Pentagon  Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security   Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri  who heads the oversight subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  announced plans this week for a hearing in September about the programs   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin  a Michigan Democrat  said last week he planned a review to ensure that the Pentagon s 1033 program  which transfers surplus equipment to local and state authorities  was working as intended before the full Senate considers the annual bill that authorizes military spending   Key concerns include a clause in the program that requires police to use the equipment within a year  something the American Civil Liberties Union argues may give police forces an incentive to use the equipment in inappropriate situations  The program also does not mandate training for crowd control or other uses   House of Representatives lawmakers defeated a bill to halt the 1033 program in a 355 62 vote in June  but concerns about the handling of the crisis in Ferguson have revived the reform effort   COMPANIES HAVE EYED  ADJACENT  MARKETS  The Pentagon has transferred more than  4 billion of equipment including armored vehicles  tents  rifles and night vision goggles to local and state agencies since 2006  of which about 36 percent involved new equipment   Over the past year alone  the Pentagon said  it has transferred some 600 armored military trucks known as MRAPS that were built for the war in Iraq   In addition  the Department of Homeland Security has awarded more than  35 billion in grants over the past decade   U S  weapons makers have been eyeing what they call  adjacent  markets for years  keen to drum up fresh demand for products initially developed for the military  and recently  to offset declines in U S  and European military spending   Faced with a dwindling number of big ticket military contracts  even the Pentagon s largest suppliers such as Lockheed Martin Corp  N LMT  and Northrop Grumman Corp  N NOC  are competing for increasingly smaller contracts in commercial or non military markets  analysts and industry executives said   Among the products marketed to state and local officials are military grade communications equipment  radios  night vision goggles  drones and other surveillance equipment   Some smaller companies such as privately held Sierra Nevada Corp and Exelis Inc  N XLS  are also marketing military style reconnaissance systems to state and local governments to help agencies become more efficient  said Loren Thompson  chief operating officer of the Virginia based Lexington Institute think tank   But Michael Smith  managing director of the Virginia based Silverline Group defense consultancy  said local law enforcement agencies accounted for less than 1 percent of the revenues of most defense contractors   But he said the crisis in Ferguson could help niche firms by increasing demand for cameras  more coordinating centers and better training   Digital Ally  O DGLY   which makes tiny digital video cameras worn by police officers  and Taser International Inc  which makes stun guns  have seen a sharp

113816,335331,NOC,Pentagon says cost to fix F 35 engine issue  relatively minor ,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall said the United States was close to a design fix for the Pratt   Whitney engine that powers Lockheed Martin Corp s  N LMT  F 35 fighter jet after a major engine failure in June  and the cost would be  relatively minor  
Kendall told reporters after a defense conference that the Pentagon was setting up test fixtures to ensure that the corrective action proposed by engine maker Pratt  a unit of United Technologies Corp  N UTX  was acceptable and adequate 
 I am getting  over time  more confident that we ve got our arms around that problem and are solving it   Kendall said 

Asked about the cost of addressing the issue that destroyed the engine on an Air Force F 35A model at Eglin Air Force Base on June 23  he said   I don t think it s going to be a huge cost  I think it s a relatively minor cost

113817,335332,NOC,Pilot actions examined in U S  crash of Virgin Galactic spacecraft,news,"By Irene Klotz  MOJAVE Calif   Reuters    A human factors expert will join the investigation of the fatal crash of Virgin Galactic s passenger spacecraft to study why the co pilot prematurely unlocked a pivoting tail section of the ship during a test flight  the National Transportation Safety Board chairman said on Monday   The untimely engagement of the tail mechanism  designed to slow the vehicle s descent into the atmosphere from space  and the possibility that pilot error was to blame  were disclosed by the NTSB late on Sunday and have emerged as a main thrust of the inquiry into Friday s accident   The suborbital rocket vehicle dubbed SpaceShipTwo broke into pieces over California s Mojave Desert and crashed shortly after its separation from the special jet aircraft that carries it aloft for its high altitude launches   The accident  which unfolded without SpacesShipTwo catching fire or exploding in flames  came on its fourth powered test flight  the first since January   Video footage from the cockpit shows co pilot Michael Alsbury  39  who died in the crash  releasing a lever to unlock the twin tail section too soon after the space plane was jettisoned from the mother ship over Southern California   This was followed two seconds later by the premature movement of the tail  which pivots upward from the rear of the wings at a 90 degree angle and increases aerodynamic drag on the spacecraft   Still  NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart told Reuters that investigators have yet to determine whether releasing the tail mechanism too early caused or contributed to the crash of the space plane near the Mojave Air and Space Port  about 95 miles  152 km  north of Los Angeles    We know already from having the lever move from lock to unlock that we need to get a human factors person in here because the question then is why did that happen when it happened   Hart said   The human factors person will be here today    MYSTERY OF PILOT S SURVIVAL  Investigators also are trying to determine how surviving pilot Pete Siebold  43  managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from a height of roughly 50 000 feet  an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen   Hart said Siebold  now hospitalized with a shoulder injury  did not exit through the cockpit s escape hatch   We know it wasn t through there  so how did this pilot get out   he said   SpaceShipTwo  developed by the fledgling space tourism company of billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson  was designed to carry wealthy passengers on short rides into space  with Virgin Galactic planning to begin offering its first flights to paying customers next spring   The crash came three days after the unmanned rocket of another private space company  Orbital Sciences Corp  N ORB   exploded during liftoff from a commercial launch pad in Virginia on a mission to deliver cargo to the International Space Station under contract with NASA   Hart told a news conference on Sunday that investigators had determined SpaceShipTwo s tail system was supposed to have been released for deployment as the craft was traveling about 1 4 times the speed of sound  Instead  the tail section began pivoting when the vehicle was flying at Mach 1  the speed of sound    I m not stating that this is the cause of the mishap  We have months and months of investigation to determine what the cause was   Hart said   Asked if pilot error was a possible factor  Hart said   We are looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap     including that possibility    Also unclear was how exactly the tail mechanism  once it was unlocked  began to rotate  since that maneuver requires a separate pilot command that was never given  Hart said  This raised questions about whether the craft s position in the air and its speed somehow enabled the tail section to swing free on its own   SpaceShipTwo was released normally from the carrier jet WhiteKnightTwo at an altitude of about 45 000 feet  The rocket motor  fueled for the first time in flight with a new plastic based propellant formula  then ignited as planned  Hart said   SpaceShipTwo s fuel tanks and engine were recovered intact  indicating there was no explosion   The engine burn was normal up until the extension of the feathers   Hart told reporters   About 800 people have paid or put down deposits for a ride into space at  250 000 a seat  and Branson plans to be on the first commercial flight with his son   Branson said Monday his company s venture was  absolutely  worth the risks   It s a grand program  which has had a horrible setback  but I don t think anybody    would want us to abandon it at this stage   he told NBC   Virgin Galactic is about two thirds finished building the second of its five planned space tourism vehicles  and was determining how the crash probe would alter its production schedule  chief executive George Whitesides told Reuters

113822,335337,NOC,UK space travel insurer sees no spike in queries after Virgin crash,news,"By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK  Reuters    A UK insurer that recently began offering life coverage for would be space tourists said it has seen no increase in interest in the policy following the fatal crash of a Virgin Galactic test space ship last month 
The policy  sold by Pembroke Managing Agency  pays up to  5 million per traveler or  20 million per suborbital space flight  parent Ironshore International said in announcing the policy in June 
 The policy has not sold yet and the initial response has been slow   Anthony Ruddell  a personal accident underwriter at Pembroke  said in an interview  noting Pembroke spreads the risk through a Lloyds syndicate 
 But we anticipate lots more interest closer to when the first flights take off  
Virgin Galactic had expected to carry tourists by March 2015  founder Richard Branson said  but the timeline lengthened after the company s SpaceShipTwo broke up during a test flight over the Mojave Desert in California on Oct  31  killing one of two pilots 
There are no suborbital space tourists yet  and insurers have so far not excluded the activity from coverage as they do with hang gliding  skydiving and other hazardous avocations  That means life policies already in existence are likely to pay out if a space tourist eventually dies on a flight 
But insurers are expected to rethink and possibly change policies to ask about or exclude space tourism as the 62 mile high  100 km  rides join other  extreme sports   albeit at a hefty price 
 We anticipate that when space tourism flights begin this may well be added to the list  of excluded activities  Ruddell said   Our product is designed to cater for these types of exclusions   he said 
Ruddell acknowledged that with tickets costing  250 000 on Virgin Galactic  the market will be limited initially  Pembroke does not have an estimate of the potential market size  he said 
 However  as space tourism advances and develops  the potential for the market to grow is huge   Ruddell said   The sky s the limit  
Ruddell did not comment on prices  but they are expected to mirror those of satellite policies costing between 2 5 percent and 10 percent of the insured amount  meaning premiums for tourists of between  25 000 and  100 000 for a  1 million policy 
The Virgin Galactic crash destroyed a space craft made by Scaled Composites  a unit of Northrop Grumman Corp  N NOC   that was being flown by Scaled Composites test pilots  U S  investigators are focusing on pilot error as possible cause 

Virgin Galactic  an offshoot of Branson s London based Virgin Group  VIRGI UL   now hopes to finish building a second SpaceShipTwo in mid 2015 and begin test flights before the end of the year

 By Andrea Shalal Esa
 WASHINGTON  Sept 16  Reuters    Northrop Grumman Corp
 Chief Executive Ron Sugar announced on Wednesday he was
stepping down and handing the reins to Wes Bush  the company s
president and chief operating officer 
 Sugar  61  presided over a period of strong growth at the
No  3 Pentagon contractor but leaves as the company braces for
a re run of a bruising  35 billion competition against Boeing
Co  to build new refueling airplanes for the Air Force 
 He will vacate the chairman and CEO positions at the end of
the year  but is staying on to advise the company until June 30
of next year 
 Bush  48  said Northrop was well positioned given its focus
on intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance  unmanned
systems  and cybersecurity    three big areas of focus for the
Pentagon 
 Shipbuilding was recovering and likely the company s most
promising area  said Bush who joined the company in 1987 
 Bush said he wants to accelerate a drive to improve
performance across the entire company  a maker of weapons
ranging from nuclear powered submarines to unmanned spyplanes 
 Sugar spent 29 years with Los Angeles based Northrop  and
at Litton Industries and TRW  two companies later acquired by
Northrop 
 He told Reuters it was the  right time to hand the baton 
to a younger generation of company leaders and was confident
Bush and other top managers would continue the strong growth of
the defense company 
 Shares of Northrop dipped 1 7 percent in after hours trade
from their  49 85 close in regular trading on Wednesday 
 Northrop s annual sales have grown to nearly  35 billion
from  26 billion during Sugar s tenure as chief executive which
began in 2003  The company also reversed a debt of  9 billion
to achieve its highest ever credit rating 
 SHIPBUILDING PROBLEMS
 But Northrop has faced criticism this year over the
performance of its shipbuilding business  At least two analysts
downgraded the company s shares in July after it missed
consensus estimates for second quarter earnings 
 The company has been working to correct quality issues in
its U S  Gulf Coast shipyards by making changes in production 
engineering and testing  It recorded a  105 million pretax
charge to its second quarter profit tied to increases in cost
estimates to complete several ships 
 Bush will become chief executive  and retain his title of
president  effective January 1  Bush was also elected to the
Northrop board of directors  effective immediately 
 Lewis Coleman  now lead independent director  will become
non executive chairman effective January 1  the company said 
 Defense analyst Loren Thompson said the succession should
be a smooth one  given that Bush was Sugar s protege and had
been groomed for the job 
 Brian Ruttenbur  a defense analyst with Morgan Keegan  said
resolving the shipbuilding problems and the management change
 could be a very good thing for the stock in 2010  
 He said the shipbuilding issue  has gotten progressively
worse   but looked set to be resolved this year 
 Northrop is the third largest U S  defense contractor 
measured in prime contracts  behind Lockheed Martin Corp
  and Boeing  In total revenues  it ranks second  behind
Lockheed  Sugar said

113844,335359,NOC,Boeing backers eye adding trade to tanker contest,news,"  U S  draft request expected later this week
   Some U S  lawmakers weighing legislative action
   Believe WTO ruling against Airbus must be considered
 By Andrea Shalal Esa
 WASHINGTON  Sept 22  Reuters    Lawmakers who back Boeing
Co  said they were considering legislative action to
ensure the Pentagon did not exempt Airbus parent EADS 
from U S  export restrictions and other laws in a  35 billion
refueling aircraft competition that resumes this week 
 Representative Todd Tiahrt  a Republican from Kansas   
where Boeing has a big plant    said on Tuesday he expected to
see a draft request for proposals for the new competition on
Thursday 
 The Air Force s third attempt to begin replacing its aging
KC 135 tankers is being closely watched by lawmakers supporting
Boeing  and those backing a rival bid by Northrop Grumman Corp
 and Europe s EADS 
 Northrop won a contract for 179 tankers in February 2008 
but the Pentagon canceled the deal in September 2008 after
government auditors found the Air Force had not followed its
own rules in evaluating the bids 
 Tiahrt said the Air Force needed to take into account a
preliminary World Trade Organization ruling  that concluded
Airbus  A330 and A340 planes benefited from about  5 billion in
illegal subsidies  when deciding which tankers to buy 
 He said the subsidies had already given Airbus an  unfair
advantage  in the commercial marketplace  costing Boeing jobs
in the United States  Now it was crucial to ensure that Boeing
was not disadvantaged in the tanker competition as well 
  That s why I think it s important that they include
recognition     and financial acknowledgment of these illegal
subsidies   Tiahrt told reporters after touring a demonstrator
of the cockpit for Boeing s 767 tanker outside the Capitol 
 IRANIAN HELICOPTER SALES 
 Tiahrt said the Pentagon previously exempted the Northrop
bid from the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  export
restrictions  cost accounting standards  and rules on the
foreign content of specialty metals  and should not be allowed
to do that again 
 He said EADS had pitched a small military helicopter at a
recent air show in Iran  raising concerns that it was
leveraging work done on the U S  Army s UH 72 Light Utility
Helicopter into helicopter sales to a U S  enemy 
 EADS spokesman Guy Hicks said his company scrupulously
adhered to every U S  law that governs foreign sales and the
protection of national security and military technologies 
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 He said EADS was not marketing a version of the U S  Army
helicopter to Iran  and any foreign sales of that helicopter
would be led by the U S  government 
 Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said he was puzzled that
lawmakers were raising these issues again since they had been
addressed and debated during the last competition 
  Boeing s supporters must believe that disqualifying
Northrop Grumman s tanker offer is the only way to guarantee a
Boeing win  which implies that that they feel Boeing won t have
the best tanker for the warfighter   Belote said 
 LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS
 Depending on how the Air Force tanker request looks  Tiahrt
and other lawmakers could act to ensure the trade issue and
waivers are addressed in the new competition 
  We will look at legislative solutions   said
Representative Rick Larsen  a Democrat from Washington  where
Boeing has its largest manufacturing facilities 
 The Air Force exempted the trade issue from the last
competition and officials say the recent WTO ruling does not
require changes to the draft request for proposals 
 Some details of the WTO ruling have leaked out  but there
are differing accounts 
 Boeing supporters say the preliminary WTO report upheld the
U S  view that Airbus received illegal subsidies to the
detriment of Boeing  while Northrop backers say it concluded a
European loan mechanism was in fact legal 
 European Union Ambassador John Bruton said on Monday the
WTO ruling concluded launch aid was not automatically illegal 
but depended on the conditions under which it was given 
 Scott Hamilton  defense analyst with Leeham Co  said Boeing
supporters should be cautious about playing up the WTO issue 
since a separate European case against alleged illegal U S 
subsidies to Boeing was also nearing an end 
  Be careful what you ask for   Hamilton said   I know
Northrop will bring the WTO up in the event Boeing is called
offside  Then what  Buy Russian

but the Pentagon canceled the deal in September 2008 after
government auditors found the Air Force had not followed its
own rules in evaluating the bids 
 Tiahrt said the Air Force needed to take into account a
preliminary World Trade Organization ruling  that concluded
Airbus  A330 and A340 planes benefited from about  5 billion in
illegal subsidies  when deciding which tankers to buy 
 He said the subsidies had already given Airbus an  unfair
advantage  in the commercial marketplace  costing Boeing jobs
in the United States  Now it was crucial to ensure that Boeing
was not disadvantaged in the tanker competition as well 
  That s why I think it s important that they include
recognition     and financial acknowledgment of these illegal
subsidies   Tiahrt told reporters after touring a demonstrator
of the cockpit for Boeing s 767 tanker outside the Capitol 
 IRANIAN HELICOPTER SALES 
 Tiahrt said the Pentagon exempted the last Northrop bid
from export restrictions  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
cost accounting standards  and rules on the foreign content of
specialty metals  and should not be allowed to do that again 
 He said EADS had pitched a small military helicopter at a
recent air show in Iran  raising concerns that it was
leveraging work done on the U S  Army s UH 72 Light Utility
Helicopter into helicopter sales to a U S  enemy 
 EADS spokesman Guy Hicks said his company scrupulously
adhered to every U S  law that governs foreign sales and the
protection of national security and military technologies 
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 He said EADS was not marketing a version of the U S  Army
helicopter to Iran  and any foreign sales of that helicopter
would be led by the U S  government 
 Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said he was puzzled that
lawmakers were raising these issues again since they had been
addressed and debated during the last competition 
  Boeing s supporters must believe that disqualifying
Northrop Grumman s tanker offer is the only way to guarantee a
Boeing win  which implies that that they feel Boeing won t have
the best tanker for the warfighter   Belote said 
 LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS
 Depending on how the Air Force tanker request looks  Tiahrt
and other lawmakers could act to ensure the trade issue and
waivers are addressed in the new competition 
  We will look at legislative solutions   said
Representative Rick Larsen  a Democrat from Washington  where
Boeing has its largest manufacturing facilities 
 The Air Force exempted the trade issue from the last
competition and officials say the recent WTO ruling does not
require changes to the draft request for proposals 
 Boeing supporters say the preliminary WTO report upheld the
U S  view that Airbus received illegal subsidies to the
detriment of Boeing  while Northrop backers say it concluded a
European loan mechanism was in fact legal 
 European Union Ambassador John Bruton said on Monday the
WTO ruling concluded launch aid was not automatically illegal 
but depended on the conditions under which it was given 
 Scott Hamilton  defense analyst with Leeham Co  said Boeing
supporters should be cautious about playing up the WTO issue 
since a separate European case against alleged illegal U S 
subsidies to Boeing was also nearing an end 
  Be careful what you ask for   Hamilton said   I know
Northrop will bring the WTO up in the event Boeing is called
offside  Then what  Buy Russian  
 Larsen told Reuters that U S  trade policy and defense
procurement were on a collision course  and it was up to the
White House to solve the problem  If the WTO concluded Boeing
had also benefited from illegal subsidies  then that should
also be reflected in the competition  he said 
  If  in fact  it s had an impact on the 767 then what s
good for the goose is good for the gander   Larsen said 
although he added it would be harder for the European Union to
prove its case since the 767 aircraft had been around for much
longer

 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS  Sept 28  Reuters    Deals with Brazil  Saudi Arabia
and Morocco pushed French arms sales up 13 percent last year to
their highest level since 2000  the government said on Monday 
 The increase follows a drive under President Nicolas Sarkozy
to support defence export companies that  according to the
government  directly or indirectly provide 50 000 jobs in
France 
 French companies took new orders worth 6 6 billion euros
  9 7 billion   strengthening France s grip on fourth place in
the league table of global arms exporters behind the United
States  Britain and Russia  the defence ministry said 
 France has about 7 percent of the global arms market  which
is shifting away from a heavy reliance on the Middle East 
 Sarkozy this month led an arms export delegation to Brazil 
which finalised a deal to buy four conventional submarines and
is pondering whether to buy French Rafale warplanes  built by
Dassault Aviation 
  We are getting away from the classic idea that France only
exports to the Middle East and we are doing what is necessary to
respond to the needs of Europe  Asia and Latin America   defence
ministry spokesman Laurent Teisseire told a news briefing 
 Brazil and France signed a defence accord in December last
year worth up to 8 6 billion euros  including the supply of 50
EC725 Super Cougar helicopters built by EADS subsidiary
Eurocopter 
 France had seen its defence exports come under pressure for
most of the decade as it struggled to repeat the success of
Dassault s previous generation of Mirage warplanes with the
multi role Rafale  which has not yet found a buyer 
 France sold weapon systems worth 8 2 billion euros in 2000 
 Morocco was France s second largest client in 2008 with a
contract to buy FREMM frigates built by a state controlled
company 25 percent owned by electronics firm Thales 
 France suffered an embarrassing setback at the end of the
previous year when Morocco snubbed a French offer of Rafales in
favour of Lockheed Martin F 16 fighters  prompting Sarkozy to
order a shake up of France s arms export system 
 In third place last year was Saudi Arabia  thanks in part to
a deal to buy air refuelling tankers converted from passenger
planes built by EADS subsidiary Airbus 
 Details were presented to the French parliament as EADS and
U S  partner Northrop Grumman embarked on a fierce battle with
U S  contractor Boeing to secure a far bigger order of mid air
tankers for the U S  Air Force

contest now said by a senior U S  military official to be
potentially worth as much as  50 billion  
 Shipments of arms sold in previous years fell in 2008 to
3 17 billion euros from 4 6 billion in 2007  but the figures are
not final because of bureaucratic delays in compiling data

 PARIS  Sept 28  Reuters    Defence deals with Brazil 
Morocco and Saudi Arabia pushed French arms sales up 13 percent
last year to their highest level since 2000  the government said
on Monday  highlighting efforts by Paris to capture new markets 
 President Nicolas Sarkozy has launched a drive to secure new
business for 50 000 high tech workers directly or indirectly
employed in France s arms industry and to try to arrest a dearth
of export orders for France s multi role Rafale combat jet 
 French companies took 6 6 billion euros   9 7 billion  in
new orders last year  strengthening France s grip on fourth
place in the league table of global arms exporters behind the
United States  Britain and Russia  the defence ministry said 
 Contract wins included France s share of aerospace deals
with Brazil and Saudi Arabia secured by Franco German Spanish
group EADS and a frigate contract with Morocco that will boost
privatised French electronics group Thales 
 France has about 7 percent of the global arms market  which
is shifting away from a heavy reliance on the Middle East 
 Earlier this month  Sarkozy led an arms export delegation to
Brazil  which has a deal in the pipeline to buy four French
submarines on top of 50 EC725 Super Cougar helicopters it
ordered from EADS subsidiary Eurocopter last year 
  We are getting away from the classic idea that France only
exports to the Middle East  and we are doing what is necessary
to respond to the needs of Europe  Asia and Latin America  
defence ministry spokesman Laurent Teisseire told a news
briefing 
 Brazil is also weighing up whether to buy French Rafale
warplanes  built by Dassault Aviation 
 Latin America s largest country has signed a strategic
defence alliance with France  and the government has expressed
preference for Dassault s Rafale plane over competing models
from Boeing and Sweden s Saab 
 But Brazil s air force last week extended until Oct  2 a
deadline for companies to present improved bids 
 Brazil is seeking a generous technology transfer offer and
local assembly as part of a contract to buy 36 jet fighters  The
deal could eventually rise to more than 100 aircraft  
 
 BARGAINING CHIP
 The contest illustrates how buyers are increasingly driving
hard bargains in exchange for lucrative contracts as Western
companies face mostly stagnant defence spending at home 
  The global financial crisis is held up as a useful
bargaining chip   said Paul Holtom  a senior official at the 
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  a thinktank on
the global arms business 
  In Brazil  France has shown that it is willing to transfer
a lot of technology  it is a case where buyers do not just want
off the shelf equipment but to a great extent the blueprints  
 The U S  and Sweden have both said they would also be able
to meet Brazil s technology transfer requirements 
 Last year s jump in export orders came after Paris saw arms
sales come under pressure for much of the decade as French arms
salesmen struggled to repeat the success of Dassault s previous
generation of Mirage warplanes

113851,335366,NOC,Airbus reaffirms A400M flight  reshuffles jobs,news,"PARIS  Oct 13  Reuters    Airbus reaffirmed plans to get the
delayed A400M military transport plane flying by the end of the
year as it announced a raft of management changes on Tuesday 
 The planemaker s military division said it had appointed a
new head of engineering as part of a shake up of positions by
the recently appointed head of Airbus Military  Domingo Urena 
 Miguel Angel Morell  the new head of engineering and
technology  was previously in charge of Airbus military
derivatives and is seen as a key player in efforts by parent
EADS to build and sell aerial refuelling tankers 
 The move comes as EADS  in partnership with Northrop Grumman
  faces a new  35 billion competition against Boeing to sell
mid air tankers to the U S  Air Force 
 Airbus Military is responsible for building both the A400M
military airlifter and the MRTT mid air refuelling tanker which
has been sold to countries including Britain and Australia 
 The maiden flight of the A400M has been delayed by almost
two years due to engine and software development problems 
forcing EADS to renegotiate the 20 billion euro contract with
the seven European NATO countries that first ordered the plane 
  Airbus Military is getting ready for some important
milestones such as the A400M first flight to take place by the
end of the year  the first A330 MRTT deliveries to operators in
Australia and the UK and the U S  tanker competition   the
company said in a statement 
 The previous engineering chief  Rafael Acedo  has been
appointed head of strategy  Airbus Military said in a statement 
 Jaime Perez Guerra  a former spokesman for Spanish airline
Iberia  was appointed head of communications 
 Spain clashed earlier this year with EADS over the sacking
of senior Spanish management officials and a reorganisation that
saw its military plane business integrated into Airbus instead
of remaining as a standalone EADS unit  industry sources say

Northrop Grumman ProspectsIn recent times  the importance of military aircraft in the U S  aerospace defense market has gained significant traction  This upside can be attributed to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features along with the inclusion of improved radar systems and the availability of advanced system engineering services  Being a prominent aircraft manufacturer  Northrop Grumman is benefiting from such crucial developments that are resulting in solid demand for combat jets Furthermore  the company s Aerospace Systems unit develops and designs military aviation aircraft  manned aircraft  autonomous systems and spacecraft  These product lines allow the division to receive a steady inflow of contracts from the Pentagon and the foreign allies of the United States  As a result  this segment has been witnessing solid top line growth  In the fourth quarter of 2018  the Aerospace Systems unit generated 6  revenue growth  with the Hawkeye jet being one of the contributors to its top line performance As the E 2D Hawkeye Aircraft is a significant defense program for the government of the United States  we can expect more contract inflows like the latest one in the near future  These  in turn  should further bolster the Aerospace segment s top line in coming days Last month  the U S  government proposed its fiscal 2020 defense budget that includes a spending plan of  57 7 billion on aircraft  a massive increase of 166  from the approved fiscal 2019 defense spending on aircraft  If approved  such spending provision should usher in more contracts for Northrop Grumman moving ahead Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have lost 21 8  in a year compared with the  s 3 7  decline Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119  and  164  in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northrop-grumman-wins-32b-deal-to-build-e2d-hawkeye-jet-200405883,200405883
113853,335368,NOC,Northrop Grumman  NOC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Northrop Grumman  NOC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 3  
Revenues are expected to be  8 32 billion  up 23 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman 
For Northrop Grumman  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northrop Grumman will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of  4 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 93  delivering a surprise of  10 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Northrop Grumman doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northrop-grumman-noc-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200407729,200407729
113854,335369,NOC,Why Northrop Grumman  NOC  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Northrop Grumman  NOC   which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This defense contractor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 30 57  
For the most recent quarter  Northrop Grumman was expected to post earnings of  4 45 per share  but it reported  4 93 per share instead  representing a surprise of 10 79   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 35 per share  while it actually produced  6 54 per share  a surprise of 50 34  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Northrop Grumman lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of  0 59  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

   Recession adds to challenge of cracking U S  defence deals
   Acquisitions seen key for access to U S  market
   U S  defence spending also under pressure with cuts expected
   Europeans led 73 percent of U S  defence acquisitions by value last year
 
 By Deepa Babington
 ROME  June 9  Reuters    European defence companies will step up their
frantic search for a slice of the U S  defence market    even if a new U S 
administration  spending cuts and a recession make an already difficult mission
harder still 
 The United States accounts for about half the world s defence spending and
has long attracted    and frustrated    European firms like Franco German EADS
and Italy s Finmeccanica which are eager for a foothold to spur their global
ambitions 
 But the dominance of U S  rivals has hampered them  a problem which analysts
say will be made worse by a more dove ish new U S  administration  planned cuts
to big ticket programmes and a rise in protectionist tendancies amid a global
recession 
  It has never been easy for European companies to break in to the U S 
market and it just got a whole lot harder   said Doug McVitie of Arran Aerospace
consultancy   The defence budget is not expanding like the  former U S 
President Ronald  Reagan Star Wars years and they won t allow foreigners
waltzing in  
 Analysts say that Europeans facing flat or lower defence spending at home
are unlikely to be deterred  making more joint ventures or acquisitions like
Finmeccanica s  4 billion purchase of U S  firm DRS Technologies last year
inevitable 
 European led acquisitions accounted for 37 percent of U S  defence sector
deals and more than 73 percent by value in 2008  as a weak dollar provided a
powerful incentive  according to a study by Jane s Industry Quarterly 
  If your domestic market is shrinking but your shareholders still expect
growth  that means looking at the United States    which is like a siren call
for the defence industry   said Guy Anderson  lead analyst at Jane s Information
Group 
  And to do business in America  you ve got to be in America  You ve got to
have a footprint  Acquisitions are going from nice to have to a necessity  
 The U S  defence budget for fiscal 2009 is set at  515 billion  excluding
further outlays for war in Iraq and Afghanistan 
 Even if spending stays flat  the intelligence  surveillance and
reconaissance segment promises exponential growth  and overlaps with the

 DIPPING ITS TOES
 Britain s BAE Systems    Europe s largest defence contractor that generates
over half its sales from the U S     could continue scouting for more deals as
could Finmeccanica  on a much smaller scale than the DRS buy  said Anderson 
 Finmeccanica has stuck to its U S  growth ambitions despite being penalised
by investors for paying a 27 percent share premium to buy DRS and then facing
cuts to the U S  presidential helicopter and C 27J cargo plane programs it is
involved in 
 Smaller British peer VT Group has already said it is planning an acquisition
spree in the fall and will bid for  3 billion worth of U S  contracts 
 But analysts say the European company most likely to strike the next big
U S  deal is France s Thales SA  which was eyeing DRS before Finmeccanica
snapped it up  
 It says it remains on the lookout for U S  acquisitions 
 It remains to be seen whether a change of industrial leadership makes it
harder to prise open U S  defence contracts 
 Privatised radar builder Alcatel Lucent has always been on a tight rein  but
the Franco U S  firm recently sold its 21 percent stake to Dassault Aviation 
which is seen as a company more closely associated with French sovereign
interests 
 Airbus parent EADS may struggle to pull off a big U S  deal despite
repeatedly stating its interest in the United States amid growing concerns of
being sidelined  said Anderson and McVitie 
  In the U S   EADS has repeatedly rushed to the water  dipped its toes and
run away   said McVitie 
  On the industrial level  they don t have the competence to get into the
U S  market but the bigger concern is that their shareholders don t want cash
reserves used on U S  acquisitions  
 An acquisition thought to be worth  1 billion was vetoed by the board last
year and the company has vowed to conserve cash 
 EADS is still hoping to wrest back a  35 billion refueling tanker contract
it won jointly with Northrop Grumman before the deal was cancelled after a
Boeing challenge 
 
 GETTING IN THE DOOR
 Not everyone is convinced European companies will succeed in their U S  bid
despite intense lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill 
 Though the Pentagon has yet to show a nationalistic streak in its buying
practices  Europeans face a much tougher sell at a time of contracting budgets
unless they offer a critical mission product  said Loren Thompson of U S  based
Lexington Institute 
  What tends to happen in the highly cyclical U S  defence market is that it
opens up when there s rapid expansion and holds back during a contraction  so
foreigners have a much greater difficulty getting in the door   said Thompson 
 But while trying to export to the United States may be virtually impossible 
buying a U S  company like DRS and maintaining U S  jobs there could overcome
protectionist concerns  said Anderson 
 More long term joint ventures could also be the order of the day to avoid
overpaying or getting into a price war with European peers  since linking with a
U S company can help override security or technology transfer worries  said
McVitie 
  There is no trend  what you ll get is probably a lot of one offs   he said 
 But what is clear is that if  a European company  wants to step up to be a
global player  they have to have access to the biggest market in the world  ",2009-06-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/arms-trade-u.s.-siren-call-irresistible-for-europe-arms-makers-61303,61303

sterling
   Expects high single digit revenue growth over medium term
   Half year dividend up 10 percent at 1 48 pence a share
   COO Andy Stevens to become new chief executive
 
  Adds comments by CEO  analyst  more details  updates shares 
 By John Bowker
 LONDON  Aug 6  Reuters    British aerospace and defence
electronics group Cobham posted a big jump in its first half
profit on Thursday and said it would continue its acquisition
strategy  while naming Chief Operating Officer Andy Stevens as
its new CEO 
 Underlying pretax profit in the first half of the year rose
32 percent to 141 million pounds   239 million   in line with
market expectations  on revenue up over 50 percent at 952
million pounds  boosted by a number of acquisitions including
the U S  electronics business M A COM which it bought last year
for  425 million 
 Cobham s shares  down 14 percent this year  were up 3 6
percent at 185 pence a share at 0853 GMT  valuing the company at
2 12 billion pounds 
 Chief Executive Allan Cook  who will be replaced by COO
Stevens when he retires at the end of the year  said  strategic
acquisitions  were still on the agenda despite a slowdown in its
deal rate in 2009 
  We are looking at deals right now  Size is not important   
we are looking for deals in high growth  high tech areas with
strong management   he told reporters 
 He added that a potential growth area for the group is the
cyberspace defence market  or internet security  where the
company is seeking to grow market share 
 
 MILITARY ROBUST
 Cobham said organic revenue growth was expected to be in the
high single digits over the medium term  while the first half
dividend was raised 10 percent to 1 48 pence a share 
The company  which in its infancy pioneered in flight
aircraft refuelling  said military and government work was
helping to offset a slump in its commercial business 
 Military and government organic revenue was up 7 percent 
while commercial fell 13 percent  
  Sales were relatively weak underlying  but that was more
than compensated for by better than expected margins   Evolution
analyst Nick Cunningham said in a note 
 Cobham added that Chairman David Turner would retire from
the company in 2010 after taking up a position in Australia 
 The company last week won a  2 4 billion  10 year contract
alongside partner Northrop Grumman to supply battlefield
communications equipment to the U S  army  but is also being
investigated by the U S  government over parts used in certain
military products

113874,335389,NOC,PREVIEW WTO to issue landmark aircraft industry ruling,news,"  WTO panel to give first ruling in Airbus  launch aid  case
   Investigation of rival Boeing to follow in months
   Verdict could set tone for negotiated US EU settlement
 
 By Laura MacInnis
 GENEVA  Sept 3  Reuters    World Trade Organisation judges
will rule on Friday for the first time on whether the European
Union handed out illegal subsidies to Airbus in a verdict that
could affect planemakers worldwide 
 The three member WTO panel is widely expected to agree with
complainant Washington that the billions of euros in  launch
aid  Airbus received to build the A380 and other top selling
planes was anti competitive and violated trade laws 
 Their findings  to be distributed to U S  and European
diplomats at about 1400 GMT  will set the markers for acceptable
government funding in civil aviation and also colour
trans Atlantic relations at a sensitive time for the global
economy and multilateral trade talks 
 It also stands to impact Airbus  strategy as it develops its
next airliner  the wide body A350 due in the next decade 
  This will likely be a fairly significant document   said
Brendan McGivern  a partner with the law firm White and Case in
Geneva  which has not been involved in either the Airbus case or
a counter suit by Brussels against U S  rival Boeing 
whose findings are due out in six months 
 Trade lawyers expect Washington to lose that parallel case 
That would leave both sides bruised as a result of the biggest
and most commercially significant arbitration in WTO history 
 The extent to which Airbus or Boeing come out cleaner than
the other in the twin preliminary rulings will affect the
dynamics of negotiations to settle their differences privately 
which both sides have said they eventually want 
 
 BUSINESS IMPACT
 Friday s preliminary Airbus report    expected to run to
1 000 pages or more    will not be made public for several
months to give both sides the chance to review it  WTO panels
virtually never change the substance of their reports before
they are circulated to the public as final versions 
 The WTO declined to speak about the size of the aircraft
dispute or the number of staff assigned to work on it   We never
comment on specific disputes   spokesman Keith Rockwell said 
 McGivern said the Airbus ruling would build on years of
litigation on aircraft subsidies between Canada s Bombardier and
Brazil s Embraer  companies that will be looking to the latest
WTO findings with interest 
 Upcoming industry players in China  Russia and Japan are
also expected to pore over the complex ruling to inform their
own decisions about how to finance their aircraft market
expansion 
  This is a make or break case because it will set the
standard for everyone who wants to be involved in free trade and
develop and export aircraft without tariffs   said Doug McVitie 
founder of the aerospace consultancy Arran Aerospace 
 Boeing spokesman Tim Neale also said the report should have
a direct impact on how planemakers do business 
  A strong  clear ruling on launch aid and other subsidies
not only will ensure a fair and level playing field for Boeing
and Airbus  but for all governments and companies that want to
compete in the global commercial airplane market   he said 
 Boeing claims Airbus got a cumulative boost of  205 billion
from advantageous loans and other perks from France  Germany 
Spain and Britain over two decades  giving it an unfair edge 
 Airbus says the loans were fair and claims in turn that
Boeing got illegal subsidies from U S  agencies including NASA
plus big tax breaks from several states  worth some  24 billion 
  It is hard to see an overall winner emerging this week   an
EU diplomat said   We also have to wait until the Boeing
decision to get a full picture  
 Years could pass before the WTO arbitration process runs its
full course and both sides are likely to appeal any decisions
that challenge the way they do business 
 Tensions from the aircraft dispute have raised concerns of a
trade war between Brussels and Washington  though White and
Case s McGivern said it was unlikely their  700 billion a year
commercial relationship would be put on the line 
  I think it would be an effort by both governments to try to
quarantine Boeing Airbus into its own discrete area and not have
it affect the broader trans Atlantic relationship   he said 
 Northrop Grumman  the third largest U S  weapons maker  said
this week the Airbus case should not be mixed in with broader
deals including a U S  tanker competition it is involved in
alongside Airbus 
 McVitie  a former Airbus executive  said he doubted either
side of the Boeing Airbus dispute would settle any time soon 
  They hate each other too much for that to happen  It is
like a divorce gone wrong  times one hundred   he said   I think
it is down to hubris now  I am right and you are wrong no matter
what anyone else says

113877,335392,NOC,Space Militarization Race Speeds Up Globally  Who Will Gain ,opinion,Next generation wars are likely to shift from the Earth to outer space  Weaponization of space or the arms race for the outer space is gradually picking up pace  On Mar 27  India became the fourth nation of the world with military space capabilities  The other three countries are the United States  Russia and China India s Mission ShaktiOn Mar 27  India conducted Mission Shakti  an anti satellite missile test  from Dr  A P J Abdul Kalam Island launch complex  This was a critical military mission carried out by India s Defense Research and Development Organization  DRDO  The anti satellite test was successful as a missile developed by indigenous technology hit a low orbit satellite of the country  The DRDO confirmed that the test achieved all objectives  The significance of the test is that India will now be able to intercept and destroy a satellite in outer space Global Pursuit of Space Weaponization   In February 2019  U S  Defense Intelligence Agency  DIA  published an extensive report about military expansion in space by China and Russia  The report revealed that China is conducting sophisticated satellite operations and could be testing on orbit dual use technologies for space missions The report also cited an instance when China destroyed a weather satellite in 2007 using an anti satellite missile  Therefore  U S  satellites used for navigation  early warnings and communication might be susceptible to attacks In October 2018  CNBC cited an U S  intelligence report that Russia is preparing for an anti satellite weapon that will be ready for warfare by 2022  It claimed it had a photograph of a never before seen missile on a Russian MiG 31 interceptor as proof The Trump administration is aggressively pursuing a new space based missile defense system  Given the geopolitical tensions between the United States and countries such as Russia and China that are developing space weapon systems  Pentagon s new defense technologies in space could be appropriate Last year  the U S  Congress approved  11 5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency  an increase of  3 6 billion  or 46   from the Trump administration s May 2017 initial budget request  In addition  the Congress provided  1 3 billion in extra funds for the purchase of additional interceptors for the Navy s Aegis missile defense program and the Army s Theater High Altitude Area Defense system In addition to Russia and China  threats from North Korea and Iran make it imperative to develop space

113912,335427,NOC,Bull Of The Day  Northrop Grumman,opinion,With an annual budget north of  4 4 trillion  The U S  is the largest single consumer of virtually everything it purchases  The defense portion of U S  expenditures naturally rises in time or war  but with conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan greatly reduced  had settled into a range between  560 and  600 billion annually during the second term of the Obama administration  As of 2016  the United States accounted for more than a third of global defense spending and it s been on the rise since then President Trump campaigned on a promise to  rebuild our depleted military  and in office  he s living up to that promise In August 2018  Trump signed into law the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act  committing  716 billion to defense spending during the fiscal year  Even when other budget consideration remain unresolved  Congress and the President have an easy time agreeing on defense spending Northrop Grumman Corporation  NYSE NOC  supplies a wide range of Military systems to the U S and also other countries  The business is broken down into four main categories   Aerospace Systems  Mission Systems  Technology Services and the newly acquired Innovation Systems In the Aerospace division  Northrop produces aircraft  spacecraft  high energy systems and microelectronics  Mission Systems makes military radar  sensors and related products  Technology Services works on the entire lifecycle of civil and defense platforms through a wide range of services  including logistics  security  network operations and integrated air and missile defense serving not only the U S government and other Sovereign nations  but also municipalities like the state of Virginia  Finally  Innovation Systems was borne from the acquisition of Orbital ATK and is a leader in space  defense and flight systems Defense stocks are also generally defensive stocks  providing stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall stock market  With a beta of 0 76  NOC shares tend to move considerably less than the broad markets  especially during times of turmoil  In fact  periods of armed conflict   which cause significant uncertainty for most stocks   are actually the best times for defense companies as nations expand their offensive capabilities and refresh depleted resources Another positive aspect of the defense sector is that these companies generally have an easier time passing along cost increases to their customers than other industrial companies  When rising steel  oil or labor costs increase the price of finished goods  ordinary consumers can much more easily choose to delay the purchase of an automobile or even a tractor  but the government can t necessarily put off defense purchases  Defense companies are also naturally resistant to trade wars and tariffs  because governments are unlikely to enact tariffs on goods and services of which they themselves are the purchasers Despite outstanding earning performance  Northrop Grumman shares declined in 2018  making the military and aerospace giant a legitimate value opportunity  NOC at an extremely attractive forward P E ratio of just 14 4X   lower than the industry average of 16 3X In their most recent earnings report released Thursday  NOC handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates of  4 45 share in earnings on  8 1B in revenues with  4 93 share in earnings and sales of  8 2B Analysts expect  19 08 share in earnings in 2019 and  19 56 in 2020  Both have been revised upward several times over the past quarter Northrup Grumman is a Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   The company also pays a 1 7  dividend  and has over  2 5B in Free Cash Flow to back it up  There s one more story that bodes well for the futures at Northrop Grumman  That defense budget bill signed in August also provided the framework for the development of an additional branch of the US military   the Space Force The establishment of the Space Force is likely to be a windfall for Northrup Grumman  It s a fair bet that a company with Northrop s expertise in the space sector would make it a natural choice for the goods and services the new division would require  Until we know more about the ultimate size and shape of the Space Corps  this is a non quantifiable wildcard  but one with the potential to create a strong tailwind for the company In an investing environment that includes all sorts of apparently hidden risks   trade wars  rising commodity prices  increased labor costs  etc   there are some companies that appear particularly well equipped to weather the storm  With the support of a Presidential administration devoted to increased defense spending  Northrop Grumman belongs in any well diversified portfolio  Looking for Stocks with

113936,335451,NOC,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Northrop Grumman  NOC ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Northrop Grumman  NOC   This company  which is in the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This defense contractor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 26 48  
For the most recent quarter  Northrop Grumman was expected to post earnings of  4 35 per share  but it reported  6 54 per share instead  representing a surprise of 50 34   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 83 per share  while it actually produced  3 93 per share  a surprise of 2 61  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Northrop Grumman lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of  2 02  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-northrop-grumman-noc-200379555,200379555

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for NOC  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system

Valuation is also important  so investors should note that NOC has a Forward P E ratio of 13 8 right now  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 14 18  so we one might conclude that NOC is trading at a discount comparatively 
It is also worth noting that NOC currently has a PEG ratio of 0 93  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Aerospace   Defense industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 32 as of yesterday s close

113939,335454,NOC,5 Stocks Riding High On Relative Price Strength To Buy Now,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid

Looking more specifically  NOC belongs to the Aerospace   Defense industry  a group that includes 13 individual stocks and currently sits at  102 in the Zacks Industry Rank  Stocks in this group have gained about 12 06  so far this year  so NOC is slightly underperforming its industry this group in terms of year to date returns 
Investors with an interest in Aerospace stocks should continue to track NOC  The stock will be looking to continue its solid performance ",2019-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-northrop-grumman-noc-outperforming-other-aerospace-stocks-this-year-200377606,200377606
113954,335469,NOC,Northrop Grumman  NOC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Northrop Grumman  NOC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  56  
Revenues are expected to be  8 11 billion  up 22 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7 73  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman 
For Northrop Grumman  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northrop Grumman will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of  4 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  6 54  delivering a surprise of  50 34  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Northrop Grumman doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northrop-grumman-noc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200378918,200378918
113963,335478,NOC,Did The 5 Best Defensive Stocks Just Become Offensive  ,opinion,"Introduction
Nothing clears the pallet of a diehard value investor better than a good old fashioned bear market  In the calendar year 2018   and especially December 2018   we were given what I would call a bear market  However  not all bear markets are the same  Sometimes bear markets occur because of a bad economic scenario such as a recession  But that was not the case in 2018  In fact  I could argue that 2018 was a great year for the market and a great year for many business enterprises  In my view  the 2018 bear market is the best kind of all 
Many great businesses became overvalued as we entered the 2018 calendar year  Consequently  from a value investor s perspective  many great businesses were not great investments because of excessive valuation  This was especially true with the aerospace and defense subsectors  Moreover  excessively high valuations that started manifesting in 2016 were the exact antithesis of excessively low valuations that we experienced coming out of the great recession of 2008  To summarize  we went from ridiculous undervaluation to unjustified overvaluation almost equally over the course of the last decade  In other words  five undervalued years brought us five overvalued years 
Furthermore  2018 has potentially delivered the opportunity to invest in a good industry with many excellent companies at valuations that once again makes sense  Therefore  as a twist on the old adage   the best defense is a good offense    I offer these five best Aerospace and Defense stocks as attractive offensive research candidates for double digit future returns and above average growing dividend streams  In other words  I believe these defense stocks are positioned to score a lot of performance points over the next 3 to 5 years

Summary and Conclusions
When stock prices are moving in dramatic fashion either to the upside or the downside  it is very difficult for most investors to see beyond the price action  These five top Aerospace and Defense companies presented in this article and the video represent quintessential examples  In each case  the price action of these five strong businesses was horrible in 2018  Consequently  most investors would refer to them as performance dogs over the calendar year 2018 
In contrast  I saw the performance of these five great businesses as spectacular in 2018  Earnings growth for each of these five aerospace and defense companies was phenomenal and each of these dividend growth stocks lived up to their names with above average dividend growth in 2018  In simple terms  each of these companies had great 2018 s from the perspective of operating results  The only problem that each of them was faced with was the excessive valuation that ran into a nervous marketplace 
Consequently  the drops in price were justified based on valuations that were higher than fundamentals indicated  However  I did not see this as a bad thing  Instead  I saw it as an opportunity to get offensive with defense stocks  Therefore  I offer each of these businesses as attractive research candidates  I believe they all provide exceptional total returns as a function of above average capital gains and dividend growth going forward

113977,335492,NOC,Why Northrop Grumman  NOC  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Northrop Grumman  NOC   This company  which is in the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This defense contractor has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 26 48  
For the most recent quarter  Northrop Grumman was expected to post earnings of  4 35 per share  but it reported  6 54 per share instead  representing a surprise of 50 34   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 83 per share  while it actually produced  3 93 per share  a surprise of 2 61  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Northrop Grumman  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Northrop Grumman currently has an Earnings ESP of  8 66   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 24  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

113992,335507,NOC,3 Post Midterm Buys,opinion,"Now that the election s over  it s time for us contrarians to get greedy 
And I ve got just the thing  3 hated buys we can use to rack up serious gains and dividends while the rest of the herd struggles to get its bearings 
Where do these 3 cash machines come from  The defense and infrastructure sectors 
Now you might see where I m coming from on infrastructure  Probably the one thing Republicans and Democrats agree on is that our ramshackle roads  bridges and power plants need a lot of work 
More on this  including a rock solid play for 6 5  dividends and  steady as she goes  upside  at the end of this article 
Before we get to that  though  let s talk defense  a sector that might surprise you given that the media regularly rolls out stories about Democrats  reluctance to goose the Pentagon budget 
Funny thing is  defense stocks crushed it during the Obama years  including from November 2008 to November 2010  when Democrats were elected to majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate  as well 
Defense Roars Under Obama  
And here s what s happened since Election Day 2016 
  And Trump
From this chart  you might be fooled into thinking defense stocks are too pricey now  And sure  some have gotten ahead of themselves  But the two I want to show you below are still bargains  giving us a rare second chance to jump in 
The Generals Always Get What They Want
If you ve been watching the news  and who hasn t    you may have seen President Trump call for a 5  spending cut across all departments  But even if defense gets lumped into that  as Barron s recently pointed out  only 21  of the department s budget goes to buying weapons  so procurement could be spared 
In fact  I ll go you one better  it will be spared  Because other countries  I m looking at you  China  are always experimenting with new tech  like hypersonic weapons  and America will always have to respond 
2 Unloved Innovators
All of this is good news for Northrop Grumman  NYSE NOC  and Raytheon  NYSE RTN  
This pair aren t your typical arms merchants  churning out old school tanks  trucks and planes for Uncle Sam and his friends 
They re basically tech stocks but they re actually cheaper than big tech names like  say  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   with each trading just below 16 times forward earnings 
Why do I say they re tech stocks  Take Northrop  Sure  it churns out military gear like the heavyweight A 10 Thunderbolt plane and the next gen B 21 bomber  But it also stakes a big part of its business on things like drones for military and research purposes  space launch systems and cybersecurity 
You may be wondering why I m excited about 2 stocks with puny current yields around 1 7   But as I ve written before  if you re investing for the long haul  it s dividend growth that matters as a surging payout is a critical share price driver 
And these 2 sport dividend histories that would make your typical holder of  say  the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  green with envy 
Financial Crisis Couldn t Dent These Payouts
Thanks to this massive growth  if you d bought Northrop 10 years ago  you d be yielding a fat 12  on your initial buy today  Raytheon  A tidy 7 3  
We can expect plenty more  even if defense spending flattens out for a bit  Northrop pays out just 39  of free cash flow  FCF  and 29  of earnings as dividends  with both well below my  safe zone  of around 50   Raytheon s payout growth is also locked in  at 53  of FCF and 39  of earnings 
Both firms also soundly beat expectations in the third quarter  And check out these sales and earnings trends

Take Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   which may indeed benefit if Trump and the Democrats  er  hammer out an infrastructure plan  Trouble is  CAT boasts a 5 year  beta  of 1 6  meaning it s 60  more volatile than the market 
Keep in mind that a stock with a beta of 1 largely moves in time with the market  Anything above is more volatile  below  less   NOC and RTN  for their part  sport betas of 0 83 and 0 84  respectively

Think You Can t Retire on Dividends Alone  It s Easy  Here s How 
If you want income from your portfolio now  the truth is  Raytheon and Northrop won t help you much  Don t get me wrong they re terrific companies  but you may need to wait 10 years  or more  for the payout on a buy you make today to reach 8  or higher 
UTG  It ll give you a 6 5  dividend now  a more diversified portfolio and payout growth  That makes it a much better deal

114010,335525,NOC,Use Driehaus Strategy To Pick These 5 Momentum Stocks,opinion,American businessman and fund manager  Richard Herman Driehaus developed an investment strategy based on the buy high and sell higher principle  This investment approach is ideal for investors having a tendency to take huge risk  Investors use this particular investment method to gain from momentum stocks  The success of this strategy helped Driehaus to make a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns A Brief Note on Driehaus  StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In keeping with his insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2   Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business    Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median  Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks    Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5   Positive EPS surprise indicates potential    Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks  High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend    Momentum Score equal to or less than B  Ideal for taking advantage of momentum with the highest probability of success  These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7 872 stocks to only 20 Here are five of the 20 stocks that passed the screen Johnson Outdoors Inc    NASDAQ JOUT   is a designer of outdoor equipment  diving  watercraft and marine electronics products  It has a Momentum

114046,335561,NOC,North Korea To Denuclearize  Are Defense Stocks In Trouble ,opinion,To everyone s surprise the first ever formal meeting between U S  President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un in Singapore was extremely successful  While the eco political consequence of signing the denuclearization agreement at this historical meeting was a constructive one  hinting at a peace regime across the Korean peninsula  it does not bode well for the U S  defense industry Major U S  defense contractors paid the price  witnessing a sudden downfall in their stocks on Tuesday  since a settlement of the long standing conflict between these two nations may lower demand for weaponries from these contractors Crux of the Denuclearization DealPresident Trump and Chairman Jong Un signed an agreement at yesterday s historical summit that aimed at averting any major military confrontation between the two nations  at least in the near term  The two primary aspects of the agreement were Kim s renewed commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump s promise to pull out thousands of troops stationed in South Korea While the minute details of the deal were not made public  in a press conference  Trump announced that as part of the deal America will end joint military drill with South Korea against North Korea and eventually withdraw troops from the Korean Peninsula Defense Stocks That Took a BeatingFrequent cross border altercations between the United States and North Korea were one of the primary driving forces behind defense stocks  rally last year  Indeed  major U S  defense contractors  especially the ones that manufacture high end missiles or offer missile surveillance services  hit all time highs  following the countering missile test war between these two nations Naturally  the signing of the denuclearization deal  hinting at easing of tensions between Pyongyang and Washington  sent the following defense stocks lower Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC   provides systems  products and solutions to government and commercial customers in the areas of aerospace  mission systems and technology services worldwide  Its cyber

the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines  It manufactures combat proven missile destroyer ships  missile submarines as well as tactical missile aerostructures  General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 The company s shares lost 1 6  following the announcement  Will the Deal Really Jeopardize Defense Growth While the signing of the denuclearization deal has adversely impacted defense stocks  the effect will wane over time  After all  United States  cross border tension with North Korea was not the sole driver of U S  defense stocks Factors like expansionary U S  budgetary amendments under Trump administration along with rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India have boosted investors  optimism in the U S  defense industry  Also  owing to regional tensions in the Middle East  U S  defense majors have been increasingly receiving contracts from countries like Qatar  Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  which are boosting international sales  In fact  the aforementioned defense primes have been witnessing upward earnings estimate revisions even before the U S North Korea tension escalated  thanks to intrinsic strength of their diverse product portfolio  Moreover  analysts are skeptical about the viability of the deal over the long term  This is because North Korea had made similar commitments in the past but continued to develop nuclear weapons  In fact  following the summit  Trump said that there is no surety that there will not be a reversal of situation in another six months or so  owing to which he may act against Jong Un  This keeps the doors open for defense majors to regain momentum  We believe signing of the deal is a small step toward maintaining peace between these two nations  Verification and monitoring will be necessary to ensure that North Korea has actually put down its nuclear weapons  For this  the U S  government will have to rely on its defense contractors  So  all s not lost for the U S  defense

Zions Bancorporation   ZION  rose steadily out of a consolidation in June last year  It has had several pullbacks along the way  the last one to the 100 day SMA  The reversal off of that pullback reached the prior high and failed again  pulling back to a higher low  From there it rose again to a new high  It has been consolidating over the prior high as support since  The RSI is strong and bullish with the MACD rising  Look for a break of the consolidation to participate

114066,335581,NOC,Lockheed Martin  LMT  Secures Navy Deal To Upgrade F 35 Jets,opinion,"Lockheed Martin Corp  s   NYSE LMT   Aeronautics business segment has secured a modification contract to upgrade F 35 Lightning II aircraft  Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by June 2021 
Valued at  20 million  the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command  Patuxent River  Maryland  Per the deal  the company will deliver additional radar upgrades for the Block 3F software integrated in the F 35 jets 
Notably  the project includes 58  of the work for the U S  Air Force and 42  for Marine Corps  Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement  Air Force and Marine Corps  will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth  TX 
F 35 Attributes
Lockheed Martin s F 35 Lightning II is a single seat  single engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft  which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility  fully fused sensor information  network enabled operations and advanced sustainment  Currently  three variants of F 35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U S  Air Force  Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries 
With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner  the F 35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors  Notably  Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC   rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low observable stealth technology to this program  BAE Systems    OTC BAESY   short takeoff and vertical landing experience  and air systems sustainment supported the jet s combat capabilities  Also  Pratt   Whitney  a unit of United Technologies   NYSE UTX    provided F 35s with the F135 propulsion system   the world s most powerful fighter engine 
Recent Developments
The F 35 program is Lockheed Martin s largest program  which generated 24  of its total net sales in first quarter of 2018  As of May 14  2018  the company delivered more than 290 F 35 jets to the United States and its allies 
However  critics have condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U S  government  It was only after President Trump s intervention  in February 2017  that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F 35 s cost significantly 
Now  the company s current cost saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F 35 project is expected to result in cost savings of  1 billion over a five year period  In sync with this  per a recent report by Lockheed Martin  it targets to reduce the cost of an F 35A to  80 million by 2020  with production enhancements 
Also  additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades  which were a part of this latest contract  will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program  Moreover  with the U S  government s current inventory objective of 2 456 F 35 aircraft coupled with its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets  in coming days  No doubt  Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F 35 program  which in turn  will surely boost its profit margin 
Price Movement
In a year s time  shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 13 2  compared with the broader  s increase of 38 4   The underperformance was most probably caused by the intense competition that the company faces domestically as well as internationally

114132,335647,NOC,Lockheed Martin Wins  211M Navy Deal To Upgrade F 35 Jets,opinion,"Lockheed Martin Corp  s   NYSE LMT   Aeronautics business segment recently won a contract for offering Block 4 1 common capabilities pre modernization efforts to support the preliminary design review of F 35 Lightning II jets  The deal will cater to the U S  Air Force and the nation s overseas partners 
Details of the Deal
Valued at  211 3 million  the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command  Patuxent River  Maryland  Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth  TX 
Fiscal 2018 research  development  test and evaluation  Air Force   and international partnership funds will be utilized to partially finance the task  The project is expected to be completed by July 2019 
F 35 Attributes
Lockheed Martin s F 35 Lightning II is a single seat  single engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft that comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility  fully fused sensor information  network enabled operations and advanced sustainment  In fact  three variants of F 35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U S  Air Force  Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries 
With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner  the F 35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors  While  Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC   rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low observable stealth technology to this program  BAE Systems    OTC BAESY   short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet s combat capabilities  Moreover  Pratt   Whitney  a unit of United Technologies   NYSE UTX    provided F 35s with the F135 propulsion system  which is the world s most powerful fighter engine 
Recent Developments
The F 35 program is Lockheed Martin s largest program  which generated 25  of its total net sales and 64  of Aeronautics division s net sales in 2017  Evidently  the company s top line grew 12  in the fourth quarter at its Aeronautics segment  primarily driven by the F 35 program 
Meanwhile  Lockheed Martin seems to be enjoying a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon each year and 2018 is no exception  Last month  the company won a modification contract worth  1 5 billion for the purchase of long lead material and parts related to low rate initial production  LRIP  of F 35 Lightning II air systems  Considering these contract wins  we expect the Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well 
Moreover  production of F 35 is expected to continue for many years  given the U S  government s current inventory objective of 2 456 aircraft for the Air Force  Marine Corps and Navy  commitments from the company s eight international partners and three international customers as well as expressions of interest from other countries 
Additionally  Trump recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of  21 7 billion on Aircraft  In particular  the These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin s F 35 program  which in turn are likely to boost the company s profit margin  Budget proposal hints at an increase in Lockheed Martin s F 35 Joint Strike Fighter program and has allotted  10 7 billion for procurement of 77 F 35 Joint Strike Fighters 
Price Movement             
In the past year  Lockheed Martin has gained about 27 9  compared with the broader  s rally of 47 2  The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services  both domestically and internationally

114291,335806,NOC,5 Large Cap Aerospace Stocks That Crushed The Market In 2017,opinion,"The year 2017 has been an overwhelming one for the U S  economy  courtesy of President Trump s policies that came up with many positive market movements  The fiscal 2018  FY18  budget proposal  in particular  along with a rising interest rate environment backed by improving economic backdrop as well as progress on tax reforms have helped the S P 500 index surge 20 1   so far this year 
Coming to the Aerospace sector  stocks in this space have been on a growth trajectory on anticipation of the new administration s favoritism toward huge defense spending  since last year when Trump became the President  This year also the sector maintained similar trends 
Impressively  stocks in the sector  a stand alone sector  have rallied 38 1  on a year to date basis  significantly outperforming the S P 500 index s 20 1  gain  Below we have discussed the major factors that have influenced the stocks in this sector  in recent times 

Positives That Drove Aerospace Stocks  FY18 Budget and North Korea Tiff
The FY18 defense budget reflected a 10  hike from the FY16 level  In fact  a favorable defense spending strategy endorsed by the U S  administration has been a primary force driving these stocks  In September 2017 the U S  Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act  NDAA   better known as the FY18 defense policy bill  worth roughly  700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump s budget request  It authorized an additional  8 5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland  regional and space missile defense  which is  630 million higher than the new administration s request 
Meanwhile  there s no denying that  while a slew of contract wins have been boosting defense stocks over the years  repeated counteractive missile tests conducted by the United States and North Korea have been instrumental in the sector s latest outperformance  In particular  following Trump s strong condemning of North Korea s hostile action  companies that either manufacture high end missiles or offer missile surveillance services like Northrop Grumman Corp    NYSE NOC   and Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN    gained substantially 
Additionally  an anticipated military action in the Korean peninsula and a recent wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies have bolstered the sector s performance  To fend off competition  Aerospace players are merging with their counterparts to restructure business models as well as expand their core operations and product lines  For example  United Technologies Corp   NYSE UTX  decided to take over Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL   Inc  for  30 billion this September  This mega deal is expected to create one of the world s largest aircraft equipment manufacturers 
In the same month  Northrop Grumman agreed to buy rocket maker Orbital ATK  Inc   for  9 2 billion  Post the deal  Northrop Grumman will benefit from Orbital s rocket motors  missiles and electro optical countermeasure product lines 
Challenges Exist Too
Like all sectors  the Aerospace space is faced with multiple headwinds  For instance  questions are still being raised on the FY18 budget and the viability of such high spending 
Workforce related issues like retaining aged workers along with employing graduates who lack technical acumen has been challenging the aerospace and defense industry  Per the Aviation Week   Space Technology 2017 Aerospace   Defense Workforce Study  approximately 60  of employees in this industry are over the age of 45 versus 44  in the overall U S  workforce  Moreover  various regulations imposed on international trade of defense equipment remain the major deterrents to the sector s growth 
Moreover  internationally many emerging nations are posing stiff competition to the U S  defense contractors  For instance  China is developing space technologies to block U S  military communications  per a report commissioned by a panel formed by Congress  Similarly  per a CNBC report  Russian defense officials have confirmed deploying radar imagery jammers and developing laser weapons to counter U S  intelligence and ballistic missile defense satellites 
Choosing the Winning Strategy
Considering all the aforementioned factors  we can say that Aerospace stocks exhibited a decent progress graph  so far this year  weathering all the headwinds  Notably  the stocks witnessed solid bottom line profitability and top line growth

114316,335831,NOC,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Northrop Grumman  Raytheon  Huntington Ingalls  General Dynamics And Lockheed Martin,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 20  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Aerospace   Defense  including Northrop Grumman Corp    NYSE NOC    Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN    Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII    General Dynamics Corp    NYSE GD   and Lockheed Martin Corp    NYSE LMT   Industry  Aerospace   Defense  Part 2Link  While President Donald Trump and North Korean president Kim Jong Un indulged in verbal blows over the past few months  the U S   industry has thrived  There s no denying that  while deal making activities have been historically boosting defense stocks  repeated counteractive missile tests conducted by these two nations have been vital to the broader Aerospace sector s Q3 outperformance On top of the possibility of military action in the Korean peninsula  a recent wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies has given this industry a lift In addition  Trump s fiscal 2018  FY 2018   America First Budget  has been another determinant of the defense stocks  solid gains  Impressively  through this proposal  the President not only repealed defense sequestration enacted by his predecessor in 2011  but also made a mark in American history by presenting the largest one year increase in the nation s fund for the Department of Defense  DoD  Also  other factors like Trump s new defense strategy for Afghanistan  recent cyber security threats that affected nations worldwide as well as sporadic attacks in European nations continued to boost the Aerospace sector as a whole Altogether  these factors have helped the United States to remain at the top when it comes to military expenditure  Notably  military spending consumes more than 50  of the U S  discretionary budget  way ahead of the second and third spot holders China and Russia  respectively Many of the defense majors in the nation are doing a decent job  propelled by the following strategies Frequent U S  North Korea Tiff  The now familiar geopolitical tension between North Korea and the United States is one of the major reasons why shares of the U S  defense contractors have surged multiple times in the recent past  Moreover  in response to Kim s fanatic military actions taken against the United States and threats to its ally Japan  Trump made the  fire and fury  comment  He strongly condemned Kim s hostile action  reflecting the U S   readiness to counter attack any time necessary and in turn  defense stocks rallied  In particular  companies that either manufacture high end missiles or offer missile surveillance services like Northrop Grumman Corp  and Raytheon Company gained the most While such cross border tensions hinting at the possibility of upcoming wars does not favor a nation s GDP growth  these act as forerunners for stock market surges  especially for stocks in the aerospace and defense industry  Recent Upside in Budget  On Sep 18  2017  the U S  Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act  NDAA   better known as the FY18 defense policy bill  worth roughly  700 billion that extensively surpassed President Trump s budget request  The bill provisioned  640 billion for the Pentagon s base budget and  60 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations  OCO  account  It authorized an additional  8 5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland  regional and space missile defense  which is  630 million higher than the Trump administration s request In addition  the bill includes  6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding  This would benefit the nation s prime shipbuilders like Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc  and General Dynamics Corp  The legislation also authorizes over  141 billion for military personnel costs  providing a 2 1  increase in pay for troops Moreover  the FY18 defense budget that Trump presented this March reflects a 10  hike from the FY16 level  With Trump being highly in favor of defense spending  these numbers have a huge chance of getting elevated in the coming days Foreign Military Sales  FMS   In addition to catering to a large domestic market  U S  defense majors are expanding their foreign markets rapidly  taking advantage of regional tensions prevailing in the Middle East  Such tensions include civil wars in Syria and Bahrain  the unrest in Iraq  Yemen and Libya  and Iran s strained relationship with the U S  over oil  Moreover  the recent vehicle attacks in London  Barcelona and Paris show that the developed nations of Europe have also failed to escape the scythe of terror Further  lack of regional arms control regulation has prompted Asian emerging nations like India and Japan to boost their arsenals  U S  being the top global arms exporter is seeing added arms imports by these foreign countries  This is giving U S  aerospace and defense business a big boost Of the recent FMS contracts  notable is the  3 8 billion worth deal that Lockheed Martin Corp  sealed with the Bahrain administration  in October  Per the deal  an arms package including Lockheed Martin s F 16 jets  upgrades  missiles and patrol boats  will be sold to the Bahrain Defense Force  Notably this deal got stalled last year  when Obama s administration disapproved it  citing Bahrain government s failure to demonstrate noticeable progress on human right issues In July  Lockheed Martin inked a landmark deal with Tata Advanced Systems Limited  TASL  to jointly manufacture the F 16 Block 70 fighter jets of the former in India  This came as a move to expand its foothold in the market of India  the world s largest military weapons importer  Surely  these FMS deals will boost the company s F 16 product line considerably  which has been suffering lately due to dearth of orders Notably  doubts were raised in relation to Trump s foreign defense policies during early days of his presidency  However  the U S  situation in terms of FMS deals seems to have only improved  under his rule Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks

114317,335832,NOC,3 Top Ranked Defense Stocks That Brokers Love ,opinion,"The U S  aerospace and defense industry has been grabbing investors  attention of late  Particularly with the Trump presidency  defense stocks have been on a growth trajectory  courtesy of the latest policies adopted by the new administration 
Cross border tension stemming from repeated missile tests of North Korea also provided impetus to these stocks  The rise in defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan  China and India has also been a booster 
Favorable Budgetary Allocations 
Trump unveiled Pentagon s fiscal 2018  FY 2018  budget proposal on Mar 16  2017 which reflected a total increase of  54 billion over the FY 2017 level  The proposed budget of  639 billion includes a base budget of  574 billion  reflecting a  52 billion increase over the FY 2017 level of  587 billion  This also includes  65 billion funding for Pentagon s overseas contingency operations  OCO  fund  higher than the FY 2017 level by  2 billion 
In September 2017  the U S  Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act  better known as the FY18 defense policy bill  worth roughly  700 billion  It authorized an additional  8 5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland  regional and space missile defense  which is  630 million higher than the Trump administration s request  The legislation also authorizes more than  141 billion for military personnel costs  providing a 2 1  increase in pay for troops 
Needless to say  such favorable budgetary allocations have boosted the performance of defense stocks lately 
Eye Catching Deals
New macro economic challenges along with rising competition have prompted defense players to restructure their business models as well as expand their product lines  One such example is the acquisition deal that United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX    inked this September  to take over Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL   Inc   for  30 billion 
In the same month  Northrop Grumman Corp  NYSE NOC    agreed to buy rocket maker Orbital ATK  Inc   for  9 2 billion  Such mega deals are expected to give birth to even bigger defense giants in this space  thereby strengthening the nation s security as large corporations like these team up with diverse products in their portfolio

Think bulldozers and rocket ships 
Most of us will never get a chance to captain either of those glorious  rigs  
But nothing can stop us from investing in them 
If you haven t noticed  Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT  and Northrop Grumman Corporation  NYSE NOC  are each sitting near all time highs 
So which company is more worthy of our investment dollars 
I asked my senior analysts to battle it out 
Your vote decides the winner 
Good luck  gentlemen 
Integral to Our Nation s Defense
If there is one military need that the United States requires above all else  it s missile defense 
Obama   like previous Democratic administrations   neglected and underfunded this initiative  They claimed that the  Star Wars  missile defense concept was a fantasy of President Reagan that couldn t work 
However  the recent activities of  Little Rocket Man  Kim Jong Un of North Korea  along with the rapid surge toward a nuclear capability in Iran  make missile defense in the U S  a crucial No  1 priority 
Otherwise  we may face the consequences in a few years when we ll be saying  Hasta la vista  Los Angeles  
Sure enough  the 2018 U S  defense budget has included an additional  20 billion beyond 2017 spending in this area 
And Northrop Grumman Corp  NYSE NOC   has the most to gain from the budget expansion  The company is a leader in both offensive and defensive missile technology 
It was largely responsible for a successful U S  missile defense test in May when the Pentagon shot down a mock intercontinental ballistic missile using a long range interceptor missile 
So the company stands to benefit greatly as that system is beefed up in the coming months 
Northrop Grumman has also received a preliminary contract to design and test a replacement for the entire U S  Minuteman missile fleet 
The company has grown earnings in each of the last five years and that growth is projected to continue 
At 23 times earnings  I expect the company to take maximum economic advantage of the next great U S  defense buildup 
Providing a Basic Human Need
As long as humans roam the earth  we ll need to build big  strong things to keep us alive and productive 
I m talking about buildings  roads  bridges  mines  you name it 
And thanks to heavy machinery  we can do it faster   and cheaper   than ever before 
Founded nearly a century ago in California  Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   is the world s largest maker of construction equipment 
The industrial giant boasts a current market value of  81 billion 
In the wake of the financial crisis  many construction projects were halted or shelved indefinitely around the world 
And as a result  Caterpillar suffered through several consecutive years of losses 
But thanks to steep economic recoveries in Latin America and Asia in 2016  Caterpillar has snapped its sales and earnings  recessions  to become one of the Dow Jones  best performers 
In fact  the company has beaten earnings estimates in seven of the last eight quarters 
And annual earnings are projected to rise by more than 80  over the next 12 months 
Better still  the company trades at 18 2 times forward earnings   a discount to the industry of 14  
The stock has soared on the stellar projections 
In the last two years  shares have gained a whopping 88  
That s nearly triple the rise of the Dow over the same period 
To be fair  the big knock on Caterpillar is that it sits on  25 billion in long term debt   most of which was incurred post recession 
But the company has paid down more than 40  of its debt from an all time peak of  41 billion in 2013 
And with improving fundamentals around the globe   and a  1 trillion infrastructure bill backed by the White House   Caterpillar s soaring stock has plenty of fuel to keep chugging

114371,335886,NOC,ETF Strategies To Benefit From North Korea Tensions,opinion,"North Korean tensions once again flared up after President Trump returned with his incendiary comments against the rouge nation   Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years  agreements made and massive amounts of money paid hasn t worked  agreements violated before the ink was dry  makings fools of U S  negotiators   Trump said in a pair of tweets 
And now  only one thing will work   This sparked off the possibility of  against North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un  In any case  several global leaders including Trump have long been vocal against North Korea s antagonistic activities 
Following North Korea s  nuclear test on Sep 3  the 15 member Security Council voted on a U S  drafted resolution and slammed the nation with a new round of sanctions on Sep 18  Former North Korean partners Russia and China also supported the  
The relation between Trump and North Korea soured so much that the latter s foreign minister indicated in late September that a tweet by Trump was considered  as a declaration of war on North Korea  and that Pyongyang will not step behind to take counter actions  as per   If this was not enough  it is  that North Korea has been fortifying defense on its east coast after U S  Air Force  were flown to the Korean peninsula 
Pyongyang is also planning to test a  which is deemed to reach the west coast of the United States  a Russian lawmaker was quoted as saying  after a recent visit to North Korea 
Against this backdrop  below we highlight a few ETF strategies that investors might have to face if a war begins between North Korea and the United States 
Bet on Defense
The higher the tension between North Korea and the United States  the more gainful it will be for defense stocks and ETFs  Shares of Raytheon  Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  and Northrop Grumman  NYSE NOC  are likely to benefit if North Korea tension escalates  So  play ETFs like PowerShares Aerospace   Defense ETF  and SPDR S P Aerospace   Defense ETF   LON XAR    read    
Be Sure to See a Gold Rally 
Gold is always viewed as a safe haven asset  Such geopolitical risks are likely to spur safe haven bids  which is why gold bullion may gain ahead  This makes SPDR Gold Shares  HK 2840    V GLD   and iShares Gold Trust   AX IAU   good bets  read    
Get Ready for a Treasury Spike 
U S  Treasury yields  though on an uptrend on the Fed policy tightening speculation  may slip ahead on a safe haven bid if any war takes place  This would benefit iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  ETF   V TLT   
Drive for Defensive ETFs
If volatility levels crop up  investors can target defensive ETFs like QuantShares U S  Market Neut Anti Beta  and AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF   read    
Japan Investing May Come Under Pressure 
Japan s government  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fully supports Trump on the North Korea issue   Since two missile launches by North Korea were close to Japan  the country s concerns are understandable  In September  a North Korean state agency threatened to    Japan by using nuclear weapons  So  if violence intensifies ahead  Japan investing may feel some pressure 
Plus  if geo political concerns rise  safe haven currency yen should also gain traction  This would hurt Japan ETFs like iShares MSCI Japan ETF  as most of underlying companies have greater foreign exposure and thus underperform in a rising yen environment 
South Korea  Another Likely Loser
South Korea is also under Kin Jong un s rage  The South Korea government also ordered officials to get ready for likely new threats  such as  and electro magnetic pulse  As per an article published on   a news research showed that a North Korea Nuclear attack on Tokyo and Seoul could kill 2 1 million people and injure 7 7 million  iShares MSCI South Korea Capped ETF  thus may be hurt if a battle ensues  read

 No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea   President Trump    The United States has great strength and patience  but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies  we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea  It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future

114515,336030,NOC,5 Defense Stocks Gain As North Korea Japan Tension Escalates,opinion,"Following fresh tensions over North Korea s fanatic militant activities  this time targeting Japan  majority of the U S  defense stocks moved north on Aug 30  Notably  North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan s Hokkaido island before crashing in to the sea 
This sudden move made investors skeptical owing to which major world market indices  at the onset of Aug 29 trading session  dipped  However  by the end of the day  the U S  stocks regained their footing 
The S P 500 ended the session by inching up 0 1   while both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0 3   Though investors were initially unnerved by the mounting tension due to the missile launch and Hurricane Harvey s devastation  the day eventually closed on a promising note  U S  administration s aggressive defense strategy probably saved the day for the stocks 
How Did North Korea Justify 
North Korea s President Kim Jong Un justified the move as an action to counter the United States and South Korean military drills  Per major media sources  Kim maintained that the missile launch was his first step of conducting military operations in the Pacific and more such actions can be expected  going forward

In response  a few hours after the attack on Japan  South Korea dropped bombs at the Taebaek Pilsung Firing Range in North Korea s Gangwon province  Through this South Korea exhibited its military strength to dent the opposition s confidence when needed 
Further  North Korea s missile attack on Japan  was severely criticized by the U S  President Trump  He sent a strong message to his Korean counterpart  saying  all options are on the table  indicating a possible counter missile launch in the near term

technical issues for the last few years  Additionally  it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project In this context  Lockheed Martin finally inked an  8 5 billion deal with Pentagon this February  Per the agreement  the company will deliver 90 F 35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump s intervention or to maintain management s earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6 7  Going forward  the company is likely to adopt a cost saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F 35 by 10   over the next few years  This  in turn  will result in cost savings of  1 billion over a five year period  In fact  we believe the recent contract win will enable Lockheed Martin to take a step toward achieving its goal  so that it could provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate Meanwhile  Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since it has reduced its price  Earlier this month  the company won a modification contract  worth 5 6 billion  to offer LRIP of the 11th lot of F 35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter  Again  it won a modification contract  worth  258 million  to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F 35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter Interestingly  with the U S  government expecting to spend approximately  400 billion in the upcoming decades to develop and purchase 2 443 F 35 jets  Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program  Additionally  the government might place larger orders  This  in turn  will boost the company s profits in the near term Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 18 8  in the last one year  underperforming the 33 3  rally of the  it belongs to  This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

114560,336075,NOC,Aerospace And Defense ETFs Soar Amid Rising North Korea Tensions ,opinion,"Defense stocks have been rising with escalation of tensions between the US and North Korea  while the broader stock rally has stalled  Raytheon     Lockheed Martin    and Northrop Grumman    hit record highs after President warned North Korea against making any more threats to the US 
Trump said North Korea faces  fire and fury like the world has never seen before  and the rogue nation responded by threatening to launch a missile strike on Guam 
The sentiment for Aerospace   Defense stocks improves with rising geopolitical tensions  They surged after US missile strikes on Syria   And  that is one of main reasons why these stocks performed well in the last few years  despite defense budget cuts in the US and Europe 
Many developing countries including India  UAE  Saudi Arabia and Brazil have increased their defense spending over the past few years  Of late  Japan and South Korea have also boosted their defense spending in response to increased military spending by China  Trump s budget proposals call for a boost in US defense spending  which would be positive for these stocks 
Most aerospace   defense companies reported excellent earnings for Q2 and have seen continued positive momentum in earnings estimates  Aerospace   Defense ETFs have significantly outperformed the broader market this year

	Buy rated Alphabet shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet Services over the last one year period  the stock is up  30 6  vs   22 1  gain for the sector  on the back of innovation and strategic acquisitions  while Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows  Its diversification strategy is also positive  but requires significant investment and involves uncertain payback periods  particularly since these efforts are at the cutting edge of technology 

	Alphabet has shown good execution to date  more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive  fast growing search market   You can      

	Shares of GlaxoSmithKline have gained more  11  year to date  marginally underperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which has gained  13 2  over the same period  However  Glaxo should continue to see strong performances from all of its business segments   Pharmaceuticals  Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare 

	The Zacks analyst likes Glaxo s efforts to develop its pipeline as well  Performance of new products as well as of those acquired from Novartis has been encouraging  However  persistent challenges like stiff competition  genericization and pricing pressure along with slowing growth in emerging markets have been affecting the company s performance  In particular  pricing dynamics and competitive pressure are hurting sales of its top selling drug Advair 

	Meanwhile  Advair is expected to face generic competition in the U S  soon which will further hurt sales  However  estimates have risen ahead of Glaxo s Q2 earnings release  The company has also recorded a string of positive earnings surprises in recent quarters   You can      

T Mobile  s shares have been strong performers lately   the stock is up  34 5  over the last 12 months  handily outperforming the Zacks National Wireless industry  down  12   and the broader Zacks Telecommunications Services industry  down  6 8    T Mobile US posted impressive second quarter 2017 financial results

	However  competitive and saturated wireless market and marketing costs of the low priced promotional plans are major headwinds  Also  it faces increased scrutiny in its working conditions  lawsuits and fines by regulatory authorities   You can      

	Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Northrop Grumman  NYSE         and CSX Corp  NASDAQ

114584,336099,NOC,Shareholder Yield  A Better Approach For Dividend Investors ,opinion," 0     Shareholder Yield  Have Dividends Fallen Out of Favor  4     Does Shareholder Yield Tilt Towards Value  5     What Are the Income Payouts For This Strategy  8     SYLD Overview  Weighting Method and Sector Breakdown 12     FYLD Overview  International Exposure 16     Emerging Markets  EYLD 18     What s In The Future For Cambria Investment Management 20     Episode Roundup  Dividend investing is an ever popular topic  and for most investors  it begins and ends with a look at how much a company pays out each year relative to its share price  However  this simplistic approach of only inspecting the dividend yield could be overlooking some key areas that are actually very important to consider 
Chief among these are considering other financial activities  such as share repurchases or debt retirement  and the impact these data points have as well  And  if you combine all of these together  you get a much more complete picture of a company s true yield prospects  in what is often referred to as  shareholder yield  
Why Shareholder Yield 
To explain how and why to use this concept in a bit greater detail  we have Meb Faber  the CIO of Cambria Investments to discuss the topic with us on this week s Dutram Report  Meb literally wrote a book on shareholder yield  so it is pretty safe to say he knows a thing or two about the concept and why it might often a more holistic approach for yield focused investors 
Meb goes over the main points of this strategy  how income investors might feel about the approach  and the ever increasing popularity of share buybacks these days  Meb also makes the case for why this technique might be worth investigating  and the importance of free cash flow to great outcomes too 
We then discuss the main way for investors to target this market in ETF form with the Shareholder Yield ETF  SYLD   and how this portfolio is constructed  Top holdings right now include Northrop Grumman  NOC   Green Dot  GDOT   and Southwest Airlines  LUV   but check out the podcast for additional information on how this actively managed portfolio is built and maintained 
The Rest of the Lineup
We also talk about how this strategy works internationally  There are some important considerations to keep in mind for a foreign approach  including which countries tend to be more well represented for this metric in their Foreign Shareholder Yield ETF  FYLD   and if there are enough quality companies in the emerging world when using this technique for their Emerging Market Shareholder Yield ETF  EYLD  too 
Finally  we also discuss two of Cambria s other funds  and what these might bring to the table  The company has a Tail Risk ETF  TAIL  which invests in out of the money put options to mitigate downside risks  while it also has a Core Equity ETF  CCOR  that uses options trading to produce capital appreciation  But check out the podcast for additional information on this duo  as well as the shareholder yield lineup from Cambria

18 F 35B aircraft for the Marine Corps  and eight F 35C aircraft for the Navy and Marine Corps Additionally  it includes financial support to previously awarded fiscal 2015 and 2016 aircraft contract

either forced by Trump s intervention or to keep management s earlier promise to cut down cost by 6 7  Going ahead  Lockheed Martin s management is likely to adopt a cost saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F 35 by 10   over the next couple of years  This  in turn  will result in cost savings of  1 billion over a five year period  In fact  we believe the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since it has reduced its price  Recently  Lockheed Martin won a modification contract  worth  258 million  to offer low rate initial production of the 10th lot of F 35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter Furthermore  with the U S  government expecting to spend approximately  400 billion in the upcoming decades to develop and purchase 2 443 F 35 jets  Lockheed Martin is trying its

stock was up about 12 1  in the last one year  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 26   This could be because the company faces intense competition for its broad portfolio of

The space is probably a lot bigger than you think too  Sure  most are familiar with companies like iRobot  IRBT   but the industry goes beyond vacuuming and pool cleaning robots at this point  In fact  many big name players are getting into the robotics world  and it looks to be a high growth area for quite some time

Investing in Robotics
Bill and I discuss the key growth areas of the robotics and automation world  as well as some of the top reasons for the greater push towards robotics as of late  including the prospect of rising wages  We also talk about how this industry may have reached a  critical mass  in recent years  and what this means for investors too 
We also look at what the hot areas of the robotics world are  and I get Studebaker s take on Bill Gates  recent commentary that we may have to consider taxing robots in the near future  We then investigate what is ahead for this industry  and why an index based approach might make sense in this high growth and higher risk corner of the market 
Index in Focus
The index is also the basis for the Robo Global Robotics   Automation Index ETF  ROBO   the most popular fund by assets to track the space in the ETF world  We dive into the underlying benchmark in this podcast and I investigate how securities are chosen and weighted for the index 
This is especially important when you take a first glance at the index components for the benchmark  as some companies that make their way into the benchmark include large and well known firms like Deere  DE  and Northrop Grumman  NOC  to name a few  We go over why these are in the index  as well as the wisdom behind including a number of semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia  NVDA   Qualcomm  QCOM   and Ambarella  AMBA  too 
We also talk about the significant foreign exposure in this index  and why Japanese companies account for such a large portion of the benchmark as well  Finally  we talk about the market cap breakdown for companies in this space  and what could be ahead for this growing area

114870,336385,NOC,Time To Buy Or Sell Defense Stocks ,opinion,"When the recent U S  election sent up a surprise Presidency  we got this old bull market to spring back to life 
Here are 3 key parts to the latest rally 
Number One  
A Republican President and Republican control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives means the chance of passing a spending bill is much higher  That led scores of covering analysts to raise EPS estimates on companies that can benefit   in particular from more Infrastructure or Defense spending  There may also be less regulation on the Health Care and Financial sectors 
Number Two  
Higher expected spending and lower taxes by the soon to be installed federal government has been the main driver behind recent bond investor transactions  They sold their U S  Treasuries to buy stocks or move to cash or alternatives  T bond selling pushed risk free federal government bond interest rates sharply higher  Remember  T bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions 
However  there is a bearish Number Three  
The Equity Market sky is not clear to the horizon  Respected market strategists have spoken up with meaningful concern  This fearless stock market looks to be underestimating the possibility of President Trump rattling risk markets during his 4 year term  He remains unpredictable 
There are big GDP growth negatives to higher long term bond rates  Think about the pace of house buying and the effects of a stronger U S  dollar  There are also negatives to less regulation  Recall the wonderful poorly regulated securitized mortgage markets in 2006 
The best Bull example in this recent phenomenon may be Defense stocks 
The 13 company strong Zacks Aerospace Defense industry has been bid up in recent trading  gratis the widely covered Trump rally  We can thank the ETF industry for the broad  ebullient share price pick up 
However  Industry EPS fundamentals help keep these shares aloft  too  The current Aerospace Defense Zacks Industry Rank comes in at a terrific  35 out of 265  rising  12 industry spots more in recent weeks  Covering analysts raised their estimates 40 times during this time period  with only 5 cutting estimates  That s the  Number One  Trump rally evidence I m talking about 
Should you buy now    Not If Zacks Valuation scores are too high on the given stock 
I say sell and take profits on the largest Defense players if they get poor Zacks Value scores like D  Once significant profit taking occurs  you might want to dip a toe in the water 
Bone up on the smaller less known Aerospace Defense players  Find one that looks relatively more attractive 
Here are 3 Zacks Top Ranked Defense stocks and their quantitative stories 
General Dynamics  GD  
This stock carries a Zacks  2 Rank  BUY   The shares are NOT attractive in terms of a long term Zacks VGM score  That comes in at a D  granted by a B in Zacks Value and a D in Zacks Growth  The forward P E is 17 59  Shares currently trade around  170 after a swift Trump election run up from around  150

Northrop Grumman  NYSE NOC  is a high tech defense company  It provides innovative solutions in systems integration  defense electronics and info tech for its U S  and international military  government and commercial customers  It serves as a prime contractor  principal subcontractor  team member or preferred supplier

This is a much smaller military service contractor  with  1 4 billion in market capitalization  6 analysts follow the stock  and 4 have raised their estimates recently  None have cut them  There is no annual dividend 
Unlike the big defense companies  this company can provide substantial EPS growth  2016 EPS has risen from  1 42 to  1 61 over the last 30 days   2017 EPS has risen too  from  2 03 to  2 12  The average of the last 4 EPS surprises has been a substantial at  23    The last EPS surprise was  37   The company reports again on March 2nd

114874,336389,NOC,Will Mattis Have An Impact On Stocks As Defense Secretary  ,opinion,"On Dec 1  President elect Donald Trump announced that retired marine general James Mattis was his choice for Secretary of Defense  Speaking at a rally in Cincinnati  OH  Trump said he was  the closest thing we have to General George Patton   Mattis will require a special waiver from Congress since he has yet to complete the seven years out of service necessary to be eligible for the position 
However  as a candidate who enjoys wide ranging support both within the military and on Capitol Hill  Mattis is likely to be confirmed largely unopposed  Known for his hawkish views  Mattis will have a strong impact on U S  defense policy  This is why it is necessary to examine whether his presence in the Trump administration will have a significant impact on defense stocks which have been on an upswing ever since election results were announced  
 Mad Dog  and his Methods
During his final years in service  Mattis was leading United States Central Command  However  his stint as head of military operations in the Middle East and South East Asia came to an end after the Obama administration thought that he had adopted a hardline approach on Iran  Mattis believes that Iran is the primary threat to lasting peace in the Middle East  in keeping with Trump s views  Additionally  his criticism of the last administration s methods while pursing the conflict in Iraq and Syria has made him a natural choice for Trump 
However  Mattis is at variance with the President elect on several issues  For instance  he believes that Trump s overtures toward Russia are unnecessary if not ill advised  Despite his tough stance on Iran  he believes that upholding the nuclear agreement would benefit the U S  He has also opposed Trump s position on torture  But for those who feel that Mattis will help moderate Trump s views  he still has enough points of agreement with the new administration to help facilitate his integration 
Trump s Impact on Defense Companies
When considering the importance of Mattis  selection it becomes necessary to note that like Trump  he has little administrative experience  Nor does the former general have any exposure to public life  A former senior military officer has said that he was a good choice but would require a deputy with keen knowledge of budget and procurement procedures 
Additionally  Trump s proposed defense spending program is at variance with his foreign policy views  The president elect envisions recalling U S  troops home and rich allies sharing a larger portion of the burden of expenditure 
However  when it comes to the armed forces  Trump is likely to step up expenditure by nearly  60 billion every year  The president elect would like to enlarge the size of both the army and the marines substantially which also requires a concurrent increase in spending on arms and other supplies  He also proposes that the air force have  at least 1 200 fighter aircraft   a hundred more than its current strength  Additionally  Trump calls for a navy with 350 ships which is near the far end of the size proposed by the National Defense Panel 
Most  if not all off these proposals are likely to meet with Mattis  approval  It is only on matters of deployment and strategy that he is likely to temper the president s influence  It seems that good times are likely to last for defense stocks in an era where rearmament could be the watchword 
Defense Stocks to Watch
Since election results were announced on Nov 8  the iShares US Aerospace   Defense  ITA  has gained 10 5   indicating the rising popularity of defense stocks  Both Clinton and Trump had urged in favor of substantial increases to the defense budget  This is probably why ITA has risen 21 7  year to date  Below we examine some of the key stocks which investors are likely to focus on in such a scenario

114901,336416,NOC,Lockheed Martin Clinches  1 2B FMS Deal For Korea s F 16,opinion,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp  s   NYSE LMT   Aeronautics business division has secured a foreign military sales  FMS  contract for upgrading Korean F 16 fighter jets  This deal comes from a sole source acquisition 
Valued at  1 2 billion  this contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center  Wright Patterson Air Force Base  OH  Work related to this deal will be carried out at Fort Worth  TX and is scheduled to be over by Nov 15  2025 
A Brief Note on F 16
Originally manufactured by General Dynamics Corp    NYSE GD    F 16 became part of Lockheed Martin after it acquired the former s aircraft manufacturing business  The combat proven F 16 falcon is a multi role fighter jet  which currently serves 28 nations  As an F 16 Original Equipment Manufacturer  OEM   Lockheed Martin is uniquely qualified to design  engineer  develop  integrate and sustain a complete F 16 weapons system to meet customer requirements 
Over the decades  the F 16 falcon has evolved from a day only lightweight jet to all weather multi role fighter  The latest and most advanced version   F 16V   is the 4th generation of the F 16 fleet  Its superiority over the earlier F 16 models lies in its advanced APG 83 AESA radar 
Notably  Northrop Grumman Corp  s   NYSE NOC   APG 83 radar provides F 16s with 5th generation fighter radar capabilities  which allow better detection and tracking ranges  multiple target track  high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar  SAR  maps for all environment precision strike  interleaved air to air and air to surface mode operations for improved situational awareness  operational effectiveness and survivability LOCKHEED MARTIN Price
 

   Our View
Lockheed Martin generates a substantial amount of its total sales from international customers  Notably  the company s primary tactical aircraft F 35 as well as F 16 and C130J jets contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
A quick look at the company s recent deal wins reveals three large international upgrade programs  which in turn will help outweigh the expected decline in F 16 production next year  per management  Moreover  the company expects organic growth of 3 5  this year  which will primarily be led by the strength in the Aeronautics segment  We believe these developments along with the aforementioned contract win will further bolster the company s revenues from Aeronautics division in days to come 
Zacks Rank   Other Key Picks
Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Another favorably ranked stock in the aerospace and defense sector is Engility Holdings  Inc    NYSE EGL    with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

5 Momentum Picks Based on Driehaus Strategy

	Richard Driehaus  a pioneer in momentum investing  came out with a strategy with high return prospects for investors not afraid of taking risks  The philosophy    buying high and selling higher    is the base of this strategy  Driehaus  proven high profitability strategy made him popular throughout the investment world  Several well known organizations including Barron recognized him as one of the top investors 

	Separately  famous investing institutions such as the American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  found that Driehaus  momentum strategy has the potential to offer healthy returns  According to AAII  the strategy generated returns of 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  against  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500 

Driehaus  Momentum Strategy

	After studying Driehaus  strategy thoroughly  AAII came to the conclusion that companies with impressive earnings growth rates and the potential to maintain the positive trend are its main focus  In addition to that  Driehaus gave precedence to those companies that have a solid track of beating expectations  Moreover  the strategy works better for longer time periods 

	Driehaus had said in an interview   That means buying stocks that have already had good moves and have high relative strength   that is  stocks in demand by other investors  I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around  

How to Apply the Strategy

	Based on Driehaus  approach  we have created a screen for picking solid momentum stocks  In it  we have added positive relative strength as an important criterion  Then  we have followed it up with the percentage 50 day moving average   which is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price by the 50 day moving average of month end price   Positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 

Screening Parameters 

	In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

	 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    

	  Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2  
	 Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business

	 High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend  

	  Momentum Score equal to or less than B

114933,336448,NOC,The One Chart You Need to See Before the Market Opens,opinion,"It s 2 o clock in the morning as I write  and the winds are howling outside  making it near impossible to sleep  Somehow that s strangely appropriate on election night  especially if you understand the implications of what I want to share with you right now 
But be warned  This isn t for everybody 
 just investors who want to make gobs of money 
Profits Trounce Politics Every Time
If you re one of millions of Americans who are worried sick that we re on the brink of political  economic  and financial chaos based on last night s outcome  you re not alone  I feel the angst  too 
This election was one of the most contentious in recorded history  Clinton and Trump pulled out all the stops in an incredible orgy of mudslinging  gossip mongering  and just plain old nastiness that has given pause to almost every investor I ve talked to 
Most people view this is a negative influence simply because it s tearing the country apart  but I think it ll prove to be one of the most significant opportunities of our lifetime 
Chaos always is 
Obviously  I don t want you to miss that   no  scratch that  I won t let you miss the huge profit potential being created as voting comes down to the wire 
Let me explain 
Prepare for Change  but Don t Fear It
Millions of investors are scared stiff when there s change in the air  Longing for the  good old days   they fear deviating from what they know because that means they ll have to change their ways 
Yet  that s actually not true 
The only change they ll have to make is in what they think they know 
That s where the big profits are hiding  and where 99 out of 100 investors go off the rails 
I joke with audiences around the world that   We re all born with common sense  It s just  bred  out of us as adults  
Chances are good that you already know this instinctively  I usually see a sea of heads nodding from stage when the irony of what I ve just said dawns on them 
Again  you re not alone  What s more  there is a logical explanation 
Humans are much more prone to stop reaching for the stars as we get older because we ve convinced ourselves that we  know better  
We can t help it   it s simply human nature  It s in our DNA 
Yet  what we want to be doing is flipping that around   at least when it comes to our money  anyway 
That s because history shows beyond any shadow of a doubt that the biggest opportunities are always created during periods of huge chaos  War  famine  political strife  financial crisis  it doesn t matter 
The key is learning to recognize that the angst that comes with each of these things is actually the signal you re looking for when it comes to lining up the huge profit potential you deserve  but which most investors will never have 
Fortunately  this isn t as difficult as you would think if you remember three  Total Wealth Principles  we talk about frequently 

Capital is a creative force that s constantly flowing forward
Money flows like water to where it s treated best
Success constantly replaces failure  and there s expansion each time it does

Now it s time for the fun part  and why I couldn t wait to share this with you 
I know what comes next based on 500 years of market history  And  now  so will you 
Profits 
Not some of the time  Not part of the time  Every time 
The following chart comes from Kieron Nutbrown  who is the former head of global macro trading at First State Investments in London  and I want to share it with you because it goes a long way towards putting current conditions in perspective 


I totally understand that you probably don t have 500 years to wait  I get that a lot whenever I share this chart or one like it that brings a much larger perspective to the table 
More often than not  though  that s usually code speak for risk management  and that s an entirely different subject 
What I want you to understand is that fear of uncertainty and change always creates opportunity   which is why you ve got to constantly look for it instead of trying to hide from it  like many investors are at the moment 
Keith follows these six Unstoppable Trends that have made people wealthy for centuries  and will continue to do so long into the future 

Demographics
Scarcity Allocation
Medicine
Energy
Technology
War  Terrorism  and Ugliness

There s a reason why we emphasize the Unstoppable Trends that form the bedrock of our approach  because they re driven by trillions of dollars that will not stop based on who s elected  or who s not 
Every dollar you re going to make for the next 10 years is on this list  Demographics  Scarcity Allocation  Medicine  Energy  Technology  and War Terrorism Ugliness 
Many of the best choices  including dozens of companies we ve talked about here  have already scorched the broader markets simply because they make  must have  products and services we cannot live without 
What s more  they will continue to do so often  moving directly against expectations everybody  knew  to be true  Only we ll know better 
Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN   Lockheed Martin Corp  NYSE LMT   and Northrop Grumman Corporation  NYSE NOC   for example  have all turned in triple digits over the past eight years   181   211   and 525   respectively   even though the bet was President Obama would eviscerate the military  and he s proven to be even more secretly hawkish than President Bush was overtly so 
Remember the 2010 Dodd Frank legislation that was supposed to rein in big banks 
On July 21  2010  President Obama signed the massive financial regulatory bill into law that I quickly dubbed  Dodd Frankenstein  with the idea that the onerous regulations would not prove to be the intended roadblock everybody thought  Instead  I counseled that they d prove to be some of the biggest profit creators of all time based  in large part  on the chart I ve just shared with you 
Big banks reported a combined  record setting  43 6 billion in profits just last quarter alone  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  has returned more than 97  with dividends reinvested versus only 3  from the S P 500 at a time when  again  everybody expected it to crater 
Things will be no different today 
We have a new president   and a new set of opportunities made all the more profitable by the simple fact that most people will be totally unprepared to deal with them 
And it s not just me saying so 
You ve got 500 years of market history on your side 
As always  I ll be with you every step of the way 
Probably just not at 2 o clock in the morning  if my wife has anything to say about it ",2016-11-09,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-one-chart-you-need-to-see-before-the-market-opens-today-200163619,200163619

114959,336474,NOC,Follow Driehaus  Rule   Pick These 5 Momentum Stocks,opinion,"Investors with a high risk appetite always look for a momentum strategy that can add to their portfolio returns  Momentum investing seeks to fulfill their objectives through the principle of  buying high and selling higher    Richard Driehaus  who is considered as one of the pioneers in this domain  built a portfolio by following the philosophy and the same succeeded in yielding robust returns  This success earned him several honors from the investment world  Barron honored him by including his name in its All Century Team  which also includes famous investors such as Peter Lynch and Bill Miller      
Separately  famous investing institutions such as the American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  found that Driehaus  momentum strategy has the potential to offer healthy returns  According to AAII  the strategy generated returns of 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  against  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Hence  one may apply Driehaus  momentum strategy to build a profitable portfolio 
The Strategy
After studying Driehaus  strategy thoroughly  AAII came to the conclusion that companies with impressive earnings growth rates and the potential to maintain the positive trend are its main focus  In addition to that  Driehaus gave precedence to those companies that have a solid track of beating expectations  Moreover  the strategy works better for longer time periods 
Driehaus had said in an interview   That means buying stocks that have already had good moves and have high relative strength   that is  stocks in demand by other investors  I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around  
How to Apply the Strategy
Based on Driehaus  approach  we have created a screen for picking solid momentum stocks  In it  we have added positive relative strength as an important criterion  Then  we have followed it up with the percentage 50 day moving average  which is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price by the 50 day moving average of month end price   Positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 
In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have only considered those stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  as well as a momentum score of  A   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential 
  Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see   
  Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2   Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business  
  Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median  Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5   Positive EPS surprise indicates potential  
  Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks  High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend  
  Momentum Score equal to A
 Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 14 
Here are five of the 14 stocks

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Follow Driehaus  Rule  Pick These 5 Momentum Stocks 

	Investors with a high risk appetite always look for a momentum strategy that can add to their portfolio returns  Momentum investing seeks to fulfill their objectives through the principle of  buying high and selling higher   Richard Driehaus  who is considered as one of the pioneers in this domain  built a portfolio by following the philosophy and the same succeeded in yielding robust returns  This success earned him several honors from the investment world  Barron honored him by including his name in its All Century Team  which also includes famous investors such as Peter Lynch and Bill Miller 

	Separately  famous investing institutions such as the American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  found that Driehaus  momentum strategy has the potential to offer healthy returns  According to AAII  the strategy generated returns of 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  against  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Hence  one may apply Driehaus  momentum strategy to build a profitable portfolio 

The Strategy

	After studying Driehaus  strategy thoroughly  AAII came to the conclusion that companies with impressive earnings growth rates and the potential to maintain the positive trend are its main focus  In addition to that  Driehaus gave precedence to those companies that have a solid track of beating expectations  Moreover  the strategy works better for longer time periods 

	Driehaus had said in an interview   That means buying stocks that have already had good moves and have high relative strength   that is  stocks in demand by other investors  I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around  

How to Apply the Strategy

	Based on Driehaus  approach  we have created a screen for picking solid momentum stocks  In it  we have added positive relative strength as an important criterion  Then  we have followed it up with the percentage 50 day moving average  which is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price by the 50 day moving average of month end price   Positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 

	In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have only considered those stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  as well as a momentum score of  A   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential 

  Zacks Rank equal to  1
	 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    

	  Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2  
	 Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business  

	  Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median 
	 Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks

	 Positive EPS surprise indicates potential  

	  Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks 
	 High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend

Prepare for President Hillary with These Stocks and ETFs

After her solid performance in the second presidential debate and the damage inflicted on Trump s campaign by his 2005 comments  Hillary Clinton s chances of becoming the next president have gone up substantially 
	According to CNN  a majority of voters watching the debate thought Hillary won the debate by 57  to 34   A new WSJ NBC poll says Clinton gained an 11 point lead over Trump  46  to 35   among likely voters  This poll was taken before Sunday s debate but after release of the tape  And NYT s election  suggests Clinton now has an 87  chance of winning the presidency 
	Things could still change in the coming weeks and investors should be prepared to position their portfolio for either outcome  Some time back we discussed stocks and ETFs that could benefit in a Trump presidency       So let s now discuss what could likely happen if Hillary wins the White House 
	The market has been closely watching the race and already priced in a Clinton victory as of now so I don t expect a huge rally but a moderate relief rally is likely as the election uncertainty has been clouding the outlook for stocks  Markets hate uncertainty and Trump s election would no doubt increase volatility Buy Infrastructure  Defense  Alternative Energy  Gun   Mexico Stocks
	Hillary has announced a  275 billion plan to improve US infrastructure over the next five years  She says   the heart of my plan will be the biggest investment in American infrastructure in decades  including establishing an infrastructure bank that will bring private sector dollars off the sidelines and put them to work there  Deere   NYSE      a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock could be a major beneficiary of higher infrastructure spending  Railroad stocks are also worth a look   See   
	Clinton has talked about lifting defense spending and ending defense sequester cuts  Take a look at defense stocks like Northrop Grumman   NYSE    or top ranked ETF iShares Aerospace   Defense ETF  NYSEARCA          
	She has also promised investing in innovations to counter cyber security threats  During the first presidential debate  she said   cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president   PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF  NYSEARCA           is a great way of gaining diversified exposure to this industry Smith   Wesson   NASDAQ      a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock could see a bounce as gun sales could soar in the wake of the threat of stricter gun laws  which Hillary would likely push for  She has emphasized that gun control is one of her top priorities 

Her win could also pressure oil stocks which have been rallying of late on hopes on an OPEC deal   Read

If Hillary Clinton Becomes President  Defense Stocks Could Win Big

Hillary Clinton has always embraced a strong defense platform  and it would be safe to say that she is more hawkish on national security in comparison to her peers 

Over the course of this election season  Clinton has collected the most money than any other candidate from contractors in the defense industry  According to    she has accepted at least  454 994 in campaign funds over a 14 month period ending this past February 

The reason for this high amount  Politico explains that Clinton s large defense related contributions could possibly be due to  donors at defense related companies betting that a Democrat is more likely to win the White House in the fall   or that  the Democratic Party s highest elected official   President Obama   has called for a  2 4 billion increase in defense spending for fiscal year 2017  

Defense Stance

During her time as Secretary of State  Clinton s track record suggests she would be more aggressive than President Obama when it comes to using military force  She advocated for the United States  intervention in Libya  pushed Obama to arm Syrian rebels in the fight against ISIS  and backed Israel 

While on the campaign trail  Clinton has said she plans on cracking down on ISIS  as well as holding China responsible in the ongoing territorial fight over the South China Sea  The Democratic frontrunner has yet to provide any specific defense strategies  but she has used certain phrases and themes during her campaign that give us a somewhat clearer picture 

On her campaign website s   Clinton promises to  ensure we are stronger at home    stick with our allies    embrace all the tools of American power   i e  to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons  and building a strong relationship between Americans and Cubans    be firm but wise with our rivals   or in other words   stand up  to Russian president Vladimir Putin and make sure China is held accountable  and  have a real plan for confronting terrorists  

Stocks to Watch

What does this mean for the defense industry  Well  in short  some pretty good things 

As a whole  the Aerospace Defense industry current sits in the bottom 42  of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank  but could potentially see a much needed boost if Clinton wins in November 

Clinton s commitment to making sure the U S  military is strong  modern  and sophisticated bodes well for defense contractors  as the need for more weapons means more business  Companies like Lockheed Martin    and Northrop Grumman Corp     could see sales of their F 35 stealth fighter jet and B 21 bomber  respectively  rise if Clinton takes office  Current Pentagon plans call for approximately  400 billion in spending on the F 35 and B 21 as the Air Force is looking to replace its aging bomber fleet 

Other defense companies like General Dynamics Corp       which makes Gulfstream jets  tanks  and warships  and is one of only two contactors in the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines  Raytheon Co       maker of a diversified line of military products like missiles  radars  and sensors  among others  and Orbital ATK Inc       which produces and delivers launch vehicles  and supplies ammunitions and related accessories to government agencies  could all too see an increase in valuation and in the number of contracts they receive 

Bottom Line

Investors in the defense industry won t have to worry too much about the results of the election  because even if Trump wins  the defense budget would likely see an increase as well  But Clinton is an obvious favorite among these companies  and under her administration  the industry would probably get a significant boost in research and spending dollars

115179,336694,NOC,Gold s Current Pullback Provides Attractive Opportunity,opinion,"First it was Stan Druckenmiller  now it s George Soros  Following billionaire former hedge fund manager Druckenmiller s announcement that gold was his family office fund s largest currency allocation  we learned last week that his old boss  billionaire investor George Soros  purchased a  264 million stake in Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   the world s largest gold producer  after liquidating  3 5 billion in U S  listed stocks  Additionally  he disclosed owning call options on a gold ETF 
Soros  investment can be held up as further proof that sentiment toward gold has decidedly shifted positive  following the challenging last three years 
London based precious metals consultancy Metals Focus just released its  in which the group calls an end to the gold bear market that began in late 2011  after the metal hit its all time high of  1 900 per ounce   We are optimistic about gold over the rest of this year and our projections see it peaking at  1 350 in the fourth quarter   the group writes  Global negative interest rate policy fears have reawakened investors  confidence in gold as a reliable currency and store of value 
The group adds   In the near term  there may well be some liquidations of tactical positions   This is to be expected  especially around the start of summer  based on historical precedent 
Will Gold Follow Its Short or Long Term Trading Pattern 
We ve noticed that mining companies which have deleveraged their balance sheets this year have been some of the biggest gainers  Barrick  now Soros s largest U S  listed allocation  started 18 months ago 
Glencore  OTC GLNCY   Teck Resources  NYSE TCK  and higher risk junior producers such as Gran Colombia Gold  OTC TPRFF  bounced off the canvas after being knocked down 
Gold equities always have a higher beta than bullion  Usually a  1 percent move translates into 2 to 3 percent in gold stocks 
Regardless of it being a bull or bear market  there are still fairly predictable intra year trends in the price of gold  Below is an updated composite chart of the metal s historical yearly patterns over the last five  15 and 30 years  courtesy of Moore Research 

In all periods  gold contracted in May to early summer  then rallied in anticipation of Ramadan this year beginning June 4 and India s festival of lights and wedding season  India has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world  and for at least 5 000 years they ve adhered to the tradition of giving gold as gifts during religious and other celebrations 
Predictably  the yellow metal has retreated somewhat this month  following its best start to a year in 30 years and its best ever first quarter for demand  As I told Daniela Cambone during last week s Gold Game Film  this pullback provides an attractive buying opportunity 
The five year period decoupled from the other two starting in mid autumn  but the annual losses in 2013  when the yellow metal    2014 and 2015 skewed the data  Metals Focus sees gold following its more typical trading pattern this year  possibly climbing to as high as  1 350 an ounce  
In the near term  gold is   possibly as early as next month s Federal Open Market Committee meeting  The metal fell to a three week low this week on hawkish Fed minutes  If the Fed ends up delaying a hike  it could give gold the chance to take off 
Analysts See a Possible 25 Percent Depreciation in China s Currency
One of the concerns the Fed has right now is the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi  In a special report  CLSA estimates it could fall as much as 25 percent before rebounding somewhat  Because the trade volume with China is so massive  the fear is that it could affect the U S  economy  
This would have many obvious negative consequences  For one  because China s oil contracts with the Middle East are denominated in renminbi  not dollars  Middle East suppliers would be hurt 
CLSA points to several winners  however  including investors  The devaluation could very well  represent the best opportunity to buy Chinese assets that investors have had since the financial crisis   the investment banking firm writes  China s materials sector  local exporting producers and mainland gold producers should also benefit  The renminbi will  inevitably  fall  CLSA says   irrespective of economic fundamentals  as a free market works out what it is worth  
It s little wonder then that  in the meantime  the country s consumption of gold has skyrocketed in recent years as it vies to become one of the world s key gold price makers   Remember  China just introduced a new   

In addition  it was reported last week that Chinese bank ICBC Standard just purchased one of Europe s largest gold vaults from Barclays  located in London  for  90 billion  This will help give the country greater control over gold transactions around the world  about  5 trillion of which are cleared in London every year 
Should They Stay or Should They Go  Likely to help gold this summer are geopolitical events  specifically the potential  Brexit  next month when U K  voters decide on whether to remain members of or leave the European Union 
Various analysts have warned that such an event could trigger a crisis with both the euro and pound  which might spread to other economies  A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey found  in fact  that the idea of a Brexit has risen to the top of global investors  worries  What s more  no consensus was reached during a meeting among G7 nations this past weekend on how to deal with fiscal policy  other than to take a  go your own way  approach 
In the past  gold has been used as a hedge against the risk of not only negative interest rates but also inflation 
High inflation might also be coming to the U S  thanks to the Labor Department s new regulation on overtime pay  which doubles the eligibility threshold from  23 660 a year to  47 476 a year  on condition that the worker puts in more than 40 hours a week  It s estimated that the ruling will affect 2 2 million retail and restaurant workers  among others 
President Barack Obama s heart is certainly in the right place by wanting to boost workers  wages  But it s important to be aware of the unintended consequences that have often accompanied such sweeping edicts throughout history  We could end up with rampant inflation as companies will have little choice but to raise prices to offset the increased expense 
Again  having part of your portfolio invested in gold and gold stocks  as much as 10 percent  could help counterbalance inflationary pressures on your wealth 
Defense Stocks Hit All Time Highs on Terrorism Jitters Global fears of terrorism persist  of course  with a Cairo bound EgyptAir flight crashing in the Mediterranean Sea last week  Although the cause of the crash is not clear at this point  officials have not ruled out terrorism  In light of this and other tragedies the attacks in Belgium  for instance defense and military stocks have made huge moves in recent weeks 
Shares of Northrop Grumman Corporation  NYSE NOC   Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN  and L 3 Communications Holdings Inc  NYSE LLL  all hit all time highs the week before last 
In a recent call  an analyst with Cornerstone Macro predicted that a presidential victory for Donald Trump would be good for defense stocks  as he s made promises to  rebuild  the military should he make it into the White House  It appears the market is already betting on such a win

115231,336746,NOC,NOC Stock  Had Incredible Run  Bulls May Still Have Steam,opinion,"Northrop Gruman NOC
The stock has had an incredible run higher and judging from the Fibonacci extension tool  the bulls may still have some steam to continue  The 2 0 Fibonacci target is roughly around  165  the bulls have exceeded the  160 level  which was the 1 618 Fibonacci target 
We can also see that  DMI is above  DMI on the daily time frame  so the bulls are still in predominant control of the price action over this duration  The ADX line is flat lined  which is reflective of the fact that the stock has been in a trading range between  140 and  150 for the bulk of the time over the past few months 
The weekly chart for NOC is simply amazing  Since mid October  the stock has only witnessed four weeks in which the bears outnumbered the bulls and managed to close the stock lower then its Monday open price  The stock has not closed below its 10 week moving average since then as well 
Caution is warranted if one is assuming long positions at current price levels  given the extent of the rise the stock has experienced since its mid October lows just under  120 a share ",2015-02-05,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/$noc-exceeds-$160-240932,240932

115233,336748,NOC,Retirees  Apply A Value Investing Strategy And Earn More Income,opinion,"Introduction
Value investing produces safe  powerful long term results  but it is often misunderstood  This is why most of the greatest investors that have ever lived have employed some form of value investing as an integral part of their overall stock investing strategy 
However  the term  concept or strategy called value investing does not necessarily universally apply  Like many financial terms and concepts  there are many nuances that pertain to the general concept of investing for value in common stocks 
On the other hand  there is some common ground that theoretically applies to all value investing approaches  At the core  value investors are looking for investment opportunities in companies that they believe the market is currently undervaluing 
Additionally  most value investing strategies are attempting to exploit disconnects that occasionally occur between a company s stock price and its true underlying fundamental value  This article will present value investing strategies that apply primarily to investing in dividend growth stocks  Although all value investing implies investing in a business below its true worth  the calculation of fair value can differ significantly between various types of common stocks  For example  a fast growing true growth stock will command a different level of fair valuation than a slower growing dividend paying company  Although the underlying principle of value applies to both  the calculation of fair value will be materially different  
Successful Value Investing Requires a Long Term View
An important attribute shared by most value investing approaches is the rational perspective of taking a long term view  This is critically important  because it is all too common that undervalued common stock investments do not tend to perform well over the short run  This is simply because  as a general rule  you will not find undervalued investment opportunities in popular stocks  companies  
Common sense dictates that stocks only tend to become undervalued when they are simultaneously unpopular  at least temporarily  It is generally this unpopularity that creates the short term discrepancy between fundamental value and stock price 
However  the greatest success derived from value investing happens when the company s stock price is dropping even when the fundamentals of the company continue to remain strong  Therefore  the key to implementing a profitable value investing transaction is to learn to focus on and trust the fundamentals supporting the business  In the same context  this further means adopting the conviction to not trust  and even the willingness to ignore poor short term price action 
Accomplished value investors understand that stock prices can lie  at least over the short run  But more importantly  accomplished value investors also understand that in the long run  fundamentals matter most  Consequently  successful value investing requires a level of patience that unfortunately many short term oriented investors do not possess  However  the rewards from investing in a truly undervalued stock can produce powerful long term returns for the rational value investor who is capable of engaging in intelligent patience  But even better yet  those powerful long term returns are generated at reduced levels of risk relative to other common stock investing strategies 
On the other hand  value investing does not eliminate all the risk or risks associated with common stock investing  But  if engaged in properly  value investing does significantly mitigate or reduce the risks to a more than acceptable level  Importantly  this last point also applies to investing in the same individual stock at different levels of valuation  In other words  if you overpay for even the best company  you thereby add a level of risk that is not innate to the fundamental strength of the business itself 
In contrast  by investing in the same company when it is undervalued will reduce the risk of owning it  and simultaneously add a turbo charger of sorts to your future long term results  The turbo charger I am alluding to refers to the tendency of stock prices that have disconnected from fundamental value to inevitably move back to alignment with intrinsic value in the long run  In other words  when a stock is overvalued  it will inevitably move back into alignment with its fundamental value  Unfortunately  the precise timing of that movement is unpredictable  and can take longer than many people expect  T
his principle can cause investors in overvalued stocks to lose capital long term  even when the company remains fundamentally strong  In contrast  when a stock is undervalued  it will also inevitably move back into alignment with its true worth in the long run  Again  the precise timing is unpredictable and can even take longer than many investors are willing to tolerate  Regardless  the value investor not only receives financial rewards from the fundamental strength and or growth produced by the company s business results  they also receive accelerated rewards from future P E ratio expansion  
Value Investors Care Deeply about Capital Appreciation and Total Return
There is a great misconception and even criticism that alleges that value investors do not care about capital appreciation or total return  Although it is true that accomplished value investors will ignore short term price volatility  losses   this does not mean that they don t care about making a profit  On the other hand  it does mean that they do not worry very much about short term price volatility  but only when they have determined through research that it is unjustified 
Accomplished value investors understand that long term investment results are functionally related to the success of the business behind the stock  Therefore  they focus more on fundamentals such as earnings  cash flows and dividends  if the company pays one  
As long as fundamentals are strong  they are confident that this strength will eventually be reflected in higher future stock values  Frankly  I have never seen a situation where that confidence was not justified in the long run  as long as fundamentals remain intact 
In summary  value investors care deeply about capital appreciation and total return  However  they are willing to wait patiently for it to happen as long as the fundamentals of the company they purchase remain solid  and better yet   continue to grow  But perhaps more to the point  value investors are not expecting poor long term returns when they invest in an undervalued stock  quite the contrary  Value investors expect outsized long term returns resulting from purchasing a stock at a bargain valuation  But best of all  they will get them as long as they are patient enough  
Northrop Grumman Corporation  N NOC  a Classic Example of Patience Rewarded
The following  looks at Northrop Grumman based on the important fundamentals earnings and dividends only since 2008  Just as it was for most publicly traded US corporations  Northrop Grumman produced a down earnings year in 2009  The Great Recession   However  it s important to point out a few critical factors 
First  the company was not losing money   in fact  remained highly profitable  Second  they remained profitable enough for management to have the confidence to raise their dividend by 8  in 2009  Additionally  a weak 2009 lead to an incredibly strong 2010 where earnings growth recovered 45  off of 2009 s low  From there  forward earnings growth for the next few years ranged from 5  to 7   However  the Budget Control Act of 2011 included slashing our country s defense budget  As I will illustrate in the next graphic  this generated a high level of pessimism about publicly traded companies in the defense industry s future  
Northrop Grumman Corp Earnings and Dividends Only
The end result was that the Great Recession followed by fears associated with a cutting of our defense budget lowered Northrop Grumman s traditional P E ratio valuation of 13 15 down to a P E ratio valuation of 9 or less  But here is where the value investor s required patience comes into play  Not only did Northrop Grumman s P E ratio shrink to 9 or below  it stayed there for more than 4 years running  This happened in spite of the fact that the company continued to produce solid earnings and dividend growth over that time  Consequently  Northrop Grumman s shareholders suffered with a  10 42 capital loss   13 81  capital depreciation  for the period May 30  2008 to January 31  2013  I chose May 30  2008 because it was a time when Northrop Grumman was trading at a fair value P E ratio of approximately 15  14 7   However  in concert with continuing earnings growth  Northrop Grumman raised their dividend at a compound average growth rate of approximately 9  over that same timeframe  Therefore  long term shareholders received  8 78 of dividend income per share that softened the blow of weak price action  Nevertheless  a total annualized rate of return of    47   was clearly disappointing up to that point  
Northrop Grumman 4 Years Weak Price Performance
Nevertheless  committed long term oriented value investors that were focused on fundamentals  earnings and dividends  were eventually rewarded  After long term Northrop Grumman shareholders suffered through more than 4 years of weak price action  things took a dramatic turn for the better starting in January 2013  From that point to current time  long term Northrop Grumman shareholders that trusted the company s continued fundamental strength achieved a total annualized rate of return in excess of 14   It is interesting to note that long term Northrop Grumman shareholders also earned total returns that were more than twice the S P 500 over that same timeframe  Dividend income was also approximately twice that of the S P 500  
Northrop Grumman Strong Long Term Total Returns 
This represents a classic example of the turbo charging effect I referenced above  Northrop Grumman s P E ratio more than doubled from 8 3 on January 31  2013 to its current blended P E ratio of approximately 19  Remarkably  Northrop Grumman s shareholders were rewarded with a total annualized rate of return of 48 55  from January 31  2013 to November 4  2015  This accelerated return resulted from the company s stock price inevitably moving back into alignment with fair value and then beyond  Clearly  patience predicated on the fundamental strength was richly rewarded

Defense Stocks  Undervaluation Resulting from Investor Pessimism
The principle of patience of being rewarded in the long run by investing in fundamentally healthy undervalued stocks is clearly revealed by what happened with leading companies in the defense industry since The Budget Control Act was passed in 2011  Clearly  investors were fearful that the fortunes of these companies were in dire straits  However  time has proven that those fears were generally overblown  Companies in the defense sector did experience a slowdown in earnings growth since 2011  However  the premiere companies in this sector remained profitable  and most importantly  continued to increase their dividends  Ironically  after suffering through a long period of undervaluation  I do believe that most companies in this sector have gone from deep undervaluation to moderate overvaluation currently  Lockheed Martin Corporation  N LMT  is a second example of the same principles of undervaluation in action as we saw with Northrop Grumman above

Understanding Valuation Bonus  Live Fully Functioning F A S T  Graphs  on General Dynamics
  I consider General Dynamics Corporation  N GD  one of the highest quality  if not the highest quality company in the aerospace and defense sector  It has an A  S P credit rating and a low debt to capital ratio of 20   Moreover  the company has raised its dividend for 24 consecutive years placing it one year away from entering the prestigious Dividend Champions status listing prepared by fellow Seeking Alpha author  
Additionally  General Dynamics represents a quintessential example of how a company s stock price tracks earnings over the long run  Since this article is focused on both the power and importance of the principle of valuation  I thought it would also be interesting to use it as a teaching tool on how value investing works  and how this principle can be applied to everyday investing strategies 
Therefore  as a bonus  I offer the following live fully functioning earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  on General Dynamics  In order to get maximum benefit from this exercise  I offer the following tips on how to utilize and navigate the live graph 
At the top of the graph there are orange rectangles representing different historical timeframes  For example  you can click on the orange rectangle 10Y and the graph will automatically draw a 10 calendar year graph on General Dynamics  Therefore  you can quickly move from one timeframe to the next and evaluate changes in earnings growth rates and historical normal P E ratio valuations over each respective timeframe 
There is also a scrollbar at the bottom of the graph that allows you to focus on any historical timeframe of your choosing  At the bottom of the graph there is a long orange rectangle that allows you to take the graph apart or rebuild it by simply clicking on any of the words  For example  if you click on the word  Price   monthly closing stock prices will be taken off of the graph and you can replace them by simply clicking on the word  Price  again 
You can do this with all of the items located in the orange rectangle  But most importantly as it relates to the thesis of this article  valuation  the graph also has a built in performance calculation feature  Simply point and click your mouse on any price point on the graph  the black line  until a red dot appears  Then simply move your mouse to any other price point on the graph and click it and a pop up will appear with the calculation of the performance over the timeframe you chose 
To erase the calculation  simply point and click on your second red dot and you will be ready to perform another calculation  Note  all these calculations are based on purchasing and holding one share of the company s stock  I suggest that the reader utilizes this calculation function feature in order to evaluate the effects that valuation has on long term performance  You can measure periods of time from high valuation to low valuation  when price is above the orange valuation reference line   from low valuation  when price is below the orange valuation reference line  to high valuation  etc  As you perform these calculations  notice the effect that various levels of valuation have on long term performance over time 
I hope you have fun performing these various calculation exercises  but more importantly  I hope they reveal and solidify the important effect that valuation has on long term returns  
General Dynamics Corporation  GD  Live Fully Functional FAST Graph The Same Principles Apply to Overvaluation But as a Mirror Image
Accomplished value investors possess the discipline to avoid investing in a stock when it s overvalued  as much or more than they appreciate the opportunity of investing in an undervalued company  The following earnings and price correlated graph on Medtronic  N MDT  illustrates the damaging effect that overvaluation has on long term returns  even when the company s operating performance is good  Additionally  a close examination of this example also illustrates how good performance can be when the same company is purchased at more attractive valuation levels  
Medtronic  MDT  Solid Earnings  Overvaluation  Poor ResultsLow Valuation Can Reward the Patient Value Investor Even When Fundamentals Are Weak
The principle of investing in a company when it is undervalued is a powerful strategy that can even be rewarding when investing in a weakening company  Although this is not an approach I recommend  as I will soon illustrate  investing in a weak company at attractive valuations supports the power and protection of the value investing strategy  However  before I do I would like to support and share some wisdom from legendary value investor Warren Buffett 

 It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price  

The point is that value investing works best when you do in fact get the opportunity of finding a wonderful company at a substantial discount to its intrinsic value  This principle applies to the examples I previously cited above 
However  with that said  you can in fact buy a fair company at a wonderful price and not lose money over the long run  Moreover  if valuation is low enough  you can even generate reasonably positive long term returns 
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc  N PFE  represents a case in point  After achieving significant growth  and a ridiculous level of overvaluation on its stock price up to 2004  the company entered a period of sustained low earnings growth rates  Since 2004 Pfizer has remained profitable  but has only been capable of growing earnings at the rather mediocre rate of 2 2  per annum  Consequently  Pfizer s share price fell approximately 60  by the end of February 2009  However  positive albeit weak earnings performance drove their stock price and its valuation to unjustified low levels 
On February 27  2009  Pfizer shares were trading at a mere P E ratio of 5 2  However  for the conservative dividend growth investor  especially those in retirement  matters became even worse  In 2009  Pfizer cut their dividend by 38  from  1 28 per share to   80 per share  and followed that with an additional 10  cut in 2010 from   80 per share to   72  A dividend cut is an unforgivable sin to most dividend growth investors  However  starting in 2011  Pfizer commenced raising their dividend again at an average rate that has exceeded 9  per annum 
Nevertheless  and in spite of weakening operating results and the dividend cut  had you purchased Pfizer on December 30  2005 when its P E ratio has fallen to a below intrinsic value of 11 5  and held on through thick and thin  your long term total annual return would have averaged 6 79   Interestingly  that rate of return would have essentially matched the S P 500 s return of 6 84  over that same time period  But even more interesting  Pfizer would have generated approximately twice as much dividend income as the S P 500 
To repeat and clarify  I am not in favor of investing in a company that was going through the situation like we saw with Pfizer  However  this does represent a clear example of the power of investing in stocks when they are undervalued relative to their fundamentals  even weakening fundamentals  
Pfizer Inc  PFE  Fair Company  Low Valuation  In order to drive home the true power  protection and advantage of investing in a stock at extremely low valuations  let s look at the returns that Pfizer shareholders would have enjoyed had they purchased Pfizer when its P E ratio had fallen to 5 2  Over that timeframe  this huge pharmaceutical company generated a long term rate of return exceeding 19  per annum  Of course  this is an extreme example that assumes the foresight to purchase at the bottom  which is rarely accomplished  On the other hand  it does illustrate the power and advantage of value investing  
Pfizer Inc   Fair Company  Wonderful Price
Investing In a Wonderful Business At a Low Valuation Is Even Better
Although I totally agree with Warren Buffett about investing in a wonderful business at a fair price  it s even better to invest in a wonderful business at a low valuation  AAA rated Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  is widely considered as one of the highest quality dividend growth stocks on the planet  And as such  it is very rare to find this blue chip trading at an attractive valuation   and even rarer to find it undervalued  However  the Great Recession presented that opportunity  and the long term results for those that took advantage would have been amazing  Value investing is a powerful and productive investment strategy indeed

Beware of Value Traps
The essence of value investing is identifying fundamentally strong companies that are trading below their intrinsic value  The key phrase in that last sentence is  identifying fundamentally strong companies   As previously stated  the key to implementing a successful value strategy is to focus more on fundamental strength than on stock price activity  especially in the short run  However  value investors are often admonished to beware of value traps  Those admonitions are often misguided because they are predicated on short run price volatility  however 
In my humble opinion  for a stock to be a true value trap  it has to be associated with real deteriorating fundamentals  The following represent 3 examples of what I would consider true value traps  In each case  I ran calculations from when the companies were trading at below average current price earnings ratios  However  what made these value traps  in my mind at least  was the severe and continued deterioration in fundamentals primarily represented by collapsing earnings  and in 2 of the examples drastic cuts in their dividends that followed 
I will let the graphic s speak for themselves  however  the primary principle here is that fundamentals were deteriorating in concert with stock price  A falling stock price onto itself does not represent a value trap  Instead  as illustrated with my previous examples  a falling stock price that occurs when fundamentals remain strong and attractive represents opportunity

Joy Global Inc  N JOY    Value Trap 
Avon Products Inc  N AVP  Value Trap 
The Advantage of Value Investing in Dividend Growth Stocks
To me  value investing into blue chip dividend growth stocks might be the most appropriate and advantageous utilization of this proven common stock investing approach  The advantage stems from the growing dividend income stream that pays the value investor to wait for eventual price appreciation  This is especially appropriate to retired investors whose primary objective is to earn a current and a growing future income stream 
Investing for income in retirement is almost by definition  most appropriately a long term approach and strategy  This works in concert with value investing because it works best when it is applied over the longer run 
Valuation oriented dividend growth investors are often criticized with refrains that goes something like this  What good does it do me to receive a dividend when I ve lost 2 years  worth of dividends from the price drop  To my way of thinking  everything I ve written thus far answers that question  However  there is an additional insight that is worth mentioning here 
A short term drop in the price of a stock represents an unrealized loss  This only turns into a realized loss if  in fact  you sell out of the position  In other words  a loss does not become a true loss until and unless it is actually taken  As I illustrated with many examples in this article  the advantage of applying value investing to dividend growth stocks comes from the growing dividend income stream that is paying you to wait for better prices 
If fundamentals remain strong  and even if they temporarily weaken a little bit  a truly undervalued stock will inevitably return to fair valuation  and once it gets in favor again  it often rises beyond fair value  I call this natural leverage  which I earlier referred to as turbo charging long term performance  
Summary and Conclusions
Value investing is a proven strategy and produces above average long term returns  However  it does require what I call intelligent patience  This simply means the willingness to wait for the price of a wonderful business to reward you in accordance with its underlying fundamental strength  It s much easier to exercise patience when you focus on fundamentals first and foremost 
Growing earnings and a rising dividend income stream are worth waiting for  At the end of the day  value investing is about focusing on earnings yield  The lower the price you pay for earnings  the more yield each dollar s worth of earnings provide you  In the long run  that tends to pay off handsomely with both a growing income stream  and eventually strong price performance 
In this Part 1  I primarily covered value investing as it applies to dividend paying stocks  In Part 2 I will turn my attention to applying value investing principles to high growth stocks  The underlying principle of valuation being supported by fundamentals holds true  However  due to the power of compounding  growth stocks can  and rightfully so  command higher valuations and still be considered attractive or even undervalued

115285,336800,NOC,Five Smart Money Dividend Stocks,opinion,Now and then it is nice to take a peek over the shoulder of a successful investor to see what their high conviction buys are  When you read a headline that  Warren Buffett is buying Company X   you re naturally inclined to do a little digging into Company X s financials  After all  if it s good enough for Buffett  it might be good enough for you You have to be careful with this line of thinking  of course  The SEC filings that disclose the holdings of large investors are generally pretty dated by the time we have access to them  For all we know  the conditions that made a guru buy a given stock may no longer be valid by the time we read about it  and there are no guarantees that they haven t already sold it  For these reasons  I tend to focus on larger holdings  the conviction buys that they are likely to hold onto for a while Today  I m going to look at one high conviction dividend stocks each from five well known superinvestors  My criteria is simple enough  the stock must be a significant holding in the guru s portfolio and it must pay a respectable dividend  We ll start with   Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway    has been accumulating shares of retail behemoth Wal Mart  WMT   and it s not hard to understand why  Wal Mart is exactly the kind of company that Buffett is famous for buying  It has a dominant position as the leading discount retailer in the world  It has competitive  moats  in its size and logistical efficiency that competitors have a hard time scaling  And naturally  it s attractively priced  Wal Mart trades for 14 times 2013 expected earnings and at 0 55 times sales  Its 2 10  dividend  while not exceptionally high  is growing at a nice clip  Wal Mart raised its dividend 9  last year and 20  the year before  Our next guru is   Einhorn is better known for some of his high profile short positions he even wrote a book about his short of business development company Allied Capital  Fooling Some of the People All of the Time but he is certainly not afraid to make large  concentrated long bets as well  As of his most recent filings  former high flyer Apple  AAPL  was his largest holding by a wide margin at fully 15  of Greenlight Capital s publicly traded long portfolio  It is debatable whether Apple should be considered a  dividend stock  given that the company only recently started paying a dividend and yields less than the broader S P 500  Still  given Apple s gargantuan  100 billion cash hoard and continued shareholder agitation  it is safe to assume the dividend will be rising in the years ahead   of Gotham Capital is one of my favorite gurus  His  Magic Formula  is one of the best stock screeners I have ever come across  and he gives away access to it for free  I ve stumbled across more great investment ideas than I can count from browsing his site  and I recommend that you give it a look  Greenblatt is heavily invested in defense firms these days  and one that caught my eye was Northrop Grumman Corporation  NOC   Northrop Grumman is not a  high conviction  pick of Greenblatt  per se  as its weighting is not materially higher than any of his other holdings  It is  however  a highly profitable company selling at a very attractive price  Northrop Grumman trades for just 9 times expected 2013 earnings and yields an impressive 3 3  in dividends  Next on the list is   Greenblatt s former partner at Gotham Capital and the principal of Pershing Square Capital Management  Ackman is an activist investor with a history of taking

115287,336802,NOC,Five Sinful Dividend Stocks,opinion,This is Part 2 of a two part series on  Naughty and Nice  dividend stocks In the last article  I gave you five socially responsible stock picks you could feel good about owning  Now  we re going in a very different direction as I ve got five delightfully naughty dividend paying stocks to consider First A ConfessionI love sin stocks and always have  Because they are politically incorrect  companies in the tobacco  alcohol and defense industries tend to trade at lower valuations and higher dividend yields than the broader market  In effect they are perpetual value stocks and investors with no qualms about investing in socially stigmatized companies benefit from that pricing model For a longer explanation on the virtues of being bad  see    As I ve written before   Not All Sin Stocks are Created Equal  and not all vice investments are strong dividend payers  But the following five stocks all pay current yields well in excess of the market average The SmokersI ll start with a sin stock standard  American tobacco giant Altria  MO   As the poster boy for Big Tobacco  Altria is probably the most hated company in history  If Altria were a movie character  it would be Darth Vader It also happens to be the most profitable investment in history  according to Jeremy Siegel s The Future for Investors  Dr  Siegel s calculation assumed the reinvestment of dividends  of course  And when you buy shares of Altria  you should accept that you are buying the stock specifically for its dividend because the company s business is in long term terminal decline  Cigarette smokers will continue to light up  but their ranks are not growing and cannot be expected to At current prices  Altria yields 4 70   This is a little lower than I would normally like to see for a tobacco stock  but it still makes Altria one of the highest yielding stocks in the S P 500 The Big GunsSome of the best values in the vice sphere are in the  merchant of death  category  and the next stock is one that I covered in  Five Smart Money Dividend Stocks  as a stock owned by Magic Formula guru Joel Greenblatt  defense and aerospace firm Northrop Grumman Corporation  NOC  Northrop Grumman makes the sort of toys you might expect to see in a James Bond movie  Its aerospace division sells hardware and systems to government agencies for use in various mission areas  including intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance  battle management  strike operations  electronic warfare  missile defense  earth observation and space exploration Northrop Grumman trades for just 9 times expected 2013 earnings and yields an impressive 3 3  in dividends Next on the list is one of Northrop Grumman s competitors  Raytheon Company  RTN   Raytheon offers integrated defense systems  including integrated air and missile defense  naval combat systems  and intelligence systems Raytheon is priced comparably to Northrop Grumman  trading for just 9 times earnings and yields 3 6  The entire defense sector is attractively priced at this time  and Northrop Grumman and Raytheon are two excellent dividend stocks Drink UpMoving down the list of all things naughty  we come to booze  And the single best play in the world of spirits is British based Diageo PLC  DEO   the largest and most diversified seller of premium alcoholic beverages in the world Diageo s brands include Johnnie Walker scotch  Smirnoff vodka  Baileys Irish Cream liqueur  Crown Royal Canadian whiskey  Captain Morgan rum  Jose Cuervo tequila and many  many others  The company has been a long time favorite of the Sizemore Investment Letter for its exposure to emerging markets  Diageo already gets 40  of its revenues from emerging markets  which increases each year Diageo is a current constituent of the Mergent International Dividend Achievers Index  meaning the stock has a long history of raising its dividend  and currently yields a respectable 2 0  SudsAnother stock in the alcohol sphere I like is Dutch mega brewer Heineken NV    The global beer market is dominated by the Big 4    Anheuser Busch InBev  BUD   Heineken  SABMiller    and Carlsberg    though beer sales have been stagnant in the company s core American and European markets  Sales are booming in emerging markets  however  and the Big 4 continue to gobble up small local brands with reckless abandon Heineken is unique among Western multinationals in that it is not only a great indirect play on rising incomes in the developing world  but it is a great play on the development of Africa in particular  Heineken already gets roughly a quarter of its revenues from Africa  and this percentage will only rise over time as the African middle class grows and develops Heineken pays a decent dividend of 2 1  So there we have it  Investors looking to build an income portfolio have their choice of both naughty and nice dividend paying stocks  I recommend they take their pick of both

115293,336808,NOC,Northrup Grumman  Volume Pushes New Annual High,opinion,Northrop Grumman Corporation  NOC  provides products  services  and integrated solutions in aerospace  electronics  information and services to its global customers  As of December 31  2011  the Company operated in four segments  Aerospace Systems  Electronic Systems  Information Systems and Technical Services  This is an almost identical post to the one I wrote on LMT a couple of days ago  Rising vol to new highs and earnings vol priced below the front  You can read the LMT post here  I found NOC using a real time custom scan  This one hunts for elevated vols  Custom Scan Details Stock Price GTE  5  IV30  GTE 20 IV30  Percentile GTE 80 Average Option Volume GTE 1 200 The goal with this scan is to identify short term implied vol  IV30   that is elevated to its own annual history  at least in the 80th percentile   I m also looking for a reasonable amount of liquidity in the options  thus the minimum average option volume   and I want a minimum vol level so I don t pick up any boring ETF s  or whatever   The stock price requirement helps me identify names that have enough strike prices to trade or spread  The six month NOC Charts Tab is included  below   The top portion is the stock price the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side we can see a relatively quiet period with the price moving from  61 73 to now just over  67 in half a year  The 52 wk range in stock price is   55 38   70 65  But this is a vol note  so let s focus on the IV30   I have included the six month implied chart in isolation  below The trend is pretty obvious    up  The vol was trading below 14  in late summer and is now nearly twice that level  The 52 wk range in IV30  is  13 39   24 74    putting the current level well into new annual high territory The story gets even more interesting when we look to the Skew Tab  below We can see the shape is normal and quite pretty really  but note how Jan is elevated to Feb  This is odd because the next earnings release for NOC should be in the Feb expiry but outside of Jan  In other words  the vol is topping an annual high today  but the earnings vol is not following suit Finally  let s look to the Options Tab  below  Across the top we can see the monthly vols are priced to 27 46  for Jan and 25 10  for Feb  This automatically triggers a thought in my mind to analyze a calendar spread of some sort  Then again  with the implied reaching an annual high right now  selling the font could be a disaster  This will be a very interesting one to watch unfold for sure  I ll quote myself from the LMT post   If this is fiscal cliff related watch for climbing vol and then a potential vol crush after the news  Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation Images provided by Livevol ,2012-12-30,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northrup-grumman:-volume-pushes-new-annual-high-149107,149107
115296,336811,NOC,Weighing The Week Ahead  Hope For A Budget Compromise ,opinion,Sometimes the week ahead  despite our relentless focus on markets  brings policy issues to the fore  Such was the case during the fiscal cliff countdown  and it is happening again  I have strongly advised that investors remain agnostic about politics  It is more profitable to accept the reality of current policy  Figure out what investment is best for the times  For this reason I rarely opine about policy  I often identify what is most likely to happen  and which outcomes are market friendly  In this spirit I suggest that investors should be monitoring the slow and laborious process toward a compromise that will avoid the impending spending sequestration  Until now I have refrained from writing about this issue  Why this week  Two things  It will be a light week for other economic data  leaving plenty of media space and time to fill  My mission in the WTWA series is to forecast what will be on the agenda The State of the Union speech might offer some real hints    if you know what to look for Background on the Sequestration Issue  Sequestration was adopted originally as part of the resolution to the 2011 debt ceiling impasse  The Budget Control Act of 2011  Congress is great at misleading names for bills   created a   This  SuperCommittee  was evenly balanced  and failed to reach a bipartisan agreement within the time limit  Congress has acted to delay the implementation of these cuts  most recently as part of the so called  fiscal cliff  resolution  D Day is now March 1st  but the effects are already being felt in many ways  While some now seem willing to allow sequestration provisions to take effect  no one really believes that the meat axe approach is the preferred solution to U S  budget problems  In fact  the original intent was exactly the opposite  The issue is important  The automatic cuts will reduce expected economic growth by 0 7  according to the   This will have a related effect on expected corporate earnings  The timing is important  since Congress is about to go on an extended  President s Day Recess  starting Friday  Background on the State of the Union  President Obama s second inaugural address was widely perceived as aggressive and partisan  The tradition for the State of the Union Address is different  While it lays out an agenda  it often strikes some bi partisan and patriotic themes  It will and should be closely watched as a hint for the future  There are some   but even these may be trial balloons  I have some thoughts on what to watch for in the SOTU speech which I ll report in the conclusion  First  let us do our regular update of last week s news and data  Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead  There are many good lists of upcoming events  One source I especially like is the weekly post from the WSJ s  There is a nice combination of data  speeches  and other events   In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios  This is unlike my other articles  where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context  Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market  Last Week s Data Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good This was a generally positive week  both for data and for earnings  The outlook for profit margins is promising in the eyes of most analysts   show the consensus take and highlights the dissent from Goldman Sachs  Even that viewpoint is better than the common bearish assumptions of rapid mean reversion  Here is the key chart Nouriel Roubini is  optimistic  on stocks   via  at AdvisorOne   We always admire those who use facts  changing forecasts as indicated  For those who will call this a contrary indicator  you need a reality check  That interpretation guarantees that you will never change your mind The trade deficit improved   a lot  This certainly flips the sign on the preliminary Q412 GDP report  and may represent an increase of as much as 0 7  Contrary opinion   Here is a  from Calculated Risk Home prices are up 8 3  year over year  The CoreLogic data is reported by everyone s   Calculated Risk The earnings beat rate is still strong  Revenues  too  Despite the twist you might have seen from your favorite conspiracy site    with the expected great charts So far this earnings season  64  of US companies that have reported earnings have beaten earnings estimates  while 63  of companies have beaten revenue estimates  As we highlighted last Friday  both of these readings are strong compared to past quarters over the last few years    The Bad There was some bad news  but not so much on economic data  Feel free to add in the comments anything you think I missed  Insiders are selling   big time   says that the pace is the fastest in several years   emphasizes the warning  pointing out that potential tax selling

really will matter to our investments  She recommended that I find something to spice it up a bit  The big time bloggers all write about cars and music and such  Good advice  We all know that on Wall Street if you want a friend you should get a dog  Here is her suggestion for   It brought a smile to my face  Recommended Reading   to the Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook  Tadas starts with an intriguing chart  The Yearbook explains that one and more  This is worth some time to study  The Indicator Snapshot  It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators  The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions  The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses  The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found    I have now added a   where Dr  Dieli explains the rationale for his indicator and how it applied in each recession since the 50 s  I have organized this so that you can pick a particular recession and see the discussion for that case  Those who are skeptics about the method should start by reviewing the video for that recession  Anyone who spends some time with this will learn a great deal about the history of recessions from a veteran observer  I have promised another installment on how I use Bob s information to improve investing  I hope to have that soon  Anyone watching the videos will quickly learn that the aggregate spread  and the C Score  provides an early warning  Bob also has a collection of coincident indicators and is always questioning his own methods  I also feature RecessionAlert  which combines a variety of different methods  including the ECRI  in developing a Super Index  They offer a  Anyone following them over the last year would have had useful and profitable guidance on the economy  RecessionAlert has developed a comprehensive package of economic forecasting and market indicators  I will try to do a more complete review soon  Dwaine Van Vuuren also has an   demonstrating how the coincident data have reduced recession prospects  Doug Short has of the ECRI recession prediction  now well over a year old  Doug updates all of the official indicators used by the NBER and also has a helpful list of articles about recession forecasting  His latest comment points out that the public data series has not been helpful or consistent with the announced ECRI posture  Doug also continues to refresh the  of the major indicators used by the NBER in recession dating  He also provides this helpful chart of the ECRI s public indicator   The average investor has lost track of this long ago  and that is unfortunate  The original ECRI claim and the supporting public data were expensive for many  The reason that I track this weekly is that it is important for corporate earnings and for stock prices  It has been worth the effort for me  and for anyone reading each week  Readers might also want to review my   which explains many of the concepts people get wrong   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  About a month ago we switched to a bullish position  These are one month forecasts for the poll  but Felix has a three week horizon  Felix s ratings stabilized at a low level and improved significantly over the last few weeks  The penalty box percentage measures our confidence in the forecast  The low current rating means that few ETFs are in the penalty box  so we have more confidence in the overall ratings   For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer   The Week Ahead This week is extremely light on economic data  The  A List  includes the following  Michigan Consumer Sentiment  F   More important than usual because of the recent dip  fuel prices  and the payroll tax increase Initial jobless claims  Th   Employment will continue as the focal point in evaluating the economy  and this is the most responsive indicator The  B List  includes the following  Retail Sales  W   Holiday season is significant  Confirmation of same store sales JOLTs Report  T   No one seems to do a really good job with this  since they try to infer overall employment  It is more about structure Industrial Production  F   This is an element of GDP  so it will be watched closely The State of the Union on Tuesday night will be the big story of the week  There will be Fed speeches almost every day  These are not really relevant given the Fed guidance  but that will not stop the pundits  Earnings stories are winding down  but still noteworthy  Trading Time Frame Felix has continued a bullish posture  Felix did pretty well last year  becoming more aggressive in a timely fashion  near the start of the summer rally  and getting out a couple of months ago  Since we only require three buyable sectors  the trading accounts look for the  bull market somewhere  even when the overall picture is neutral  Felix has been cautious  but still has caught most of the rally  and done so with less risk  Felix has been bullish in 2013  but the ratings have been declining a little  Investor Time Frame Each week I think about the market from the perspective of different participants  The right move often depends upon your time frame and risk tolerance  The current investment climate offers a dearth of choices  Prof  James Hamilton has a    The question is maybe not what is a good investment right now  but instead what is the least bad investment   He writes further as follows  But what else are you going to do  Low as the dividend yield is on stocks at the moment  2 04     it s still better than what you can get on a 10 year U S  Treasury bond  Moreover  any inflation in the prices of the goods and services that firms sell  as well as any profit gains associated with a larger market  should boost those dividends over time  whereas inflation would continue to erode what you make on the Treasury  Or you might look at a Treasury Inflation Protected Security  whose coupon will rise with the headline CPI  That s currently yielding a hefty  0 57   Anybody want to sign up for that 10 year plan  High yield bonds are dangerous  partly because of the stampede for yield   Formerly referred to  merely as the Quest for Yield   David Schawel  in an  for us all by Abnormal Returns   writes as follows  Greater price risk now exists  The devil is always in the details  and price is an important risk that most corporate bond investors  in my opinion  are overlooking  Gold is currently on a  sell signal  according to Georg Vrba  whose  the Coppock indicator  The last sell signal was at the end of November 2012 and no new buy signal has so far appeared  What is needed now for an early buy signal is a sustained upward move of the gold price to over  1 700 during the next few weeks  something which is certainly not outside the bounds of probability  Meanwhile  we have continuing  headline risk   Buying stocks in times of fear is easy to say  but so difficult to implement  The big shot experts on TV are calling you the dumb money  even when you have been right   in case you missed it     Almost everyone I talk with wants to out guess the market  The problem  Value is more readily determined than price  Individual investors too frequently try to imitate traders  guessing whether to be  all in  or  all out   There are some alternatives  but the answer is different for each investor  We have collected some of our recent recommendations in a     a starting point for the long term investor   Comments and suggestions welcome  I am trying to be helpful and I love feedback   Final Thought Is there realistic hope for a budget compromise  Most of the pundits you see or read have little understanding of history  Congress  or the policy making process  For them the answers are easy and obvious  Anyone who does not agree is a fool  I am currently spending my leisure time reading Walter Isaacson s wonderful biography of Ben Franklin  As I read the final chapters on the Constitutional Convention I am struck by two themes related to compromise  The U S  Constitution required serious compromise of strongly held principles by all parties  Franklin was not a great orator  but his final  is widely acclaimed as stimulating the needed support for this new government The resulting government implemented checks and balances that would make compromise the order of the day for progress If you do not understand this  you will never be able to see how government decisions affect your investments  Senate Democrats are  in their comments  Obama has earlier stated that the sequestration cuts would not occur  I will be closely watching Tuesday s speech for signs of flexibility and bi partisanship  Investment Conclusion  I anticipate plenty of SOTU discussion on Wednesday  The challenge will be to sift through the partisan commentary  Avoiding sequestration would be bullish for the overall market  My guess   and that is all that anyone can do right now   is that observers see this as a 50 50 proposition or worse  Specific sectors

115300,336815,NOC,The Stealth Sequester,opinion,So far  the much dreaded  sequester    some  85 billion in federal spending cuts between March and September 30   hasn t been evident to most Americans The dire warnings that had issued from the White beforehand   threatening that Social Security checks would be delayed  airport security checks would be clogged  and other federal facilities closed   seem to have been overblown Sure  March s employment report was a big disappointment  But it s hard to see any direct connection between those poor job numbers and the sequester  The government has been shedding jobs for years  Most of the losses in March were from the Postal Service Take a closer look  though  and Americans are starting to feel the pain  They just don t know it yet That s because so much of what the government does affects the nation in local  decentralized ways  Federal funds find their way to community housing authorities  state unemployment offices  local school districts  private universities  and companies  So it s hard for most Americans to know the sequester is responsible for the lost funding  lost jobs  or just plain inconvenience A tiny sampling  Brandeis University in Waltham  Massachusetts is bracing for a cut of about  51 million in its  685 million of annual federal research grants and contracts  The public schools of Syracuse  New York  will lose over  1 million  The housing authority of Joliet  Illinois  will take a hit of nearly  900 000  Northrop Grumman Information Systems just issued layoff notices to 26 employees at its plant in Lawton  Oklahoma  Unemployment benefits are being cut in Pennsylvania and Utah The cuts   and thousands like them   are so particular and localized they don t feel as if they re the result of a change in national policy It s just like what happened with the big federal stimulus of 2009 and 2010  but in reverse  Then  money flowed out to so many different places and institutions that most Americans weren t aware of the stimulus program as a whole A second reason the sequester hasn t been visible is a large share of the cuts are in programs directed at the poor   and America s poor are often invisible For example  the Salt Lake Community Action Program recently closed a food pantry in Murray  Utah  serving more than 1 000 needy people every month  The Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium is closing a center that gives alcohol and drug treatment to Native Alaskans Some 1 700 poor families in and around Sacramento  California are likely to lose housing vouchers that pay part of their rents  More than 180 students are likely to be dropped from a Head Start program run by the Cincinnati Hamilton County  Ohio  Community Action Agency Most Americans don t know about these and other cuts because the poor live in different places than the middle class and wealthy  Poverty has become ever more concentrated geographically A third reason the sequester is invisible is many people whose jobs are affected by it are being  furloughed  rather than fired   Furlough  is a euphemism for working shorter workweeks and taking pay cuts Two thousand civilian employees at the Army Research Lab in Maryland will be subject to one day per week furloughs starting on April 22  for example  resulting in a 20 percent drop in pay  The Hancock Field Air National Guard Base is furloughing 280 workers  Many federal courts are now closed on Fridays Furloughs spread the pain  The hardship isn t as evident as it would be if it came in the form of mass layoffs  But don t fool yourself  A 20 percent pay cut is a huge burden for those who have to endure it Bear in mind  finally  the sequester is just starting  The sheer scale of it is guaranteed to make it far more apparent in coming months Some 140 000 low income families will lose their housing vouchers  for example  Entire communities that depend mainly on defense related industries or facilities will take major hits If you thought March s job numbers were disappointing  just wait With the sequester  America has adopted austerity economics  Yet austerity economics is the wrong medicine at exactly the wrong time  Look what it s done to Europe ,2013-04-09,Robert B.

stronger note  boosted by G8 sentiment bent on keeping the euro zone together as well as some veiled signals of further accommodation out of China  In its statement  the G8 indicated it was  maintaining a firm commitment to implement fiscal consolidation  in Europe  but also noted of continued  interest in Greece remaining in the euro zone while respecting its commitments   G8 also said it would  commit to take all necessary steps to strengthen and reinvigorate our economies and combat financial stresses  recognizing that the right measures are not the same for each of us  Outside the formal declaration  struggling periphery states found a new ally in the incoming French President Hollande  who said he is not alone in support of creation of euro zone bonds  A more formal proposal for underwriting state debt would be unveiled at the upcoming informal EU summit this Wednesday  even as German officials continued to express their opposition to such an instrument  Finance Minister Schaeuble said the Greek vote is one of whether the nation wants to remain in EMU  even though Chancellor Merkel on Friday tip toed around calling the June second vote a referendum  Bundesbank President Weidmann also called for European central banks not to increase exposure to Greek debt  while the youthful far left Greek Syriza party leader reiterated his call for more growth measures as part of renegotiated bailout terms China premier Wen reiterated the State Council is keeping its  proactive  fiscal and  prudent  monetary policy  but also suggested more focus is needed on the growth side  Analysts took that sentiment as indication of an impending more aggressive easing by the central bank  especially in light of a fairly muted response to PBoC s 3rd RRR rate cut last week  Meanwhile  more evidence emerged of cooling China demand for hard commodities  as FT noted local buyers were deferring on delivery or defaulting altogether on shipments of coal and iron
