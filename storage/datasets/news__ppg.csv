14384,235899,PPG,HUN Or PPG  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Chemical   Diversified stocks have likely encountered both Huntsman  HUN  and PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Huntsman and PPG Industries are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that HUN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PPG has recently  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
HUN currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 39  while PPG has a forward P E of 21 27  We also note that HUN has a PEG ratio of 1 65  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  PPG currently has a PEG ratio of 2 28 
Another notable valuation metric for HUN is its P B ratio of 2 10  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  PPG has a P B of 5 87 
Based on these metrics and many more  HUN holds a Value grade of A  while PPG has a Value grade of D 
HUN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PPG  so it seems like value investors will conclude that HUN is the superior option right now ",2019-12-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hun-or-ppg-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200495747,200495747

14388,235903,PPG,PPG Industries  PPG  Lags Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 31 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 35 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 15 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  2 96   A quarter ago  it was expected that this paint and coatings maker would post earnings of  1 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 67  delivering a surprise of 3 73  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
PPG Industries  which belongs to the Zacks Chemical   Diversified industry  posted revenues of  3 67 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 27   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 65 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
PPG Industries shares have lost about 2 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 8  
What s Next for PPG Industries 
While PPG Industries has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for PPG Industries was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 49 on  3 67 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 76 on  15 52 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Chemical   Diversified is currently in the bottom 10  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ppg-industries-ppg-lags-q4-earnings-estimates-200499233,200499233

appreciate you joining us on our call  Today  we reported fourth quarter and full year 2019 results  Before reviewing the results  let me just make a few additional comments  We are very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and the full year as we delivered strong year over year results in the phase of weakening global manufacturing activity We delivered record fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS and our full year results were in the middle of the financial guidance we gave last January  despite softer global economy  Additionally  we continue to execute on our long term strategic and cash deployment initiatives focused on shareholder value creation  These initiatives included the completion of several acquisitions which expanded our technology reach and customer intimacy and our legacy rewarding our shareholders  including the 48th year of annual per share dividend increases We continue to invest about 3  of sales in research and development and progress the commercialization of new products and technologies allowing us to deliver above market growth in several of our businesses  We will continue to communicate our progress on these initiatives  and any new key products for 2020 More technically  we begin 2020 continuing to benefit our aggressive and decisive operational management including achievement of our self help commitments from our cost saving program as we delivered about  85 million for the full year  higher than previously committed target  In addition  we delivered record cash from operations in  Phonetic  2019 of about  2 1 billion  including further reductions in working capital Our strong 2019 performance was possible due to our broad business portfolio  supply in both the OEM and aftermarket along with individual consumers and individual industrial customers in all major regions  Also want to thank the dedicated PPG team that remains focused on delivering value added services and technologies for these customers all around the world And let me summarize the financial details we released earlier today  For the fourth quarter  our net sales were nearly  3 7 billion  up about 1  in constant currencies  Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were  1 31  which represents a 14  increase versus last year s fourth quarter  This is our second consecutive quarter of adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 10  with EPS up 14  this quarter and 15  in the prior quarter For the quarter  our segment margins improved about 160 basis points versus last year and are up 120 basis points for the full year despite broad contraction and the global manufacturing activity that worsened as the year progressed  As one data point  actual global industry automotive builds in 2019 were about 10  lower than projected at the beginning of 2019 Our segment results benefited from continued selling price realization and strong cost management  Last  we continued our unwavering support of our customers all over the world and continued to advance our sustainability initiatives  I m very proud that PPG earned the EcoVadis Gold Rating for corporate social responsibility progress  Our team will continue to prioritize these programs and we ll provide a full update when we issue our 2020 sustainability report in the spring Now let me ask Vince to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year results and the guidance we communicated earlier today Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Michael  Again just in the view of the fourth quarter results  our net sales as Michael mentioned were about  3 7 billion  up about 1  year over year that consisted of sales volumes  which were down 3  reflecting the weekend global industrial production environment as Michael mentioned  This included global automotive OEM production and many of our general industrial end use markets  which declined in the quarter and they were most pronounced  the declines were most pronounced in the US and European regions Our aggregate selling prices were up nearly 2   marking the seventh consecutive quarter with selling prices of about 2   We have announced additional selling price increases in several of our businesses heading into 2020 and we will continue to work with our customers to ensure we are receiving fair value for the products and services we supply Summarizing some business trends for the fourth quarter  In our Performance Coatings reporting segment  aerospace coatings continued to deliver very strong volume growth  outpacing industry performance in both the US and Asia regions  This caps off what has been a truly excellent year for this business  which well outperformed the strong industry gains  This reflected increased customer demand for our specific technologies  Automotive refinish organic sales were higher with solid growth in the US  offset partially by weaker volumes in Europe  where customers continued to closely manage inventory levels Our SEM acquisition has delivered strong financial performance in its first year  And we are now commercializing various key SEM products in certain international markets providing us with further growth opportunities The soft trading conditions in Europe impacted our architectural coatings EMEA business  as we experienced lower sales volumes partially offset by higher selling prices  Despite this very challenging economic environment in Europe during this past year  the business was able to grow organic sales for the full year In Latin America  our PPG Comex business increased organic sales aided by improved selling prices  Sales volumes improved sequentially versus the prior quarter  but remained generally soft year over year as consumer demand reflected overall lower Mexican economic activity  For the year PPG Comex delivered another strong financial performance growing both sales and earnings in this reduced economic climate  We also added 160 new stores in 2019 bringing our regional total to about 4 800 concessionaire locations Organic sales volumes in architectural coatings US and Canada  increased modestly with positive sales in most channels during the quarter  including our US same store sales  This is traditionally a slower quarter seasonally Led by continued strong growth in the Asia region  our protective and marine coatings business delivered above industry sales volume growth of a mid single digit percentage during the quarter  We expect sales to remain at elevated levels in the first quarter  although growth rates will be moderated  given the strong prior year comparisons In our Industrial Coatings segment  overall  sales volumes were down about 6  in the quarter reflecting a weak industrial demand  In China  automotive sales fell in December  marking 18th consecutive monthly declines  And in Europe  manufacturing activity contracted for the 11th consecutive month  We have implemented aggressive cost actions in reflection of this lower demand  and despite the lower volumes year over year  our segment earnings were higher for the quarter and for the full year As we look at individual business units  PPG s automotive OEM sales volumes were lower by a mid single digit percentage  consistent with the industry rate  Our automotive OEM business continued to realize higher selling prices in the quarter and for the year  Weak global industrial production activity impacted most of our general Industrial Coatings business sub segments and our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased as higher beverage can demand was more than offset by continued weakness in food can demand From an overall PPG perspective  our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was  1 31  Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 24  for the quarter  similar to our adjusted tax rate for the year  Our results were supported by broad increases in selling prices  improved manufacturing performance and cost and excellent progress on cost savings programs as we delivered more than  20 million against these cost savings programs during the quarter  slightly ahead of our targets The acquisitions we made over the past 12 months also contributed positively to earnings in the quarter  We recently had the acquisition of Texstars  a manufacturing of high performance transparencies and wingtip lenses for aerospace and defense vehicles  We also recently announced the acquisition of ICR  a manufacturer of automotive refinish products Now I ll quickly comment on our full year results from continuing operations  Our full year sales were  15 1 billion  Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were  6 22  which was up 5  versus 2018 Excluding foreign currency translation  our adjusted earnings per share were up about 8   firmly within 2019 earnings guidance we provided last January  Most of the growth in earnings was driven by our strong operating discipline that generated higher segment operating margins each quarter this year  Specifically  our industrial Coatings segment achieved 5  earnings growth despite sales being off  175 million for the year  Additionally  each of our major regions improved operating margins As Michael mentioned  we continue to focus on cash deployment in 2019 and are pleased to announce or completed various acquisitions over the past 12 months  These acquisitions have had aggregate annualized revenue of about  500 million  of which  100 million is in Asia Pacific  We realized just over  300 million of acquisition sales in 2019 and expect the remainder occur in 2020 In addition to acquisitions  we repurchased  325 million of PPG stock during the year  of which  150 million was completed in the fourth quarter Before I turn it over to Michael  I m going to review some of our 2020 financial guidance  Let me briefly cover some of our current economic expectations regionally  We anticipate overall positive economic growth to continue in the US and Canada at levels generally similar to 2019  This is being aided by commutative  Phonetic  interest rates  that remain supportive of the construction markets and also stability in the regional market In Latin America  we anticipate modestly improved economic expansion in Mexico versus a lackluster 2019  And in South America  we also expect modest economic improvement   Indecipherable  in China are expected to fall more than 10  in the first quarter and industrial production demand conditions in India are forecasted to be challenging earlier in 2020  However  we do anticipate growth improving overall in Asia  as the year progresses and demand trends in the region in the latter half of the first quarter following Chinese New Year will be an important measurement of the region s prospects  Economic growth in Europe is expected to remain subdued overall and varied by country  We expect the potential for greater volatility in automotive builds throughout the year due to the onset of new emission standards as the year progresses We have included in today s presentation materials available on our website a summary of specific financial assumptions  These are included on Slide 11 and 12  As we included in our earnings press release issued earlier today  we expect full year 2020 sales growth in local currencies of 1  to 3   This includes the acquisitions I discussed earlier  We also expect full year 2020 EPS growth afford a 9  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  We fully acknowledge the earnings guidance range is wide and this is primarily due to the current high level of uncertainty as the year begins  Embedded in our guidance are the following key elements  We expect continued soft industrial demand in Europe and the US in the early portion of the year Automotive production globally is expected to remain challenging including weak Q1 China production forecast which were revised further down as early as this week  Additionally  we don t have visibility on overall China demand trends this early in the year with forecasting increasingly difficult given the early Chinese New Year  which is about a week away  Our guidance also includes updated first half 2020 Aerospace OEM production forecasts which have tilted lower  Additionally  despite the lethargic economic backdrop our raw material costs have remained stubbornly high relative to overall supply and demand and reflecting recent crude oil volatility  Also included in our guidance are any favorable impacts from the recently approved US China trade agreement  the pending US MCA trade agreement for the benefit of reduced uncertainty regarding Brexit  And it s simply too early for us to assess what impact  if any these noteworthy regional items will have  Also given all the self help actions the past 18 months  any increase in volume PPG realizes  we expect to translate into strong earnings contributions giving our strong operating leverage  In addition to general items I just mentioned  following are PPG specific assumptions First is the carryover impact from acquisitions that we completed during 2019 and the full year impact our recent    the recently announced ICR acquisition  we expect about  170 million in sales from these acquisitions in year 2020  These acquisitions will typically deliver at or below segment margins as we work to fully integrate their operations in the PPG  We are forecasting continued general inflation  including higher wages  medical and logistics cost We are closely monitoring the cost environment for our raw materials with the recent spikes in crude oil prices  We are working with our customers for targeted additional selling prices in 2020  As referenced earlier  we are still completing our 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs  We anticipate these programs will deliver an incremental  75 million in combined savings in 2020  We expect our annual corporate cost increase  including general inflation and we expect the increase due to the general inflation and higher management incentive comp as we accrue at targeted earnings levels Next  we anticipate the company s 2020 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations to be 22  to 24   The comparable rate for 2019 was 24   As the year progresses  we will work to tighten the tax rate basis current information including geographic earnings forecast We also provided EPS guidance specific to the first quarter  This guidance was  1 32 to  1 42 and this does include a modest unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation  This also includes a modest impact from a large aerospace customers announced production curtailment  We continue to manage our capital expenditures based on the current economic climate and have budgeted for spending to be between 2 5   Phonetic  to 3  of sales  consistent with our 2019 range As I mentioned  some of these and other financial assumptions are contained in the presentation materials for today s call  And now I will turn the call back over to Michael for some final comments Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Vince  As we look at the current year  While there continues to be geopolitical concerns and some lingering uncertainty over trade activity  we are optimistic that the global economy will grow in 2020  However  given the heightened uncertainty  we will continue to aggressively manage all elements within our control and we continue to target EPS and cash flow growth  supported by achieving aggregate segment margins that we maintain prior to the recent inflationary cycle  which we believe this is achievable in the back half of 2020  We are expecting to have better visibility on demand trend by the end of the first quarter and we will adjust our guidance as necessary 1Strategically  we will continue to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities  We have a strong track record of creating shareholder value with acquisitions and we intend to remain active but methodical  We have an excellent balance sheet and we remain consistent with what we said in 2019  that we don t intend to let excess cash growing our balance sheet  But we will remain disciplined in deploying this resource  Finally while our guidance is reflective uncertainty of when the industrial demand will improve  I am confident and our 2019 results solidified that PPG remains well positioned strategically and financially to deliver increased value to our shareholders and worldwide customers supported by our outstanding team  differentiated industry expertise  broad footprint and product innovation engine In conclusion  I want to recognize our employees around the world for their outstanding contributions  We have a strong  engaged and dedicated global team  Everyday our employees are focused on delivering results the PPG way by partnering with customers to create mutual value  They make it happen and work hard to do better today than yesterday every day  This concludes our prepared remarks  Once again  we appreciate your interest in PPG  and now Chad  would you please open the line for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  The first question will be from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  Just real quick on the price cost  can you comment on your just any broad expectations for the resin basket  And anything on TiO2 just  And on the former and on any puts and takes regarding Chinese supply including when it  Phonetic  operates  Any changes in your views on environmental and safety and just trends in the New Year  just anything you could add to your expectation would be greatly appreciated  Thank you Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Christopher  I ll try to get all those questions  Let s start with TiO2  I don t expect this to be a topic will talk about this year  obviously there is one supplier out there that s cutting rates  The rest of the guys are out there supplying  At this point in the cycle  you need to expect to see lower prices  It s been still kind of hanging flat  But I think the underlying fundamentals of supply and demand would echo reduction in that over time  But I would just say that  that should be a non event this year  I would say that propylene and ethylene the things that go into resins continue to be well supplied  I would tell you that I m cautiously optimistic that there ll be some moderation  But it s a little bit too early to tell the crude oil prices are  as you know under a lot of fluctuation volatility right now with the world So it s hard to pin that number down right now  China is moderating production rates and varied by province  And so it s not always easy to predict when they will have a blue sky day  But they do periodically do ask for people to moderate their production in order to help facilitate the environment over there Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat and just a quick follow up on aero  Just given the customer production disruption and noise in the growth rate  can you just break down just    commercial any private exposure versus military in particular  And then also just anything to add on recent acquisition performance and services  Thank you Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo we have a very broad aerospace business  We re into the transparencies  adhesives and sealants and coatings and now with the acquisition of Dexmet lightning protection  So we don t have any one customer that dominates our sales  but the recent customer announcement is impactful and that you ll see our aerospace growth rate still being very positive and still being embedded the industry but not quite at the high single digits  I said it was earlier in the year But I would tell you that we re really pleased with aerospace business  they had a record year  And I anticipate them have another record year in 2020 Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you OperatorThe next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman    I m sorry  it s Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W  Baird  Please go ahead Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird    AnalystYes  thank you  Hi  everyone  I guess  first off  the comment that industrial activity in China began to stabilize in your fourth quarter  can you just give us more context on that  which specific end market stabilized and do you think the stability reflected any pull forward from the timing of the Chinese New Year in 2020 Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I would say it was pretty broad  We saw some benefits in the appliances  Of course  it was less negative in automotive  It s potentially a possibility that there was a pull forward for Chinese New Year  given it s much earlier this year and it s really too early to tell that right now  We did see November was better than October and December was better than November  So that s a good question to come back to us in March after we return from the Chinese New Year and have a little more visibility into it Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird    AnalystOkay  And then Michael  your comments on margins for 2020 approaching levels prior to the current    the recent inflation cycle  I guess in context of the uncertainty still obviously demand in 4Q and your early quarter expectations for 1Q anyway  I guess what gives you confidence in being able to approach those levels as the year unfolds with this current macroeconomic backdrop  Thanks Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe were    in this past quarter  our volumes were down 3  and our margins improved by more than 150 basis points  So if you start to put any volume on the bottom line  you should expect to see the industrial segment margins significantly improve  So you ve already seen us close the gap on the performance coating side and I think you should expect to see us continue to close that gap on the industrial segment side Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  this is Vince  Two other elements there  One  we are doing targeted pricing across the portfolio in the regions and in addition  as I mentioned in my opening comments  we do have additional cost savings projected for 2000    2020 that    we re comfortable we will realize Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird    AnalystYes  Thanks so much Michael and Vince Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorThe next question will be from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Bob Koort    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you  I was wondering  you guys talked about 6  volume erosion in industrial in the fourth quarter  Is there any element of that can be destocking or is there any hope that maybe if you go through 2020 you could get a little restocking or is that not really an element of your product lines Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Bob  we do know similar to PPG  people who are working down their inventory levels as we ended the year really reflection of the tepid environment out there  We do believe our customers are holding low and stock of their products  So if there is    if there is a pickup or recovery  we do feel there ll be at least a modest inventory rebuild  But those will be the two elements that we re aware of Bob Koort    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd Vince  you guys gave some specific quantitative guidance for next year  which is     which is helpful  I guess when I triangulate when you talked about acquisitions and then the carry through the price efforts you made in  19 it suggest no real volume growth  I think  Michael  you asserted that you ve got confidence that the economy will grow  So can you help me understand that disconnect Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the big disconnect right now Bob is two segments that are important for us are automotive  So you just saw the downgrade on where they re anticipating China being down more than 10   You have Europe that s going through the transmission or the emission change on the engines  So that s a big uncertainty  But right now  it s too early to call  heavy duty equipment  I think the recent signatures in Washington yesterday will help the farmers  But I don t think they ll immediately start buying equipment  but I do think that will come over time And then you certainly have aerospace  there is a significant demand for new planes  They re not being met right now  So hopefully over time that will get back on track  And we do know that the military side of aerospace is going to continue to be pretty strong Bob Koort    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Thanks for the help Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bob Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Bob OperatorThe next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you  Michael  looking at the M A pipeline  does the fact we bought back shares in Q4  signal any change in the M A pipeline or your expectations in that area Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerDavid  no change  We have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions  we re looking at  But  we also generated a lot of cash  We know that we always generate a lot of cash in the fourth quarter  We ve committed that we re not going to let that cash sit on the balance sheet  So we took some of that cash off the sidelines and bought back stock  We can continue to do both  right now  as you know  we still prefer acquisitions  But it just seemed like a prudent thing to do given the amount of cash that we knew was coming into the fourth quarter David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystVery good  And just on packaging coatings  in Slide 5  you highlighted it was below market in all four regions in Q4  Did you lose share in that business in Q4 Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say marginally  it s more of a matter of the mix  We are much bigger in what I would call food and MAT  which is monobloc aerosol vent and tubes  So think about deodorants and various other odd ball sides cans  So we re bigger in that segment than beverage  We did have positive growth in beverage  but beverage is growing at a much faster rate then the other segments  So it was more of a mix  but that s the fact David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you very much OperatorThe next question will be from Matthew Skowronski with UBS  Please go ahead Matthew Skowronski    UBS    AnalystThanks for taking the question  In your 2020 guidance  what would be the major businesses expected to be most up and what would be the most down  If you could break that down between the performance and industrial that would be appreciated Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo the most up obviously would be aerospace and PMC  those businesses will have another fantastic year in 2020  Probably the one that will be a little more challenged will be automotive and then industrial Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd if I could add  we do expect Comex to be up as well in 2020 Matthew Skowronski    UBS    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd our next question will come from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo Michael Sison    Wells Fargo    AnalystHey  guys  You had good earnings growth in the fourth quarter  and it sounds like the sales levels or sales sort of weakness will persist in the first quarter  but just curious  is there anything going on in the first quarter that your earnings growth is going to be better driven  it sounds like the sales levels will be about the same fourth quarter than in the first Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  part of the difference is just comparisons as you know  we have strong pricing throughout 2019 on a year over year basis  We re still going to get some price in Q1  but not the same year over year level  as we did in the fourth quarter or prior quarters in 2019  Q4 for Comex is their largest quarter  typically seasonally  but we re not going to see that same effect in Q1 We talked about Aerospace already  We had strong volumes in Q4 in aerospace  We know that s going to be tempered  In Asia  Q4 is the automotive market peak in China  even though the volumes were down  overall production is up sequentially  Q3 and Q4 that drops back down  as we will have as much fixed cost coverage in Q1  So if you re trying to compare the quarters  I would pull forward of those big elements Michael Sison    Wells Fargo    AnalystGot it  And then  you should have good leverage to better demand  obviously  But is there a way to think about  if the trade deal  Phonetic  is a positive and then going forward  what the upside or where we would see maybe stronger results in PPG if things get better this year Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI ll start with it and Mike will finish  I think broadly  we ll see it in our global industrial segment  That s the one that we think has been most impacted by the delays in the agreements  There  again as I mentioned just a few minutes ago  inventory levels  we think and end product inventory levels for our customers in those segments are very low  So you could see a production pick up in a halo of inventory build Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And the other thing I d say is that incrementally  not just Europe  where we say 40  of any incremental dollar drops to the bottom line  but we re seeing that same kind of incremental benefit in the US and Latin America now  So that s another positive  So I would say we see any pickup  0 30 on the dollar is going to befall into bottom line Michael Sison    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThe next question will be from P J  Juvekar of Citi  Please go ahead P J  Juvekar    Citi    AnalystYes  hi  good afternoon Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey  P J P J  Juvekar    Citi    AnalystI am a little confused about China automotive comment  You mentioned that auto production was up in 4Q year over year  but should be down 10  in 1Q  So can you just flush that out and talk about things like what are the dealer inventories in China or what are pricing discounts on autos in China  Thank you Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  P J   as we mentioned auto production was up in Q4  that was a mistake on our behalf  I think we intended to say auto production was down but not as much as it was in prior quarters  So it s still down in Q4  We expect it to be down again low double digits in Q1  We do feel that inventory is generally are in check in China  So they ve been matching inventory with lower sales  So sales do pick up that should be a straight translation through to production P J  Juvekar    Citi    AnalystOkay  thank you  And just secondly  as interest rates moved down last year  do you see a pickup in housing activity this year  in particular your architectural business  And in your experience in terms of past cycles when the rates go down  how long before you begin to see some positive impact on your business  Thank you Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  P J   I would say that right now  rates are down  but they ve been down for a while and we re expecting another 2  to 3  kind of growth year for architectural US  I don t expect to see anything significant  Our trade customers have a significant backlog  I still expect to see  trade to be better than DIY  the do it for me trend is going to continue P J  Juvekar    Citi    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorAnd the next question will be from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research  Please go ahead Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystThank you and good afternoon  Michael  I appreciate the comments regarding the active pipeline on M A and the fact that you didn t want to let cash build up on the balance sheet  which is why you reentered into the buyback markets  The prior few years certainly  you have been doing more on the buyback front  this past year 2019  you did double on the M A front  Is that    is your expectation as we look at 2020 that that PPG will be kind of in that same order of magnitude  where M A will be double of what buybacks are or how should we think about the interplay between those two uses of cash Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Frank  I think if you look back the last three or four years  we ve consistently done about four or five acquisitions a year  I would be disappointed if we don t do four or five this year  We ve already announced ICR  We have a very active acquisition review committee in the company  It is a matter of timing  We are working generally with the private owners  They can be temperamental sometimes to get to the finish line  but I m still optimistic that we ll do more acquisitions in 2020 than we ll do share buybacks Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Frank and that s really  and if you look at our history  we ve done a variety of acquisitions  We ve delivered really good returns on those  which is why it remains a priority for us  We typically were able to capture synergies and easily cover our cost of capital  But if those acquisitions don t materialize  as Michael mentioned  we fully intend not to let cash grow in the balance sheet Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystThat s a very fair point  the Whitford deal was a very good deal in hindsight as well  And just turning back to the interplay between price and raws and the fact that you ve got a cost cut program that you re continuing to execute on  you were able to deliver better margins through each quarter in 2019 with some acceleration at the end of the year  how should we think about the progression on improvement in margins in 2020 Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  the first part of the year  we re going to continue to be volume challenge  Phonetic  as we denoted earlier  That will certainly affect our ability to grow margins in our Industrial segment  We do expect Performance to continue to perform well on a relative basis  Frank Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd our next question will come from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research  Please go ahead Kevin Hocevar    Northcoast Research    AnalystHey  good afternoon everybody  Wanted to dig into the guidance a little bit  So sales growth of 1  to 3   I think that 1  of that is acquisitions  So kind of flat  flattish  Phonetic  2  volume  price  and again of which I think most is price  So wanted to dig into the whatever pricing is baked into that  how much would you say is based on carry forward pricing from 2019  I know you have some other actions out there  now  so how much is from those and how much is from any future price increases you might do throughout the year Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Kevin  I ll remind you that we gathered most of our price gains in 2019 at the beginning of 2019 in the first quarter  both in Industrial and Performance  So all price gains in 2020 will be primarily based on actions that we re executing from the beginning of this year  So very little carryover pricing in every business and we do have again in the back half of the year some volume growth layered into the guidance Kevin Hocevar    Northcoast Research    AnalystOkay  got you  And can you comment too  sticking with pricing  how the competitive response has been to the pricing action you have out there  Competitors followed suit or are you flying solo on any of those actions Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell the answer to that question really varies by sub segment  So I would tell you in the Performance Coatings side  there is more    there is more support than maybe there is in the Industrial segment Kevin Hocevar    Northcoast Research    AnalystOkay  got you  Thank you very much OperatorNext question will be from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets  Please go ahead  Arun  perhaps your line is muted on your end Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystAll right  sorry about that  Good afternoon  Sorry about that  Yeah  so I was just curious  couple of years ago there was a chance to or it s or a statement that you ll be focusing on low single digit volume growth and cost reductions at the same time when Michael took over  Now  I know volume growth has been disappointed    disappointing just given the macro backdrop  But maybe you can just catch us up on the cost reduction side  What do you see in the future  I guess  as far as cadence and what can we kind of model through our estimates for cost reductions from here  Thanks Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we achieved  85 million in lower costs in 2019  And I think John mentioned that we were going to do  80 million in 2020 and I would say that we re always looking to be better year over year  There is no additional program we re out there thinking about right now  but we do want to be in a continuous improvement mode  So you should expect us to continue to push our cost lower  especially in such a weak demand environment Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  thanks  And then just on that weak demand environment  could you characterize kind of the price discussions with your customers  I m just curious if there has been any kind of push back just given that raw materials are likely potentially a little bit deflationary in Q4 and then maybe even the next couple of quarters  how are you fighting  Phonetic  those conversations with the customers  Thanks Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOur customers are very sophisticated  generally  they look at it over a cycle not over a single point in time and they can tell by looking at our margins  that we have not returned yet to our margins that we had in 2016  So they also know we have continued inflation in wages and logistics  things like that  So that s also something that we factor in  So the discussions are constructive Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystAnd just lastly  just talking about the M A pipeline  could you discuss maybe some of the verticals that you re looking at  You have done Eurocoat in the past in some areas  ancillary to core coatings  is that still an area of interest for you  maybe in adhesives is there anything like that or what are your areas of focus for M A  Thanks Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we always say that we re looking at all acquisitions in our space  So we are big in adhesives and sealants but we won t do a commodity one in that space  We only do specialty ones  If you look at aerospace  we do want to continue to grow our presence in that segment  And then the traditional core coatings segments  we re going to continue to look in  So we re not going to go out and create some new third leg though  So we ll stick to the businesses that we know Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorThe next question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial  Please go ahead Don Carson    Susquehanna Financial    AnalystJust a couple of questions on US architectural  Michael  you had another quarter of growth in your dealer network  which certainly versus a long trend of declines  Is this your new strategy helping out with your premium dealer network  Or is it just because you had some easy comps  And then on your company stores  what    do you think you can get further price increases in 2020 Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI will take the latter one first  So we did announce an increase in our company owned stores and we do anticipate being successful in that  In regards to the dealers  we are making a significant push for our premier authorized dealer network and it s way too early to talk about success in that name  but we do think the program makes a lot of sense  where we work jointly together with our dealers to better service our customers  So I m glad to see the growth in the dealer network and we ll continue to push forward Don Carson    Susquehanna Financial    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan  Please go ahead Jeff Zekauskas    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks very much  I think your consolidated prices were up 2 6  in the third quarter and 2  in the fourth quarter  So is it fair to say that maybe they ll be up 1 4  or 1 5 in the first quarter  is that the progression Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Jeff  this is Vince  A little more precision than we typically guide to  again I would say 2019 was on the heels of very modest pricing in 2018  We did have very strong pricing  if you recall in the first quarter of 2019  So the comparable is much more difficult  but I wouldn t give specific guidance  We do expect a positive number  but again nothing specific Jeff Zekauskas    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  And your tax rate expectation for the year is between 22  and 24   But I think for the first quarter it s between 22  and 23   does that mean that your base case is 22  to 23   or is there something unusual about the first quarter tax rate Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe are expecting a true up of one of our major geographies in the first quarter  which is why we signaled that to be lower  That s a ongoing number  but it s a true up of a discrete item that will occur during the quarter Jeff Zekauskas    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you so much Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThe next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks so much  Vince  on the cash flow conversion this year  you did a nice job in generating more cash  should we expect further improvement in cash flow conversion off of EBITDA in 2020 Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  you must be listening to our internal management meetings  We target every year half to a full turn on our working capital  We ve been improving that for the last several years  but we still have more room to go  specifically on inventories  We do have a very good receivable conversion rate  but there is still more room there  So our intention is to lower our working capital  full year working capital  another half turn to full turn in 2020 Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And if I could just ask as quickly on the the refinish inventory levels in the EU  are we at the point where you ve kind of lapped that issue and we shouldn t see it as much in 2020  Or is there another quarter or so left of that Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat s always hard to tell because it s two step distribution Vincent  And we don t always have perfect line of sight into that  So I would hope  the answer is yes  but I have no real positive knowledge of that Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Thank you very much  Appreciate it Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThe next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  thanks for taking my question  So when we look back at 2019 oil prices were down  10  Phonetic  a barrel  14  to 15  and yet to your comments earlier the raws remain sticky  I guess  is crude the right barometer for us to be looking at going forward in terms of how your raw material is moving  if so then when should we start to see any relief because it still looks like other than the pricing that you ve been able to put through  you really haven t seen anything on the actual raw material relief side Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  crude does impact a large chunk of our basket  but it doesn t impact things like TiO2  probably doesn t always impact things like packaging and so there are some other things like  let s call it pigments  that doesn t impact it  So there are some other facets of our raw material basket that are not impacted by crude  but it is the larger driver Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerBut just echoing on what Michael said earlier  we feel are our suppliers    our supply demand is well supplied  And it s just been stubborn in terms of passing down the food chain here John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  fair enough  And then  Vince  just a housekeeping question  it looks like your interest expense guide for 2020 is up 10  to as much as 25   I guess  what s driving that Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  a couple of things  one  we did have good cash in the back half of this year  So we were able to retire some debt in the fourth quarter  We will typically be borrowing money in the first quarter as we build inventory for the season  So there is nothing significant about that other than interest rates in some of our key regions like LATAM are coming down  where we had interest income in prior years John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  Okay  thanks very much OperatorThe next question is from Sean Gilmartin with Barclays Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystHey  this is Duffy for Sean  Can you walk through what your market  so 2019 architectural  what do you think the markets grew in Europe  North America and Mexico Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  The US  we think it grew between 2  and 3   In Europe  we think it declined in the 1  kind of range  and in Mexico  the volume was probably down 1  net organic growth positive because of price increases  and the same thing in Europe we had price increases that offset the negative volume  So net net  I would say  marginally positive from an organic growth side in both markets Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystOkay  And then can you help size the the issue in aerospace  so if the slowdown continues all this year  how should we think about the size of that impacting your business  And then when does the the maximum pain happen  I mean  obviously there s probably a lead lag as you go through  and it s slowly kind of working its way through  when does the brunt of that issue start impacting your P L Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Duffy  maybe  I ll tell you what it is not  some people have said it s 1   that s not even remotely close  So if you want to factor up and down off a 0 5   somewhere in that area code  but it is a really complicated question  because as you know we supply transparencies  sealants and adhesives as well as coatings and some of those things we are a Tier 1 suppliers  some of them we re a Tier 2 supplier  And some of the suppliers were running faster than the customer stated line rate and some were matching it  So we re trying to figure out what the inventory in the chain is  and then it will be more complicated by the fact that the airlines are going to be running their planes a little harder  So that will lead to some additional MRO opportunities for us  But then they have to find the time to do the MRO  So it s not a straightforward answer  And so that s why it s    we ve given a larger than normal for our guidance Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Thank you guys The next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystGood afternoon  Michael  I recognize the ink is still drying on the Phase 1 trade deal  but I d be curious to hear your initial thoughts as to what effect it might have in losing up some of the supply chains  where you had encountered a fair amount of friction over the past year or two  Any thoughts on end use markets product lines that could benefit Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  the one that I am optimistic on is Mexico  I think the government is going to start to turn loose some money  they wanted to know what environment they were dealing with  Now they have a little more certainty  So I anticipate the government spending more money that s going to be a positive for us  for our PPG Comex business  And then obviously  we re looking forward to the farmers having more money in their pockets as a positive  but that I think that s a long term putt Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystOkay  And then  Vince for 2020  do you have a strong feeling today as to whether the capital budget could be up flat or down  And maybe you can talk about some of the swing factors or chunkier projects that you are considering for this year Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah first of all for 2019 our cap spending matched almost exactly our 2018 number  We did start some larger projects in 2019 and given the economy  we kept those projects running  but we feel back off of some smaller projects  We re still expecting  Kevin  for 2020 in 2 5  to 3  of sales as our capex bogey  we re going to obviously topple that based on the economic environment Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystOkay  So it sounds pretty similar then  Thank you very much OperatorThe next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Steve Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  you have these online apps  they are meant to help homeowners and property managers identify contractors and mostly to buy paint from you  How much traction are you getting with this initiative  How are you raising awareness level on these apps  And has it affected the driving volume to your dealerships relationships even in areas where you don t have stores Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so Steve  I would say this is still in its infancy digitization of the retail and trade paint network  I would say is slow going  not for a lack of effort but traditionally  I would say these are small business people a little bit slow to change  but they all recognize the need to do that  and so we re working with them on trying to help them understand how they can improve their own businesses by moving to more digital apps  But I would say it s still in the first couple of innings Steve Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAll right  And maybe this one is also in the first couple of innings  or do you have this this this retail refinish  pardon me  mixing technology that you acquired in Europe  Can you provide an update on how that s rolling out whether you can bring that across the pond and whether you could drive market share gains with that Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so Steve that was something we developed ourselves  it s a trademark Moonwalk  it s a automated mixing system for the refinish market that allows the painter basically to scan the paint of the car  stick the chip basically into a machine and it premixes the paint  so that way the painter can be way more productive  We ve already sold 100 of these machines in Europe  The interest level is very high  We ve got a tremendous amount of recognition Obviously  we re starting with our own paint shops first  and then we ll be pushing it out into a competitive environment  so that we can start to gain share  We do have people outside of Europe that are also asking about it  because of the significant press we received  But I would say right now  we re focused on Europe and then we ll look at how we re going to expand that over time Steve Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you OperatorThe next question will come from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Jim Sheehan    SunTrust    AnalystThank you  On the emission standards in Europe that you referenced  how would you compare the disruption this year to what happened in the last go around for Euro VI  Is there a single date in which that occurs  Or is it or is it going to be phased in Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI d say it s way too early to call  There is so much challenge in Europe with the emissions  that we ll just sit back and wait  So no real insight Jim Sheehan    SunTrust    AnalystOkay  And then on your pricing versus raw materials  I think maybe your general industrial business is the business that s furthest behind in terms of inflation  is that correct  And if so when would you expect that business to fully catch up to raw materials  if there is no macro acceleration Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we said it would be in the back half of the year  we obviously need a little volume to help drive that  But I would tell you that  we ve made significant progress in all three of those businesses  whether it s packaging  industrial  automotive  They ve all made significant improvement so far Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd that s Jim  an addition  that s really we re focusing a lot of our self help activities as well  That s helping us March back to those prior margin levels Jim Sheehan    SunTrust    AnalystThank you very much Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJim  just for your information  the forecast for Europe is minus 2  on cars  So that s the external forecast on how the emission packages were impacted Jim Sheehan    SunTrust    AnalystMuch obliged OperatorThe next question will come from Kevin Estok with Jefferies  Please go ahead Dan Russo    Jefferies    AnalystThis is Dan Russo  actually on for Laurence  Could you just tell me  could you hit the lower end of your guidance if there is no volume reacceleration in the second half of the year Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We have a guidance range for a reason  We do  we don t see any pickup in activity basis  our internal expectations we will be more discerning on costs  So  I would certainly expect us to hit our guidance either through our own self help or through economic activity Dan Russo    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Thank you very much OperatorThanks Dan And the next question will come from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    AnalystHi  good afternoon  Wanted to ask you about SG A costs  Looks like they were up more than 100 basis points year over year as a percentage of sales  Can you walk us through some of the dynamics on the SG A front  Is there a reason that we re not seeing better fall through from restructuring actions at the SG A line  Was there a change in incentive comp  Or what s going on there Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerTwo main items  Mike  One  as we brought these acquisitions in  they re typically coming in at a much higher SG A baseload  And we ll work that down over time as part of our synergy capture that we do  The second is we did have higher    a higher stock price this year  which resulted in a higher TSR from a management and incentive perspective  Those were the two main factors Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    AnalystAll right  thanks  And then my other question is on the architectural market in China  you noted that as an area of strength and said you re growing above market  Can you talk about what you re doing in China to drive growth  while some of your other competitors struggled to gain traction in that market Vincent J  Morales    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI ll start  I ll let Michael finish  I think we referred to Mike in China was our protective and marine market  not necessarily architectural  We do see even though China is down in terms of industrial activity  we do see a tremendous amount of infrastructure under way there  We re participating in that  We think we re winning more than our fair share of the business  Marine is also up slightly in China  So those were the two items I think we earmarked not necessarily architectural  Michael  if you want to add Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  the only thing I would add is  our marine business is winning in the shipyards that are winning business in China  And China is winning more business than Korea and we re better positioned in China than we are in Korea  So we re in the places that are growing Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    AnalystYeah  I guess I m looking at Slide 5 in the   John Bruno    Director  Investor RelationsMike  Mike  I m sorry  Mike  this is John  Yeah  I see what you re looking at  So just as a reminder everybody  we do have architectural business in China  It s a small business  and it s in part of China as a regional business within China and it s performed well  So I just would remind people that it is on the smaller side Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s regional  It s mostly in the Shanghai and Southern China piece  So that s where the incentive is heading of us  Phonetic  Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    AnalystAll right  Thanks very much Michael H  McGarry    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mike OperatorLadies and gentlemen  this concludes our question and answer session  I would like to turn the

127974,349489,PPG,Why PPG Industries Is Still a Buy,news,"The case for buying stock in paintings and coatings company PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  is definitely not based on the idea that its end markets are firing on all cylinders right now  However  on a risk reward basis  the stock actually looks like a good value  Let s take a look at what s going on with the Dividend Aristocrat  and why it s an attractive stock for long term investors 
What happened in 2019
Last year wasn t a great one for the industrial sector  and as you can see below sales actually declined for PPG on a reported basis  What s more  management s guidance for 2020 calls for sales growth of 1  3   including acquisitions  which should be responsible for 1  growth   so it s fair to say 2020 will be another year of anemic growth 

Data source  PPG Industries presentations 
A quick look at PPG s end markets by use shows the nature of the problem in the last couple of years  and helps explain what s going on  Simply put  the slowdown in the industrial sector and automotive original equipment manufacturing  OEM  hit PPG s industrial coating segment  with volume down 6  in 2019   and economic weakness in Europe hit its performance coatings segment  with volume down 1  in 2019  
In fact  overall volume declined 3 1  in 2019  and only a 2 3  contribution from price increases and 2  from acquisitions kept revenue growth positive at 1 2  in 2019  In case you are wondering  adverse currency movements led to the drop in revenue you can see in the table above 

PPG Industries faces a difficult year
If the headline performance in 2019 was lackluster  then management s guidance for 1  3  sales growth in 2020 is similarly so  Moreover  speaking on the earnings call  CFO Vincent Morales said that automotive production is likely to remain weak in 2020  while the production halt on the Boeing 737 MAX led to  updated first half 2020 Aerospace OEM production forecasts which have tilted lower  
Meanwhile  for those hoping that raw material prices could drop substantially    enabling gross profit expansion    Morales said that  raw material costs have remained stubbornly high relative to overall supply and demand and reflecting recent crude oil volatility  
Putting it all together  it s set to be a year of low revenue growth  with  stubbornly  high raw material costs and downside potential from further weakness in the industrial economy  That said  PPG might be a stock worth buying 

Three reasons to buy PPG Industries
The case for buying the stock rests on three main arguments  First  during the slowdown  management has taken actions to reduce costs and improve profitability  In fact  as the table above shows  segment margin expanded from 13 8  to 15  in 2019  and CEO Michael McGarry argued that   if you start to put any volume on the bottom line  you should expect to see the industrial segment margins significantly improve  
In other words  any improvement in the industrial economy    and there s a good case for an improvement in the second half    should lead to substantive profit increases  
Second  the paintings and coatings industry remains an industry in consolidation  and underlying margin and return on equity trends appear to be on the upswing  In the last decade  PPG bought the North America architectural coatings business of Akzo Nobel  OTC AKZOY  and Mexico s Comex  while Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW  bought Valspar in 2017 
Simply put  PPG  Sherwin Williams  the two largest players in the industry  and peers are very good at generating income from their assets  In the long term  this means they have the potential to grow dividends handsomely    PPG and Sherwin Williams are both Dividend Aristocrats  having raised dividends for more than 25 consecutive years   Moreover  there s a reason why Warren Buffett holds Axalta Coating Systems  NYSE AXTA   

PPG Return on Equity data by YCharts
Third  PPG has significantly improved its free cash flow  FCF  generation from earnings in recent years  Based on analyst estimates  PPG looks like a good value on a free cash flow basis  To put these figures into context  a price to FCF multiple of 18 times implies PPG is generating 5 5  of its market cap in FCF  And as we ve already seen  PPG is very good at generating income from its investments

Is PPG stock a buy 
If you can close your ears to some potentially bad news from the industrial sector in the first half of 2020  then the stock is attractive  The valuation is fine  and any improvement in the economy and or a long overdue drop in raw material prices will give PPG the chance to grow margin and profits 
So on a risk reward basis  there is upside potential to the stock from any recovery in the industrial economy  while the FCF generation should limit the downside  That s usually a good proposition for investors ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmdcy,2067021

128000,349515,PPG,U S  Chemicals Growth To Cool In 2020 Amid Trade Headwinds,opinion,The American chemical industry is poised for slower growth in 2020 amid uncertainties surrounding trade and a downturn in manufacturing  according to the newly released  Year End 2019 Chemical Industry Situation and Outlook  by the American Chemistry Council   ACC   Trade Uncertainties  Manufacturing Slowdown to Hurt GrowthThe industry faces headwinds from slowing global growth  impacts of trade tensions and a slowdown in manufacturing globally  the Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group noted  However  production from shale gas linked new capacity will be a positive    Trade issues and slower growth in several major chemical end use markets led to sluggish growth in U S  chemical production in 2019  Amid the prevailing challenges  the ACC envisions domestic chemical production volumes  barring pharmaceuticals  to grow just 0 4  in 2020 after a meagre 0 6  rise in 2019  Production is  however  expected to gain steam with a 2 3  growth in 2021 Basic chemicals production is projected to rise 0 7  in 2020 and 3 1  in 2021  Downturn in several specialty chemicals market segments started toward the end of 2019  The ACC sees a 0 4  contraction in specialty chemicals production in 2020 on easing end use market demand and lower energy investment  Growth in specialties is forecast to resume in 2021 with an expected recovery in the industrial sector The U S  chemical industry saw a slowdown in chemical exports in 2019  Chemical exports declined in 2019 due to slowing global growth and trade tensions  the ACC noted  U S  chemical exports are forecast to drop 2 5  to  137 billion this year   However  exports are projected to recover in 2020  rising 1 1  to  138 billion in 2020 Per the ACC  disruptions in the supply chains due to trade issues  softened energy investment and weaker growth in major trading partner economies hurt demand for U S  exports this year  Industrial output decelerated to a 0 9  gain in 2019 and is projected to further slow in 2020 with a growth of 0 5   before recovering in 2021 with a 1 4  rise    On the chemical end use market front  the ACC envisions growth to be mixed in 2020  The trade group expects biggest gains across construction materials  oil   gas extraction  refining  semiconductors and aerospace Automotive  a major end use market  is projected to weaken further in 2020  Per the ACC  U S  light vehicles production slowed from the strong pace witnessed over the 2015 18 period  Sales are expected to slow to 16 9 million units in 2019 and further retreat to 16 5 million units in 2020  For building and construction  another key market  housing starts are forecast to tick up to 1 26 million units in 2019 and remain steady next year  Meanwhile  the American chemical industry continues to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheap feedstock extracted from shale gas  According to the ACC  340 projects have been already announced by the chemical industry since 2010 worth  204 billion  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream U S  Chemicals Roiled by Trade WarThe U S  chemical industry is bearing the brunt of the protracted trade conflict  Washington and Beijing levied billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products last year  China s tariffs on American products include a vast range of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics  Beijing s retaliatory tariffs are hurting demand for U S  chemical

in 2020 amid uncertainties surrounding trade and a downturn in manufacturing  according to the newly released  Year End 2019 Chemical Industry Situation and Outlook  by the American Chemistry Council   ACC   Trade Uncertainties  Manufacturing Slowdown to Hurt GrowthThe industry faces headwinds from slowing global growth  impacts of trade tensions and a slowdown in manufacturing globally  the Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group noted  However  production from shale gas linked new capacity will be a positive    Trade issues and slower growth in several major chemical end use markets led to sluggish growth in U S  chemical production in 2019  Amid the prevailing challenges  the ACC envisions domestic chemical production volumes  barring pharmaceuticals  to grow just 0 4  in 2020 after a meagre 0 6  rise in 2019  Production is  however  expected to gain steam with a 2 3  growth in 2021 Basic chemicals production is projected to rise 0 7  in 2020 and 3 1  in 2021  Downturn in several specialty chemicals market segments started toward the end of 2019  The ACC sees a 0 4  contraction in specialty chemicals production in 2020 on easing end use market demand and lower energy investment  Growth in specialties is forecast to resume in 2021 with an expected recovery in the industrial sector The U S  chemical industry saw a slowdown in chemical exports in 2019  Chemical exports declined in 2019 due to slowing global growth and trade tensions  the ACC noted  U S  chemical exports are forecast to drop 2 5  to  137 billion this year   However  exports are projected to recover in 2020  rising 1 1  to  138 billion in 2020 Per the ACC  disruptions in the supply chains due to trade issues  softened energy investment and weaker growth in major trading partner economies hurt demand for U S  exports this year  Industrial output decelerated to a 0 9  gain in 2019 and is projected to further slow in 2020 with a growth of 0 5   before recovering in 2021 with a 1 4  rise    On the chemical end use market front  the ACC envisions growth to be mixed in 2020  The trade group expects biggest gains across construction materials  oil   gas extraction  refining  semiconductors and aerospace Automotive  a major end use market  is projected to weaken further in 2020  Per the ACC  U S  light vehicles production slowed from the strong pace witnessed over the 2015 18 period  Sales are expected to slow to 16 9 million units in 2019 and further retreat to 16 5 million units in 2020  For building and construction  another key market  housing starts are forecast to tick up to 1 26 million units in 2019 and remain steady next year  Meanwhile  the American chemical industry continues to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheap feedstock extracted from shale gas  According to the ACC  340 projects have been already announced by the chemical industry since 2010 worth  204 billion  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream U S  Chemicals Roiled by Trade WarThe U S  chemical industry is bearing the brunt of the protracted trade conflict  Washington and Beijing levied billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products last year  China s tariffs on American products include a vast range of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics  Beijing s retaliatory tariffs are hurting demand for U S  chemical exports The trade tiff has also led to a slowdown in industrial activities globally  hurting demand for chemicals  In particular  chemical

128026,349541,PPG,Mixed U S  inflation signals leave investors adrift,news,"By Trevor Hunnicutt  Reuters    U S  quarterly earnings reports this month were supposed to give investors clarity about the health of Wall Street s rally this year  Instead  profit reports and forecasts following the most recent three months are giving investors indigestion as companies send unclear messages about the rising cost of goods and labor   I don t understand why people are so hesitant to admit that we re in an upturn in inflation   said Richard Bernstein  chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC  Companies  he said  are  scared that they re not going to get rewarded for pricing growth   The unexplained absence of inflation during the last decade s U S  equity price boom is now being replaced in investor psychology by fears that inflation is finally pushing up costs and squeezing margins and may be one of the culprits in this month s selloff of U S  stocks  U S  consumer price inflation was 2 3 percent in the year to September  according to the Labor Department  and even  core  inflation  which strips out volatile food and energy prices  is running at 2 2 percent for the year  above the Federal Reserve s target   With unemployment at 3 7 percent  the lowest in nearly 40 years  annual wage growth was 2 9 percent in September  a nine year high  The question is whether the cost increases companies say they are now absorbing are fleeting or here to stay  At stake is a market rally built on the premise that stock valuations are justified by earnings that go on growing  While earnings growth is still high at 22 percent so far this quarter  the amount by which S P 500  SPX  index companies are beating analyst estimates is nearly half of what it was during the first quarter  according to Refinitiv data  Unless companies can raise prices fast enough to keep up with the rising costs of hiring and materials  stocks may struggle to maintain current valuations   Borrowing costs are also rising as the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates into 2019 to ward off the inflationary threat  with U S  economy growing at 4 2 percent in the second quarter this year  helped by last year s  1 5 trillion worth of tax cuts  And now U S  businesses are also warning of input costs rising as a result of President Trump s imposition of import tariffs  Steel and aluminum tariffs have cost  Ford Motor Co   N F  about  1 billion in profits  its chief executive officer said last month    Market participants are really concerned that maybe finally we have seen peak earnings and that people are talking much more about costs rising and  looking ahead  corporate profit margins could certainly come under pressure   said Fritz Folts  chief investment strategist at 3EDGE Asset Management LP  Corporate leaders sit on the frontline of inflation  but they are not offering consistent guidance about where they expect the trend to go from here  The divergence in guidance and outlooks is costing investors money  On October 8  paint maker PPG Industries Inc  N PPG  told investors to expect lower profits  saying that it expected the prices for the raw materials it uses to keep rising  and its stock fell 10 percent during the following trading session  Economist Ed Yardeni said the forecast help set the stage for the broader market selloff later that week  Yet PPG s rival   Akzo Nobel  NV  AS AKZO   said nine days later that it thinks inflation on those sorts of items has peaked for the year  Akzo shares rallied 3 0 percent   There s anecdotes about inflation pressures  but when you add them up we re not seeing it in the macro indicators   said Yardeni  The Fed s own  Beige Book  collection of anecdotal evidence on business conditions  published on Wednesday  said inflation has appeared modest or moderate in most parts of the country  Investors are rewarding companies that can keep up with inflation and punishing those that cannot   So far this year  companies with high operating leverage  typically meaning they can generate additional profits with relatively small increases in their costs  have returned 13 percent  including dividends  according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  data   By comparison the S P 500 has returned about 0 9 percent  And anecdotes about costs abound   At Del Taco Restaurants Inc  O TACO   executives warned on an earnings call earlier this month that food inflation will increase in 2019 and its labor costs will grow too  given an increase in California s minimum wage  despite efforts to minimize labor by using food processing machines to cut more cheese and tomatoes  The company hopes to offset those at least some of those increases by raising prices  Del Taco shares fell to a more than 2 year low  But inflation has helped other companies   Nestle  S NESN  and  Unilever   L ULVR   AS UNc   two of the world s biggest consumer goods makers  both reported a pick up in sales last week as inflation helped give them greater scope to push through price hikes  Both companies  shares rose on the news  While inflation has risen and is a concern  markets generally see it contained  One bond based measure of consumer inflation expected over the five years starting in 2023  puts the figure at 2 2 percent  little changed from today  But some equity investors are not waiting for a clearer signal  Bernstein  for one  said he is investing with an emphasis on sectors  primarily in cyclical consumer industries  that can pass on costs to their customers

128032,349547,PPG,PPG Industries  PPG  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 91 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 51  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries 
For PPG Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PPG Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of  1 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 85  delivering a surprise of  1 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

128036,349551,PPG,US Chemical Output Slows In October As Manufacturing Cools ,opinion,U S  chemical production growth cooled in October on a monthly comparison basis as output rose at a slower pace across all chemical producing regions   according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council   ACC    Activity for the U S  manufacturing sector   the largest consumer of chemical products   slowed in October The Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group said that the U S  Chemical Production Regional Index   CPRI   edged up 0 2  in October on a monthly comparison basis  following a 0 5  rise a month ago  The U S  CPRI  which is measured using a three month moving average  was created to track chemical production in seven regions nationwide Overall chemical production fell 0 6  on a year over year comparison basis in October  Declines were witnessed across Gulf Coast and Midwest with other regions racking up modest gains  Notably  production in the Gulf Coast   the epicenter of the U S  specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry   was off 1 3  Regional Output Growth EasesThe October reading showed a rise in chemical production on a monthly comparison basis across all regions  However  the rate of growth slowed in the reported month  per the ACC Production in the Gulf Coast  Midwest  Ohio Valley and Southeast was up 0 2  in the reported month  Output rose 0 3  across Mid Atlantic  Northeast and West Coast By segments  chemical production was mixed  Gains in plastic resins  chlor alkali  pesticides  organic chemicals  consumer products  adhesives  coatings and other specialty chemicals were masked by lower production in synthetic rubber  miscellaneous inorganic chemicals  synthetic dyes and pigments  industrial gases fertilizers and manufactured fibers U S  Manufacturing Activity Ticks DownAccording to the ACC  activity for the U S  manufacturing sector edged down 0 2  in October  The manufacturing sector serves as a barometer to gauge the overall health of the U S  economy and has a major influence on the chemical industry  The sector is a major driver for the chemical industry which touches around 96  of manufactured goods  Manufacturing activity is also a key indicator for chemical production U S  manufacturing activities shrunk in October as domestic manufacturers faced a challenging global demand environment amid trade tensions with China  Global economic slowdown and the trade spat walloped American factories last month  A strike at General Motors Company   NYSE GM   also contributed to the contraction Tariffs  Weaker Demand Weigh On ChemicalsThe U S  chemical industry is bearing the brunt of the protracted trade conflict  Washington and Beijing levied billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products last year  China s tariffs on American products include a vast range of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics While recent talks between the countries have raised hopes of a possible resolution to the bitter trade dispute  the tariffs currently in place are already doing harm to the U S  chemical industry  China is among the most important trading partners of the American chemical industry and is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals  Beijing s retaliatory tariffs are hurting demand for U S  chemical exports The trade tiff has also led to a slowdown in industrial activities globally  hurting demand for chemicals  In particular  chemical makers are seeing demand weakness in China associated with the trade war amid a slowing Chinese economy  Notably  the trade friction has led to a slowdown in demand in the automotive market  a major chemical end use market  in China Moreover  a slowing global economy  partly due to the trade tensions  is a concern for the chemical industry  Economic conditions have  in particular  weakened across emerging economies The impact of demand weakness resulting from a slowdown in industrial activities  especially in Asia and Europe  due to trade issues was well visible in the third quarter performance of U S chemical makers Leading U S  chemical companies like Celanese Corporation   NYSE CE    Eastman Chemical Company   NYSE EMN   and PPG Industries  Inc    NYSE PPG   faced the heat from a downturn in demand across Asia  particularly in China  and Europe in the third quarter  hurting their sales volumes and revenues  The difficult environment is expected to continue through the December quarter amid global slowdown and lingering trade uncertainties Chemical

128060,349575,PPG,U S  hedge fund Elliott amps up campaigns in Europe,news,"By Maiya Keidan  Arno Schuetze and Agnieszka Flak  LONDON FRANKFURT MILAN  Reuters    U S  hedge fund Elliott is stepping up its activities in Europe  a Reuters review of data shows  as it sees more opportunities to unlock value for shareholders by pushing through management changes  company break ups and merger deals  Filings with regulators show that eight of Paul Elliott Singer s activist fund s 15 disclosed positions in the first four months of 2018 were in Europe  compared to three out of eight in the same period of 2017  Activist hedge funds rarely disclose reasons behind their strategy  But  four sources familiar with Elliott s thinking said Europe offered a lot of scope  as fewer activist funds operated there than in the United States  and European companies have been subject to the attentions of activists for less time  The first quarter was the most active in Europe for Elliott in at least five years  separate data from research group Activist Insight showed   Last month  Elliott bought British bookshop chain Waterstones  disclosed stakes in software firm Micro Focus  shopping center operator Hammerson and hotel and coffee shop company  Whitbread   LON WTB   and upped its holdings in Sky and  Telecom Italia   MI TLIT   TIM    Industry experts say Elliott appears to be acting on a plan to open up a region that until recently was regarded as less fertile ground for activist funds   I think it s a concerted effort that there is too much money to be made here and  they re  not going to be deterred by the structural or cultural defenses  anymore    said Chris Young  who works with companies on the receiving end of activist campaigns at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  in New York    I think that Elliott   given their size  their relative aggressiveness versus other activists   are saying we ve got the capital  we ve got the patience that s necessary and we re going to try to now unlock Europe   said Young  who is working with Telecom Italia  TIM  where Elliott is attempting to overhaul the board at a shareholder meeting on Friday  Elliott has accused the Italian company s top shareholder  Vivendi   PA VIV  of serving only its own interests  while Vivendi says Elliott is looking for short term financial gains  A spokesman for Elliott said   Our activity in Europe is not a specific strategy shift  It s just a function of the way this market is growing   He said there had been a change in the way people view activism   There has just been a shift in the last few years in thinking and you re seeing it now in terms of capital deployed   The fund  which in London is led by Singer s son Gordon  manages  35 billion in assets  dwarfing European rivals  like TCI Fund Management  with  17 5 billion  and Cevian Capital  with assets of more than 13 billion euros   15 6 billion   It is among the biggest global activists by assets  with peers Icahn Enterprises and Third Point managing around  32 million and  18 billion respectively  Since it was founded in 1977  Elliott has made gains of 13 3 percent annually after tax  only ever ending a year down in 1998 and 2008  according to an investor letter seen by Reuters  Not all of its positions are activist  as in the case of its investment in Italian football club AC Milan  As well as making returns  activists say they improve long term performance   More traditional investors say Elliott s swoop on a company does not necessarily mean better returns for long term shareholders   Any time an activist like Elliott comes in  the stock jumps as everyone is betting on some strategic changes happening soon  In reality  it takes much longer than that if it ever gets to that   said a U S  investment fund which also owns TIM stock and fears the fight with Vivendi may drag on and harm the company   DISTRUST The U S  market  where investors like Singer  Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn sprang up in the 1970s and 1980s  has a long history of so called  activists   Similar moves were not made in Europe until the 1990s and 2000s  when Elliott  TCI and Cevian all set up there  Europe has long been considered a more difficult place for activists due to cultural and structural impediments  Many European companies have bylaws  including voting right caps  loyalty schemes and other legal mechanisms that protect management  as well as a deep distrust of activists  Deutsche Boerse s Chief Executive Werner Seifert once called TCI s Chris Hohn the leader of a swarm of locusts in a book about the exchange s battle with the hedge fund  The Elliott spokesman said things had started to change and activist investors were getting a better reception   In the last 12 months  a lot more shareholders are willing to consider that maybe management doesn t know best   Elliott registered its London office with the UK regulator in 2004  It does not have another base in Europe  but flies its traders in and out of various countries as necessary    Corporate constitutions in some European jurisdictions can make it more difficult to yield the right results for activist investors versus the U S   but for Elliott they know the vagaries of European corporate laws and defense tactics very well   said Ian Harris  senior analyst at Elevation Securities  Last year  Elliott failed in its push for Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel to accept a bid from rival PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  and oust Chairman Antony Burgmans  Last week  Whitbread yielded to pressure from Elliott and U S  hedge fund Sachem Head to spin off Costa Coffee  while German activist fund Shareholder Value Management s slate of board candidates at Italy s Retelit was approved  Sources told Reuters government thinking in Europe is gradually changing

Around 10 percent of the 1 200 workers at Akzo Nobel s factory in Sassenheim joined the strike  the spokesman said  in a conflict that is focused mainly on the unions  demand that Akzo injects an extra 400 million euros   471 million  in its pension fund 
Unions also demand a 3 5 percent pay rise  So far  Akzo has offered to increase wages  but has denied any demand for extra contributions to the pension fund 
Work stoppages were also causing a smaller Dutch factory to run at half its capacity on Tuesday  Akzo said  and were expected to hit production at a third plant on Thursday 
The company said it was too early to estimate the costs of the strikes 
Akzo Nobel earlier this year sold its Specialty Chemicals division for 10 billion euros to  Carlyle Group   O CG   after it fended off an unwanted takeover offer from U S  rival PPG Industries  N PPG  last year

128090,349605,PPG,New Akzo Nobel boss pursues  30 billion deal with Axalta,news,"By Toby Sterling and Ludwig Burger
AMSTERDAM FRANKFURT  Reuters    Dutch paints maker Akzo Nobel  seeking to recover after rejecting a takeover offer and issuing two profit warnings  is discussing a merger with smaller U S  rival Axalta Coating Systems Ltd to create a  30 billion company 
Akzo  the maker of Dulux paint  said on Monday it was in  constructive talks  about a  merger of equals  in what would be the first major deal by Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker  who took over in July after Akzo spurned a 26 billion euro   30 2 billion  offer from U S  rival PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  
Reuters reported on Friday that Akzo had approached Axalta about a possible merger  sending Axalta s shares 17 percent higher  Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  is the largest Axalta investor with a stake of just under 10 percent 
 This seems a classic attack is the best defense strategy   said a fund manager at one of Akzo s top 10 investors who asked not to be named 
 Akzo overpromised after defending their own company and started to fail to deliver in Q3  so  they  need to do something transformational   he added 
At 19 5 billion euros   22 7 billion   Akzo s market value is close to three times that of Axalta at  8 1 billion at Friday s closing price of  33 15 
Even after the planned sale of its chemicals divisions  valued at 8 10 billion euros  the Dutch group would tower over its prospective partner  suggesting a lead role that typically results in a premium being offered to the junior partner 
Akzo said plans to divest the chemicals unit remained on track and a  vast majority  of net proceeds from the deal would be returned to shareholders 
Axalta s coatings for new vehicles could fill a gap in Akzo s portfolio  which caters to various other industries including manufacturing  marine and construction  analysts have said 
STIRRING THE POT
The relatively fragmented global paints and coatings industry has seen a frenzy of deal activity  as buyers seek scale to squeeze their raw materials bill to further bolster already attractive margins 
PPG s aborted move for Akzo followed BASF deals last year  selling its industrial coatings business to Akzo and buying Albemarle s surface treatment unit Chemetall for  3 2 billion to focus on automotive coatings 
Before that  Sherwin Williams snatched up rival U S  paint company Valspar in an all cash deal valued at about  9 3 billion 
The mooted combination would make Akzo the second largest coatings player with a 12 percent market share  ahead of PPG but trailing an enlarged Sherwin Williams  analysts at brokerage Raymond James said 
Vanlancker has been forced to cut targets made in the heat of the takeover battle twice in the space of six weeks  blaming disruption caused by hurricane Harvey  rising raw materials costs and  headwinds  at its marine coatings business 
Akzo shares were 0 5 percent higher at 77 89 euros at 1120 GMT  well below a figure of around 96 euros proposed by PPG 
PRESSURE TO DELIVER
Analyst Joost van Beek of Theodoor Gilissen said that in negotiations over financial terms  Axalta would seek to take advantage of Akzo being under pressure to bulk up 
Analysts at Bernstein  in turn  stressed the strategic rationale  saying in a note the Akzo Axalta merger  would improve scale and density in segments and countries where needed while taking out costs  most likely in the fragmented general industrial segment and in Europe  
They forecast savings of around 250 million euros from combining operations 
Akzo would not comment on how the deal could be structured  though describing it as a merger suggests it would pay mostly with shares 
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that talks were at an early stage and there was no guarantee the companies would come to an agreement 
Akzo has gone through tumultuous times of late 
After PPG s approach was fended off  a group of shareholders launched a court case seeking a vote to have Chairman Antony Burgmans removed  but lost 
Akzo s CEO and CFO then resigned  citing health reasons  while Burgmans is due to retire next year 
PPG has indicated it is no longer interested in trying to buy Akzo  After walking away from the deal on June 1  it is barred from rebidding for Akzo until Dec  1

128105,349620,PPG,Analysts Estimate PPG Industries  PPG  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 83 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 7  
Revenues are expected to be  4 09 billion  down 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries 
For PPG Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 24  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PPG Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of  1 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  14 05  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PPG Industries doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-ppg-industries-ppg-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200438964,200438964

128120,349635,PPG,How PPG lost its  29 5 billion bet on Dulux paint,news,By Pamela Barbaglia and Toby Sterling LONDON AMSTERDAM  Reuters    In early March  U S  paint maker PPG  N PPG  s Chief Executive Michael McGarry flew from Pittsburgh to Amsterdam to take  Akzo Nobel   AS AKZO  boss Ton Buechner for lunch  There  the 59 year old American ambushed Buechner with a takeover plan and price tag that his company had been working on for months  a source familiar with the talks told Reuters  Rather than spark a discussion  McGarry s bold move at their March 2 meeting triggered a hard nosed response    He was brutal in his approach and Akzo decided to respond in the same aggressive way   said the source  The offer was rebuffed on March 9  Akzo said the proposal was  not in the interests of its employees  and the firm would pursue different plans to sell its specialty chemicals business  After two more offers were rejected  the Pittsburgh based firm on Thursday dropped its bid  whose value had risen to 26 3 billion euro   29 48 billion   The nature of the lunchtime meeting has not previously been reported  but other elements of PPG s pursuit emerged in news briefings and a May court hearing  exposing details of the takeover bid that would normally stay behind closed doors   The fact that it went public made the process difficult from the beginning   Bryan Iams  PPG S vice president for corporate and government affairs  told Reuters in an emailed response to questions  Akzo s spokesman Leslie McGibbon confirmed two face to face meetings took place  including the lunchtime appointment  What PPG S McGarry got wrong was the timing and the difficulty of pulling off such a deal in the Netherlands  where supervisory boards hold great sway and most companies including Akzo are protected by  poison pill  defenses  McGarry s message was delivered a fortnight before a Dutch general election on March 15  which included strong nationalist themes  PPG s swoop on Akzo caused fury among the Dutch political establishment who turned its takeover plan into a political football to be used in the election debate  McGarry  however  was determined to fight on for a deal that would give his firm access to some of the most popular paint brands in the world  such as Dulux   I don t think the political commentary changes the fact that there was a compelling strategic logic for the two companies to come together   said PPG s Iams  Usually  takeover bids are followed by weeks of secretive negotiations as companies haggle over price and deal structure  and go on charm offensives with investors and regulators  But for PPG  the three month attempt at courtship brought snubs  lawsuits and barely any negotiation time with their counterparts at Akzo  Its second bid on March 20  worth 90 euros per share  was rejected within 48 hours   What was missing from the very start was dialogue   said the source  Akzo took the position that if it engaged in talks  it would quickly become impossible to decline PPG s offer  which was financially attractive for shareholders but which it said was not in the best interests of other stakeholders   FACT OFFENSIVE  PPG s main counterpart in merger and acquisition  M A  talks was Elliott Advisors  which along with other major investors openly urged Akzo to engage in negotiations and tried but failed to oust Akzo Chairman Antony Burgmans in court  McGarry wrote an open letter to Akzo shareholders and visited the Netherlands twice to promote his plan  but met with little success  The PPG CEO said on March 23 that his visits were  not so much a charm offensive as a fact offensive   Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Henk Kamp proposed a law giving any Dutch company targeted by a foreign firm the unrestricted right to refuse for one year  PPG was turned away from meeting top politicians  After the March 2 lunch  the second and last time PPG s McGarry met Akzo CEO Buechner was on May 6  McGarry  based in Pennsylvania  had been given barely 24 hours notice to get to Rotterdam in time  Akzo s chairman would also be there  McGarry flew by private jet from the United States to make the 3 p m  appointment  only to be told that Akzo s two top executives did not have any power to negotiate and were only there to hear any further elaboration on PPG s latest offer  The meeting  which lasted 90 minutes  proved fruitless  despite an offer to Burgmans of a seat on the board of the merged company  Details of the dash to Rotterdam and the nature of that discussion emerged in a May 22 court hearing  Akzo rejected PPG s third bid on May 8  During the May hearing  Akzo s lawyer Jan de Bie Leuveling Tjeenk said McGarry  shouldn t squawk  about the wasted trip   He s the one who said he was willing to meet any time  anywhere   the lawyer said  After a Dutch court ruled that Akzo s board was under no obligation to engage in talks  the American firm s prospects dimmed   If PPG were to pursue a hostile offer by a June 1 filing deadline  Akzo s board still had one trump card  its poison pill defense that would give Burgmans and three other members of the supervisory board the power to make binding recommendations to the company s managing board  Even a successful hostile bid could leave PPG powerless to control the merged firm  In a last ditch attempt  McGarry wrote to Burgmans on Monday   Although you declined to have my requested five minute call  you indicated you would be open to receiving our views in writing  As a result  I am providing you with this letter   McGarry wrote   The letter went on to say PPG would even consider raising its bid again and sweetening other terms  Akzo said it received the letter but added that it didn t have time to respond  With the

128125,349640,PPG,Akzo Nobel CEO quits for health reasons after takeover defense,news,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM  Reuters    The chief executive of Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel  Ton Buechner  has stepped down for health reasons two months after fending off a takeover bid  and will be replaced by chemicals division chief Thierry Vanlancker  the firm said 
Buechner  52  had repelled a 26 3 billion euro   30 35 billion  takeover attempt by U S  rival PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   alienating a chunk of the Dutch firm s shareholders who felt combining the companies made strategic sense 
Vanlancker  a Belgian who joined the firm in 2016  will now have to deliver on the promises made by Buechner and Chairman Anthony Burgmans in their struggle to avoid a merger  including stronger sales growth and margin improvements 
Analysts have said some promises will be tough to achieve 
In his resignation statement  Buechner said   For me this was an extraordinarily difficult decision to make but my focus must now be on my health  
Burgmans declined to elaborate on details of Buechner s illness  saying he regretted  only that he has decided to step down  
Buechner  felt that if he continued to subject himself to the pressures of his office  that would endanger his health   Burgmans told reporters on a conference call 
 What caused it  I cannot tell  I m not a doctor  
Buechner told Akzo s board about his decision on Tuesday  Burgmans said 
Vanlancker was previously identified as the person who would take Buechner s job as part of emergency contingency planning 
In his current post  Vanlancker was expected to oversee the sale or initial public offering  IPO  of Akzo Nobel s specialty chemicals division  Vanlancker previously worked for Chemours  which was spun off from DuPont  NYSE DD  in 2015 
Buechner s surprise announcement means his tenure at Akzo Nobel has ended almost as it began 
In September 2012  a half year after he took the top job  Buechner stepped down on his doctor s advice  suffering from what the company described as  over tiredness   After several delays  he resumed work in December the same year 
Buechner s tenure was mostly regarded as successful  as he made a series of strategic and operational changes to improve the company s financial health 
 Buechner has been responsible for overseeing the successful transformation of the business  including portfolio reshaping      de risking of the pension funds  cutting costs and driving efficiency gains that have raised both margins and returns    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  analyst wrote in a note 
But the firm faced a minor shareholder rebellion after Buechner and Burgmans rejected talks with PPG  leading to a shareholder lawsuit still in progress seeking to have Burgmans ousted 
Faced with opposition from Akzo s board and Dutch politicians  PPG walked away from its bid for Akzo on June 1  Under Dutch market rules  PPG cannot approach Akzo again during a six month cooldown period

128169,349684,PPG,Earnings Preview  PPG Industries  PPG  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 21 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13  
Revenues are expected to be  3 71 billion  down 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries 
For PPG Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PPG Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 15  delivering a surprise of  5 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PPG Industries doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-ppg-industries-ppg-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200405948,200405948
128170,349685,PPG,Top Research Reports For McDonald s  Enterprise Products   Charles Schwab ,opinion,"Thursday  April 11  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including McDonald s  MCD   Enterprise Products Partners  EPD  and Charles Schwab  SCHW   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
McDonald s shares have gained  17 1  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry which has gained  19 4  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks high labor costs and currency headwinds remain major concerns  
Moreover  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to strategic refranchising initiatives  Even its heightened focus on refranchising might cut the capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth  McDonald s margins have been under pressure from worldwide wage increases  
However  McDonald s impressive earnings surprise history  various sales and digital initiatives  as well as positive comparable sales  bode well  In fact  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the trailing 14 quarters  
Furthermore  increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should boost its performance  These apart  efforts to drive growth in International Lead   High Growth Markets bode well 
 You can   
Shares of Buy ranked Enterprise Products have gained  6 9  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Oil Production Pipeline MLP industry s increase of  5 4   The Zacks analyst likes Enterprise Products  extensive network of pipelines that is spread across nearly 50 000 miles  
Importantly  the pipeline network  which is connected to every major U S  shale play  provides services to producers and users of commodities by transporting gas  liquids  and refined products  At present  Enterprise s  5 1 billion pipeline of fee oriented midstream projects positions it to enjoy above average growth in distributable cash flow over the next two years  in turn expanding its distribution coverage ratio  
Most importantly  its ethane export facilities in the Gulf Coast  which link domestic producers to the overseas market  should drive further growth as the use of ethane is rapidly increasing to manufacture plastic instead of naphtha  As such  the partnership holds tremendous upside potential 
 You can   
Schwab shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past year  declining  14 5  vs   19 4   The Zacks analyst likes Schwab s impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company s first quarter 2019 earnings release  
The company remains well positioned to gain from the higher interest rates and its initiatives to strengthen trading income  Also  the company s efforts to improve operating efficiency will go a long way to support profitability  Its efficient capital deployment activities reflect a strong balance sheet position  
However  continuously rising operating expenses are likely to hurt bottom line growth to an extent  Moreover  the company s significant dependence on fee based revenues remains a major concern as it might hamper financials

128195,349710,PPG,Akzo Nobel rejects third takeover proposal from PPG,news,"By Toby Sterling AMSTERDAM  Reuters    Dutch paint maker  Akzo Nobel   AS AKZO  on Monday rejected a third takeover proposal from PPG Industries  N PPG   leaving its larger U S  rival to decide whether to make a formal bid without the support of Akzo s board  or throw in the towel  PPG s third offer values Akzo at 26 3 billion euros   28 8 billion  including debt but the Dutch firm  which makes Dulux paint  said it was too low  faced antitrust risks and failed to address concerns such as  cultural differences   PPG has significant support among Akzo shareholders  But opposition from its boards  Dutch politicians and many of its Dutch staff present difficulties PPG will have to weigh before a June 1 deadline to bid or walk away for at least six months  The deal would combine the world s two biggest makers of paints and coatings and PPG reckons it can achieve savings of  750 million thanks to factors such as economies of scale on production and lowering input costs  A group of Akzo Nobel shareholders led by hedge fund Elliott Advisors has been pushing for it to discuss a merger with PPG but Akzo said on Monday it would not engage in discussions with the U S  firm about the current offer   The PPG proposal undervalues AkzoNobel  contains significant risks and uncertainties  makes no substantive commitments to stakeholders and demonstrates a lack of cultural understanding   Akzo Nobel CEO Ton Buechner said in a statement  Reuters reported on Tuesday that Akzo was poised to reject PPG s latest offer  made on April 24  Buechner told reporters he and Akzo Chairman Antony Burgmans met PPG Chief Executive Michael McGarry on Saturday but would not give details of what was discussed  saying only that it was  cordial and respectful   PPG said it was  disappointed  with the rejection of its third proposal  saying the meeting  lasted less than 90 minutes  and Akzo Nobel officials made clear at the outset they would only discuss PPG s offer and not negotiate   They also did not share any concerns regarding PPG s proposal  or analysis or comparison of their new standalone strategy versus PPG s proposal   PPG said in a statement  adding it would study Akzo s response before commenting further  SHARES FALL PPG s latest offer in cash and shares values Akzo s stock at about 96 75 euros per share  or a 50 percent premium to the price before PPG s interest became known on March 9  Akzo s shares fell 3 percent to 77 euros per share on Monday   We think the shares are likely to fall to the mid 70s this morning  as the market adjusts to a lower probability of a successful transaction    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  said in a note   However  much will depend on PPG s response   Buechner reiterated that Akzo intends to pursue an alternative plan that it has developed to fend off PPG  which includes paying 1 6 billion euros in extra dividends to investors this year   Akzo Nobel also plans to sell or list its chemicals business  which accounts for about a third of its sales and profits  within 12 months  At Akzo Nobel s annual shareholders meeting on April 25  institutional shareholders and Dutch shareholder groups voiced dissent about Akzo s failure to at least talk with PPG  but there was no vote on the matter  About 93 percent of Akzo s shareholder base is non Dutch  as are most of its employees  But at the April meeting  Dutch shareholders cheered calls for Akzo to remain independent and jeered an Elliott representative who spoke  During voting at the meeting  about a third of shareholders opposed a resolution allowing management to issue shares this year  Support for the routine measure would normally be virtually unanimous  so the outcome could be seen as a sign of shareholder dissatisfaction  DIFFICULT DECISION Most analysts say Akzo s independence plan cannot match a PPG takeover in terms of financial value but Buechner and Burgmans have said it is difficult to objectively measure other stakeholder interests  Akzo addressed those less tangible interests in more detail for the first time on Monday  saying the U S  firm had not offered Akzo representatives sufficient representation on its board to safeguard its interests after an acquisition  It also said PPG s proposals on   employees  pensions  location of headquarters  R D and sustainability   are limited  or describe existing contractual arrangements   The latest rebuff leaves PPG with a difficult decision to make  An unsolicited bid by PPG would be considered hostile by the company  which has protective measures against hostile takeovers which were adopted in 1926 but have never been tested  The Dutch economic affairs minister has openly opposed an Akzo Nobel takeover amid rising nationalist sentiment in the Netherlands and some of Dutch employees are concerned that U S  ownership would lead to job losses  Elliot Advisors  which declined to comment on Monday  has argued the job losses required by Akzo s independence plan would be four times greater than if PPG and Akzo were to merge  While Akzo Nobel and other Dutch multinationals have grown large through foreign acquisitions  successful hostile takeovers of Dutch companies by foreign buyers are almost unheard of   the 2007 buyout of ABN Amro by Royal Bank of Scotland  L RBS  being the notable exception

128227,349742,PPG,LPC  U S  healthcare lending rouses from policy induced sedation,news,By Lynn Adler NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  drug distributor  Cardinal Health   NYSE CAH  Inc s deal to buy  Medtronic   NYSE MDT  Plc s medical supplies units days after  Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT  agreed to a long awaited purchase of diagnostic testing company Alere Inc has raised the pulse of a sector suppressed by potential healthcare policy upheaval  Healthcare deal making among high quality companies has stalled  with President Trump and the Republican Congress tackling and then unable late last quarter to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  known as Obamacare  Highly anticipated tax reforms are being delayed by the ongoing healthcare policy debate  President Trump has vowed to cut corporate taxes  as well as allow companies to bring cash stockpiles held overseas back to the US at sharply reduced tax rates  which could also stoke merger and acquisition activity  Investment grade healthcare companies borrowed just US 10bn in the loan market in the first quarter  57  less than a year earlier  according to Thomson Reuters LPC  Loans to high quality companies accounted for 60  of the US 178bn in healthcare lending last year  But in the first quarter  the share sank to just 28  of the US 35 5bn volume   For healthcare M A  transformative deals may be more limited in 2017 due to uncertainty related to Obamacare  Repeal and Replace  as well as pending tax reform   said Allen Fisher  a managing director and global head of healthcare banking at MUFG   Comprehensive tax reform seems almost as unlikely as healthcare reform   The deal logjam budged on Tuesday when Cardinal said it would buy Medtronic for US 6 1bn and agreed to a US 4 5bn bridge loan before locking in longer term debt  Earlier in April  diversified healthcare company Abbott said it would buy Alere at a lower price than initially offered in February 2016  with both companies agreeing to drop lawsuits that prolonged the transaction  Last year  Abbot raised a US 9bn bridge for the Alere deal  and has yet to detail further financing needs   These tie ups come on the heels of several high profile health insurer mergers   Aetna  NYSE AET  with Humana  NYSE HUM  and Cigna  NYSE CI  with Anthem   scrapped by separate anti trust rulings earlier this year  BEST PRESCRIPTION  While healthcare mashups are being subdued  domestic M A broadly is being curbed by the considerable uncertainty surrounding tax and trade policy  Some mergers will push forward  based on an urgency for a takeover target  bankers said   On the one hand you have PPG trying to go hostile into the Netherlands   which under the best of circumstances is difficult   as an example of an issuer willing to power through for an asset it wants to buy   said a senior banker who expects ongoing strategic consolidation  On Wednesday  Pennsylvania based PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  dismissed efforts by Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel to fend off its takeover bid and won support from an activist hedge fund investor  Reuters reported   On the other hand  there may be other Fortune 500 companies that are very much prepared to wait it out and see what the exchange rate environment  regulatory environment and general financing environment are before deciding if it s still worthwhile   said the banker  DIAGNOSING VALUE Amid the unknowns  investors in the healthcare arena are scrutinizing their picks sector by sector   We re trying to assess company performance to see whether there are going to be any liquidity issues  any collection issues  bad debt issues  things that would be indicative of the way payments and coverage may be affected   said Farboud Tavangar  a founder of LCM Asset Management  Public and political scrutiny of high priced medications could pressure pharmaceutical corporations  for example  Hospital companies  on the other hand  could benefit from an aging population and growing medical needs  most investors and strategists agree   The essential service component of hospitals has always been a good protector against unreasonable actions in the past   said Tavangar    However  we re a little worried about diagnostics and reimbursements for diagnostics  screening and imaging companies  particularly if insurance companies approve fewer medical tests    Healthcare loan volume overall could end the year little changed from last year s total  bankers said  even with current market trepidation   First quarter lending was off just 6  from a year earlier  as a surge of refinancing by lower rated companies to cut borrowing costs tempered the slump in investment grade deals  Refinancing may continue to overshadow borrowing for new transactions   A tax holiday that brings corporate cash to the US from overseas would  incentivize pharma and med tech companies to go out and buy assets but not necessarily to make big bet transformative acquisitions   Fisher said   Because the companies would use cash  it won t necessarily produce a lot more financing activity

128242,349757,PPG,Earnings Preview  PPG Industries  PPG  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"PPG Industries  NYSE PPG  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 10 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 6  
Revenues are expected to be  3 66 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries 
For PPG Industries  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PPG Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 45  delivering a surprise of  1 40  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PPG Industries doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-ppg-industries-ppg-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200374481,200374481

128264,349779,PPG,Akzo Nobel rejects  22 billion PPG bid  looks to spin off chemicals,news,By Toby Sterling AMSTERDAM  Reuters    Dutch paints and coatings maker  Akzo Nobel  NV  AS AKZO  rejected a 21 billion euro   22 billion  bid from larger U S  rival PPG Industries Inc  N PPG  on Thursday  saying instead it wanted to  unlock value  by spinning off its chemicals business  PPG s unsolicited offer comes just days before an election where the vulnerability of the biggest Dutch companies to foreign takeover has been an issue  Underlining such concerns  the country s Economic Affairs Minister Henk Kamp said the proposed deal was  not in the interest of the Netherlands   Akzo Chief Executive Ton Buechner said the maker of Dulux paint was best placed to create value itself and was looking at floating or selling its specialty chemicals arm  which accounts for roughly a third of sales and earnings  with a 2016 operating profit of 629 million euros on sales of 4 8 billion euros  The cash and share offer from PPG was  unsolicited  non binding and conditional  and worth around 83 euros per share  Akzo said  The bid represented a 29 percent premium to Akzo s closing price of 64 42 euros on Wednesday and its shares almost 15 percent to 73 95 euros on Thursday  nearing all time highs  Pittsburgh based PPG confirmed its approach on Thursday  saying its proposal was  attractive and comprehensive    We believe a combination is a very compelling strategic opportunity   said CEO Michael McGarry in a statement  adding he believed it was in the interest of shareholders  employees and customers as well   PPG   has devoted has devoted significant time and resources to analyzing a potential combination of PPG and AkzoNobel and is confident in its ability to execute and complete the proposed transaction   it said  But Buechner said Akzo s management and supervisory boards had  concluded that the PPG proposal failed  to reflect the long term value creation potential of the company   PPG s offer was also risky because cost savings were uncertain  it would lead to a highly leveraged company  and it stood a good chance of being blocked by regulators  he added  However  analysts said there could be merit in a deal   In our view  Akzo Nobel could in large parts be a good fit for PPG in a fragmented global coatings market   said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz in a note  Faitz said the pair were the two biggest players  with PPG holding 12 percent of the market and Akzo another 9 percent   One significant overlap would be in automotive refinish  while all other segments except for decorative paints in Europe would be a good complementary fit   he said  In the United States  paintmaker Sherwin Williams is in the process of buying Valspar in a deal worth  11 3 billion  DUTCH TAKEOVER DEFENCES Analyst Jauke de Jong of AFS Group in Amsterdam said he thought regulators would oppose the deal on antitrust grounds and he doubted PPG could overcome Akzo opposition   AkzoNobel has sufficient takeover defenses to block a hostile takeover   he said  Like many Dutch companies  Akzo Nobel has strong defenses in place against a hostile takeover  Under a 1928 provision  members of its supervisory board hold  priority shares  granting them the right to make binding nominations to the management board or amend the company s articles of association  Buechner said Akzo had intended to announce plans to sell or float the specialty chemicals division later this year  but had brought forward the announcement after PPG s offer  ING Bank analyst Stijn Demeester said the division could be sold for around 9 times 2016 EBITDA of 953 million euros  or around 8 6 billion euros   The reason to do that would be that it would lead to a re rating of the rest of Akzo s businesses  which trade at a discount to peers  he said  People close to the matter said that Akzo would likely market the asset to peers such as BASF  DE BASFn   Sabic   Celanese   N CE  and Eastman  N EMN  as well as private equity groups   If Akzo does spin off the division  it will be the latest in a series of European companies to attempt to unlock greater shareholder value by doing so  In a such event  the unit would likely fetch a lower valuation  possibly around 8 times its core earnings  one of the people said  Akzo s specialty chemicals business makes ingredients used in industrial processes and products  including polymers  salt and chloralkalines used for making everything from foodstuffs to household products  paper  vehicles and constructing buildings  Akzo  which has net debt of 1 25 billion euros  fell short of analyst earnings estimates in the last three months of 2016  as its marine and energy sectors weighed  Restructuring costs also pressured results  In January PPG reported adjusted full year operating income of  1 55 billion  It has net debt of  3 8 billion and a market capitalization of  27 billion  Akzo is being advised by Lazard and

128286,349801,PPG,MEOH Or PPG  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Chemical   Diversified sector have probably already heard of Methanex  MEOH  and PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Methanex has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while PPG Industries has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MEOH is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
MEOH currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 94  while PPG has a forward P E of 17 95  We also note that MEOH has a PEG ratio of 0 53  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  PPG currently has a PEG ratio of 2 16 
Another notable valuation metric for MEOH is its P B ratio of 2 73  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  PPG has a P B of 4 93

128294,349809,PPG,UPDATE 2 PPG Industries Q3 profit jumps 36 percent,news," Q3 EPS 96 cents vs  70 cents
  Street expected EPS of 89 cents
  Revenue down 24 percent to  3 23 bln
  Shares fall 1 percent
  Adds additional earnings details  Updates stock movement 
 By Ernest Scheyder
 NEW YORK  Oct  15  Reuters    Coatings and chemicals maker
PPG Industries Inc  posted a 24 percent decline in third
quarter sales on Thursday and expects only modest improvement in
the current quarter  sending shares down 
 Although PPG posted a better than expected third quarter
profit on cost cuts  the company expects sales at its units to
dip later this year 
  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter  we anticipate only
modest improvement in the overall economy   Chief Executive
Officer Charles Bunch said in a statement 
 That news was not received well on Wall Street  where
investors sent shares of the Pittsburgh based company down 1
percent to  61 
 Nevertheless  the beat was seen as a positive indicator that
the economy may have slowly begun to recover from its anemic
performance earlier this year 
  We benefited from our aggressive cost reduction actions  as
well as a modest improvement in demand versus the first half of
2009 stemming from a very gradual recovery in the global
economy   Bunch said 
 For the quarter  the company posted net income of  159
million  or 96 cents per share  compared with  117 million  or 70
cents per share  in the year ago period 
 Analysts had expected earnings of 89 cents per share 
according to Thomson Reuters I B E S estimates 
 Excluding a one time charge due to an asbestos settlement 
the company posted adjusted income of  161 million  or 97 cents
per share 
 Revenue fell 24 percent to  3 23 billion  though results
still beat the  3 13 billion in revenue analysts expected 
 Part of that drop was due to PPG s sale of its stake in an
automotive glass business  and a smaller part of the dip was
due to currency differentials

128311,349826,PPG,Cross Currents For U S  Chemicals  ,opinion,"In March  we noted to investors that when looking at potential ways to invest for an infrastructure boom  they shouldn t neglect U S  specialty and commodity chemical companies  We pointed out that chemicals    from commodities like PVC for piping to higher tech specialty chemicals such as lubricants  industrial gases  and adhesives    are omnipresent necessities for all kinds of construction projects 
The political landscape has shifted somewhat since we wrote  optimistically  that  Unless partisanship escalates in the run up to mid term elections  there is a good chance that common interests across the political divide could help advance an infrastructure bill   The current administration s strategic approach focuses on wrong footing opponents and opening negotiations with outrageous demands  and makes predicting the future an even tougher task than usual  However  we think that prospects for bipartisanship in the lead up to this fall s elections have faded  Consequently  we would be surprised to see a major infrastructure push from the administration 
Even so  though  U S  chemical companies are enjoying a number of tailwinds  Ten years ago  these companies were suffering from weak demand  due to a sub par global economic recovery from the Great Recession   They were also dogged by overseas competitors bolstered by cheaper feedstocks  most chemicals are derived ultimately from hydrocarbons  mostly Oil and natural gas   Other competitors in many places  such as China  enjoyed the patronage of their governments  So U S  chemical companies languished  with aging manufacturing infrastructure and a lack of capital investment 
Over the past decade  this has all begun to change  For years   crackers   big industrial facilities that turn hydrocarbons into the precursors for industrial chemicals  had been aging and closing  Now there are six new large projects under construction across the U S  Since 2010   185 billion worth of new plant construction has been announced  accounting for about half of all investment in American manufacturing  It is a leading export sector  with annual exports exceeding  500 billion 
The fundamental tailwind behind this renaissance  of course  is cheap natural gas made available to U S  chemical manufacturers thanks to the development of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling  This in turn has led to a trend of industry restructuring  The most significant recent example was the merger of Dow and DuPont  NYSE DWDP   Each company had major agricultural  materials science  and specialty chemical divisions  the next strategic step will be to combine them and spin them out as stand alone  pure play companies in their respective fields 
So technological advancement  cheaper feedstocks  newly streamlined and focused businesses  and significant capital investment are all contributing to a positive backdrop for U S  chemicals  even in the absence of a major infrastructure initiative  There are challenges    such as a workforce whose skills may have been dulled by the industry s long fallow period    but they are not insurmountable 
The fly in the ointment is trade  Of China s announced retaliatory tariffs  40  cover chemical products  As we ve pointed out in recent letters  we continue to believe that a full blown  trade war  is unlikely to develop  and that current public statements from both sides are merely negotiating tactics  Of course  such rhetoric can always heat up  particularly when it is intended for domestic political consumption  as may occur in the U S  with this fall s approaching Congressional mid term elections   However  we note that that s just rhetoric for the base    a base which likes to hear tough talk on trade but in the last analysis cares most about a healthy economy and good jobs   We will keep you informed if we believe that the trade conflict is moving beyond a war of words and into more substantive actions which will have negative consequences 
Investment implications  Even without a big infrastructure push from the Federal government  U S  chemical companies are enjoying tailwinds  Should the market turn for leadership towards more commodity and industrial oriented stocks  chemicals could also benefit  Investors could consider DowDuPont  NYSE  DWDP   about to divide itself into agricultural  materials  and specialty chemical products  PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   NYSE  PPG   which makes coatings  and RPM International  NYSE  RPM   whose offerings focus on repair and maintenance

128319,349834,PPG,MEOH Vs  PPG  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Chemical   Diversified sector might want to consider either Methanex  MEOH  or PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Methanex is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while PPG Industries has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that MEOH likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PPG has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
MEOH currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 06  while PPG has a forward P E of 16 28  We also note that MEOH has a PEG ratio of 0 74  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PPG currently has a PEG ratio of 1 81 
Another notable valuation metric for MEOH is its P B ratio of 3 13  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PPG has a P B of 4 64 
These metrics  and several others  help MEOH earn a Value grade of A  while PPG has been given a Value grade of C 
MEOH is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that MEOH is likely the superior value option right now ",2018-06-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/meoh-vs-ppg-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200324577,200324577

128340,349855,PPG,Don t Overlook Chemicals When Considering Infrastructure Spending,opinion,"With tax reform under its belt  the administration is turning its attention to a topic that the President used to good effect during the 2016 campaign    infrastructure  It is also a topic that we have addressed frequently in these pages  noting the connection between adequate infrastructure and such critical barometers of economic health as productivity growth  U S  public infrastructures    roads  bridges  ports  airports  public buildings  levees  railroads  waterways  and so forth    stand in need of a good deal of investment to continue to support robust economic growth  see our commentary of April 27  2017  

When many investors think of these infrastructure investments  they probably imagine steel and concrete as the critical physical ingredients for infrastructure  But there is another  pervasive ingredient that they may overlook  chemicals 
Concrete requires chemical additives  Most construction requires coatings  Much requires piping  often made from PVC  polyvinyl chloride   or more advanced resins and other materials  Adhesives are critical parts of most of the infrastructure categories mentioned above  Besides being general beneficiaries of a big infrastructure push  chemical companies are also benefitting from a secular tailwind  pricing power from the roll out of innovative   greener  chemicals that eliminate harmful ingredients  such as bisphenol A   enhance energy efficiency  and so on 
When considering the impact of infrastructure spending  don t neglect chemicals 
Investment implications   Unless partisanship escalates in the run up to mid term elections  there is a good chance that common interests across the political divide could help advance an infrastructure bill  As it gets closer  consider chemical companies  DowDuPont I NYSE DWDP   about to divide itself into agricultural  materials  and specialty chemical products  PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   which makes coatings  and RPM International  NYSE RPM   whose offerings focus on repair and maintenance

Market Summary
U S  Outlook  A New Profit Cycle for the U S 
Fourth quarter U S  profits continue to come in  and they are very strong 
Some analysts are arguing  and we agree  that U S  corporate profits are in a new upcycle 
U S  corporate profits declined in 2015 by about 11   In 2016 profits rose moderately  so in the two year span from 2015 to 2016 there was very modest profit growth 
In 2017  corporate earnings started to rise a little more rapidly than in the previous two years  The most interesting point is that earnings began to accelerate during the year  and increased their acceleration in the fourth quarter  So far  with 92  of the S P 500 having reported fourth quarter  S P 500 operating earnings are up 22 3  from one year earlier 
This is a very large earnings increase  and analysts at the New York and Atlanta Federal Reserve currently predict a real GDP growth rate of about 3 1   This equates to about 5 8  nominal GDP growth in 2018 
In short  2018 U S  GDP growth will be strong 
The historical records indicates that 5 8  nominal GDP growth strongly supports the probability of much higher earnings in 2018  Even though labor and interest costs will rise somewhat  we anticipate that operating profit margins will stay strong and that after tax corporate profits will rise 9 15  in 2018 
All other things being equal  those companies in the fast growing sectors of the economy  specifically  financials  techs  and industrials  should do better than the market as a whole 
We remain bullish on these sectors  and suggest adding to positions in these sectors on the inevitable market corrections which will continue to occur as interest rates gradually rise 
Those who listened to our recent conference call  or who regularly read these pages  know that our danger points for a market reversal do not appear to be imminent  The danger points include  1  a very rapid increase in the value of the dollar   2  two year interest rates on U S  Treasury securities higher than 10 year rates   3  a major war  and  4  a world banking crisis 
None of these are near term problems  for this reason we remain very optimistic about corporate profit growth in 2018 
Emerging Markets
Emerging markets are attractive    especially those which grow by manufacturing as opposed to commodity price appreciation  Our favorites are China  India  Vietnam  and Chile 
In all four countries  growth is strong  and although China has an overleveraged banking system  they are taking action to correct the problem by forcing irresponsible companies to pare back their speculation  One such company  Anbang Insurance  has been taken over by the Chinese government  which will reduce the company s excessive risk taking 
Europe And Japan
In our view  Europe has many hurdles to cross in 2018  including contentious elections in several countries  Brexit negotiations  the rise of populist parties in many countries  and slower growth as a result of a high euro  We are not bullish on Europe 
Japan depends upon the moves in the U S  dollar  At the current level of the U S  dollar  or if the dollar strengthens  Japan will make progress  On the other hand  if the Japanese yen rises too much  the stock market will retreat  because exports will moderate  The central bank continues to buy bonds and stocks to support economic growth  and they are meeting with some success as growth is improving  Inflation has not yet rebounded to a high enough level  so Japan s central bank continues to fight deflationary forces 
Gold
Gold continues in a trading range  As inflation begins to rise toward 3 4  in 2018  we will see modest appreciation in gold  but we do not look for a major rise  A price above  1500 ounce in 2018 will surprise us 
Digital Currencies
After a tumultuous few months  bitcoin and many other digital currencies have returned to a more typical level of volatility    which is still highly elevated compared to most other asset classes  At this writing  bitcoin remains nearly 50  below the December highs 
Incrementally  the regulatory news for digital currencies has been positive  In our article above we note how the Swiss canton of Zug has embraced digital currencies  Many eagerly reported regulatory actions have turned out not to be as onerous as first reports suggested  Congressional hearings in the United States produced commentary from regulators that indicated support for digital currency innovations  Digital currencies are still a speculative  Wild West   the Venezuelan government s launch of an allegedly oil backed digital currency demonstrates that there will continue to be unscrupulous actors eager to take advantage of froth and exuberance among digital currency speculators 
We continue to look for a regulatory  sweet spot  that reins in criminality and manipulation while still permitting innovation to flourish  We suspect other crypto watchers would like to see the same developments  and if they occur  it will be bullish for many crypto assets  Similar bullish developments will include the successful deployment of new technologies that help crypto transactions be faster and cheaper  we commented on some of these emerging technologies in our recent conference call ",2018-03-02,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dont-overlook-chemicals-when-considering-infrastructure-spending-200295474,200295474
128347,349862,PPG,What Could Dampen Chemical Industry Momentum ,opinion,"The chemical industry is finding traction again after staying down for a while  Chemical makers should benefit from continued strong demand in major markets and strategic measures including expansion into high growth markets  aggressive cost management  acquisitions and investment on capacity expansion  However  the industry is still exposed to certain headwinds  There are a few reasons to be mindful about the chemical industry in the near term  which we have outlined below 
China Worries Persist
Fears of an economic slowdown in China    a major market for chemicals    is a deterrent over the short haul  The world s second biggest economy remains hampered by persistent industrial overcapacity  weak property investment and rising corporate debt  In particular  ballooning debt levels  manifested by rising debt to GDP ratios  and rapid credit expansion have raised a red flag on the Chinese economy 
China s GDP expanded 6 9  in 2017  better than the Chinese government s growth target of roughly 6 5   aided by a recovery in export  However  the country s economy is expected to lose momentum this year and faces headwinds from tighter regulations  trade tensions with the United States and a weaker consumer sector 
The Chinese government expects a slowdown in economic growth this year and sees a GDP growth of 6 5   The expected slowdown  in part  is due to Beijing s efforts to curb risks in the financial system  reduce poverty and clean up the environment  partly through reduction in steel and coal production  
Moreover  the International Monetary Fund  IMF   its annual report on the Chinese economy  had issued a warning about the country s surging debt level that has raised risks for a potential sharp decline in growth in the medium term  The IMF projects China s growth to moderate gradually and sees GDP to grow 6 6  in 2018  further slowing to a 6 4  growth in 2019 
Capital outflow pressures  rapid credit expansion  continued reliance on stimulus measures and geopolitical uncertainties are among the key risks to the country s economic growth  As such  a sluggish Chinese economy may weigh on demand for chemicals in this significant market 
Still Difficult Fertilizer Agrichemical Space
Agriculture market fundamentals remain weak  and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  Moreover  the prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies  Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  remain at their multi year lows as markets remain awash with grains 
Adding to the concerns is the expected decline in U S  farm income in 2018  U S  farm profits are expected to hit 12 year low this year  per the U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  outlook  The USDA envisions net U S  farm income to tumble 6 7  year over year to  59 5 billion in 2018  the lowest level since 2006 
The projected decline in profits is due to lower expected cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories as well as low crop prices  The USDA expects cash receipts for all commodities to go down 0 5  year over year to  363 1 billion in 2018  Cash receipts for crops have been forecast to dip 0 8  to  188 2 billion  The USDA also sees prices of corn and soybean to drop this year 
As such  lower anticipated farm income is likely to negatively influence farmers  nutrient purchasing decisions this year  Lower profit is expected to lead to tightened spending by growers 
Raw Material Cost Pressure
Commodity pricing remain a concern for many U S  chemical producers  Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy  given the competitive pressures in play 
A number of chemical companies including PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   Inc   PPG   Celanese Corp   CE  and Eastman Chemical Co   EMN  are witnessing a spike in raw material prices  exacerbated by short supply due to hurricanes  As a result  margins of these producers may be under pressure moving ahead amid an inflationary environment  A number of chemical makers  in their December quarter earnings calls  have warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through first half 2018 
Trump Trade Tariffs Pose Headwinds
While President Trump s actions toimpose heavy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would provide more protection to the domestic producers of these metals  it poses a headwind for the U S  chemical industry  The move is expected to hurt new chemical investment in the United States and may lead to a slowdown in growth in the domestic chemical industry  These costly tariffs are likely to push up the costs of building chemical plants that use a significant amount of steel 
According to the American Chemistry Council   ACC    the chemical industry has invested  185 billion in new factories  expansions and restarts of plants across the United States with more than half of these projects presently in the planning stage  The trade group has raised concerns that the hefty trade tariffs may force investors to consider doing business elsewhere 
Stocks to Get Rid of Now
As you can see  there are certain reasons to be cautious about the chemical industry  As such  it would also be a prudent choice to get rid of certain companies in the space that show weak fundamentals and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank 
We hold a bearish view on Olin Corp   OLN   Compass Minerals International  Inc   CMP  and Ashland Global Holdings Inc   ASH   each holding a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We also suggest staying away from stocks such as Innophos Holdings  Inc   IPHS   Innospec Inc   IOSP  and Axalta Coating Systems Ltd   AXTA   all carrying a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

 36 Billion Pulled From Mutual and ETF Funds
Despite investors pulling  36 billion out of U S  stock  mutual  and exchange traded funds  ETFs  in the third quarter  the Dow made its 51st new all time high yesterday  Many investors think that that the continued push has made the major indexes too expensive  and with the fed talking higher rates  and the continued talks of war with North Korea  the risk is too great  Yet  the S P has only moved 0 50  or more one time in 27 sessions  and has not seen a daily pullback of 3  or more since Nov  4  the longest stretch without a decline since the mid 1990s  which is why so many investors worried that a big sell off could be coming 
I have said many times over the last several months  barring a war  the current rally could go on for a  few more years   With the markets up so much  there is nothing wrong with taking some profits  According to B of A Merrill Lynch  the amount of cash in investors  portfolios remains historically elevated  even though cash balances slipped to their lowest level in 2  years in October 
A September survey from 179 fund managers with  516 billion in assets pointed out that the average allocation to U S  stocks fell to a net 28  underweight  The last time investors had so little allocated to U S  stocks relative to their benchmarks was in November 2007  Is that a bearish signal  It could be  but like I have been saying   baring a war with North Korea   I think the current rally could last a few more years  In the investing world  there remains a  no place to go but stocks environment   even with  36 billion being pulled out  The Republican tax overhaul and strong economic and corporate data continue to be a driving force 
A trader on Twitter said a fellow trader told him if you want to be successful you need stats going back hundreds of days for any kind of strategy  My answer was simple  if you are building a system I would say yes to that  but if you are day trading I would say no  No one has ever seen anything like this  so what are the old stats really going to tell you  I have had many discussions with the PitBull about this many times  The first part is none of the stuff we used to help us make money trading do not work  and the second part is that no one has ever seen a rally like this 
As for yesterday s trade  the S P 500 futures opened on the high at 2562 25  and then sold off down to 2557 25 just after 9 15  The ES then moved back above the vwap at 2560 25  before going back down and  double bottoming  at the early low at 2557 25  and then took the rest of the day to rally back up to 2562 00  Again  the early MiM had over  400 million for sale  and initially the ES upticked  but when the actual NYSE imbalance came out Sell  120 million  the ES started to pull back down to 2558 25  Total volume was scary low  at 2 53 CT there were only 623 000 ES traded  and that included 130 000 from Globex

 120 Billion In Stock Company Buybacks
Our View  According to the S P and Dow Jones indices in the second quarter  companies in the S P 500 bought back  120 billion worth of stock  These buybacks have been an intricate part of the rally  and have been since the fed lowered rates to zero  I do not know when that markets are going to  correct   but I do know as long as the volume stays historically low  buying weakness is where the money trade rests 
Do I think you could buy some puts  Sure  as my friends Hayes once said  you can play the long side in the ES  but buy some puts  I agree  there has to be a pullback  I just don t know when  or from what price  As the PitBull always said  the markets rally early in the week and early in the day  Our view remains unchanged  you can sell the gap higher opens  or the first rally above the gap  or just be patient and buy the dip

128414,349929,PPG,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  PPG Industries  Celanese And Eastman Chemical,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 13  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Chemicals  Part 3  including PPG Industries  Inc    NYSE PPG    Celanese Corp    NYSE CE   and Eastman Chemical Company   NYSE EMN   Industry  Chemicals  Part 3Link  The chemical industry has gotten its mojo back on strength across major end markets and an improving world economy  While chemical makers should benefit from strategic growth measures and investment on capacity expansion  the industry is still reeling under certain headwinds  There are a few reasons to be cautious about the chemical industry in the near term  which we have outlined below China Woes LingerSlowdown in China    a major market for chemicals    remains a deterrent over the short haul  The world s second biggest economy remains plagued by persistent industrial overcapacity  weak property investment and rising corporate debt  In particular  ballooning debt levels  manifested by rising debt to GDP ratio  and rapid credit expansion have raised a red flag on the Chinese economy The country s GDP expanded 6 7  in 2016  a deceleration from 6 9  a year ago  also the weakest annual growth in 26 years  The International Monetary Fund  IMF   its annual report on the Chinese economy  issued a warning about the country s surging debt level that has raised risks for a potential sharp decline in growth in the medium term  The IMF projects China s GDP to grow 6 8  in 2017  moderating to 6 5  in 2018  Moreover  the Chinese government has set a GDP growth target of roughly 6 5  for 2017 Capital outflow pressures  rapid credit expansion  continued reliance on stimulus measures and geopolitical uncertainties are among the key risks to the country s economic growth  As such  a sluggish Chinese economy may weigh on demand for chemicals in this significant market Harvey Stoked Disruptions Pose a ConcernHurricane Harvey weighed on U S  chemical production during the third quarter  knocking off a sizable chunk of production capacity  Harvey led to the shutdown of several chemical plants along the Gulf Coast    the epicenter of the U S  specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry In particular  the storm ravaged Texas that accounts for nearly three quarters of the U S  production of ethylene  which is among the world s most important petrochemicals and a basic ingredient for final products ranging from plastic bottles to tires to polyester fabric  Many chemical plants producing ethylene are located near the Gulf Coast s concentration of petroleum facilities According to IHS Markit  54  of total U S  ethylene production capacity was hit by Harvey  A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production  leading to reduced supply of this major chemical  The lingering effects of Harvey is a concern for U S  chemical companies  Lost production volumes as well as costs related to the disruptions caused by the storm may pose some headwinds for U S  chemical makers in the fourth quarter of 2017 Still Challenging Fertilizer Agrichemical SpaceFertilizer and agricultural chemical companies are still grappling with a difficult pricing environment  While the potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows  the picture is not so good for nitrogen and phosphate Higher supply has contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment  Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected to weigh on global prices in 2017  Additional nitrogen capacity including a significant increase in North America is expected to come online globally in the back half of the year Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices  Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  As such  nitrogen margins of fertilizer producers remain thwarted by a weak pricing environment Excess capacity  outpacing demand  also continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed so far this year  Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied through the second half  thereby putting pressure on prices Moreover  agriculture market fundamentals remain weak and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  Insipid economic growth in certain key markets including Latin America is affecting demand for nutrients  Moreover  the prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies as it is hindering fertilizer usage by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers  income Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  remain at their multi year lows as markets remain awash with grains  An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017 Raw Material Pricing HeadwindsCommodity pricing remain a concern for many U S  chemical producers  Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy  given the competitive pressures in play A number of chemical companies including PPG Industries  Inc   Celanese Corp  and Eastman Chemical Company are witnessing a spike in raw material prices  exacerbated by short supply due to hurricanes  As a result  margins of these producers may be under pressure moving ahead amid an inflationary environment  A number of chemical makers  in their September quarter earnings call  have warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through the rest of 2017 Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany

128445,349960,PPG,Top Research Reports For Mondelez  Colgate Palmolive   Stryker ,opinion,"Monday  September 25  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Mondelez  MDLZ   Colgate Palmolive  CL  and Stryker  SYK   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Mondelez s shares have lost  10 8  in the last three months  compared with the  7 6  dip of the Zacks Food Preparation industry  However  the Zacks analyst likes Mondelez s attractive portfolio of iconic brands  commanding presence in impulsive categories and fast growing emerging markets  Mondelez s margins have remained constantly strong backed by cost savings and productivity gains 
The company has a mostly positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters  However  Mondelez s volumes have been hurt since 2014 by the elasticity impact from higher pricing and category weakness because of soft consumer demand  Moreover  with a significant portion of its sales coming from international markets  currency is a significant top line headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated Colgate Palmolive are up  8 8  in the year to date period  outperforming the Zacks Consumer Staples sector  which has gained  8 6  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes the progress made on its 2012 Restructuring Program and expects additional opportunities identified under the program to help reach the higher end of its previously stated cost and savings view 
Moreover  the company has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record  However  the company s sales missed expectations for the fifth straight quarter in second quarter due to continued softness in North America and challenges in Asia Pacific  Further  the company lagged sales estimates in 16 out of the trailing 17 quarters 
Nevertheless  the company remains focused on four fundamentals to boost profits including  increased spending on advertisements  innovation across portfolio  higher spends on e commerce business and aggressively maximizing productivity  Also  its disciplined capital strategy bodes well  Estimates have been stable lately 
 You can   
Stryker s shares have gained  21 2  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has increased  8 4  over the same period  Stryker announced the voluntary product recall of the Oral Care lineup recently  The recall is likely to adversely impact the company s sales and operating income  Stryker exited the second quarter on a solid note  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts  Solid performance in the MAKO platform drove revenues 
Upbeat guidance for the full year instills investor confidence on the stock  Stryker has a diversified product portfolio  Continued strong demand for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke products and neuro powered instruments boosted sales in the neurotechnology segment  However  volatility in foreign currency exchange is likely to impede revenue growth  Stryker also faces supply side headwinds and has been grappling with issues in the spine business for long

128475,349990,PPG,Basic Materials Start To Break Out  5 Stocks To Watch,opinion,"Since the Basic Materials sector is in the process of breaking out  I d like to take an in depth look at some of the stocks within the sector along with some commodities in general  Most commodities have had a tough go of it since they topped out in 2011  but there are signs they may be bottoming  which could lead to a substantial rally over the intermediate to the long term 
As you ll see  some of the bottoming formations are very symmetrical while others are pretty ugly  but as long as they can make a higher high and higher low an uptrend is in place 
Let s start with the CRB Index which built out a one year bearish rising wedge formation that broke to the downside in March of this year  The price action has been chopping to the downside  but got a bounce to the upside in late June  Normally the price objective of a rising wedge is down to the first reversal point where the pattern started to build out 

There is another pattern I ve been keeping a close eye on which may have given us a good clue that we could have a consolidation pattern building out which is forming above the January 2016 low  As you can see on the long term daily chart for the CRB index  below  it has built out a sideways trading range which broke to the downside last month  That wasn t a bullish development if one was bullish on this index 
Expanding patterns  whether they re a triangle  flat top or flat bottom  expanding falling or expanding rising wedges are some of the more difficult formations to find in real time  The reason  as with the pattern on this daily chart below which shows a false breakout below the bottom rail  the blue horizontal dashed line  it looks like a breakout to the downside  With current price action closing back above the blue dashed line we now have a potential flat top expanding triangle  If the price action can close above the top horizontal trendline  the flat top triangle will be the first consolidation pattern in the CRB index s new bull market 


This 75 year quarterly chart for the CRB shows just just how bad the bear market has been  To really get this index bullish again I would love to see the price action trading back above the brown shaded S R zone above 200 or so  which would create an unbalanced double bottom 
By looking at the daily chart above you can see how the unbalanced double bottom would look like if the top rail of the expanding flat top triangle is broken to the upside  If the possible unbalanced double bottom plays out  we are just in the first inning of a nine inning game 



This next commodity focused chart is a long term monthly look at the PowerShares DB Commodity Tracking Index  NYSE DBC  which is much more actively traded than the CRB  Instead of an expanding flat top triangle  the DBC is building out a possible flat bottom triangle 
Again  this potential pattern has a chance to be a consolidation pattern to the upside if it can take out the top rail  No matter how you look at the current price action  there is still a lot of work to do before we get any type of resolution to the trading range  A break below the bottom rail will ensure a move back down to the previous low and on the other hand  a breakout above the top rail will put the bull market thesis into play 

Next I would like to focus in on the Materials Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLB   the basic materials index  which is made up of a variety of large cap stocks from this sector  The last time I did an in depth report on the XLB  I suggested this index should do very well as long as its top five components were doing well 
Now take a look a daily chart for the XLB  which is showing it has just broken out of a 6 month blue expanding flat bottom triangle with a small H S bottom that formed as the backtest  Yesterday this basic materials index closed at a new all time high 

Below is a 4 year weekly bar chart showing the breakout from the 6 point flat bottom triangle consolidation pattern into new all time highs this week 


The long term monthly chart for the XLB shows its entire history and its bull market uptrend channel  If the 6 point expanding flat bottom triangle is breaking out topside  then the original top rail of the major uptrend channel will be taken out 
Generally  when that happens you can see another equal channel higher giving the uptrend 3 equal channels instead of two  The black rectangles show how this new uptrend may play out 

This next chart is a long term monthly chart of the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF   I ve been using it to show how the lower channel may be morphing into a double uptrend channel with equal lower and upper channels  This is the same principle as with the XLB chart above  which is forming a possible third channel 

This last chart for the XLB is a monthly line chart going back 20 years  The reason the XLB looks so good is because it s made up of many very big large cap stocks that we ll look at in a moment 

Next  look at the SPDR S P Metals   Mining Fund  NYSE XME   the metals and mining ETF  which broke out of a double H S bottom last fall and has recently been backtesting the neckline  forming the blue falling wedge as the backtest  Last week the price action finally closed above the 30 week ema 

Five stocks make up nearly 45  of the XLB  They are Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW    Dupont  NYSE DD   Monsanto  NYSE MON   Praxair  NYSE PX  and PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   For the past two years  Dow Chemical has built out an expanding triangle that broke out to the upside about 8 months ago and is currently trading at a new all time high  It has the highest weighting in the fund at 12 1 

Next is DuPont which makes up 11 9  of the XLB  It has broken out of a bullish rising wedge and is also trading at a new all time high 

Below is a monthly chart for Monsanto which has a weighting of 9  in the XLB  It s just completing the 4th reversal point in a massive 10 year triangle trading range 


The number four stock by weight on the XLB is Praxair with a weighting of 5 9   It too is trading close to all time highs  though it s still trading inside of its bull market uptrend channel which began to form way back at the 2000 low 


PPG Industries is the fifth largest stock by weighting  at 4 8   It s trading close to new all time highs as well  building out a very large triangle consolidation pattern 

Right now  the stocks and even commodities within this market sector are which are all over the place  some showing strength while others still showing weakness  At some point  if this asset class really takes off we should see the whole complex moving up together with all areas enjoying their own individual bull markets  One step at a time ",2017-07-20,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-report…basic-materials-and-commodities-part-i-200202209,200202209
128514,350029,PPG,5 Trade Ideas For Monday  AEP  HD  ORCL  PPG  ZTS,opinion,"American Electric Power Company Inc  NYSE AEP 

American Electric Power  AEP  started to move higher in December  It paused mid month and into January before a second leg higher  It ran out of the Bollinger Bands  in February and pulled back to a higher low before moving to the latest consolidation zone 
With the Bollinger Bands squeezed it may be ready to move higher again  The RSI is holding in the bullish zone while the MACD is pulling back but positive  Look for a push over resistance to participate higher   

Home Depot  NYSE HD 

Home Depot  HD  started moving higher in November  reaching a peak in December  After a consolidation period it started a second move higher to the current consolidation  The Bollinger Bands  came together at the end of March and last week they opened as the price pushed to the top of consolidation with a Marubozu candle Friday  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone and the MACD is crossing up  Look for a push through resistance to participate higher   

Oracle  NYSE ORCL 

Oracle  ORCL  started higher in January  pausing at the end of February before a gap higher at earnings  It has been pulling back since that gap up  but found support 2 weeks ago as it hit the lower Bollinger Band   It has been slowly turning higher since  with the Bollinger Bands squeezing in  The RSI held in the bullish zone while the MACD is now level after resetting lower  Look for continuation higher to participate to the upside   

PPG Industries Inc  NYSE PPG 

PPG  PPG  gapped down in October and quickly found a bottom  Since then it has steadily moved higher  A spike in March sold off and it has now settled into consolidation under 107  The RSI is holding in the bullish zone while the MACD is flat  Look for a push over resistance to participate higher   

Zoetis Inc  NYSE ZTS 

Zoetis  ZTS  had a strong run up from December to a peak in mid February  It pulled back from there  finding support at the 100 day SMA and has consolidated in a range ever since  Last week saw it move up to the top of the range as the RSI moved up into the bullish zone and the MACD crossed up  Look for a push over resistance to participate higher   
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with April Options Expiration behind  saw the equity markets a bit stronger than last week in the short term and still in consolidation longer term 
Elsewhere look for Gold to pause in its uptrend while Crude Oil continues to pull back lower  The US Dollar Index remains moving sideways in broad consolidation while US Treasuries continue to look better to the upside in the short term  The Shanghai Composite has morphed into a consolidation with a downward bias short term and Emerging Markets are pulling back in their uptrend 
Volatility has moved up slightly from abnormally low levels to a more normal range but still low which continues to keep an upward push on the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts look stronger in the short term  with the QQQ and IWM stronger than the SPY  but with all three consolidating near their highs and strong in the intermediate term  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

London was shaken today by the first major terrorist attack since the 2005 subway bombings  Witnesses told of hearing  after a policeman was attacked outside Parliament  On Westminster Bridge  a car   Two pedestrians and a police officer were killed  and at least 20 people injured  some very seriously 
A vehicle ran over pedestrians before crashing into a fence outside Parliament  A man wielding a knife then ran into the grounds and stabbed a police officer before being shot  Police believe the man  who died from his injuries  was the only attacker and are treating the attack as terrorism 
Global stocks were in retreat mode  but losses were relatively minor  Investors were taking some money out of equities and they re putting their cash into government bonds  European markets declined with many indexes down by about 1   Asian markets ended the day with losses 
Japan s Nikkei notched the biggest drop of 2 1   The moves follow a sizable drop for U S  stocks yesterday  The Dow Industrials fell 1 1   the S P 500 dropped 1 2  and the NASDAQ was down 1 8  
It was the worst day for stocks since October  but it was the first day in which the S P 500 index traded in a 1 percent range since Dec  14  In that time  the market did see one other one day move of 1 percent or greater  when the S P rose nearly 1 4 percent on March 1  but since stocks opened sharply higher that day  the S P did not manage a 1 percent intraday move 
Consequently  the index went 64 days without such a move  which is easily  according to data that dates back to 1962  The second place streak  of 34 days in 1995  In the past  after periods of calm  the market tends to continue moving in the direction of the trend   which is up  but calm is not the normal state for the market  so we can expect a period of increased volatility 
So  watch out for some big dips ahead 
That s the historical tendency  however we also need to watch out for other markets   notably bonds  as we discussed yesterday  where we see a flattening yield curve  and it flattened even more today  A flattening curve means the economic outlook is dampening  When it grows steeper  like it did after the election  the economic outlook is brightening  But a flattening yield curve also influences the stock market negatively 
And if you are waiting for more volatility  you might not have to wait long  Healthcare legislation is schedule for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow  This is the first big piece of legislation for the Trump administration  and could serve as a harbinger 
After the health care legislation  Trump s budget proposal will take front and center and he may face resistance from members of his own party for cuts to environmental programs  That s due to an Obama administration practice that spread billions of dollars in contracts to Republican as well as Democratic congressional districts  Members of Congress typically resist efforts to cut spending that brings projects and jobs to their district 
A Bloomberg analysis of federal contract data shows that spending related to the environment reached 423 congressional districts in fiscal year 2016 and totaled  5 9 billion  Almost half that spending  47 percent  went to districts represented by Republicans 
Federal contract spending isn t just spread across congressional districts  It s also spread across contractors  Last year  4 462 vendors got contracts categorized as related to the environment  climate  sustainability or similar fields 
Twenty five publicly traded companies earned more than  10 million each from those contracts  Distributing federal largesse has been standard practice for the Department of Defense for many years  a lesson not lost on the Department of Energy

The Mortgage Bankers Association reports mortgage application activity fell from a nearly four month peak as borrowing costs on 30 year home loans held at their highest level almost three years  Mortgage apps fell 2 7  for the week ended March 18  Average interest rates on 30 year  fixed rate conforming mortgages  the most widely held type of U S  home loan  held for a second week at 4 46   a level last seen in April 2014 
According to a new study from Spectrem Group  the number of millionaire households in America increased by 400 000 in 2016  reaching a new record of 10 8 million  Since the 2008 financial crisis  the number of millionaire households has grown every year  adding a total of 4 million millionaire households

128548,350063,PPG,Can PPG Industries  PPG  Spring A Surprise In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,PPG Industries Inc    NYSE PPG   is set to release first quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Apr 20 In the last quarter  PPG Industries reported adjusted earnings of  1 19 per share  up 1 6  from the year ago figure of  1 16  The earnings narrowly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 18 per share  However  net sales fell by 1 6  year over year to  3 497 million  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 552 million  PPG Industries has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of four trailing quarters  with an average positive surprise of 0 54  Can PPG Industries surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement PPG Industries  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Factors at PlayThe Chairman and CEO of PPG Industries  Michael H  McGarry  in January  said that the company is operating in an uncertain and evolving regulatory and macroeconomic environment  The company expects improved momentum in overall global economic growth  with gradually improving growth rates in developed regions and continuing but uneven growth in emerging regions The company is aggressively administering all factors within internal controls to remain competitive  PPG Industries has recently initiated a new restructuring program which is expected to generate  125 million in annual savings  The company also anticipates deploying additional  2 5  3 5 billion cash in acquisitions and share repurchases for 2017 and 2018 combined to ensure shareholder value creation PPG Industries is seeing strength in the North American automotive market  Organic sales of its automotive re finished coatings business continue to outperform the market  driven by strong demand for the company s market leading waterborne products and favorable industry trends  Further  an aggressive cost cutting and restructuring strategy will act as a positive catalyst for the company PPG Industries  shares rallied around 9  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s 3 1  gain   Revenues of PPG Industries are expected to improve from increased demand in aerospace  automotive and construction space  but due to cyclical factors there could be some short term macroeconomic challenges going ahead In the industrial coatings business  PPG Industries is seeing some weakness in the heavy duty equipment market  The protective and marine coatings sales are also getting hurt owing to weakness in the marine new build market and soft demand in the oil and gas end use market Moreover  unfavorable currency exchange translation  especially in emerging markets  reduced its sales by  400 million in 2016  The company expects the trend to continue and create unfavorable currency impact of  375    425 million in its sales and  70    90 million on its pre tax earnings for full year 2017  The company also expects some margin pressure associated with higher than expected raw materials costs  on a year over year basis  in first quarter 2017 PPG Industries continued the plan to acquire the Dutch paints maker  Akzo Nobel N V    OTC AKZOY    by revising the initial offer  The latest offer would provide a 40  premium to shareholders of Akzo Nobel  based on its closing stock price of  64 42 as on Mar 8  However  PPG Industries confirmed that Akzo Nobel has rebuffed the revised proposal as the later felt that the latest offer was not in the interest of its stakeholders and also fails to recognize the value of the company On Apr 5  PPG Industries reiterated the invitation to Azko Nobel to enter into discussion for exploring its proposal to form a merged entity  The company said that it continues to believe there is a significant strategic rationale for the proposed transaction and the combination is in the best interest of both companies  shareholders  The merger would create an enhanced global player in paints  coatings and specialty materials leveraging complementary products  technologies and geographies  offering a vast range of products to a more diverse client base

PPG Industries  low density fuel tank and fuselage sealant enables the three flight test aircraft in saving weight compared with conventional sealants and will be used on production of A350 1000 airplanes to benefit operators 
For the selectively strippable system  PPG Industries  chrome free Desoprime HS 7049 primer was applied over the existing base primer and F565 intermediate coating added over it  The aircraft was then painted with Desothane color basecoat and clearcoat  When repainting is required  only the intermediate coating  basecoat and clearcoat will have to be removed for new applications  This will leave Desoprime primer and the underlying base primer intact  reducing aircraft downtime by about 30  to 40  
Further  the company s PR 1782 is another low density aircraft fuel tank and fuselage sealant that provides about 30  weight saving by volume over conventional sealants used for those applications  affording enhanced aircraft fuel economy  It is qualified by Airbus for all of the aircraft manufacturer s airframes

128579,350094,PPG,4 Blue Chip Stocks To Buy As Trump Rally Rages On,opinion,In spite of minor hiccups  the stock market rally continued into a third straight week  with the Dow scaling a new high  The blue chip index steered past the 19 000 mark for the first time in its 120 year history  driven by expectations of market friendly policies from President elect Donald Trump There s been a particularly sharp run up in the stock price of blue chip banks  healthcare  chemical  restaurants and industrial companies  Such companies are slated to gain further in the near term as they are well established and financially sound  Moreover  investors are bullish on what Trump s fiscal policies promise for economic growth Dow Crosses 19 000The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to scale record highs  capping a week when the index breached 19 000 for the first time  The index has been on a bull run since the presidential election  registering the third consecutive week of gains as investors anticipate lower corporate taxation and regulations  along with higher infrastructure spending under a Trump administration Meanwhile  the broader market is benefitting from the abundant cash flow from government bonds  real estate and gold  As long as investors avoid shares of European companies or those in emerging markets  cashing in from the Trump rally seems pretty easy Since the U S  presidential election  the Dow is up 4 5   And if the market continues to rally higher  the index is poised to end the year with around 9 9  gains  its best since 2013  Last week  the blue chip index shot up nearly 300 points  highlighting an 800 point rise since the election Trump Raises Hopes for Financial SectorInvestors continue to turn to banks as regulatory burden is likely to ease under Trump presidency  One such change will be the raising of the minimum asset threshold for banking behemoths to  250 billion from  50 billion  which will lend more flexibility  boost valuations  strengthen consolidation and increase lending Trump  in the meantime  views the Dodd Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure  especially  on smaller banks  Trump has called for repealing parts of the Dodd Frank Act  which has for a considerable period of time limited operational flexibility  As investors  eye relaxation under Trump  financial behemoths like The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS   have seen its shares surge 10  since the election Trump Victory  Big for Healthcare   ChemicalTrump remained silent on the drug pricing debate  which could mean fewer headwinds for the industry  Trump also announced plans to  repeal and replace  the Affordable Care Act  better known as Obamacare  Even though the act helps purchase insurance plans at a subsidized rate  it does levy taxes on the industry  which reduces profitability Trump s business tax plan  in the meantime  should benefit biotech companies  He plans to trim business tax rate to 15  from 35   The lower tax burden is expected to boost profits for large biotech companies  The chemical industry is also reeling under high taxes  America s corporate tax rate is the highest among the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development countries  Hence  Trump s victory is undoubtedly a boon for struggling chemical companies like Dow Chemical Co   NYSE DOW    LyondellBasell Industries   NYSE LYB    PPG Industries   NYSE PPG   and Praxair   NYSE PX   Trump s Win to Boost Restaurant Stocks If Trump successfully rolls back the Affordable Care Act  many restaurant chains won t have to provide health insurance to employees  while it s also highly unlikely that he would raise the federal minimum wage Meanwhile  deregulations or in other words less stringent rules will make it easier and cheaper for restaurants to operate  Less government interference would also mean that restaurants can focus on inventing new flavors of Doritos Locos tacos  for instance Industrial Companies Benefit from TrumpTrump is in favor of beefing up public spending by hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure  He said that he will support more spending on transportation and telecommunications infrastructure  clean water and electricity transmission in order to accelerate economic growth He is expected to offer  in tax credits to private construction companies undertaking infrastructure projects  Industrial companies like Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   have received a welcome boost  gaining more than 10  since the election When it comes to defense spending  Trump has promised greater outlays and troop expansion  Share prices of Lockheed Martin Corporation   NYSE LMT   and General Dynamics Corporation   NYSE GD   also moved north in recent times as defense spending is expected to rise under the Republican president  Both the companies rallied over 10  since Trump s victory 4 Blue Chips to Buy NowThe Dow is positioned to perform better once Trump takes office  thanks to his pro growth policies  Hence  it will be prudent to invest in companies listed in the blue chip index  And why not  Such stocks have large market capitalization  strong balance sheets and solid cash flow  while they also provide dividends  We have  thus  selected four such blue chip stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  operates as an investment banking  securities  and

128667,350182,PPG,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Dow Chemical  DuPont  Albemarle  Rockwood Holdings  Eastman Chemical And PPG Industries,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   August 11  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Chemicals  Part 2  including  Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW      DuPont  NYSE DD      Albemarle Corp      Rockwood Holdings  Inc   Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN       and PPG Industries Inc  NYSE PPG      

	Industry  Chemicals  Part 2

	Link  

	The chemical industry remains besieged by a number of challenges  including weak demand in agricultural and energy markets  a sluggish Chinese economy and headwinds from a strong dollar  Nevertheless  the industry remains on the road to recovery  gaining from healthy momentum across automotive and construction markets  There are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul  which we have highlighted below 

Shale Abundance Driving Chemical Spending

	The shale gas revolution in the U S  has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country  According to the American Chemistry Council  ACC   the U S  has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane  derived from shale gas  in the process 

	Driven by the abundant natural gas supply  chemical makers are ratcheting up investment on shale gas linked projects which is expected to beef up capacity  The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the U S  to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way 

	Per ACC  domestic chemical investment related to shale gas has reached as high as  164 billion  more than 60  of which are from firms outside the U S  Already 264 projects    many backed by the Federal government    have been announced by chemical makers to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies with 40  of them already complete or under construction  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years  The ACC expects average annual gains of more than 8  in U S  chemical industry capital spending through 2018 

Automotive in High Gear

	The automotive sector    a major chemical end use market    is witnessing significant momentum  The sector is enjoying the fruits of low gasoline prices  Outlook paints a rosy picture as global automotive sales are expected to rise 2 7  to 89 8 million units in 2016 on the back of strong volume growth in the U S  and Europe  according to IHS Automotive 

	The U S  auto industry also remains in top gear  U S  light vehicles  a key end user market for chemicals  sales hit all time high of around 17 5 million units in 2015 and are expected to rise further this year  aided by an improving job market  rising personal income  lower fuel prices and attractive financing options  New car and light truck sales are expected to reach to 17 7 million units in 2016 on the back of reduced gasoline prices and rising employment  as per The National Automobile Dealers Association  NADA  estimates 

	The Auto industry in Asian countries  especially China  is also expected to thrive over the next several years  As such  chemical makers are expected to gain from higher demand from this important end market 

Strategic Moves

	Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on high growth markets  driven by megatrends  in an effort to whittle down their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure  Moreover  cost cutting measures    including plant closures and headcount reduction    and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to yield industry wide margin improvements  Several chemical makers are also disposing non core assets as they shift their focus on high margin businesses 

Consolidations Gathering Steam

	Chemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth in a still difficult global economic environment  These companies continue to explore growth opportunities in the fast growing emerging markets  particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America  The industry saw a pick up in consolidation activities in 2014 and the momentum continued in 2015 

	Chemical companies are increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations  The  130 billion proposed mega merger of Dow Chemical    and DuPont        the biggest chemical deal ever    is a huge testimony to these strategic moves 

	Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include Albemarle Corp  s      6 2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings  Inc   Eastman Chemical Company s    purchase of specialty chemical company Taminco Corp  for  2 8 billion  PPG Industries Inc  s    acquisition of Mexican paint company Comex  among others

The daily chart above shows the last 12 months of a steady rise from October 2011  Price is now testing the upper resistance of the cup like consolidation over the last 2 and a half months  The momentum set up is favorable with the RSI tightening on 60 and the MACD rising  A break of that resistance higher would give a target of 215 to the upside  The recent history suggests protecting against the 190 area  Point and Figure traders might be concerned as the 3 box reversal chart using the Average True Range  ATR  for box size gives a price objective lower to 169  But if you get your hands dirty a print of 201 50 or higher will change that to a triple top break out with a new price objective of 217 75  This defines your trade

128791,350306,PPG,Top Trade Ideas For Week Of January 11  2016  D  EW  GNC  PPG  UNH,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Dominion Resources  N D 
Dominion Resources is the first utility to make the Top 10 in a long time  Many have broken out  but this one is rising and at a critical point for a trade  It is filling the gap from November and breaking the 200 day SMA  The RSI is rising and in the bullish zone while the MACD is also rising  Look for a break above the gap level to participate 
Edwards Lifesciences  N EW 
Edwards Lifesciences made a top in late November and has been pulling back since  Friday it accelerated lower and that move brought the RSI down into the bearish zone  The MACD continues to fall as well  With the 100 day SMA just below  look for a break below it to follow to the downside 
GNC  N GNC 
GNC made a top in August as it pushed out of consolidation  but then failed and trended lower  There was a strong selling spike down in October upon release of their earnings report and then again in November on news of a Federal Enforcement Action  But since then it has consolidated and is now slowly turning higher  Friday brought it to the November high with the Bollinger Bands  opening  The RSI is rising and on the edge of the bullish zone with the MACD also rising  Look for a push over the November high to participate to the upside 
PPG Industries  N PPG 
PPG Industries had a solid bounce off of the bottom made at the start of October  But that move sputtered as it pushed over 100 and it has now been falling against trend support  The RSI is falling and bearish and the MACD is falling too  Look for a push under support to accelerate the move lower 
UnitedHealth Group  N UNH 
UnitedHealth Group has built a yearlong consolidation over support after a strong move higher  Heading into the week it is testing that support again  with the RSI in the bearish zone and the MACD falling  Look for a break of support to enter on the short side  The consolidation has the look of a rounding top and that could mean there is major downside opportunity 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  the worst first week of the New Year ever  Now heading into January options expiration there really does not look to be any relief in sight for the equity markets 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue the bounce higher in its downtrend while crude oil burns lower  The US dollar index looks to continue consolidation at its highs while US Treasuries are biased higher in consolidation  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside and looking really ugly 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts also point lower with perhaps a pause or oversold bounce in the short run  but with their intermediate term charts moving decidedly more bearish  The one possible exception is the QQQ which remains somewhat above the August lows  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

128792,350307,PPG,PPG  A Dividend Growth Machine,opinion,"PPG Industries  N PPG  has rewarded its investors with higher dividend payments for 44 consecutive years  The company s dividend appears to be one of the safest in the market with high growth potential as well 
What makes this blue chip dividend stock so special  Let s take a closer look Business OverviewPPG s roots can be traced back to 1883  Today  the company is a leading supplier of paints  coatings  and specialty materials to customers in construction  45  of sales   automotive  33    industrial  14    and aerospace and marine  8   markets  Coatings provide protection  performance  and decoration for a wide range of products  improving their durability and marketability 
Approximately 60  of PPG s 2014 sales were special purpose coatings  aerospace  automotive OEM  general industrial  packaging  marine  etc   with the remaining 40  related to architectural applications 
By geography  about 47  of PPG s 2014 sales were in North America  31  in EMEA  16  in Asia Pacific  and 6  in Latin America  Altogether  PPG has a presence in more than 70 countries Business AnalysisCoatings are essential materials that make products last longer and look more appealing  For example  they make cars more resistant to corrosion and beverage cans more visually appealing 
Some categories of coatings are more valuable than others  Consumers looking to repaint part of their home are going to be more sensitive to the price of paint  they perceive it as being an undifferentiated product  than an original equipment manufacturer  OEM  that is trying to improve the fuel efficiency and durability of its vehicles 
As we mentioned earlier  the majority of PPG s sales  60   are special purpose coatings  which target higher value applications  The company has historically invested 3  of sales in R D  which amounted to more than  500 million last year 
As a result of its investments  PPG is better able to protect its customers  assets in some of the world s most demanding conditions and environments and attain higher margins than most of its peers 
In automotive markets  PPG s coatings can be applied on numerous substrates including fiberglass  composites  and metallic surfaces for resistance to corrosion  chemicals  and rain erosion  PPG s coatings also take advantage of a  wet on wet  application process that lowers customers  capital costs and requires less energy  Customers can reduce the number of steps necessary to paint a vehicle by eliminating the primer layer 
In aerospace markets  PPG s technologies can reduce over 1 000 pounds per plane  improving aircraft fuel efficiencies  Not surprisingly  the company has demonstrated excellent pricing power over the last decade 
Source  PPG Investor Presentation
PPG s long standing customer relationships  economies of scale  and focus on specialty products has helped it maintain number one market share positions in aerospace  automotive OEM  and refinish   collision markets  The company is also number two in packaging  general industrial  and architectural markets 
Despite being the largest player in the  130 billion coatings market  PPG s market share is still less than 12   With a high degree of fragmentation  the coatings market provides PPG with plenty of opportunity for continued growth and acquisitions 
Another aspect we like about this business is that approximately half of PPG s coatings sales are related to aftermarket and maintenance coatings  which generates a stable base of cash flow each year  Producing coatings also requires relatively little capital which  when combined with PPG s excellent margins  results in impressive free cash flow generation Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  we like the strategic path that PPG s management team has taken over the last decade  Coatings only accounted for 55  of PPG s revenue in 2005  Through a mix of acquisitions  organic growth  and divestitures of non core businesses  high margin coatings products increased to 935 of PPG s total sales in 2014 PPG s Key RisksOver the near term  changes in key raw material prices  e g  titanium dioxide  can whip around PPG s profits  The health of key end markets such as construction and automotive will also impact demand for PPG s coatings 
However  thinking longer term  we believe coatings will continue to be used for many years to come  While we certainly wouldn t be the first to find out  it s hard to imagine a new technology displacing coatings  Perhaps the bigger risk is that competitors reduce their technology gap with PPG  which begins to pressure the industry s margins in what used to be lucrative  special purpose  coatings 
Overall  we think the most likely risk over the next few years is a downturn in PPG s core end markets  which it can do little to protect against Dividend Analysis  PPGWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
With a Dividend Safety Score of 99  PPG s dividend is one of the safest in the market 
PPG s earnings and free cash flow payout ratios over the last 12 months are 27  and 42   respectively  As seen below  the company s free cash flow payout ratio has remained stable and below 40  for most of the past decade  highlighting the consistency of PPG s business and the healthy cash flow cushion that protects the dividend  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
In addition to payout ratios  analyzing a firm s performance during the last recession can provide further clues about its business quality and the safety of its dividend  For example  a 50  payout ratio today might appear attractive  but what if the company became unprofitable during the last recession  The dividend might not be as safe as it appears 
As seen below  PPG s sales fell by 23  in fiscal year 2009  Not surprisingly  construction  automotive  and industrial markets were especially hit hard during this time  Despite PPG s decline in revenue  it managed to slightly improve its free cash flow in 2009 compared to 2008  As we mentioned earlier  PPG generates roughly half of its sales from aftermarket products and services  which are less discretionary in nature and provide more consistent cash flows Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As a result of its low capital intensity and focus on higher margin specialty coatings markets  PPG has generated excellent returns on invested capital over the last decade for a chemical business and created value for shareholders Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Looking at the balance sheet  PPG appears to be in good shape  The company has an A  credit rating from S P  and we can see why  The company could cover its entire debt with cash on hand and just 1 6 years of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   Its free cash flow generation last year nearly covered dividends paid by a factor of three as well  PPG s dividend is very safe Source  Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
PPG has raised its dividend for 44 straight years  including a 7 5  increase in April 2015  The company continues to have excellent long term dividend growth potential with a Dividend Growth Score of 77 
As seen below  this dividend aristocrat has accelerated its dividend growth rate from 4 3  per year over the last 10 fiscal years to 6 5  per year over the last three years  With low payout ratios and solid prospects to continue consolidating the fragmented coatings industry  we expect at least mid single digit dividend growth to continue and believe PPG will be crowned a dividend king by 2022 Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationPPG trades at about 15x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 1 5   which is slightly lower than its five year average dividend yield of 1 65  
While currency headwinds and sluggish global growth are weighing on near term results  we believe PPG can compound its earnings by 6 8  per year over the long term  The coatings market should grow by around the same pace as global GDP  2 3  per year  and PPG will likely continue making acquisitions  1 2    repurchasing shares  1 2    and expanding margins via productivity improvements and sales mix  1 2   
If this plays out  the stock would appear to offer total return potential of 8 10  per year  which is slightly better than the market s 7  historical average return and reasonably attractive for a business of PPG s quality ConclusionOther than its low dividend yield  sensitivity to raw material prices  foreign currency fluctuations  and cyclical end markets such as construction  there s really not much to dislike about PPG  The company appears to be well positioned in numerous profitable niches  has a leading portfolio of coatings technologies  regularly pushes through price increases  and generates excellent free cash flow each year  With less than 12  share of the global market  growth opportunities shouldn t be a problem either 
While PPG s dividend yield is relatively low  1 5   and its dividend growth hasn t ramped up yet because the company is reinvesting in itself and acquisitions  we think this is an interesting business for truly long term dividend growth investors  PPG s starting dividend yield is below the threshold we like for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  but we will continue watching this proven compounder ",2016-02-05,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ppg:-a-dividend-growth-machine-383487,383487
128811,350326,PPG,Blue Chip Dividend Growth Stocks Today s Strong Option For Retirement Portfolios   Part 1 ,opinion,There is a confluence of factors that are painting a very odd picture of current investor behavior  Common sense and a careful analysis of the market dynamics between equities and bonds today would indicate that investors should be acting in the exact opposite manner than they are  Interest rates are hovering at a 100 year low  which creates two problems for investors  First  there is not enough return from bonds to fund a retiree s income needs or to fight inflation  Second  investing in bonds with interest rates so low makes it riskier to own bonds today than it has been in over a century Conversely  many US equities  especially blue chip dividend paying equities with long histories of paying and increasing their dividends are at historically low valuations  and therefore  offering historically above average current yields  Furthermore  high quality blue chip US corporations are perhaps in better financial health than we ve seen in decades  Consequently  low valuation and healthy corporate financials would indicate that quality equities offer lower real levels of risk and higher long term returns than they have in decades Nevertheless  investors are not only making a classic mistake  I believe they are making a very obvious and thus quite avoidable mistake  It is an undeniable fact that bond prices go down when interest rates go up  Since interest rates cannot go to zero or below  it logically follows that interest rates have nowhere to go over the long term but up  Perhaps  as many believe  federal intervention may keep rates low for another year or so  But in the longer run  the powerful forces of the market can only be contained for so long Yet given what I ve already said  we continue to see that bond mutual fund inflows remain at a record high  while simultaneously equity fund outflows are some of the largest on record  In other words  investors are selling stocks  the undervalued out of favor asset class and investing into the most overvalued asset class   U S  Treasury bonds  I believe that people are forgetting that bond prices can fluctuate just like stocks  And with interest rates at such an extreme low level  bond price fluctuations could be more severe than equities have been even during their worst days The Evident Risk Profile of BondsIn searching the Internet for a long term graphic on 10 year U S  Treasury notes I came across the following 110 year chart courtesy of the financial blog Observations  Although the chart from 1950 through 2010 illustrates a clear mirror image of interest rate behavior  the portion going back to 1900 is even more illuminating  This is not statistical mumbo jumbo showing correlation without causation  this is a factual depiction of interest rates spanning over 110 years  This casts a bright light on the risk of bonds to anyone that understands the interest rate and bond price relationship  Rates clearly have nowhere to go but up long term  and when they do  prices of existing bonds will collapse  To be clear  I didn t say drop  I said collapse  Bond buyers beware To summarize  the only rational reason that people are eschewing stocks in favor of bonds is fear  The precipitous drop in stock prices during the great recession has yet to be forgotten  On the other hand  what is forgotten is the fact that the same thing can happen to bonds as well  Therefore  I believe the irrationally exuberant confidence in bonds is ill gotten  The only reason bond prices haven t fallen in 30 years is because interest rates have been falling since the early 1980s  When interest rates fall  bond prices go up and therefore an even greater aura of safety surrounds bonds  Keep in mind  although prices on pre issued bonds will go to a premium as interest rates are falling  the premium vanishes at maturity  Furthermore  at maturity  investors are forced to reinvest in new bonds at lower rates than they had on the existing bonds that matured  Regardless  stability with bond values makes people feel good  This was not true from 1950 to the early 1980s  When interest rates are rising  holders of existing bonds will see their principal devastated  Consequently  they will have less capital available to invest in the new and higher interest rates when they occur  As a result  even though rates go higher  investors will fail to take advantage of it because they will have less money to invest The Case for Blue chip Dividend Paying StocksOne of the biggest misconceptions that I believe people erroneously hold regarding equities is the notion that all equities are the same  In truth  equities come in many different flavors  some good and some not so good  therefore  to paint all equities with the same brush stroke is both misleading and unfair  This is why I so vehemently argue against evaluating and even making investment decisions based on generalities like  the stock market is high or the stock market is low   Instead  I believe in evaluating each specific holding that I might consider thus making my decisions on a case by case and I feel more rational basis Additionally  there are several facts regarding the long term ownership of quality dividend paying equities that many people either overlook or forget  But perhaps the most important fact is that any of the damage that the great recession caused was only temporary in nature for the prudent and intelligently patient investor  The prudent investor is defined as one who in the first place  was careful to only invest in blue chip equities when valuations made sense  This is especially true for the best of breed blue chips that continued to generate strong earnings during the recession and consequently raised their dividends  Inevitably  the stock prices on quality companies whose earnings held up eventually return to fair value It s true that generally speaking  their stock prices did drop along with most other stocks  but because their businesses remained strong and healthy their stock prices did recover  and as I already stated  the income that they generated never faltered  In other words  as long as the stocks were not panic sold out into price weakness  existing shareholders soon recovered their temporary losses while continuing to enjoy a steadily growing dividend income stream along the way  As I also stated before  it s not the volatility itself that represents risk  but rather the emotional reaction to volatility which is where the real risk sits Two classic examples of what I m describing thus far can be found by examining the businesses behind McDonald s Corp   MCD  and Kimberly Clark Corp  KMB  in conjunction with how the marketplace treated their stock prices during the great recession  I will utilize the F A S T  Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  to vividly illustrate my points  To focus the reader  my points are that even a catastrophic event such as the great recession of 2008  did not have a permanent long term effect on best of breed companies that were able to maintain their businesses in spite of the economic challenges McDonald s Corp  During the Recessionary YearsMy first example  McDonald s Corp   represents a Dividend Champion and Dividend Aristocrat blue chip with a consistent  above average and clearly recession resistant track record of earnings and dividend growth  Nevertheless  the stock price of McDonald s shares did fall from a high of 67 to a low of  45 79 in calendar year 2008  but quickly recovered back to  64 75 by year end 2009  and continued on to its current price in excess of  91 per share  Even more interestingly  McDonald s was very generous to their shareholders during and coming out of the great recession with large dividend increases  My point being  that as long as McDonald s shareholders didn t panic because of the pessimistic stock market behavior  they ended up being richly rewarded for their confidence and rational behavior Kimberly Clark During The Recessionary YearsWith my second example  I chose a high quality blue chip that also had a consistent record of earnings and dividend growth  however  at not nearly the same rate as McDonald s achieved  Furthermore  Kimberly Clark did experience a very minor drop in earnings during the recession which led to a more precipitous  but temporary drop in their stock price  Once again  we see that the stock price recovered in short order with little long term damage to shareholders  especially those that only purchased Kimberly Clark when the price was aligned with its earnings justified valuation Just as we saw with McDonald s  Kimberly Clark shareholders enjoyed a rising dividend income stream right through the great recession  Although Kimberly Clark does not grow as fast as McDonald s  it is clearly a quality blue chip holding that is also a Dividend Champion and Dividend Aristocrat  for those that are not aware this means that the company has increased its dividend for at least 25 straight years in a row  A Fascinating and Unexpected Lesson Learned From The Great RecessionUp to this point  I ve been building a case that there are many quality Dividend Champions and Dividend Aristocrats that from a business perspective weathered the great recession in fine fashion  Nevertheless  this did not protect their shareholders from a precipitous  albeit temporary  drop in stock price  Consequently  I have personally intended to covet companies that were able to maintain a high level of earnings strength even during challenging economic circumstances  like recessions As I have contended in this article  and others  as long as solid operating results remain intact  then I believe that shareholders have little to worry about except fear itself  Stock price volatility is often more a function of the emotional response than it is the rational response in the short run  However  in the longer run  I have long believed that dialectic thinking will prevail and rational behavior will follow  In other words  I was confident that stock prices will inevitably return to their fundamentally justified valuations  But interestingly  the recent recession may have taught this old dog a few new tricks As I was reviewing the performance of quality dividend paying companies post recession  I came across a startling fact that is  partially at least  counterintuitive to what I have long believed  I discovered that quality companies that experienced a sharp drop in earnings during the recession that soon returned to normal profitability actually outperformed the steady eddies like McDonald s and Kimberly Clark  etc  However  I still believe that this outperformance is accomplished within a much higher level of risk  Nevertheless  the principle that stock price will inevitably track earnings justified valuations remains intact The following table reviews three high quality blue chips that experienced a temporary  but very sharp drop in earnings during the great recession of 2008  McDonald s Corp  has been added to the list to provide a benchmark of performance  Note by reviewing the far right column that each of these three examples significantly outperformed the more consistent McDonald s Corp  over the time frame 12 31  2008 to 5 16 2012  In the case of PPG Industries Inc   PPG   the outperformance is rather startling  and is more than double the annual rate of return of McDonald s PPG Industries Inc    The Power of an Earnings RecoveryPersonally  I believe it is unwise to underestimate the power and protection available from investing in established US Corporation like PPG Industries Inc  The following brief history of the company taken directly from their website validates my thesis  Company History   PPG Industries  vision is to continue to be the world s leading coatings and specialty products company  Through leadership in innovation  sustainability and color  PPG helps customers in industrial  transportation  consumer products  and construction markets and after market to enhance more surfaces in more ways than does any other company  Founded in 1883  PPG has global headquarters in Pittsburgh and operates in more than 60 countries around the world  Sales in 2011 were  14 9 billion  Our success is driven by a tradition of well regarded product and process technology  management and ethical standards  Join us for a look back on more than 125 years of breakthrough ideas and transforming innovations  Once again  I will turn to the F A S T  Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  to illustrate the opportunity within a temporary interruption in the operating results of a quality established blue chip US corporation  The point of this exercise is to establish the realization that it s not a good idea to underestimate the power and value of an established US corporation  As the legendary Warren Buffett so eloquently once put it   fear is the foe of the faddist  but the friend of the fundamentalist  Although PPG Industries remained a profitable company even during the throes of the great recession  as you can see by the graph below the company has experienced two years in a row of falling earnings  Nevertheless  even though their earnings and price both fell  the company did manage to moderately increase its dividend each year  But the real focal point of the following graph is that you can t keep a good company down  Notice how the company flexed its operating muscle as earnings sharply rebounded  increasing 78  off of a low base   orange shading  Consequently  the years 2010 and 2011 represented years where the company announced staggering growth rates in their earnings per share  And  as I ve already pointed out  even though these growth rates were coming off of a low base  the market responded with a rapidly recovering stock value The following graph focuses on the low price of  28 16 in 2009 that resulted in a 55  drop from its high of  62 31  Clearly  such a price drop would unnerve many investors  especially those without a strong foundation of understanding the business  Sadly  this would have caused many shareholders to become panic stricken and thus sell at precisely the time when they should have been adding to their position  The reader should note that the following performance calculation is based on the closing price on 12 31 2008 of  42 43  The price did fall approximately another 30  to  28 16 before it started to recover  Therefore  the annualized compound rate of return of 32  per annum is not measured from its lowest price  In other words  the courageous and perhaps brilliant  lucky  investor would have had an opportunity to generate an even higher return off of all time lows  The following two graphs review Johnson Controls  JCI  and Franklin Resources Inc   BEN  and illustrates the same phenomenon of powerful price advances stimulated by the recovering earnings of blue chip companies  Once again illustrating that the greatest risk of volatile stock prices from quality US companies  even those with a temporary drop in earnings  lies within the reaction to volatility more than the volatility itself  In other words  fear is riskier than the business cycle Summary and ConclusionsThere are many pundits and prognosticators that never weary of attempting to convince investors on how risky it is to invest in equities  even high quality dividend blue chip paying equities  Invariably  they will always point to volatility as the evidence supporting their thesis that stocks are too risky of an investment for retirees  Personally  I believe this is a great travesty that is prominently promogulated upon an unwary investing public  Hopefully  it is more out of ignorance of the true facts than it is by bad intentions  The inevitable interruptions in the business cycle have conditioned people into believing that stocks are riskier than they really are  at least in my opinion Furthermore  I believe that it s important that investors understand that portfolios cannot be managed for Armageddon  If the world economies are truly coming to an end  as many would like us to believe  then frankly there is absolutely nothing we can do to protect ourselves  If our greatest corporations were to all go bankrupt in one fell swoop  there would be no sanctuary to be found  Bonds would be no good  real estate would be no good  gold would be no good because there would be nothing that we could buy with any of  Under that scenario  the only things of value would be a well fortified bunker full of food and water  and enough ammunition to fend off the starving hordes that would be trying to take away from us  Not an existence that I would be too interested in Therefore  I contend that a much more rational approach is to build portfolios that are based on successful outcomes  Common stocks represent ownership in not only our greatest corporations  but also our very economy itself  Frankly  most of our great corporations will more likely than not be in existence long after most of us are gone  Accordingly  I feel that it is rather foolish to be afraid to invest in them  especially when they can be bought at attractive valuations  This is true even when  and perhaps especially when those attractive valuations are the result of a temporary economic crisis  I don t believe it s a sound strategy to sell our country  our economy  or our great corporations short In part two of this series I will present and review a list of Dividend Champions that I believe are currently on sale  The second part of this series will represent a follow up and update to my previous article  As I have discussed in this article and many previous articles  I believe investors should behave according to the advice of legendary hockey star Wayne Gretzky who taught us  I skate to where the puck is going to be  not where it has been    In that vein  I believe that tomorrow successful investors will follow Wayne Gretzky s lead For the past several decades bonds have been a great refuge of safety and attractive return  especially for the investor desirous of income  But I believe a careful examination of the 110 year old 10 year Treasury bond history presented in this article indicates that that is about to change  Conversely  I believe the future for US based dividend paying equities is quite bright  At least that is where I recommend skating in today s investment environment

128812,350327,PPG,PPG Industries Is So Boring You Should Own It,opinion,Want a solid steady stock that keeps rising and pays a decent dividend  Try PPG Industries  PPG  Yes they make protective and decorative coatings  and pays a slightly over 2  dividend  What makes this stock interesting to me is that it a very good technical set up as well  Let me explain  The daily chart below shows a steady rise out of consolidation from November 2010 through February 2011 until it met resistance at 107 5 and consolidated there for the last 3 months  That move from a base at 82 50 to the new base around 102 5 establishes a Measured Move higher to 127 50 on the break over that 107 50 consolidation  Now that it has retested the breakout level and held this stock is ready for a trade entry  Using a stop under the 107 50 with a target of 127 50 level would yield a 15  gain against a 3  downside  A 5 1 reward to risk ratio  And the 3 box reversal Point and Figure chart lines up with this upside bias as well  carrying a 125 Price Objective  Slow  steady  boring and a dividend  Bring it on PPG Industries  PPG  DailyYou like it but at  111 it is too pricy  No problem  Since the previous move high took about 4 months to complete you can look to the end of November for the next as an approximation  Using the November 110 Calls  offered at  6 50 late Monday  cuts the capital outlay by 94   Cut that down to  4 60 by also selling the November 95 Puts for  1 90  a strike below the last consolidation range  It has a lot of previous trading history to work through to move below 95  You can reduce it further by spreading them against the November 130 Calls when it has risen in price enough to get back all of your initial outlay  Of course if you play the options the dividend is not a factor  but the potential  15 payoff at  125 in November on a  4 60 outlay is 226  return  Disclaimer  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2012-07-31,Gregory W.

128814,350329,PPG,Best   Worst ETFs   Mutual Funds  Materials Sector,opinion,The Materials sector ranks sixth out of the ten sectors as detailed in my Sector Rankings for ETFs and Mutual Funds report  It gets my Dangerous rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 10 ETFs and 15 mutual funds in the Materials sector as of July 9  2013   Figure 1 ranks  from best to worst  the nine Materials ETFs that meet our liquidity standards and Figure 2 ranks from best to worst the ten Materials mutual funds that meet our liquidity standards  Not all Materials sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the equal  The number of holdings varies widely  from 29 to 140   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks   To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Materials sector  investors need a predictive ratingbased on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  My fund rating methodology is detailed here   Investors should not buy any Materials ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this sector  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long historyof not paying off   Get my ratings on all ETFs and

and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  zero out of 10 Materials ETFs and zero out of 15 Materials mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating The takeaways are  mutual fund managers allocate too much capital to low quality stocks and Materials ETFs hold poor quality stocks Figure 3  Materials Sector Landscap For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  The fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management   Investors need to tread carefully when considering Materials ETFs and mutual funds  as no funds in this sector carry enough good stocks to earn an Attractive rating  Investors should instead focus on the individual stocks in this sector   PPG Industries  PPG  is one of my favorite stocks held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Attractive rating  PPG has grown profits  NOPAT  by 10  annually since 2001  and has a return on invested capital  ROIC  of 13   Over this period  PPG has also increased its NOPAT margins from 7  to 11   Economic earnings have increased substantially over this period  from   192 million in 2001 to  685 million in 2012  Best of all  PPG is priced modestly at   153 23 share  which gives it a price to economic book value ratio of 1 4  By comparison  the stocks in XLB have an average price to economic book value ratio of 2 0  PPG is a company with solid fundamentals trading at a significant discount compared to its peers   Dow Chemical  DOW  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Dangerous rating  Although Dow s revenue has been climbing since 1998  its profits  NOPAT  have fallen below their 2004 levels  Its return on invested capital  ROIC  has also fallen to 5   down from 13  in 2005  On top of this  Dow has earned negative economic earnings for 14 of the last 15 years  Despite its declining profitability  Dow is priced for significant growth at   33 09 share  To justify its valuation  Dow needs to grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for 10 years  High expectations combined with a weak track record make DOW a risky
