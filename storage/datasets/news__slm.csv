Navient  NASDAQ NAVI  surged 6  after rejecting the  12 50 a share offer from fund managers Canyon Capital Advisors and Platform Equity Advisors claiming it undervalued the company 
Canyon explained in a letter to Navient that it was prepared to raise the offer price if  issues  that were uncovered in due diligence were addressed 
 As we told you  that price was simply an initial indication of interest  We raised issues that we uncovered in our diligence and we told you that we had room to raise our price to the extent those issues were addressed   Canyon said 
The fund manager fueled hopes a deal could still be in the offing saying it remains prepared to continue talks with Navient on the issues raised  in the hope of ultimately arriving at a mutually satisfactory acquisition agreement

Prepared Remarks   OperatorGood morning  My name is Henry  and I will be your conference operator today  At this time  I would like to welcome everyone to the 2019 Q4 Sallie Mae earnings call   Operator instructions  Now I would like to turn the call over to our presenter today  Mr  Brian Cronin  vice president of investor relations  Sir  you may begin your conference Brian Cronin    Vice President of Investor Relations Thank you  Henry  and good morning  and welcome to Sallie Mae s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call  With me today is Ray Quinlan  our CEO  and Steve McGarry  our CFO  After the prepared remarks  we will open up the call for questions  Before we begin  keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions  expectations and forward looking statements  Actual results in the future may be materially different than those discussed here  This could be due to a variety of factors  Listeners should refer to the discussion of the factors in the company s Form 10 Q and other filings with the SEC  During this conference call  we will refer to non GAAP measures we call our core earnings A description of core earnings  a full reconciliation to GAAP measures and our GAAP results can be found in the earnings supplement for the quarter ended December 31  2019  This is posted  along with the earnings press release  on the Investors page at salliemae com  Thank you  I ll now turn the call over to Ray  Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Brian  and thank you all for your attention this morning  We have quite a bit of information to discuss  and I will  one  do a brief outline of how we plan to do that and then secondarily go through those items  after which we ll go to the Q A session  So our outline today will be to discuss 2019  followed by our evolution over these last six years and then the evolutionary change within the focus of the    on the franchise going forward  After that  we ll talk about a multiyear outlook for both the industry  as well as for Sallie Mae  followed by capital allocation  our approach to it  the steps we ve taken  what has led us to this particular point and where we expect to go in the future  After that  we ll cover the impact of these changes  which are asset sales  repurchases  CECL and a couple of other things  their impact on our business metrics  which will be somewhat of a discontinuity given the change in profile of the company  talk about the franchise going forward and what our aspirations are  and then we will discuss 2020 guidance and the three year outlook  So turning to the first of those  which is the 2019 performance  2019 was a very good year  Our earnings per share  as you know   1 27  up from  1 07  19  growth  Our volume came in at  5 6 billion  plus 6   Our efficiency ratio continues to improve somewhat dramatically from 41  in  18 to 34 7  in  19  15  improvement rate on rate  Our charge offs are on model  actually a little bit better than the model for the last two years in a row  So credit is under control  Our NIM  which was 5 76   it will continue to be impacted by the increase in liquidity that we ve discussed in prior three quarters  and it was a good number  We hit on where we wanted it to be  but it still will decrease to a number just over 5   5 05   5 10   We ll talk about that going forward  but that s just a reflection of additional liquidity on the balance sheet  Our expenses came in at  574 million  up from  557 million in the prior year  plus 3   And as you ll see in the outlook  expense control is one of our shining accomplishments these last few years  And our ROE at 20 7  remains a terrific number  Consolidations were up from  991 million to  1 512 billion  an increase that is largely explained by the maturation of the portfolio but still a worrying number  which we will continue to watch carefully  It is a case also that as we looked at our customers  customers had a very good year  It was the year we achieved the J D  Power certification  We re the only ones in the industry that have that  It s a terrific credential for us and helps in all of our audiences  the schools  the regulators and the customers  Customer satisfaction at 80  is an all time high across the channels of contact with them  We ve introduced a chat and chatbox    bot  and the satisfaction on that is running 92   We ve done over half a million transactions and so that s a terrific improvement in the course of this year  We have introduced the Amazon Lex bot  which is now answering 40  of the questions that we receive from customers  So we are carrying our interface with them to the channels and to the methods that they would prefer to interface with us on  and the satisfaction reflects the fact that that is a good meeting of the minds  Our complaints per 100 000 customers have dropped by 42  over the last four years  almost in half and once again reflects the items above the high satisfaction  the improvement in servicing and  of course  the resolution on first talk or first conversation which people are all looking for  Our credit quality continues to be flat  which is at a very good level  747 FICOs  cosigners at 90   So with that as a backdrop  let s talk about the life cycle of the company  Our story continues  We had our launch and establishment in 2014 and  15  We had rapid growth  As those of you who followed us for several years know  in  16   17  and  18  filling up our inventory to match our acquisition engine  We had a normalizing of profile in 2019  including capital return  And as we go forward  2020 and beyond  we will now turn to realizing the full potential of our franchise in the market with customers and with investors  We have a terrific opportunity in front of us  and we ll talk about that more as we move along  In regard to our focus  we have an evolutionary change  We are suspending personal loan originations  We have about a billion dollars in our portfolio  We accomplished what we wanted to there  which was we successfully introduced a second product with the opportunity for revenue increases  We re watching that portfolio  We have no intention of getting back into that market at the moment  but it remains an asset that we can use selectively going forward if conditions warrant it  Credit card  on the other hand  continues its flight pattern  We will continue to invest in credit card and in 2020 will be  0 05 per share investment  I ll talk about that as we go to look forward  And we will be concentrating on additional services for families and students as we approach the next level of our franchise  which is to improve the core  helping people out with scholarships  college search  tutoring  paying for college and their next step in life as they go to attain employment  The need for higher education is high  will continue  it will expand  and it will evolve  And there will be factors involved that include the original traditional schools  distance learning  international boot camps  certification  additional credentializing and  importantly  life long learning  And so our outlook is that regardless of who gets elected in the United States in the election  we have a bright future with this particular audience and our way of approaching it  We expect the market growth to be between 5  and 10   5   6   7   We re monitoring that now  We have some guidance on it  but it s subject to additional analysis  We expect our revenue to track consistent with that and our income to be slightly better than our revenue growth  And so the need for education is pro GDP  as it grows faster than GDP and will continue to do that for the next two decades based upon the analysis that we have  Capital allocation  Phase 1  as you know  which was  14   15   16   17   18  no capital return  no dividends as we grew the company  In 2019  we start with our capital program with two factors  One  establishing a dividend  which we believe should continue in perpetuity  It was at  0 12 per share  And we  at that time  identified  200 million as a buyback  We caveated that we were doing it as a transaction as opposed to a program  Because at that time  we still had a reasonable amount of uncertainty associated with CECL  And we said what we would do is come back in a year when CECL was known and then reset our expectations for both the company  as well as for capital allocation  Well  now as we speak  CECL is in place  We ve done all the analysis associated with it  We ve had outside vendors such as PwC and EY look at our calculations  Regulators have gone through every step with us  so we think that s known territory taken into account in our projections  And so we expect CECL to be nonvolatile  We will continue to increase our dividend  Our intention is to increase that associated with the growth in EPS  We are now initiating asset sales at  3 billion per year  and the  3 billion for the gain that we expect on the sale and the capital that is freed up as a consequence of not having those assets on the balance sheet will allow us to execute on our authorized  600 million buyback  When we did that  the authorization is significant  And while the price has changed quite a bit in the last 24 hours  at that time  just to put it in perspective   600 million buyback was against a  3 6 billion market cap  That would be a 17  buyback at that time for the total company  We expect the allocation and the buybacks and the sales to continue for the next three years   20   21  and  22  Our equity we believe to be significantly undervalued  We have had it evaluated by several top firms  And as long as the equity is undervalued and the assets are fairly valued because the assets are extremely high quality  we will continue to exercise our discretion in buying that stock until such time as the valuation approaches what we believe it should be  And so this will be an ongoing program  And if we look at the capital returns that we had from last year  the 2019 numbers with the dividend  plus the buyback of  200 million  we go forward with these guidance that we have given to the entire investment community over the course of four years  in 2019   20   21  and  22  the entire capital return will be approximately  1 9 billion  roughly half of our market cap  We expect our asset sales to be completed during the first quarter  and we expect 80  of the buybacks to occur during the first quarter with a 20  spread out through the rest of the year  When we do these changes  which are now asset sales  buyback  CECL and the liquidity increase that I mentioned earlier  there will be a significant impact on key business metrics  The EPS will be distorted  The nature of CECL  which is to allocate life of loan losses to the loan loss reserve upon the day that you acquire a new customer  will on an ongoing basis distort our EPS  And it s also the case that  of course  when you re selling assets  you will distort the revenue and the earnings associated with that EPS  And when you buy back stock  it will also distort the EPS  So when we give guidance  we fully expect to articulate the path from where we were to where we are  but there will be significant changes in the level  as well as the pathing going forward  Those four items  CECL  asset sales  share repurchases  and increased liquidity  have to be taken into account in every income statement metric  as well as every balance sheet metric  The ROEs will be affected  Of course  CECL lowers ROEs  The ROE is heavily impacted by asset sales  The efficiency ratio will be on a new trend line associated with the change in the profile of the business  The NIM  as I mentioned earlier  will continue to trend on down from numbers that were in the 5 8s  numbers that are 5 05   5 10   And the outlook will be given year by year and the discretionary impact of the asset sales will be taken into account  And so we expect to spend a significant amount of time with all of our key audiences  the investors  the analysts and prospects  going forward because there s a lot to digest  and we want to make sure that we are all on the same page  As we think about the franchise going forward  we attempt    we will attempt to be the premier brand for college and continuing education  helping families and students build prosperous futures by providing access  planning outcomes and helping them responsibly fund their futures  We would help them with their key decisions  especially the students  but the parents are close partners on this  What do I want to study  Where do I want to go for it  What do I want to be when the program is complete  How will I pay for it  Can I get help in getting into graduation with tutoring and other support services  And how do I continue to improve my skills over the rest of my life  We will have partners in this  We re not going to build these capabilities by ourselves  There are several very attractive partners  We re in the middle of negotiating with them now  And we will expect this to be a multiyear evolution  changing from a narrow funder of education loans  once people have made those decisions to  hopefully  be a partner with families and students as they evaluate their future  make decisions and then execute them in order to have a more prosperous future  We have a unique opportunity  and it s in a vital sector  and this whole sector  including ourselves  have a very promising future  We would like to be the go to resource for education  So with that in mind  key takeaways for today are  19 was a great year  We continued to evolve the franchise  which is the discontinuance of the personal loan originations  as well as credit card growth  Expense management over the course of three years is up about 1 5  compounded  EPS in  19 was up 20     19   my mistake  The capital return program is rational  The dividends will continue  and the buybacks will be on the parameters that I discussed  We are  obviously  very closely watching the presidential election  but we don t believe it actually will have much impact on the industry  We are watching carefully consolidation loss as we look at two potential risks for the company  Our organic growth going forward will track the industry  and we expect the industry to grow 5  to 6   our revenue to grow along with that and our EPS to grow a little bit better  In regard to specific guidance  the core earnings of  1 85 to  1 91 is a GAAP to GAAP comparison  It will be up 48  from 2019 to 2020 and clearly reflects the asset sales  Provisions for credit losses at that  285 million to  305 million are on model as the last two years have been  same with the portfolio net charge offs  Originations at 6  will track where the industry has been moving  although  as I mentioned earlier  we re doing more analytics in regard to that to see if there s increased opportunity for us on that subject  As I mentioned  expense management over the course of what will be now three years growing at 1 5  has greatly helped our profitability efficiency ratios and returns  Loan sales of  3 billion will continue  On the three year horizon  we expect the 6  growth to continue  We expect the loan sales to continue at  3 billion  We expect the balance sheet to be flat at  32 billion  and the EPS will jump up on at 48   and then as we said in the guidance  proceed after that with mid single digits  and that s a number that is tentatively out there  We ll talk about it a lot  I m sure  over the next year or so  And we expect the capital return to continue as long as market conditions are as I described  but the dividend  we believe  is now just a baked in part of the franchise  So with that information run by  I just want to thank you for your attention  and then let s turn to Q A if that s all right  Brian Brian Cronin    Vice President of Investor Relations Henry  we re ready for questions and answers  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Your first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch  Please ask your question  and your line is now open Moshe Orenbuch    Analyst Great  And congratulations on this set of big changes out there  Ray  maybe could you just expand a little bit on the process that you went through to come to this point  talk a little bit about the way you think about the gains that can be realized on the sale of the loans and how that market looks  And also just a little bit about the process and the discussion with the regulators as to how they ve kind of approached this as well Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Sure  Well  first things first  how did we come to this point  We  as everyone on the phone knows  have for quite a while now thought our stock was undervalued for a variety of reasons  And we also believed that our assets are very high quality  and we have tested that assumption and that turns out to be a point of consensus  And so if we were to look at where we were when we had the original analysis that  let s say   8 and change for the stock price and at  3 6 billion market cap  it is a case that you would sell X proportion of your assets in order to get a gain and the liquidity associated with that  including freeing up the capital  at such a rate that a proportion of your portfolio sold is less than the proportion of the assets being bought back  And so there s a clear arbitrage opportunity  If you were to evaluate our entire balance sheet at what you think you could sell it for this evening  given that the credit markets are in very good shape at this point  it would exceed the market cap  And so that we thought was    this idea that the company is worth more in liquidation than it is on an ongoing basis  we think  is a mistake  And we think there s an arbitrage opportunity as long as that discrepancy exists  So it was quite compelling when you look at these stocks  And so the assets  as far as what s going on there  we re in active negotiations  So I will not comment on the price of those assets  But those of you who know us over a number of years know that we sold assets in  14 and  15 of similar quality and the market today is somewhat like that  And so we ll discuss this in detail at our first quarter earnings release and when we have our April call  But right now  it s in process  and I think it d be inappropriate to comment on specific prices  Suffice it to say  there is keen interest in our assets  including some firms that bought the assets back in  14 and  15 who are anxious to get more  which is quite gratifying  And so we think that  one  we will get a reasonable price to the assets  two is that the market that s deep and rich and that we continue to do that on an ongoing basis  three is the equity is clearly undervalued  and we will continue to buy equity as long as it is undervalued  In regard to the regulators  the regulators require a one year budget outlook  which we are happy to provide apropos of their calendar  But in addition to that  Steve  myself and Paul Thome  who is the president of our bank  on a regular basis  head to Salt Lake City and San Francisco  and we discuss with the regulators  not only the one year outlook that they require  but our three year outlook  just to ensure that there are no surprises between what our intentions are and how they would evaluate things  Suffice it to say  our regulatory interfaces are excellent  They are aware of everything we re doing  And that has    that s a base that has been covered off  as we have done in the last six years  We are in no surprises business with the regulators  and they seem to find that to be a good stance Moshe Orenbuch    Analyst Well  Ray  I certainly would agree with you about the price of the assets versus the price of the stock  The follow up question that I ve got just has to do with how you think about expenses  You ve done a really great job over the last two years  in particular  on that  And it    how should we think about kind of that long term trajectory given this new strategy Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer I think that the expenses as    I agree with you  the last two years have hit a nice plateau  And as I said  the 1 5  compounded growth rate has obviously helped our efficiency ratio quite a bit  We expect to continue to have ROEs that are excellent  and we will make decisions on both expenses and revenues on a cost benefit basis  And as I said  the largest variable in our forward thinking is what is the actual size of the market  Who is in it  How do they work  What do we think expenses will be in regard to capturing an appropriate market share  And so right now  I think the right thing to do  Moshe  is to stay with our guidance for 2020  which is excellent  And then if we make incremental investments in    with any expenses  we will certainly do that with a strict discipline of cost benefit and high ROEs  But right now  our intention is to keep expenses under control unless we see a revenue opportunity that is worth keeping  So the business model cranks along on a regular basis and in incremental changes  as the world changes  we will be transparent about Moshe Orenbuch    Analyst Great  And congratulations on all of this  in addition to exiting the personal loan business Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW  Your line is now open Sanjay Sakhrani    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  I guess maybe just a follow up on that first line of questioning  Could you maybe  Ray  talk about the parameters under which the arbitrage works  So at what share price doesn t it work  At what gain on sale amount doesn t it work  And then  Ray  you kind of talked about being the resource for education management  and I guess I was just trying to think about what happens in year four  Like do you continue to do this if the market doesn t appreciate the value of the portfolio  Or kind of what did you mean by that  Are you transitioning the model to more of a consultative type model  And maybe you can just start there  please Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer OK  Sure  So two key questions  One is what is the price relationship at which the arbitrage works and when doesn t it work  And then secondarily  as we add additional services  how will we evaluate those  And so in regard to the first  as I said  if we started with parameters that were extant  let s say  on January first of this year  as I run through those numbers  you can see that the balance sheet actually is a higher    at a higher value than the market cap  That s a clear arbitrage opportunity because if we liquidated those assets  we start refilling them tomorrow morning and their additional income associated with that  So that play is both an event  as well as a program  So far as the relationship between a markup on the assets versus the stock price  the asset markups have been much less volatile than the equity prices  And so it s easier sometimes to think on these things  freeze one price  watch the other one fluctuate  At what level would the fluctuating price no longer be of value  We re not giving out a number on that  We have had people estimate what it is  I don t think anyone on the phone would be surprised that it certainly is a number that is significantly higher than  8  And so as we move along on this  one is that equity price may change  but two is we will continue to go do this until such time as we meet a number  We ve had estimates  and you all have estimated the value of the stock anywhere between  10 and  16 or so  We think that captures the range  and we expect the franchise to improve over time  And so the asset pricing  we think  is relatively nonvolatile  The equity pricing  we will continue to pursue  We think it is still undervalued  and we think it will be undervalued for quite a while  Largely  I would say  because of the political environment  I think everyone can recognize that the portfolio and the franchise are being managed properly  The ROEs are excellent  The growth rate is good  Expenses are under control  Credit is not a risk and has not been a risk  although it s always worth monitoring  And so the franchise looks good  Why is the stock price down  The answer we get frequently is politics  We don t believe the politics will have an adverse impact on us  regardless of who gets elected  And so we will continue to buy the equity until we think it s appropriately valued Sanjay Sakhrani    Analyst And then just in terms of year four  is there a commitment to sort of go back to the way things were done  Or is that up for debate Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Everything that we do is subject to evaluation on an ongoing basis  And so we ve talked with many  many students  colleges  families  When you approach the issue of educating the next generation  what are the problems that you run across  What do you worry about  Where do you go for solutions  And how do you feel after that transaction has been done  And those are the needs that they have  We are trying to be responsive to that  We believe that no one has captured the share of mind associated with   Gee  I have two children  They re going to be going to college over the next two years  How do I come up to speed on this   We think that  past that  financially  in general  the school pricing is all murky to most people  It s a transaction that they engage in about once every 25 years  once when they were students typically  and then 25 years later when the family has matured  There is no doubt there is a significant need out there for helping people make these decisions  indeed  funding the college  executing that  getting the students through college to tutoring  as you know  they help in that  And then beyond that  they have to get a job at some point  So we believe that one is those needs are out there  two is we think we have a reasonable chance of responding to them  three is that we will do that on a cost benefit basis  but we will proceed down that path  And we will do it  as I said  with a network of partners who have excellent capabilities  What we re attempting to do is bring them together in a place that has sufficient gravitas that people will naturally want to go there Sanjay Sakhrani    Analyst OK  Fair enough  And then just one final question  On the personal loan portfolio  you mentioned you d use it selectively potentially  So should we expect at some point you d consider a sale if the price is right  Or sort of how should we think about that portfolio Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer I don t think we ll sell that portfolio  And we will just watch it  learn from it  We have no plans to originate new accounts in the future  If any of that were to change  we d certainly let you know  That is not in our plan Sanjay Sakhrani    Analyst OK  Thanks OperatorYour next question comes from Sir Michael Kaye of Wells Fargo  Sir  your line is now open Michael Kaye    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst What s the fair way to think about the impact of the loan sales on your provision expense guidance that came in lower than I was thinking  I believe that provision expense guidance is net of the loan sales  I mean is it as simple as taking that  3 billion times 6 7  reserve rate to get like a  200 million benefit  so really absent the sales provision expense would have been  485 million to  505 million Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Yes  That s pretty close  Michael  The actual reserve rate on the existing portfolio is a little bit higher than that  but I think you re heading in the right direction Michael Kaye    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  And I want to talk a little bit about consolidations  You re highlighting it as a risk  Maybe can you talk about what you ve been seeing in the consolidation market  And also wanted to get your thoughts on 2020  What kind of estimate do you have where consolidations could be in 2020 Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Sure  So built into our model for 2020  we expect to see about  1 7 billion in consolidations  The consolidation market really hasn t changed all that much  Michael  It s the same players out there  The reason why we saw an uptick in consolidations this quarter is quite simply because we have the big November  December repay wave going through the books  and the consolidators basically target students in the grace period and into early repayment  So we continue to think that consolidations will level off as the portfolio matures  and we continue to see consolidations trail off significantly from older repay cohorts  And of course  I would be remiss if I didn t add that we expect that the people that do consolidate are the high earners in our portfolio  and one way or another  whether they consolidate or prepay a year from now as they start earning bonuses  that these loans will have a much shorter average life with or without consolidators in the balance of our portfolio Michael Kaye    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Any update on the defensive product  I know you tried something  It seems like it didn t work  Any progress with trying something new Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer No  Michael  We haven t made any additional progress on the way to target our existing portfolio and retain people that are likely consolidation targets Michael Kaye    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from Terry Ma of Barclays  Your line is now open Terry Ma    Barclays    Analyst Hey  good morning  Can you talk a little bit more about what the impact of CECL day two is if you didn t sell your loans  And how much that actually factored into your strategic decision making Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Well  two things  One is selling of the loans had nothing to do with CECL  That is    there was no reason to get those assets off the books  They were just profitable as anything else we have  which  as you know  have won an excellent profile on NIM  losses  expenses  and ROE  And so we should divorce the asset sale discussion from the CECL impact  both day one and day two  And I ll let Steve to talk about one initial impact and then what happens on an ongoing basis Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So I think your question has partly been answered  But the CECL reserve  we will continue to book life of loan  reserve for loans on the balance sheet  And obviously  the CECL provision guidance that we gave does include the impact of reducing the CECL allowance as loans come off the balance sheet Terry Ma    Barclays    Analyst OK  Got it  And then in terms of consolidation activity  how much does heightened consolidation activity actually impact your gain on sale margins  It was a very different market in 2014   15 in terms of consolidation activity when you were actually doing your sales Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer So the answer to that question is  obviously  prepay speed is a very important variable when people are calculating the value of a loan portfolio  Back in 2014 and  15 when we were pricing these portfolios  the prepay speed that people were assuming was much lower than the prepay speed that they re assuming today  However  the offsets to that have been cheaper cost of funding in the market for a student loan portfolio  as well as lower expected defaults  as we ve demonstrated the value and the consistency of the portfolios that we manage here at the company Terry Ma    Barclays    Analyst OK  Thanks  That s it for me OperatorYour next question comes from Rick Shane of JP Morgan  Please go ahead Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thanks  guys  First of all  when you when I was servicing retained or servicing released Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Rick  we have an awful    you have an awful connection  We got a lot of static as you asked that question  You want to try that again  We literally could not decipher your question   Technical difficulty Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst Oh  thanks  I m going to call back in Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Rick OperatorYour next question comes from Mr  Henry Coffey of Wedbush  Please go ahead Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Good morning  Let me add my congratulations to the whole equation  It s been tough  and you ve been delivering consistently  and now you re amping that up  So thank you very much  Number one  and this is kind of    I heard part of Rick s question  and I had the same    similar question  In terms of selling loans  are they going to investor parties  Will you then sell the loans on a servicing retained basis  Or are they likely to go to other banks that    or other institutions that are active in the student loan business such as Discover and Wells Fargo and Regions and PNC and the like  What are your thoughts there Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer These portfolios  by and large  will go to investors  and they are very interested in us continuing to provide our high quality servicing  so they will be sold servicing retained and ultimately end up in investment portfolios Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Yes  And to that  our core strategy is developing relationships with our customers  And so we will always retain and service all of our customers as that is the core piece of what we re doing  The franchise is being supported by the financial calculations and activities that we re taking  But the customer relationship is the most important item in our entire venue here  So we would not sell that servicing released Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Nice  I mean two more questions  one related to exactly that  I mean the biggest challenge of your business is how do you turn this loan into kind of a lifetime equation  And the service packages that you re talking about providing  are these things that you get to charge for  And are you likely to put this package together by acquiring vendors  Or is it all going to be sort of third party vendors operating under the Sallie Mae hood Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer One is it s an evolving picture  Two is the services that we re currently looking at are information providing  as well as decisioning tools  And some people are charging for those  Some people have them as giveaway package  As we formulate our profile  we ll be very concerned with    or very focused on what the market is for individual services  We will work through partners  There will be    some of them we ve identified several that have excellent  I ll call it  rifle shot type of capabilities  We expect to combine that into a platform that s more user friendly  more holistic  And the pricing on it will be dependent upon the individual service Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst And then in terms of the dividend  should we just expect a steady payout ratio Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer We should expect that    it is our goal that dividends will move with the EPS Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Great  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from Melissa Wedel of J P  Morgan  Your line is now open Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hey  guys  It s Rick  Hopefully  you can hear me this time Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Yeah  much better Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst Well  it sounds like Henry addressed the first part of my question  which is the    whether or not you re going to sell the portfolio of servicing retained or servicing released  Will you provide a breakout going forward of the retained servicing portfolio so that we can model that Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Yes  We can release bank owned and bank service portfolios  And we do that now  and by and large  the portfolios perform identically  so yes  And you ll see the    yes  you will see that performance Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  And the next question is I d like to talk a little bit about the cadence of the sales  Ray  you had indicated that the sales will be extremely front loaded this year  And given the expected origination volumes in Q1  presumably that s a mix of Q3  Q4  Q1  20 volume contributed to that portfolio  On an ongoing basis  would you expect to generally do this as a single annual sale  Or will you go back to the historical pattern of doing a couple of sales a year Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer We haven t calendarized the years beyond 2020  But for 2020  we have the inventory sitting here  We have interested buyers  As I said earlier  we re in the process of negotiating those deals  Things look very favorable  And given that the share count is important  we think that executing these things early in the year  both the sale  as well as the buyback  is in everyone s best interest Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst Got it  And then just last question  In terms of gain on sale margin  you guys have discussed the impact of consolidation  You ve discussed the impact of lower base rate  I am curious if you think that there is any impact in terms of how buyers are looking at pools related to CECL  Is there    to the extent    I m assuming they re securitizing them  It probably doesn t make a big    it s probably not significant  But to the extent you have buyers who are considering putting the loans on balance sheet  that may be a consideration as well  Have you seen a CECL related impact in terms of pricing Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer No  Rick  CECL isn t really impacting the pricing of these portfolios  but it s not really an issue  And it s actually one of the benefits  Actually  Rick  one other thing  basically what we re selling is representative samples of the portfolio  So for your modeling purposes  you shouldn t really anticipate any major changes in the company s performance Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Similar to our performance Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer And that is how we ve done it in the past Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst Got it  And just for sort of a clarification related to that  From a vintage perspective  I am assuming it is new production  so it s not going    so we should assume that the portfolio distribution in terms of vintage or seasoning is the same  but you will be selling production that s been created within the last 12 months Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer No  No  That would not be a good assumption  As Steve said  if you thought about the portfolio and all of its vintages  and you said   Gee  we re going to pay  3 billion out of this   we would take it exactly proportional to the way the current portfolio is laid out  So the sold portfolio and the retained portfolio are virtually identical Rick Shane    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  I misunderstood that  I assumed you meant in terms of credit quality  etc  Thank you for clarifying that OperatorYour next question comes from Arren Cyganovich of Citi  Your line is now open Arren Cyganovich    Citi    Analyst Thanks  I appreciate the provision and the charge off guidance for the year  I guess this follows a little bit on the last question  If you re selling proportionate of the entire portfolio  does your NCO rates change at all from these sales Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Look  they shouldn t change dramatically  I mean it is customary that you want to really get into the nitty gritty to not sell 30 plus day delinquencies  So there might be a slight tick up in defaults  but we are not looking at this as having an impact on the portfolio whatsoever Arren Cyganovich    Citi    Analyst OK  And then secondarily  I think  Ray  you mentioned that you were looking to make the loan sales  hopefully  early part of the year  And I thought you had said something about doing share buybacks early part of the year  Do you expect to do an accelerated buyback program  Or would it be throughout the entire year Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer We re looking at the exact execution on the buybacks right now  The goal is to get the shares bought as soon as possible  given as we all know the EPS is based upon the average number of shares outstanding per day through the year  And so we re attempting at this juncture to sell the assets completely by 3 31 and to do 80  of the share buyback by 3 31  and then we ll do the remaining 20  as quickly as we can thereafter  But it ll probably dribble on for six months or so Arren Cyganovich    Citi    Analyst OK  And then just lastly  what s the portion of capital that you expect to free up from the loan sales  Is it 12  Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer 11 5  Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Yes  12  is good enough for modeling  but 11 5  Arren Cyganovich    Citi    Analyst OK  Thank you Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from John Hecht of Jefferies  Your line is open John Hecht    Jefferies    Analyst Congratulations on the strategic changes  Most of my questions have been asked and answered  but I will ask that you re writing off the personal loan portfolio  it sounds like for the time being  What is the duration of that just in terms of us thinking about reducing the income from that portfolio  as well as running off the allowance tied to that portfolio Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Very short average life  John  probably a year and a half remaining on it  I mean  it s going to run off pretty quickly John Hecht    Jefferies    Analyst OK  And then you talk about anticipation of 6  origination growth  which is consistent  I guess  with the industry growth rates  At a high level  what can you talk about with respect    we see the consolidation trends  But on the front end  is there any change with market participants or competitive factors there  Has that been a pretty stable market Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer It is stable in proportions so that the major competitors who are the established banks of our sales  Citizens  Discover  Wells and SunTrust  consistent  And then there is a collection of competitors who are not those and have relatively small market share  but come and go  And so we ve seen many competitors come in there for a year or two  I think  so far  has actually been in more than once  And so that group of competitors is  one  very aggressive in their acquisitions  They were in a little bit different business plan than we are from a standpoint of whether or not volumes supported them versus ROE  but they have tended to come and go  And so we re monitoring them carefully  It s probably a dozen or so smaller competitors  and they do change  The top group has not changed at all in the course of seven years John Hecht    Jefferies    Analyst Great  Thank you guys very much OperatorYour next question comes from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer  Your line is open Dominick Gabriele    Oppenheimer and Company    Analyst Thanks so much for taking my questions  Can we just go through the walk of where the other earning asset portfolio would likely be  so the non loan earning assets and how they trend throughout  say  2020  in particular  Do you expect to keep them at sort of this higher level  Or do you expect the fluctuation like you see where you kind of raise cash  depending on where the    or this portfolio moves around with the originations  And then how does that mix overall affect your NIM going forward  It came down a little bit as you kind of expected in the fourth quarter  What do you think the run rate is given some of these portfolio sales and where the other earning asset balances could be moving forward Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer So Dominick  as we indicated in our three year outlook  our balance sheet is basically going to hover around  32 billion for the next three years  I think you re talking about our liquidity portfolio  which has grown dramatically over the course of 2019  We ve kind of reached the level of stability here  Liquidity was 18  of our ending assets in the fourth quarter  It will stay between 18  and 19  over the course of 2020 and beyond  And that is principally solely responsible for the decline in our NIM  all other things being equal  The student loan portfolio spread has been very  very stable  And the    well  there s some questions about our other consumer loan assets  So personal loan portfolio   1 billion at the end of 2019  Other consumer loans will be down to    the personal loan portion of it will be down to  200 million by the end of 2022 Dominick Gabriele    Oppenheimer and Company    Analyst OK  Perfect  That s great  And then when we just think about the    this has kind of been touched on a bit  But when we think about the business and where the long term vision is  it sounds like you are still thinking about being very much focused as one would expect in student lending  But what is the kind of long term trajectory on why we re doing this today with  obviously  the very generous buybacks and where the business can look to in that year four  five  six  even    potentially even on the other side of a recession here of what products you could offer these clientele Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Sure  First things first  I think the buyback is not really generous  It s prudent and in keeping with market conditions  And so the buyback  as I said  is driven by the relative price discrepancies  the value discrepancies that we see in the market  and the asset sales are separate in the sense that their financial activity to be separated from the franchise itself  From what we can see from research and from what our customers tell us is there is a tremendous need for families to make proper decisions about improving the profiles of younger people  They worry about it a lot  It s a big expense  but things are changing around it  There is a tremendous amount of bad publicity about student borrowing in the market  People are worried about this  We think that we can provide some help to them as they make decisions  We think we can do that better than anybody else  We have a name  which is logical for us to be the center of that activity  We will offer services  We will see how people respond  We will evolve with that  We know from  as you know  prior discussions that this cohort is demographic of college graduates and or other credentialized people  people who are licensed airline pilots  so those types  These are the best of the next generation  Every financial services competitor wants to have an inside track with them  We believe we can strengthen our position with them as they start their adult lives and will give us an opportunity  We ll work our way through this on the credit card through the decision processes that we have  We will put everything under the heading of  gee  if it works  we ll do more of it  If it doesn t work  we ll drop it  So there are no sacred cows in that particular item  We expect this to be an ongoing evolution over the course of five years or so  But we are responding to problems that families need to solve  they worry about  And as I said  the publicity around  if you have a student  don t get them into debt because terrible things happen  which is in the papers on a regular basis  scares parents  They want to make the right decision  and so we think we can be helpful in regard to that  We re not creating that need  We re trying to respond to it Dominick Gabriele    Oppenheimer and Company    Analyst Thanks so much  I really appreciate it OperatorYour next question comes from Jordan Hymowitz of Philadelphia Financial  Your line is now open Jordan Hymowitz    Philadelphia Financial    Analyst Thanks for taking my questions  My question concerns political  risk   And I m just wondering  could it be political benefit  In other words  if there really is some sort of federal program for free or reduced college  don t you think that could drive more and more people toward private schools the same way as free public schools has drawn even more and more people toward private schools  And could that lead to more and more demand for your products because private schools are more expensive Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Yes  It is the case that if something were to be enacted that in some ways deprecated the quality of education for public schools  it certainly would drive people to private schools  And it is the case also that if you look at all the candidates and you talk about free college  they  as you know  mean free tuition  they typically mean free tuition in state universities  I have no reason to think that that s going to hurt the quality of the state universities  And United States has 2 400 colleges  It s hard to generalize about them because state universities in California are quite different than those in New York  And so I think there ll be a lot of changes here  I think the federal program  if were they to somehow make it unattractive  would certainly help us  But as you can see the    if you are making a bet over the last four years in regard to the federal program or financing by the public in general  and your bet was nothing happens  you would have won the bet  And so we ll see what happens  If it benefits us  that would be great  We re certainly not counting on that Jordan Hymowitz    Philadelphia Financial    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Henry Coffey at Wedbush  Go ahead  sir Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Yes  This is just a follow up question  In terms of understanding  remember  the initial CECL ad  So on day one  there was an ad on January the second  and then you re going to sell some loans by the end of the quarter and there will be a reversal  And on the assumption that you had to report numbers every single day to us  can you give us some idea of what that initial ad is now going to look like and what it will look like once we ve got the sale transaction done  It s a hit to capital  and it s a bill to the reserve  So   Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer So Henry  the initial ad  we disclosed at  1 2 billion   900 million tax adjusted  We disclosed the reserve that we re going to book for CECL for the full year  which is going to come in between  275 million and    I m sorry   285 million to  305 million  And that already has built into the reduction from the loan sales  which is  200 plus million dollars  So those are all the moving pieces Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer So  1 2 billion up   0 2 billion down Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Does that clear up the question Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Wait  Wait  So you add  1 2 billion to the reserve on day one  which hurts equity by  900 million  and then we move forward from there Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer That s right Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst You said  1 2 billion up   1 2 billion down  The down part was   Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer No   1 2 billion up   0 2 billion down Steve McGarry    Chief Financial Officer Yes Henry Coffey    Wedbush Securities    Analyst OK  Oh  OK  Excellent  Thank you Operator Operator instructions  Your next question comes from Bill Ryan  Compass Point  Go ahead  sir Bill Ryan    Compass Point    Analyst Couple of things  Just first on the origination side  I know it s not a bellwether quarter  But if the originations were down about 2  and you re kind of giving a 6  guide for    plus 6  for 2020  Was there something in Q4 that may reverse out in 2020  Or do you plan on making some changes  whether it s pricing  what you re willing to finance  a little bit more non traditional  Can you give us a little color on Q4 and then kind of the outlook  And the second thing  obviously  going through the guidance  you put out some measures for a pro forma earnings report for 2020 that you re going to be using  That s obviously been abandoned  Behind the scenes  we ve heard the SEC has been kind of  encouraging  companies not to use pro forma accounting  I was wondering what the decision was to kind of move away from that  Was it this background noise we ve kind of heard from the SEC  Or basically  since you ve adopted the new business model or an updated business model that you just didn t feel the need to do a pro forma methodology Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer Sure  Two things  One is the originations in the fourth quarter  which were down 2   as you note  When we get to the end of the year  how the days fall turns out to be quite important for colleges  payments and our disbursements  which are a result of that  And so roughly  50 million because of the way the holidays fell didn t get posted in 2019 and will be posted    has already been posted in 2020  And so there is that sort of push and pull over those couple of days  And so no money is lost or gained  It s just a question of does it spill into 2019 or 2020  So that was day by day seasonality  and it will be different every year  as you might imagine  In regard to the forward guidance  clearly  the SEC wants everyone to be on GAAP  and we will be  But we ll be at pains to give our investors all the information that they need to calculate  what we think would be the ongoing profitability of the company  But we are bound by the rules to sort of publicize and publish GAAP  We will do that  but we will make it very clear any adjustments that we re making  The funding of the provision  let s say  versus the actual losses in a particular period will both be available for modeling purposes  Thank you OperatorThere are no further questions at this time  Please continue  presenters Ray Quinlan    Chief Executive Officer OK  Well  thank you all for your attention  We very much appreciate it  And there s been a lot of information transmitted  I m sure we ll have many follow up conversations  The changes  I should say  are all  we believe  very positive  They were all at our discretion  We re making these changes because we do think it s an improvement for both the franchise  as well as for our investors  not to miss the fact that 2019 was a very good year for us  The franchise continues to evolve  We are now in stage four of capital return and we got rational approach to that with CECL behind us  with a rapid growth behind us  And we fully expect that  one  we will have very profitable franchise going forward  excellent returns  good growth prospects  Clearly  as I said  there are many unmet needs that American families have as they approach trying to do the best that they can in order to ensure a prosperous future for the next generation  We think we are well positioned to take advantage of that  We think that entire segment of life that is improving human capital will grow faster than the GDP for the foreseeable future  We have a great opportunity in front of us  Our best days are in the future  Thank you very much Brian Cronin    Vice President of Investor Relations Great  Thank you  Ray  And thank you for your time and your questions today  A replay of this call and the presentation

96751,318266,SLM,Is SLM Corporation  SLM  A Worthy Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put SLM Corporation   NASDAQ SLM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  SLM Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 99  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 33  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  SLM Corporation s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 13 30 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 27  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile SLM Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 6 9  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  SLM Corporation has a P S ratio of 1 6  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  SLM Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes SLM Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though SLM Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives SLM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the current quarter estimate has seen no upward and four downward movements  the current year estimate has seen three upward and one downward movement over the past two months This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus dropped 9 4  over the past two months  the current year estimate has inched up 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below SLM Corporation Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSLM Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 23  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  analyst sentiments and past industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through Q3

per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents  Moreover  the figure jumped 6 5  from the prior year quarter Increase in net interest income and lower expenses were tailwinds  Also  improved deposits and loans balance supported the results  However  these positives were partially offset by lower non interest income and poor credit quality The company s GAAP net income attributable to common stock came in at  137 million compared with  143 million a year ago For 2019  core earnings of  1 27 per share grew 18 7  year over year  and also surpassed the consensus

in at  419 million  up 9 4  year over year  This improvement was mainly driven by higher interest income  Net interest margin contracted 70 basis points  bps  to 5 41  The company incurred non interest loss of  4 million against non interest income of  13 million in the prior year quarter  This downfall mainly stemmed from losses on derivatives and hedging activities The company s non interest expenses declined 2 9  year over year to  141 7 million  The fall mainly resulted from lower other operating expenses  partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses Efficiency ratio  on a non GAAP basis  decreased to 33 6  from 37 6   Generally  a lower ratio indicates improved profitability Credit Quality WorsensProvision for loan losses was  98 million  up 69  from  58

Nearly 70 percent of debt belonging to 25 year olds comes from their student loans  which continued to increase in 2013  The average student loan balance rose to  20 926 
Warren  who sponsored the legislation  said after the vote that shut down any further debate on it  said   With this vote we show the American people who we work for in the United States Senate  billionaires or students  A vote on this legislation is a vote to give millions of young people a fair shot at building their future   according to the Associated Press 
Earlier this week President Barack Obama unveiled his proposals to help ease the financial burden on Americans saddled with record student debt  including an income adjusted monthly payment cap 
At that time he president also urged Republicans in Congress to act on the Democratic sponsored bills

If you are not sure whether to invest your money in bonds or stocks  an important parameter  which can show you the right direction  is earnings yield  It is the reciprocal of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  This ratio can be effectively used for figuring out undervalued stocks  Also  this ratio is handy for comparing stocks with the market or fixed income securities 
Earnings yield can be calculated as  annual earnings per share market price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one with high earnings yield should provide higher returns 
This ratio is very useful for comparing the performance of the market with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index exceeds the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be said to be undervalued in comparison to bonds  This implies that investing in the stock market is a better choice for a value investor 
However  while T bills are free of risks  investing in stocks always carries some inherent risks  Hence  it will be wise to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market

96822,318337,SLM,Is SLM Corporation  SLM  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put SLM Corporation Inc    NASDAQ SLM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  SLM Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 83  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 45  If we focus on the long term PE trend  SLM Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 30 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 04  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that SLM Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 90 which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  SLM Corporation has a P S ratio of about 2 17  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 16x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  SLM Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes SLM Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for SLM Corporation is just 0 44  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 89  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  SLM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though SLM Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives SLM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the next year estimate has seen one up and two down in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below SLM Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSLM Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 3  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Consumer Loans industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana

If you are uncertain about whether to invest your money in bonds or stocks  an important parameter that can show you the right path is earnings yield  It is the reciprocal of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  This ratio is very useful for figuring out undervalued stocks  Also  this ratio is useful for comparing stocks with the market or fixed income securities 
Earnings yield can be calculated as  annual earnings per share market price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one with high earnings yield should provide higher returns 
This ratio is very handy for comparing the performance of the market with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index is higher than the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be said to be undervalued in comparison to bonds  This implies that investing in the stock market is a better choice for a value investor 
However  while T bills are devoid of risks  investing in stocks always carries some inherent risks  Hence  it will be wise to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market

The student lender reported in line earnings in third quarter 2017  The results reflected higher net interest income along with considerable growth in loans and deposit balance  However  higher expenses and lower non interest income were on the downside 
Sallie Mae shares have gained 4 2  over the past year  underperforming the  s rally of 6 6  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s current year earnings have remained stable at 72 cents over the past 60 days  As a result  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

 
Loan originations have increased 8  in 2016  with the trend continuing in the first six months of 2017  Thus  the company seems on track to achieve originations of about  4 9 billion in 2017  Also  management expects to improve efficiency ratio through prudent expense management and growth in service portfolio loans 
Modest growth in demand for educational loans comes as a tailwind for the lender  However  with the economic recovery  Sallie Mae should be able to maintain a leading position in the student lending market 
Sallie Mae s expenses have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12 1  over a period of five years  ended 2016  
Also  the company remains highly dependent on the broker deposits as a major source of financing  Moreover  the generation of deposits from non brokered channels takes time  Thus  this significant exposure to just one source of funding remains a concern

96900,318415,SLM,4 Top Stocks To Buy With Impressive Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth captivates all  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price Future OutperformersSo  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance Screening Parameters Let s look at stocks for which the

96925,318440,SLM,Sallie Mae  SLM  Struggles With Rising Costs  Time To Sell ,opinion,"On Aug 23  we issued an updated research report on Sallie Mae   NASDAQ SLM    The company s profitability continues to be curbed by escalating expenses  Also  it faces concentration risk due to over dependence on broker deposits as a key source of funding   
The student lender reported in line earnings in second quarter 2017  The results reflected higher net interest income along with improved loans and deposit balance  However  higher expenses and lower non interest income were on the downside 
Sallie Mae shares have lost 6 4  year to date compared with the  s decline of 6 2  
Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s current year earnings have been revised 1 4  downward over the past 60 days  As a result  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  

Sallie Mae s expenses have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12 1  over a period of five years  ended 2016  
The company remains dependent on the broker deposits as a major source of financing  Moreover  the generation of deposits from non brokered channels would be requiring some time  Thus  this significant exposure to a source of funding remains a concern 
Nevertheless  the loan originations have increased 8  in 2016  with the trend continuing in the first six months of 2017  Thus  the company seems on track to achieve originations of about  4 9 billion in 2017  Also  management expects to improve efficiency ratio through prudent expense management and growth in service portfolio loans

Net income stood at  213 5 million  down 9 7  from the prior year quarter  It must be noted that during the third quarter  the company recorded a one time tax benefit of  11 million  or  0 03 per share 
Revenues Down  Expenses Up
Total revenue amounted to  1 2 billion  down 12 3  year over year  The decline was mainly due to decrease in all components of revenue  like net finance and other interest income  profit sharing and total other income 
Net finance and other interest income totaled  1 2 billion  down 3  year over year  The decline was primarily due to a shift in credit mix  resulting from disciplined underwriting standards  and higher cost of funds  led by expansion in spreads and benchmark rates 
Operating expenses rose 8 8  year over year to  284 4 million  Higher repossession activity and higher headcount led to the rise As of Sep 30  2016  net finance receivables  loans and leases stood at  34 7 billion  up 6 1  year over year  chiefly led by an increase in lease assets  Further  total originations of  5 1 billion plunged 32 2  compared with the prior year figure  Mixed Credit Quality
Santander Consumer s credit quality represented a mixed bag in the quarter  Provision for credit losses decreased 15 7  year over year to  610 million  Also  total net charge offs ratio decreased from 13 8  to 8 3  for the quarter ended Sep 30  2016 However  end of period delinquency ratio was 4 6   up from 3 8  in the year ago period Capital and Profitability RatiosAs of Sep 30  2016  Santander Consumer s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio came in at 13 1   rising from 11 5  as of Sep 30  2015 Return on average assets inched down to 2 2  as of Sep 30  2016 from 2 6  as of Sep 30  2015  Also  return on average equity was down to 17 1  in the reported quarter from 22 2  recorded in the year ago quarter

96959,318474,SLM,Is It Wise To Hold On To Navient  NAVI  Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Navient Corporation   NASDAQ NAVI   continues to benefit from its strong position in the educational loan industry  Further  its inorganic growth strategies and improving economic conditions shall bolster its performance  However  higher expenses remain a concern 
Navient s shares have gained 26 5  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s rally of 20 6  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Navient s current year earnings remained stable in the last 30 days  As a result  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

After separation from SLM Corporation   NASDAQ SLM   in Apr 2014  Navient has become the leading servicer of education loans  It services over  300 billion in student loans for more than 12 million customers  Further  declining unemployment rate  lesser regulatory hurdles due to the approval of Financial Choice Act and specialized focus on operations will likely boost the company s performance 
Further  Navient s inorganic growth strategies to expand its asset recovery and business process outsourcing operations in the health care payment sector are encouraging  In Oct 2015 it acquired Xtend Healthcare and  in Feb 2015  it announced the acquisition of Gila LLC  an asset recovery and business process outsourcing firm  Moreover  in Apr 2017  Navient entered into a deal with JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM   to acquire the educational loan portfolio  which management expects will contribute approximately 9 cents per share to its 2017 earnings 
Nevertheless  increasing expenses remains a headwind for Navient  Several litigations issues and strict regulatory scrutiny over alleged anti consumer practices in the U S  student loan industry are likely to affect the company s financials 
Stock to Consider
A better ranked stock in the industry is World Acceptance Corporation   NASDAQ WRLD   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

96980,318495,SLM,Finance Q2 Earnings To Watch This Week  AXP  COF  MCO  SLM,opinion,"The second quarter season is in full swing  Last week  we saw results from 36 S P 500 members that combined account for 10 1  of the index s total market capitalization as per the  report  Revenues had decreased 0 1  and total earnings declined 3 9   The beat ratio was 66 7  for the bottom line and 41 7  for the top line 
Coming to the Finance sector  we already have reports from 7 8  as per the Earnings Preview article  These companies saw total earnings decline of 5 4  and meager revenue growth of 0 4  
Overall earnings for the Finance sector in second quarter 2016 are expected to be down 3 3  year over year  Also  revenues are expected to be down 0 5   Notably  during the first quarter  the sector had witnessed a 6 9  decline in earnings while revenues improved 3 3  
Let s see what factors might have influenced the finance sector performance in the second quarter 
A strong dollar will affect earnings of players having international exposure  Nonetheless  an upside in earnings is likely from an increase in consumer spending which is leading to higher card member spending  Also  strong credit card loan and overall growth in loans  including commercial and industrial  and commercial real estate loans  should drive the top line 
Then again  low interest rates will affect deposit business  and oil and gas loans will continue to pose challenges  Companies involved in oil and gas have been building reserves to reflect this concern 
As many as 299 companies will release results from Jul 18 22  Let s find out what s in store for the following the finance stocks that will report second quarter earnings results this week 
Global electronic payment processor American Express Co    NYSE AXP   is scheduled to release second quarter financial results after the closing bell on Jul 20  In the last reported quarter  the company beat the earnings estimate by 6 62   It has an  of  0 52  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
American Express  second quarter results will see the impact of a stronger U S  dollar  We also expect to see healthy loan growth and favorable credit performance  The bottom line will gain from a reduction in operating expenses as the estimated  1 billion gain on the Costco  NASDAQ COST  portfolio sale will be recorded as a benefit in operating expenses 
Earnings will  however  suffer from a higher level of investment spending and modest restructuring charge  Lower gas and airline ticket prices also remain headwinds to the Global Corporate segment and the U S  consumer segment 
The company will also incur restructuring charges to reduce costs  A strong balance sheet will enable the company to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders via share buyback  which in turn will lift its bottom line 
With respect to the surprise trend  American Express surpassed expectations in three out of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 4 23    Read more   AMER EXPRESS CO Price and EPS Surprise   Capital One Financial Corporation   NYSE COF   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 21  after the market closes  In the last reported quarter  the company missed the earnings estimate by 2 63   It has an Earnings ESP of  1 60  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Capital One expects pressure on the top line due to runoffs in home loans and sluggish auto loan growth  Further  provision for credit losses are expected to rise as Capital One s credit quality will remain under pressure  given the stressed energy sector and consistent increase in loans 
Also  operating expenses should rise given an increase in marketing expenses and continued investments in franchise   
Nonetheless  projected growth in Domestic Card loan should continue to ease pressure on the top line to some extent  Further  Capital One s revenues will likely benefit from growth in commercial loans 
Capital One missed earnings in two out of the last four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 1 22    Read more  CAPITAL ONE FIN Price and EPS Surprise   Moody s Corporation   NYSE MCO   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 22  In the last reported quarter  the company missed the earnings estimate by 13 08   It has an Earnings ESP of 8 87  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Moody s earnings might face a burn from forex fluctuations and slowdown in debt issuance activity worldwide  Moody s faces significant economic risks associated with the volatile macro environment and its effect on financial markets and soft bond issuance  which also results in sluggish demand for credit ratings  Management also slashed its 2016 forecast owing to not so conducive market conditions 
Nevertheless  earnings will see accretion from acquisitions and growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service for public fixed income securities

97008,318523,SLM,Uncle Sam s Largest Asset Is Student Debt,opinion,"Most of the talking heads on TV are constantly focused on the federal government s debt   which currently stands at a stunning  17 trillion 
But what about assets  Who is talking about the largest  positive  line item on Uncle Sam s balance sheet 
We are  Because for those who know how to spot it  there is huge profit potential   
In this week s chart  we lay out Uncle Sam s total financial assets  And as you can see  student loans make up 48 5  of the pie 
This is five times larger than Taxes Receivable  which clocks in at just 9 7  
Now we have arrived at something the media actually has been squawking about  our rapid growth in student debt 
It s astounding  Since the Great Recession of 2007  the federal government s student loan balance has risen 662   Today  total student loan debt is around  1 16 trillion  That is more than four times the size of  
This is good news for Uncle Sam  sure  but horrible news for graduates and their families  Nowadays  student debt averages  29 000 per person  So it s no surprise that student loan forgiveness has become such a hot topic 
We could entertain the classic debate between good and bad debt   something our Editorial Director Andrew Snyder  earlier this year   but let s instead focus on the opportunity   
Student loan stocks 
SLM Corporation  NASDAQ SLM   better known as Sallie Mae  and Nelnet Inc  NYSE NNI  are two of the top student loan servicing companies in the country 
Both stocks have seen strong growth as student loans balloon to new heights 
Over the last five years  SLM and Nelnet have seen their stocks gain 164 78  and 154 68   respectively  During the same period  the S P 500 has returned 112 56  
These market beating returns have a lot to do with both companies raking in huge profits  Since 2010  Sallie Mae has seen average earnings per share  EPS  growth of 17 16  per year  Nelnet has averaged EPS growth of 8 51  
I mentioned above that student loan debt is around  29 000 per graduate  Meanwhile  median starting salaries for graduates today average  46 000  Think that s bad  By 2023  median salaries are expected to be equal to outstanding loans 
Bad news for students  Absolutely  But it s great news for educational lending stocks  Based on these figures  Sallie Mae and Nelnet are all but assured to continue their upward climb 
As for the public side    don t be surprised to see student loans dominate more than 50  of Uncle Sam s assets by year end ",2015-07-19,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/uncle-sam’s-largest-asset-is-student-debt-258729,258729
