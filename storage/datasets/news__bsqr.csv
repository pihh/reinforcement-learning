3625,225140,BSQR,4 Stocks To Watch  AVXL  BSQR  ERII  NEO,opinion,"The market had a wonderful day on Monday  It was strong  and a lot of biotechs led the way  We re going to take a look at a mixture of stocks  including biotech stocks that are acting very well  There are some swing trades as well 
Anavex Life Sciences Corp   OTC AVXLD  is a monster and really is acting great  It s extremely speculative  and trading thin  The fifth wave is under way  which could get it up to 20  give or take a point or two  Maybe  We re not sure yet  Monday was spectacular as it ran up 2 42 to 13 00  the high for the day  or 22 8   on 4 million shares  the most volume it s had for a while  It did trade 4 7 million shares back in July when it broke out  That was a strong day for this stock 
BSQUARE Corp   O BSQR   one of our swing trades  is acting great  It s moving up a little at a time  pausing a day or two between each move  and on Monday  it was up another 67 cents to 11 55  or 6   on 345 200 shares traded  Not huge volume  but when it gets up near 14  it may trade some pretty heavy volume  For now  stay long 
Energy Recovery  Inc   O ERII  had a significant day on Monday because of the wedge that was forming after the big  explosive gap up  It was up 60 cents to 7 77  or 8 37   on 2 2 million shares  The spike high was at 8 16  and Monday s high is 7 99  If it gets through that level  it could run up to 10 10 plus 
Neogenomics Inc   O NEO  is acting well  It exploded on Monday  up 95 cents to 8 00  or 13 5   on 2 5 million shares  That s another example of a breakaway move  It formed a beautiful bull wedge  Low volume ebb  and then boom  it ran  It appears to be heading up toward the 9 1 4 1 2 zone
