114024,335539,THC,Researchers Discover Cannabis Compound That May Be 30 Times More Potent Than THC,news,"New research out of Italy suggests there could be a much more potent cannabis compound than tetrahydrocannabinol  THC   Scientists have found a new psychoactive substance in the plant called tetrahydrocannabiphorol  THCP   which they believe could be more than 30 times stronger  Researchers measured the impact of THCP in a lab and found that like THC  the compounded attached to cannabinoid receptors in the body but bonded to them 33 times more strongly  indicating it s possible for THCP to disrupt mental and physical functions even more than THC  
Dr  Cinzia Citti  who is the study s lead author  believes this helps explain why some strains behave differently than one would expect based solely on their THC levels  Citti said   In cannabis varieties where THC is present in very low concentrations  then we can think that the presence of another  more active cannabinoid can explain those effects  
While this discovery of THCP suggests the potential for creating marijuana products that give users a more intense high  the researchers are also optimistic about the possibility of uncovering health benefits related to THCP 

Research a key focus for marijuana companies
There s a big need for more cannabis research to be done  and industry leaders Canopy Growth  NYSE CGC  and Aurora Cannabis  NYSE ACB  have played significant roles in trying to learn more about the potential benefits of using cannabis 
Last year  Aurora partnered with the UFC  Ultimate Fighting Championship     the two plan to jointly study and develop hemp derived cannabidiol  CBD  products that could help treat athletes with injuries  Canopy Growth  meanwhile  has partnered with ex athletes from the National Hockey League to determine if cannabis be useful in helping to treat post concussion diseases  including post traumatic stress disorder and depression

114044,335559,THC,HCA Healthcare Acquires Galen  Expands Nursing Schools,opinion,"Leading hospital operator HCA Healthcare  Inc    NYSE HCA   has bought a majority ownership of Galen College of Nursing  The deal was announced in March 2019 
With this acquisition  HCA Healthcare will be adding to its existing pool of two nursing schools  Research College of Nursing and Mercy School of Nursing  as well as seven advanced nursing simulation training centers 
For HCA Healthcare  Galen is a perfect fit with its excellent reputation in nursing education   Nurses which are crucial in providing efficient  patient care  are  one of the business driving factors for HCA Healthcare and therefore form the lifeblood for the company  
This deal will also help HCA Healthcare to address the labor issue related to nurses in the industry as a decline in the number of nurses leads to increase in hospital readmissions and stretches the length of stay 
In order to better face the nursing shortage  which is expected to persist through 2025  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics   HCA Healthcare  one of the largest nurse employers in the nation  has designed its employee benefits accordingly to attract and retain nurses 
Per the American Association of Colleges of Nursing  the United States is projected to experience a shortage of Registered Nurses  RNs  that is expected to intensify as Baby Boomers age and the need for health care grows  Compounding the problem is the fact that nursing schools across the country are struggling to expand capacity to meet the rising demand for care given the national move toward healthcare reform 
We believe that HCA Healthcare s investments in nursing schools will provide it easy and ready access to skilled registered nurses  even when other hospitals in the industry continue to face financial pain from high labor cost  as turnover among nurses remains high and there are not enough new nurses entering the workforce  It should be noted that salaries and benefits constitute nearly 50  of the total operating expense for HCA Healthcare 
The expanding nursing facilities by HCA Healthcare will help in cost control and aid margins  We also believe this will boost the company s growth  Moreover  its  top line is benefiting from rise in admissions  surgeries and emergency room visits   
HCA Healthcare s revenues have witnessed a five year CAGR of 6 4   with the same for equivalent admissions  surgeries and emergency room visits being 3 8   1 8  and 4 7   respectively 
Over the past year  the stock has gained 17 5  compared with its industry s growth of 17 9   Other companies in the same space like Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC   and Universal Health Services  Inc    NYSE UHS   have grown 81 5  and 16 8  whereas Community Health Systems Inc    NYSE CYH   has declined 28 3  in the same time period

114049,335564,THC,Is Tenet Healthcare  THC  A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tenet Healthcare Corporation   NYSE THC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tenet Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 62  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 78  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Tenet Healthcare s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 14 96  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 51  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Tenet Healthcare has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 87  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tenet Healthcare s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tenet Healthcare has a P S ratio of about 0 21  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 59 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tenet Healthcare currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes THC a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Premier is just 0 68  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 13  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 3 56  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 5 55  Clearly  THC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Tenet Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives THC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the current year estimate has seen one upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 2  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has nudged up 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus    Even though Tenet Healthcare has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTenet Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 20  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades

114050,335565,THC,Hospital operator HCA spends big to keep nurses on board,news,By Jilian Mincer NEW YORK  Reuters    HCA Healthcare  N HCA  is raising the stakes in a fiercely competitive labor market  pledging  300 million for employee benefits that are largely designed to attract nurses  company executives told Reuters  The nation s largest publicly traded hospital chain said in January that it would invest much of its windfall from a U S  tax overhaul to offer tuition reimbursement  student loan repayment and extra family leave to all of its employees in the next three years  Company officials provided Reuters with new details on their spending plans  saying a top priority of the program is to keep nurses in its wards  The retention push is vital to HCA plans to grow in states like Florida and Texas  and comes as a worsening labor shortage forces U S  hospitals collectively to spend billions of dollars more on nursing staff   A generation of Baby Boomer nurses are retiring  while younger staff can choose from many job opportunities outside hospitals that offer higher salaries and better hours   HCA and smaller rival  Tenet Healthcare   N THC  are particularly vulnerable in fast growing Texas and Florida  where up to 40 percent of nurses will retire in the coming years  according to healthcare worker groups  Half of HCA s hospitals are located in those states and account for 48 percent of revenue  HCA faces stiff competition for these nurses  however  Reuters interviews with more than a dozen rival hospitals in those two states found that many already offer similar benefits to what HCA plans to introduce   What we are trying to do is become the employer of choice   Jane Englebright  HCA s chief nursing executive  said in an interview   Investing in nurses pays dividends in so many ways  This additional funding coming our way is allowing us to take this to a new level   HCA has already worked to reduce use of more expensive contract nurses and rates of nurse turnover  which hit 22 percent in 2016 and is now closer to 17 percent  But some Wall Street analysts worry HCA will face rising costs as the labor shortage intensifies in the next three to four years    Are they going to start offering more  and will that hit their margins   said Michael Newshel  healthcare analyst at Evercore ISI  EXPANSION PLAN HCA is viewed as one of the strongest for profit hospital operator in the country  Seeking new growth  the company plans to spend  10 5 billion in the next three years to expand and upgrade its facilities  Keeping them adequately staffed with nurses is key to that expansion       In January  as it devised the benefits plan  HCA surveyed millennial nurses  who account for almost half of its 87 000 nurses  Their answers on workplace priorities helped shape the benefits most likely to help nurses  such as reimbursing up to  5 250 in employee tuition annually and covering certifications for nursing specialties  such as surgery   Until now  such benefits had been offered in a limited number of HCA hospitals  to a small group of employees  For example  about 1 100 HCA nurses last year received specialty certification after passing the relevant exam  Englebright expects that number to triple now that HCA will cover study materials  exams and certification dues  Millennial nurses also requested additional training  equipment  advancement opportunities and a voice in the organization  Englebright said  One of HCA s responses is to build 13 new centers to provide recent graduates with hands on training  It currently has one such training center     Englebright said that other benefits and policies are meant to convince late career nurses to delay retirement  such as paying college tuition for employees  children and offering less physically demanding work in call centers   Many hospitals have offered some of these benefits for a while now  About half of nurses are offered educational funds  according to a survey conducted last summer by American Nurse Today  the journal of the American Nurses Association   Tenet offers tuition assistance and signing bonuses of  10 000 to  15 000 for experienced nurses in some locations  including Florida  One time bonuses can be as high as  25 000 in places where competition is fiercest  such as California  the company said  In Texas  Baylor Scott   White  the largest not for profit hospital network in the state  has been focusing on the shortage for years  providing tuition reimbursement of up to  5 250 to more than 2 000 nurses last year  Many organizations cap the tuition at  5 250  the maximum benefit before an employee would pay tax  A decade ago  Ashley Kent  33  decided to work there as a patient assistant because of such benefits  The program allowed her to complete a nursing degree in 2014  Now a manager  Kent is scheduled to graduate in May with a masters degree  which the hospital also helped pay for   I didn t have parents who could help support me through college   said Kent   I knew I was paying for it myself out of pocket

114053,335568,THC,Dose Of Bright Near Term Outlook From Medical Hospital Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises for profit hospital companies that provide healthcare facilities through different types of hospitals such as acute care  rehabilitation and psychiatric These hospitals are engaged in internal medicine  general surgery  cardiology  oncology  neurosurgery  orthopedics and obstetrics  mental health care  and diagnostic and emergency services among others Hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program  state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs  managed care plans  including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges   private insurers and directly from patients Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is witnessing increased investment in technology  Players are making investments in health technologies and working toward harnessing the power of big data to efficiently test methodologies  discover trends and provide information to support their physicians and clinicians in their continuous struggle to improve the quality of care  This should ultimately lead to lower cost and lead to higher patient admissions  thus aiding both revenues and margins  The industry has over the past few years started consolidating mainly due to the pressures of healthcare reform  Players are continuing to resort to mergers and acquisitions in order to create operational  strategic  and financial value for their operations  Numerous deals have lead to economies of scale  helping the industry to efficiently manage costs and improve productivity and outcomes through higher business volumes  and enhancing the bargaining power with payers  This consolidation paves the way for long term growth  The number of Americans 65 and older is projected to grow by 34  between 2015 and 2030   and by 2035  older adults will outnumber children for the first time in U S  history  according to the U S  Census Bureau  Also  due to the anticipated increase in life expectancy of Americans  the number of people aged 85 years and older may grow from 6 million in 2015 to 9 million by the year 2030  This anticipated increase in life expectancy will spur demand for healthcare services and  more importantly  demand for innovative  more sophisticated means of delivering those services  Hospitals  as the largest category of care in the healthcare market  will be among those boosted most directly by this rise in demand   Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects The Zacks Medical Hospital industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  52  which places it in the top 20  of more than 250 Zacks industries Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the top 20  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential Given the industry s bright near term view  we will present some hospital stocks that one should hold on to  Before that  it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation Industry Beats Sector But Lags the MarketThe Zacks Medical Hospital industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Medical sector  but has lagged the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year Over this period  the industry has gained 10 99  versus the broader sector s growth of 5 65  and the Zacks S P 500 composite s rise of 25 05   One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month EV to EBITDA ratio  which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks  the industry trades at 7 12X versus the S P 500 s 12 38X and the sector s 10 72X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 8 81X  as low as 6 58X and at a median of 7 45X  as the chart below shows Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio vs S P 500 Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio vs Sector Bottom LineFocus on an expanding footprint and product portfolio through acquisitions  along with cost saving initiatives  are expected to drive the industry s growth  The efforts on the part of hospital companies to expand their healthcare network that provides convenience and choice to patients should drive admissions  Investments in technology will increase the efficiency of operations thus leading to superior care at lower costs  which should benefit all sections of the industry However  rising labor costs from shortage of nurses and skilled workforce have weighed on the industry s labor expense and will continue to do so At present  among the hospital socks under our coverage  only Community Health Systems  Inc   CYH  holds a

114054,335569,THC,A bid to save  300 million at HCR ManorCare  and disrupt U S  healthcare,news,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO  Reuters    Thomas DeRosa is making a  4 billion bet that he can build a national  low cost healthcare network for America s aging population that will succeed where so many other models have struggled 
His secret  strip out the  for profit  business model  and leverage the real estate in nursing homes for outpatient care 
DeRosa s strategy starts with buying out the property of the huge bankrupt nursing home chain HCR ManorCare  and teaming up with a non profit hospital operator  ProMedica  to create a 30 state healthcare system 
His own company  real estate investment trust Welltower Inc  N WELL   is purchasing the ManorCare real estate for  2 7 billion under a deal unveiled April 24 and awaiting approval from a U S  bankruptcy court 
ProMedica is buying ManorCare s operations for  1 3 billion and combining them with its own surgery centers  clinics and health plan to form a network with  7 billion of annual revenues and 70 000 employees 
 This is about a health system moving into a beleaguered sector of healthcare   DeRosa told Reuters in an interview   We re breaking down the wall of what has traditionally been acute care services and services for the aging  
The aim is to strip out  300 million in costs from the operation  mainly from cheaper rent  once HCR ManorCare emerges from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year  according to interviews with Welltower and ProMedica executives 
ProMedica Chief Executive Randy Oostra expects the merger   which will propel the group into the 25 largest U S  health systems by revenue alongside names like Mayo Clinic  Geisinger and Johns Hopkins   to boost margins by two percentage points to between 3 percent and 4 percent over the next few years 
ProMedica will also invest  400 million to revamp ManorCare s facilities  and size up every site as an opportunity for different services or partnerships 
And by turning non profit under ProMedica s existing business model  ManorCare will see other annual cost savings of  30 million 
 It is a disruptor   Arthur Caplan  director of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine  said of the deal 
Yet the merged group must still overcome a perfect storm of eroding reimbursement rates  depressed occupancies  and competition from home health that has weighed on nursing facilities nation wide

A NEW APPROACH
The proposal comes at a time when companies from hospitals and pharmacy chains including  Tenet Healthcare  Corp  N THC  and CVS Health Corp  N CVS  to insurance providers and retailers like  Humana Inc   N HUM  and Walmart Inc  N WMT  are jostling to create new healthcare models for an aging population as U S  medical costs continue to soar 
Outside the health sector  Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  has joined forces with  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  for a new model to help bring down healthcare costs 
REITs  including Welltower  invested heavily in skilled nursing centers at the turn of the decade but have struggled to collect  let alone raise  rents  Large REITs like  Ventas Inc   N VTR  have since abandoned the sector 
For hospitals  declining payments by Medicare   the largest payer for the 65 and over population   and declining admissions are driving a search for lower cost  non hospital settings to deliver care  Oostra said 
Medicare penalties for patient readmissions are also forcing hospitals to follow up on recoveries  which often occur at a skilled nursing facility 
 Increasingly we re getting more focused on things that go on outside of our walls   Oostra told Reuters  He calls it a  blurring of the lines  in where clinical care starts and stops 
Enter HCR ManorCare  which in March filed one of the largest bankruptcies this year  dragged down by debt from private equity fund  Carlyle Group  LP s  O CG   6 3 billion buyout in 2007 and unable to keep up with  450 million in annual rent payments to REIT landlord  Quality Care Properties Inc   N QCP  
Under the new structure  DeRosa plans to capitalize on the trend of more healthcare taking place outside of hospitals  This could mean basic surgeries like hip replacements or treatment for conditions such as congestive heart failure being provided directly in a skilled nursing center instead of a hospital 
For a person who traditionally would have recovered from knee or hip surgery in a skilled nursing facility  they may now receive more outpatient rehab or home health 
Medicare already covers certain home health services and has a pilot program that allows patients to receive care directly at a skilled nursing facility without prior hospitalization  as is the case currently 
 Medicare is testing this out and this is where people think healthcare is ultimately going and they want to be skating in that direction   said Chas Roades  head of Washington D C  based consultancy Gist Healthcare 
Roades said the deal with ManorCare  expected to close in the third quarter  is the first bet by a major health system on the post acute space 
Welltower will own 160 skilled nursing and 59 assisted living and memory care centers run by ManorCare through a 80 20 joint venture with ProMedica  ProMedica will own ManorCare s home health  hospice and outpatient rehabilitation businesses 
If the U S  bankruptcy court approves the deal  ManorCare s rent will fall by 60 percent to  180 million in the first year of a 15 year master lease  with lower annual bumps than its previous lease  according to court filings 
Welltower estimates an 8 percent cash yield from the deal 
 This is the way we ll start to drive some of the services that this aging population will need   DeRosa said  adding that it gives the distressed skilled nursing industry a chance of  rebirth

114055,335570,THC,Solid Start To February As Stocks Stage Partial Rebound   ,opinion,"Stocks recovered some of last week s sharp selloff on Monday despite the coronavirus continuing to spread  A better than expected manufacturing report helped the performance  
	Perhaps some investors are beginning to see the recent pullbacks as a buying opportunity  which was certainly not the case on Friday when the major indices each lost more than 1 5   
	The NASDAQ was the only index still in positive territory when the dust settled last week  and today it came the closest to completely recovering from the pullback

	The S P couldn t rebound as much  but at least its back in the green for 2020  The index advanced 0 73  to 3248 92 and still needs about 1  to completely recover  
	The Dow saw the biggest plunge on Friday by nearly 2 1   and it got approximately a quarter of it back today with a gain of 0 51   or about 144 points  to 28 399 81  It s still in negative territory for the year 
	The coronavirus continues to be a major concern for the market  which will remain susceptible to selloffs as long as it continues to spread  But it will also be poised for bounce backs  especially when there s some good economic data like the ISM manufacturing report  
	The survey reached 50 9  for January  which beat expectations and the previous month s 47 2   Most importantly  it was the first expansion  over 50  since July  breaking five straight months of contraction  beneath 50

	 An outbreak outside of China of course could happen  but until then I think the market will be more rational with its fear of the virus  That was shown today as the S P was up 0 73  and the Nasdaq was up 1 50       Jeremy Mullin  who sold Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  today for a gain of 7 6

114072,335587,THC,5 Top Stocks Set To Register Earnings Beat,opinion,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season  every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation  This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and tap stocks that are of high quality in nature 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to five 
Here are all five stocks 
Care com Inc     NYSE CRCM     Care com  Inc  provides an online marketplace for finding and managing family care primarily in the United States and internationally  It belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 12  of 250  industries   The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

114078,335593,THC,White House says rollback of Obamacare must be part of short term fix,news,"By Richard Cowan and Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    A senior White House aide said on Thursday that U S  President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation  comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short term bill to shore up insurance markets   Marc Short  the White House s top liaison to Congress  said on CNN that Obamacare s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal    We re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs   Short said   Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray unveiled legislation to shore up the insurance markets created under the 2010 healthcare law by reviving the subsidies  which Trump has discontinued  for two years to help lower income Americans obtain medical coverage  The bill appeared to be gaining some momentum on Thursday after several Republican senators said they would support the measure  But Short s comments may put a damper on hopes for any sort of bipartisan agreement  Democrats have consistently opposed efforts to dismantle any and all parts of Obamacare   Short said the administration was sending a list of the principles it would like to see in any legislation to the bill s co authors and would likely make them public   The gist is we believe that the individual mandate should  be  repealed  employer mandate repealed and allow Americans to contribute to health savings accounts   he said   Earlier on Thursday  Alexander and Murray said the deal they struck now has the support of 12 of the 52 Republicans in the 100 seat Senate  as well as 12 Democrats   While Alexander predicted in remarks on the Senate floor that the plan  will become law in some fashion before the end of the year   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not committed to bringing it to a vote  and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is against it  Lobbyists and congressional aides closely following the matter said the legislation could make it onto the Senate floor tucked inside a bigger  must pass  bill that Congress needs to act on in December  such as a broad spending measure to prevent a federal government shutdown  Trump campaigned for the presidency last year promising to get rid of Obamacare  the signature legislative achievement of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama  But his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to repeal and replace the law thanks to deep intra party divisions   Obamacare  formally called the Affordable Care Act  extended health insurance to 20 million people but Republicans call it government interference in Americans  healthcare   The law s individual mandate requires all Americans to purchase health insurance  while its employer mandate requires businesses of a certain size to offer affordable coverage   TRUMP REVERSES POSITION Trump initially indicated support for the Alexander Murray agreement but reversed himself  saying on Wednesday  I can never support bailing out  insurers  Senator Mike Rounds  one of the bill s Republican co sponsors  said that if Trump decides he does not support it   then it will not go forward   When a reporter noted that Trump does oppose it  Rounds replied   That was yesterday   Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas  who focuses on healthcare  said there was too much political uncertainty for investors to latch onto any one thing  with Trump  flip flopping every day  and Ryan not supportive of the bill  Among hospital stocks   Community Health  Systems  N CYH  closed up 3 7 percent   Tenet Healthcare  Corp  N THC  rose 2 9 percent and HCA Healthcare Inc  N HCA  gained 3 percent  Most insurers rose more modestly  Without the subsidies  insurance premiums for some of the 10 million Americans who get coverage through Obamacare markets will surge  Noting that some conservative Republicans object to the subsidies  Alexander asked   What s conservative about creating chaos so millions can t buy insurance  or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created   The bill has broad support among Democrats  but had just seven Republicans on record supporting it only a day earlier  Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham  who co authored a bill in September to repeal and replace Obamacare that failed to muster enough support  endorsed the bipartisan effort   We believe we need a package which stabilizes the market in the short term and lays the groundwork for a long term solution  that would overhaul Obamacare  they said in a joint statement  If passed in December  as opposed to before the Nov  1 beginning of enrollment for 2018 Obamacare insurance policies  it would be unlikely to affect premiums for next year  meaning its benefits might not be felt until 2019  Insurers have already decided whether to participate in the Obamacare markets and set higher rates to build in the possibility that the subsidies would vanish  Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies  but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles  co payments and other out of pocket medical expenses for low income people  The bill would also give more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage  Many Senate Republicans are nervous about the prospect of voting on any healthcare measure   no matter what legislation it may be attached to   that buttresses Obamacare  Part of the fear  one senior Senate Republican aide said  is that Trump s former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon is recruiting hard line conservative primary challengers to run against incumbent Republican senators next year  The aide said incumbents do not want to be forced to cast a controversial vote to stabilize Obamacare  a law reviled by many conservatives  If all 46 Senate Democrats and two independents back the Alexander Murray bill as expected  the support of the 12 Republicans means the bill has the 60 votes needed to reach the super majority required to pass most legislation in the Senate  Trump on Thursday underscored his concerns about the bill  He urged Alexander and Murray to be  careful with respect to the insurance companies   which he said are  extremely talented at making money   Alexander and Murray said their legislation does not bail out insurers  Alexander said House Republicans passed an Obamacare repeal and replace bill in May that also would continue subsidy payments for two years  
Alexander said Trump has called him four times in recent days on this subject  including a Saturday night call when he was at a restaurant and  my dinner got cold   He urged the president to support the initiative ",2017-10-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senator-unveils-rare-bipartisan-healthcare-initiative-544382,544382
114079,335594,THC,Judge rejects state AGs bid to revive ACA insurance subsidies,news,A U S  District Judge today refused to block Pres  Trump s decision to end subsidy payments to health insurers under the Affordable Care Act  a victory for the administration against Democrat state attorneys general who argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates  The judge  appointed by Pres  Obama  said the kind of emergency order requested by the states was not necessary  because  most state regulators have devised responses that give millions of lower income people better health coverage options than they would otherwise have had   After Trump s decision two weeks ago to end the insurance subsidies  18 states and D C  asked for an immediate order halting the move while the case is being litigated  Among relevant tickers  CNC  MOH  UNH  AET  WCG  CI  HUM  ANTM  GTS  HQY  QHC  HCA  THC  UHS  LPNT  CYH  HCP  SEMETFs  XLV  VHT  IYH  HQH  CURE  THQ  FHLC  FXH  RXL  RYH  RXD  SICK  LNGR  BTEC  JHMH  HCRFNow read ,2017-10-25,Seeking Alpha,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/judge-rejects-state-ags-bid-to-revive-aca-insurance-subsidies-547943,547943
114080,335595,THC,Tenet Healthcare  THC  Is Up 10 34  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Tenet Healthcare  THC   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Tenet Healthcare currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for THC that show why this hospital operator shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For THC  shares are up 10 34  over the past week while the Zacks Medical   Hospital industry is up 2 52  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 23 91  compares favorably with the industry s 3 61  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Tenet Healthcare have risen 48 32   and are up 58 81  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 5 64  and 21   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to THC s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  THC is currently averaging 1 017 886 shares for the last 20 days

Looking for Earnings Beats  Play These 5 Stocks
The third quarter earnings season is on its last leg  but investors  fervent search for earnings beat may not have ended  They will still look for an earnings beat in the rest of the to be reported quarter  Investors love earnings beat because it usually always translates into stock price appreciation  In fact  a beat works better than earnings growth in this regard  We ll tell you why 
What Makes Earnings Beat So Intriguing 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals raise serious doubts 
Also  seasonal fluctuations are crucial in determining a company s earnings growth  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline in Q1  In such cases  growth rates are misleading when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company 
On the other hand  Wall Street analysts rack their brains to study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to derive an earnings estimate 
Thus  beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  An impressive track record generally acts as a catalyst  sending the stock higher  It proves the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or  in other words  is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release as well

114104,335619,THC,Healthcare Stocks In Focus On  Price Transparency Rule,opinion,"On Nov 15  the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services   CMS   issued two rules  pursuant to President Trump s Executive Order on Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare What Are the Rules One of the rules requires hospitals to make prices for healthcare services available online beginning 2021  Hospitals will display prices for shoppable services as a total package in an easy to read  consumer friendly format  Hospitals are also required to make publicly available the negotiated rates they charge insurers for medical services and prescription drugs The other one is a proposal that requires insurance companies offering group and individual coverage to provide cost estimates to enrollees up front  so as to enable patients to take an informed decision about their healthcare spending  It requires insurers to make public their negotiated rates with in network providers and expected payments to out of network providers Reasons Driving the RuleAt present  a complex billing structure  resulting in bills from multiple providers  makes it difficult for patients to understand the real price and value of care provided to them Both the final and the proposed rule aim at making healthcare prices more transparent than ever before  The premise behind the rules is to lift the veil put into place by health insurers and hospitals  under which these players partner among themselves to provide healthcare services at inflated prices Per the government  this systematic inefficiency has enriched industry giants at the expense of patients  This is also evident from the fact that despite an increase in the cost of healthcare in the United States  the healthcare outcomes of the patients remains at low levels  Also  the government projects healthcare spending to consume almost 20  of the economy by 2027  one of the reasons being lack of transparency in pricing These rules are expected to foster greater competition among hospitals and insurers  thus bringing down the healthcare cost and improving its quality Initial ResistanceWhen the rules were proposed earlier this year  they met with great resistance from hospitals  insurers and other industry bodies that called this was a wrong approach to price transparency  The bodies also called for a reversal of course by the administration American Hospital Association stated that mandating the disclosure of negotiated rates between insurers and hospitals is a wrong approach  This would limit the choices available to patients in the private market and fuel anticompetitive behavior among commercial health insurers in a highly concentrated insurance industry Stocks RiseNevertheless  the final rules got a different reaction from the same players that were initially against them  Stocks of hospital and insurers players rose on doubts related to how the rules would be enforced  Also  the rules were less strict than anticipated  For instance  a maximum fine of  300 per day for failing to provide adequate price transparency by a hospital is perceived as low Also  a rule encouraging shopping for low cost insurance is likely to be a positive for insurers  This might lead people to shop at lower prices  thus reducing the cost for insurers and adding to their bottom line Shares of health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM    Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   and Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   gained 5 3   5 6   5 5  and 5 3   respectively  Hospital companies Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC   and HCA Healthcare Inc    NYSE HCA    Universal Health Services  Inc    NYSE UHS   rose 3 6   2 6  and 2 2   respectively Year to date  the Zacks  industry and the  industry have risen 9 9  and 14 5   respectively  compared with the  Zacks S P 500 composite s gain of 23 3

114105,335620,THC,Tenet  THC  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Tenet Healthcare  THC   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 27 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  32 04 in the previous session  Tenet Healthcare has gained 85 3  since the start of the year compared to the 5 7  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 15 5  return for the Zacks Medical   Hospital industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 4  2019  Tenet reported EPS of  0 58 versus consensus estimate of  0 28 
For the current fiscal year  Tenet is expected to post earnings of  2 65 per share on  18 4 billion in revenues  This represents a 42 47  change in EPS on a 0 48  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 9 per share on  19 01 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 19  and 3 32   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Tenet may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Tenet has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 3 1X versus its peer group s average of 5 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 0 77  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Tenet currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Tenet passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Tenet shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-11-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tenet-thc-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200486706,200486706

114113,335628,THC,U S  states sue to block Trump Obamacare subsidies cut,news,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Dan Levine WASHINGTON SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Eighteen U S  states sued President Donald Trump s administration on Friday to stop him from scrapping a key component of Obamacare  subsidies to insurers that help millions of low income people pay medical expenses  even as Trump invited Democratic leaders to negotiate a deal  One day after his administration announced plans to end the payments next week  Trump said he would dismantle Obamacare  step by step    His latest action raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets  The subsidies cost  7 billion this year and were estimated at  10 billion for 2018  according to congressional analysts   As far as the subsidies are concerned  I don t want to make the insurance companies rich   Trump told reporters at the White House   They re making a fortune by getting that kind of money   Trump s action took aim at a critical element of the 2010 law  his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama s signature domestic policy achievement  Frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control both houses of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare  Trump has taken several steps to chip away at it  Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging the law   Democratic attorneys general from the 18 states as well as Washington  D C   filed a lawsuit in federal court in California later on Friday  The states include  California  Connecticut  Delaware  Kentucky  Illinois  Iowa  Maryland  Massachusetts  Minnesota  New Mexico  New York  North Carolina  Oregon  Pennsylvania  Rhode Island  Vermont  Virginia and Washington state  The states will ask the court to force Trump to make the next payment  Legal experts said the states were likely to face an uphill battle in court    His effort to gut these subsidies with no warning or even a plan to contain the fallout is breathtakingly reckless   New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said   This is an effort simply to blow up the system   The new lawsuit would be separate from a case pending before an appeals court in the District of Columbia in which 16 Democratic state attorneys general are defending the legality of the payments  If the subsidies vanish  low income Americans who obtain insurance through Obamacare online marketplaces where insurers can sell policies would face higher insurance premiums and out of pocket medical costs  It would particularly hurt lower middle class families whose incomes are still too high to qualify for certain government assistance  About 10 million people are enrolled in Obamacare through its online marketplaces  and most receive subsidies  Trump s action came just weeks before the period starting on Nov  1 when individuals have to begin enrolling for 2018 insurance coverage through the law s marketplaces  The administration will not make the next payment to insurers  scheduled for Wednesday  U S  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer expressed optimism about chances for a deal with Republicans to continue the subsidy payments   We re going to have a very good opportunity to get this done in a bipartisan way  during negotiations in December on broad federal spending legislation   if we can t get it done sooner   Schumer told reporters  Trump offered an invitation for Democratic leaders to come to the White House  while also lashing out at them   We ll negotiate some deal that s good for everybody  But they re always a bloc vote against everything  They re like obstructionists   Trump told reporters  The Senate failed in both July and September to pass legislation backed by Trump to repeal Obamacare due to opposition by a handful of Republican senators  One of them  Susan Collins  a moderate Republican from Maine who had been contemplating running for governor next year  on Friday said she planned to remain in the Senate and would use her voice in reforming the healthcare system  SHARES OF INSURERS  HOSPITALS FALL Hospitals  doctors  health insurers  state insurance commissioners and patient advocates decried Trump s move  saying consumers will ultimately pay the price  They called on Congress to appropriate the funds needed to keep up the subsidy payments  Shares of U S  hospital companies and health insurers closed down on Friday after the subsidies announcement  Centene Corp  N CNC  closed down 3 3 percent and Molina Healthcare  N MOH  closed down 3 4 percent  Among hospital shares  Tenet Healthcare  N THC  finished 5 1 percent lower and Community Health Systems  N CYH  declined 4 0 percent   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that erasing the subsidies would increase the federal deficit by  194 billion over the next decade because the government still would be obligated under other parts of Obamacare to help lower income people pay for insurance premiums  Trump  who as a candidate last year promised to roll back the law formally called the Affordable Care Act  received applause for his latest action during an appearance on Friday before a group of conservative voters   It s step by step by step  and that was a very big step yesterday   Trump said   And one by one  it s going to come down  and we re going to have great healthcare in our country   Earlier on Twitter he called Obamacare  a broken mess  that is  imploding   and referred to the  pet insurance companies  of Democrats  Republicans for seven years had vowed to get rid of Obamacare  but deep intra party divisions have scuttled their efforts to get legislation through the Senate  where they hold a slim majority  Since taking office in January  Trump threatened many times to cut the subsidies  Health insurers that planned to stay in the Obamacare market prepared for the move in many states by submitting two sets of premium rates to regulators  with and without the subsidies  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the change would drive up premium costs for consumers by at least 12 to 15 percent in 2018 and cut more than  1 billion in payments to insurers for 2017  The White House announced the cut off just hours after Trump signed an order intended to allow insurers to sell lower cost  bare bones policies with limited benefits and consumer protections

114116,335631,THC,U S  senators reach bipartisan deal on Obamacare  Trump indicates support,news,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two U S  senators on Tuesday reached a bipartisan agreement to shore up Obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies for health insurers that President Donald Trump planned to scrap  and the president indicated his support for the plan  The deal worked out by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would meet some Democratic objectives  including reviving the subsidies for Obamacare and restoring  106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans  In exchange  Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage  The Trump administration said last week it would stop paying billions of dollars to insurers to help lower income Americans pay medical expenses  part of the Republican president s effort to dismantle Obamacare  former Democratic President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  The subsidies to private insurers cost the government an estimated  7 billion this year and were forecast at  10 billion for 2018  Trump s move to scuttle them had raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets  Trump hoped to make good on his campaign promise to dismantle the law when he took office in January  with Republicans  who pledged for seven years to scrap it  controlling Congress  But he has been frustrated with their failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace it  Obamacare  formally known as the Affordable Care Act  extended health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans  Republicans say it is ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy  The Alexander Murray plan could keep Obamacare in place at least until the 2020 presidential campaign starts heating up   This takes care of the next two years  After that  we can have a full fledged debate on where we go long term on healthcare   Alexander said of the deal  It is unclear whether the agreement can make it through Congress  Chuck Schumer  the top Senate Democrat  said it had  broad support  among senators in his party  but it was harder to gauge possible support among Republicans   Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins  who helped sink earlier Obamacare repeal legislation  voiced backing for the new plan  but conservative Republicans may be less welcoming  Senator Bernie Sanders  an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016  threw his weight behind the effort  In an interview with Reuters  Sanders said Alexander was a  well respected figure  known for bipartisanship and that the Tennessee senator s reputation would help propel the legislation through the Senate  The willingness of Sanders  a liberal champion  to offer his support of a deal with Republicans that could allow states to change some Obamacare requirements provided a boost to the Alexander Murray effort   We are going to overturn what Trump is trying to do   Sanders said  Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the plan to a vote on the Senate floor and urged the House of Representatives to take it up then as quickly as possible so Trump can sign it  TRUMP STILL SEEKS LONG TERM SOLUTION Trump  during comments at the White House  suggested he could get behind the Alexander Murray plan as a short term solution  In remarks later at the Heritage Foundation  a conservative think tank  Trump commended the work by Alexander and Murray  but said   I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies   Trump said earlier he wanted lawmakers  once they completed a major tax reform effort  to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states  Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  and Alexander is its chairman  She said the two were able to find common ground on the steps aimed at stabilizing the insurance markets created under Obamacare and to  help protect families from premium spikes as a result of the sabotage we have seen from this administration   According to a document seen by Reuters  the plan would make it easier for states to get waivers approved that would allow them to offer cheaper

114119,335634,THC,Wall Street found a parasite growing in the US economy that could spur the next recession,news,"Wall Street s short sellers are beginning to talk about healthcare as the next major threat to the US economy 
Costs are so high that the market will have to correct sooner rather than later 
Left unchecked  a market led correction will be brutal 

Imagine a parasite living in the US economy  siphoning off the cash that has powered the middle class for decades  We know it s there  but no one   on the right or the left   is talking seriously about how to slow its growth 
This parasite is our healthcare system  It is already causing more damage to the economy than you know  and at least one group of people seems to have this figured out  the same Wall Street doomsayers who predicted the financial crisis 
Here s what they know  in the broadest terms  Healthcare spending took up 4 8  of consumer spending in 1984  hit 8  in 2014  and then surged to 10  by 2016  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Now of course there are some on Wall Street who see this as a reason to go long  with some companies poised to rake it in as baby boomers age and costly diseases like cancer proliferate 
But the crowd I m talking about is focusing instead on what inefficiencies in pricing are doing to American wallets  They re looking at the bad actors in this healthcare system  the drug companies that are taking a 60 year old medicine and jacking up the price  the middlemen that inflate costs by inserting themselves between patients and providers  This crowd has noticed that these bad actors are pervasive in our system 
So the bet here is simple  America  one way or another  will be forced to confront the parasite that is its healthcare system  and the companies that are using the sleaziest tactics will be picked off first   by prosecutors  lawmakers  insurance companies  or the press   leaving sick customers in the lurch 
Short sellers  investors who bet that stocks will go down  are talking about this thesis at conferences and sending it around in their email newsletters  They re learning about scams and picking off weak companies to bet against  They see rising costs as a bubble that will be either gently deflated through federal government intervention or violently popped by the merciless hand of the market   with a savvy investor making money either way 
We have three options for dealing with this problem going forward 

We can handle rising cost with good policy and change the way we think about paying for healthcare 
We can handle this with bad policy and deliberately shift rising costs to consumers while the government abdicates its responsibility for the health of not only the American people but also the American economy 
Or we can do nothing  which would result in more rising costs  more corporate rent seeking behavior  and ultimately a recession as household resources go toward medicine and treatment instead of new cars  homes  clothes  or toys 

The US is hurtling at full speed toward the third option  That s because  at least realistically  the government has no plan to rein in costs  Healthcare costs today make up a sixth of the economy  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that the share will grow to a fifth in just eight years 
Blame Bill and Mike
There s an origin story for how Wall Street became aware of the gravity of this situation  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   The company s stock plunged 90  starting in October 2015 after the Street  and prosecutors  became aware of how Valeant was abusing the system to shove expensive drugs down the throat of insurance companies 
In other words  Valeant   then under the guidance of CEO Michael  Pearson   LON PSON    was the poster child for big pharma s even bigger greed  What s more  no one could ignore it because Wall Street s loudest megaphone  the hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman  was telling everyone and their mother what a great stock it was  He got in himself  and  like a lot of his peers  he lost his shirt 
Now that the dust has settled we know what Ackman  who joined Valeant s board  should have known 

Valeant was handing fat rebates to any middleman that stood in the way of getting an insurer to pay for expensive Valeant drugs 
It was spending tons of money acquiring and marketing old drugs instead of developing new ones 
It used its own pharmacy to push out Valeant drugs at a mind bending rate as long as insurers would continue to foot the bill 
It was finding ways to make copays disappear so customers would never know how much their drugs were costing insurers 

These are just some of the games Wall Street learned how to sniff out in big pharma  and once the short sellers on Wall Street could see it  they started to see it everywhere 
A few weeks ago I spoke with Andy Slavitt  the man who ran the Affordable Care Act   also known as Obamacare   during the Obama administration  and he briefly touched on how to improve price transparency in healthcare 
 It s going to take more than a few tweets from the president to bring real reform   Slavitt said  just before he hung up the phone   Once pharmaceutical costs reach 25  of Medicare  we re not going to like the choices we ll have to make  
We can handle this well
First things first  Just because we re not ready to tackle this doesn t mean the market isn t 
Wall Street has noticed that the market is pushing payers in a different direction  For one  more costs have shifted to consumers  part of why everyone is so outraged   and instead of our outdated fee for service model that pays the industry only when people are very sick  payers are experimenting with bundled payments   structuring payment on the basis of expected costs   and selective points of care  They re also trying to avoid expensive hospitals  sending patients to lower cost outpatient facilities for common treatments 
But this is happening unevenly  and a lot can go wrong  When sick people are involved  the collateral damage of bankrupted companies and panicked executives eyeing falling stock prices can be death 
So we should handle this correctly  On top of changing the way we pay for care  and thus incentivize care  we should make drug pricing transparent  We should allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices  We shouldn t allow drug companies to charge Americans a premium and pretend that it s going to research and development  it s not  
We should change regulations for marketing pharmaceuticals  We should curb the pharma lobby s power 
There are glimmers of hope  Twenty one states have passed laws addressing balance billing   when an out of network healthcare provider charges you for whatever your insurer didn t pay for  California and other states are trying to bring transparency to middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers  such companies often take a cut from drug companies and manage plans for insurers  but neither party knows the deal a PBM has cut with the other  It s secret  and it s stupid 
Stocks  by the way  are starting to fall on this news 

Express Scripts  the largest PBM  has seen its stock price decline by 17  over the past year   This after one of its biggest clients  the insurer Anthem  sued it in a 2016 lawsuit accusing it of overcharging  
Stock prices for the largest for profit hospital managers   Tenet Healthcare   NYSE THC  and Lifepoint  have fallen by 30  and 6  over the past year 
The Food and Drug Administration has sped up generic drug approval  putting pressure on prices 

Unfortunately  none of this is enough  It s barely a start  Corruption still abounds  and we ve done little to save ourselves from the chaos that could result from more dramatic  disorganized  market led change 
We can handle it badly
So far  the healthcare debate in the US has centered on Obamacare   a program that covers about 10  of Americans   and doesn t go far enough in addressing the larger system s incentives 
We re embarrassing ourselves 
At least  I was embarrassed while watching a meeting of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee during the second  or maybe third  attempt to repeal Obamacare  The meeting was about curbing the rising cost of prescription drugs  and most of the Republicans were off doing something useless in secret that eventually they would have to undo clumsily in public 
It was a frustrating session  Powerless Democrats listened as experts outlined ways to control costs that seemed fairly simple but are actually fairly insurmountable in our current system in which pharma money talks louder than any congressional expert witness  Sen  Sheldon Whitehouse  a Rhode Island Democrat  sounded exasperated  He said the Senate could solve drug pricing  in a week  if it weren t for the Supreme Court s Citizens United ruling on campaign spending   the pharmaceutical industry has spent billions of dollars lobbying Congress to keep this system opaque 
Whitehouse thinks billions might be overkill   We tend to come cheaper than that   he said  disgusted 
Now  perhaps you re saying to yourself   Linette  Bernie Sanders has a plan  
Let me stop you right there  Bernie Sanders has a political pipe dream at best  a political litmus test at worse  that won t pass one chamber of Congress  let alone two  There is no plan 
We can do nothing
When I say Wall Street has caught wind of this  I don t mean the whole of it  Some money managers in this market are still howling at the moon  shaking their fists at the Federal Reserve  blaming the distortions caused by low interest rates for our economy s slow growth 
But the economy is weak  in part  because of bad policy in healthcare   policy that has allowed healthcare expenditures to choke the life out of middle class wallets 
On Monday the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a report saying discretionary consumer spending had finally reached the place it was in 2007  In other words  Americans are finally spending as much on things like dining out and going on vacation as they did in 2007 
It s about time  As the New York Fed points out  discretionary spending recovered more slowly than it did in past downturns 
One of the reasons for this  we can extrapolate  is the rising cost of nondiscretionary spending in healthcare  In a previous report  the New York Fed noted that unlike  discretionary services  nondiscretionary services expenditures     fell less during the recent recession than they did in the early 1980s recession  primarily because real health care expenditures held up better in this recession  
In other words  healthcare is gobbling up more and more of our paychecks  Even if the government stopped paying for stuff  i e   we get rid of assistance through programs like Obamacare  someone has to pay for our country s sick 
In a service based economy like the US this matters a lot  The New York Fed thinks that Americans aren t spending because they re saving and that they re saving because they re worried about slow growth going forward  That could be true  But it could also be true that Americans simply don t have the money they used to because out of pocket healthcare costs are rising 
America is nothing without a growing class of people who buy school supplies for their kids  take vacations to national parks  eat out at restaurants  and do all the things middle class Americans have done since the 1950s  That s happening less and less  and Wall Street is starting to pinpoint one inescapable  intractable reason   and there s no plan to stop it 
When the next recession comes  don t be surprised if healthcare costs are what delivers it ",2017-10-18,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-found-a-parasite-growing-in-the-us-economy-that-could-spur-the-next-recession-543454,543454
114139,335654,THC,Earnings Preview  Tenet Healthcare  THC  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Tenet Healthcare  THC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 4  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This hospital operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 28 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 46 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tenet 
For Tenet  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tenet will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tenet would post earnings of  0 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 56  delivering a surprise of  27 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tenet doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-tenet-healthcare-thc-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200479089,200479089

What s Next for Tenet 
While Tenet has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

114143,335658,THC,ISM Services Index Rebounds In October  5 Top Ranked Picks,opinion,On Nov 4  the Institute for Supply Management  ISM  announced fresh figures for its non manufacturing  service  purchasing manager s index for the month of October  Notably  October s reading exceeded expectations and returned to the growth trajectory after a significant decline in the previous month The ISM Services index clearly reflects that the U S  economy has sustained its momentum despite lingering trade conflict and global economic slowdown  Gains were broad based and occurred in 13 out of the total 18 industries Service oriented businesses remained strong in August  improving for 117 consecutive months  Substantial expansion in the services sector is indicative of its continued attractiveness as an investment option  This is why it makes good sense to add stocks from this sector to your portfolio Better Than Expected Services Index in OctoberThe ISM reported that its service index came in at 54 7  for the month of October  beating the consensus estimate of 53 6  and previous month s reading of 52 6   September s reading was the lowest in three years  Notably  any reading above 50  indicates expansion of the services sector and a reading of above 55  reflects outstanding performance by the services sector A strong bunch of 13 industries expanded in October  The Business Activity Index came in at 57   up 1 8  year over year  Notably  the index has increased for 123 consecutive months  Additionally  the New Orders Index gained 1 9  to reach 60 3  while the Employment Index advanced 3 3  to rise to 53 7   The ISM mentioned that the respondents are mostly optimistic about overall business conditions  but concerns remain about tariffs and employment resources The report carried more significance in light of the ISM manufacturing index for October  which revealed that U S  manufacturing contracted for the third consecutive month  Investors were concerned that tepid data for both manufacturing and services sectors will eventually lead to a recession  Notably  the services sector accounts for 70  of the U S  GDP while the manufacturing sector commands around 12  of economic activities   Consumer Spending Remains StrongConsumer spending remained firm and is driving the U S  GDP  In the third quarter of 2019  the U S  economy grew 1 9   surpassing the consensus estimate of 1 6   primarily buoyed by a 2 9  increase in consumer spending  Two recently released consumer centric data   consumer confidence and consumer sentiment   clearly reflected that most Americans are happy with current economic conditions The Department of Labor reported that the non farm payroll in October came in at 128 000  surpassing the consensus estimate of 88 000  Average hourly wage rate in October grew 0 2  compared with 0  in September  The figure also matched the consensus estimate  Year over year  wage rate increased 3   faster than household inflation  which grew 1 8  Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in stocks from the services sector with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential  We have narrowed down

114144,335659,THC,Find Strong Buy Stocks Hitting New Highs With This Stock Screener ,opinion,"The S P 500  Dow Jones Industrial Average  and NASDAQ Composite all sit at or just below brand new all time highs to start November  The S P is now up 22  in 2019 and 5  in the last month  The recent positivity comes on the back of reported U S  China trade war progress  another Fed interest rate cut  and better than projected quarterly earnings results 
With this in mind  some investors prefer not to buy stocks at new highs  But if somebody asked you what the best stocks in your portfolio are  it s likely you would name the stocks moving up the most 
The most basic idea is that the winners in your portfolio are the ones going up  If a stock is underperforming the market or going down  you ll quickly identify it as one of your worst holdings  With that said  it makes sense that some of these stocks will be reaching new highs along the way 
Don t Be Afraid of New Highs
Many investors are hesitant to buy stocks making new 52 week highs  But there really isn t any reason to be  Some may worry that they have already missed the mark at that point  or that now it has more room to fall  Still  a stock making a new 52 week high is a  good thing   just as one falling to a new 52 week low is a  bad thing  
On top of that  would the person who doesn t want to buy stocks making new highs be upset if a stock they owned broke out to a new 52 week high  Statistics have also shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs  And aren t these the stocks we all dream about 
Now obviously  the fundamentals need to be there  and you should try to keep an eye on valuations  But if you were in a stock making new highs and cheering it on  it seems odd to be afraid of one doing the same just because you haven t bought it yet 
Think about this  A stock just made a new 52 week high  which is great news  Guess what  Last year it made a new 52 week high as well  And the year before that  And the year before that  Can you imagine all the money you d be leaving on the table if you were afraid of being in stocks every time they made a new high 
Parameters
  Current Price 52 Week High greater than or equal to  80
Stocks that are either at a new 52 week high  or have just hit it and are still trading within 20  of it  or are climbing towards their 52 week high and are within a 20  striking distance 
  Percent Change in Price over 12 Weeks greater than 0
Even though we re looking for stocks trading near their highs  I want to make sure the price momentum over the last 3 months is positive 
  Percent Change in Price over 4 Weeks greater than 0
The same goes for the last month as well 
  Zacks Rank equal to 1
Only Zacks Strong Buys for this one 
  Price Sales Ratio less than or equal to Industry Median
The P S ratio shows how much you re paying for every  1 of sales the company makes  For this screen  we re requiring the P S ratio to be less than the median P S for its Industry  Note  different industries will have different averages or medians for different items  A P S of 1 is not such a great bargain if the median for its Industry is 0 7  But it s a great find if the Industry s median is 1 5  This parameter lets us focus in on  discounted  valuations germane to their industry  And this allows these stocks to still be considered undervalued even as their stock price continues higher 
  P E  using F1 Estimates  less than or equal to Industry Median
Just like the P S ratio  we re looking for stocks whose P E is below the median for their respective Industry  Including proven valuation metrics when using price momentum screens gives the trader a significant advantage 
  Projected One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to Industry Median
While the P S and P E ratios searched for stocks with valuations below their Industry s median  This item is looking for stocks with projected growth rates above the median for its Industry  In order for a stock to continue to go higher  there needs to be a reason for it to do so  And strong growth  of course  is an important part of that 
  Current Avg  20 Day Volume greater than Previous Week s Avg  20 Day Volume
This helps find stocks where the volume has increased in the recent week vs  the previous week  Once again  if the price is climbing on increased volume  that shows increased demand or buying coming in  And the more buying demand there is for a stock  the more it should climb 
  All of the above parameters are applied to stocks with a Price greater than or equal to  5 and anAverage 20 Day Volume of greater than or equal to 100 000 shares 
  Percent Change in Price over 12 Weeks   Percent Change in Price over 4 Weeks equal to Top   5
The screen is then narrowed down to produce no more than 5 stocks at a time  The way we re doing it with this item is by combining the percentage price change for both the 12 week and 4 week periods to select the top 5 stocks  Why  If the 12  week   price change is solid  but the 4 week change is relatively weak  that might mean the stock is retreating from its high rather than advancing towards it  On the other hand  if the 12 week gain came largely from just the last 4 weeks worth of gains  while that s impressive  it shows that the trend prior to the most recent period wasn t as robust  This item tries to find the best gainers on both time horizons in an effort to see that momentum carries forward

announced fresh figures for its non manufacturing  service  purchasing manager s index for the month of October  Notably  October s reading exceeded expectations and returned to the growth trajectory after a significant decline in the previous month The ISM Services index clearly reflects that the U S  economy has sustained its momentum despite lingering trade conflict and global economic slowdown  Gains were broad based and occurred in 13 out of the total 18 industries Service oriented businesses remained strong in August  improving for 117 consecutive months  Substantial expansion in the services sector is indicative of its continued attractiveness as an investment option  This is why it makes good sense to add stocks from this sector to your portfolio Better Than Expected Services Index in OctoberThe ISM reported that its service index came in at 54 7  for the month of October  beating the consensus estimate of 53 6  and previous month s reading of 52 6   September s reading was the lowest in three years  Notably  any reading above 50  indicates expansion of the services sector and a reading of above 55  reflects outstanding performance by the services sector A strong bunch of 13 industries expanded in October  The Business Activity Index came in at 57   up 1 8  year over year  Notably  the index has increased for 123 consecutive months  Additionally  the New Orders Index gained 1 9  to reach 60 3  while the Employment Index advanced 3 3  to rise to 53 7   The ISM mentioned that the respondents are mostly optimistic about overall business conditions  but concerns remain about tariffs and employment resources The report carried more significance in light of the ISM manufacturing index for October  which revealed that U S  manufacturing contracted for the third consecutive month  Investors were concerned that tepid data for both manufacturing and services sectors will eventually lead to a recession  Notably  the services sector accounts for 70  of the U S  GDP while the manufacturing sector commands around 12  of economic activities   Consumer Spending Remains StrongConsumer spending remained firm and is driving the U S  GDP  In the third quarter of 2019  the U S  economy grew 1 9   surpassing the consensus estimate of 1 6   primarily buoyed by a 2 9  increase in consumer spending  Two recently released consumer centric data   consumer confidence and consumer sentiment   clearly reflected that most Americans are happy with current economic conditions The Department of Labor reported that the non farm payroll in October came in at 128 000  surpassing the consensus estimate of 88 000  Average hourly wage rate in October grew 0 2  compared with 0  in September  The figure also matched the consensus estimate  Year over year  wage rate increased 3   faster than household inflation  which grew 1 8  Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in stocks from the services sector with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential  We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks that skyrocketed year to date and still have upside left  Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see the

114146,335661,THC,Looking For Earnings Beat  Play These 5 Stocks,opinion,"The third quarter earnings season is on its last leg  but investors  fervent search for earnings beat may not have ended  They will still look for an earnings beat in the rest of the to be reported quarter  Investors love earnings beat because it usually always translates into stock price appreciation  In fact  a beat works better than earnings growth in this regard  We ll tell you why 
What Makes Earnings Beat So Intriguing 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals raise serious doubts 
Also  seasonal fluctuations are crucial in determining a company s earnings growth  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and its Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline in Q1  In such cases  growth rates are misleading when it comes to analyzing the true picture of a company 
On the other hand  Wall Street analysts rack their brains to study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to derive an earnings estimate 
Thus  beating this key number is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  An impressive track record generally acts as a catalyst  sending the stock higher  It proves the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or  in other words  is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release as well 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around five 
Here are the five stocks that passed the screen 
Care com Inc     NYSE CRCM     The company provides an online marketplace for finding and managing family care primarily in the United States and internationally  The stock belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 11  of 250  industries  and has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
Tenet Healthcare Corporation    NYSE THC     The company is an investor owned health care services company  which owns and operates general hospitals and related health care facilities for urban and rural communities in numerous states  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 and belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  top 11   
Fortinet Inc     NASDAQ FTNT     This provider of network security appliances and Unified Threat Management network security solutions to enterprises  service providers and government entities worldwide carries a Zacks Rank  1  The stock hails from a favorable Zacks industry  top 4

114150,335665,THC,Health stocks to watch in GOP s latest Obamacare repeal gambit,news,By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Health stocks are highly sensitive to news about regulatory and legislative change  This week is another test with the latest Republican effort to repeal President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  The overall S P 500 healthcare sector  SPXHC  has underperformed the broader stock market in the past two weeks as Senate Republicans seek to generate enough support to overhaul Obamacare with their latest bill  known as Graham Cassidy  The sector rebounded somewhat on Tuesday as odds for the bill s passage appeared to diminish after a key senator opposed it  The Senate faces a Saturday deadline because of an expiring rule that lets the Republican healthcare legislation pass with just a simple majority  Here are the main stocks expected to move most from news over the Republican repeal efforts  HOSPITAL OPERATORS Throughout the year  the ups and downs of Republican repeal efforts have swayed shares of U S  hospital companies such as HCA Healthcare Inc  N HCA  and  Tenet Healthcare  Corp  N THC   Those stocks benefited from Obamacare s coverage expansion by reducing the companies  unpaid patient bills  including by expanding the Medicaid government program for low income Americans  so the repeal proposals have generally been viewed as negative for hospital stocks   Graham Cassidy repeals enhanced federal funding for the Medicaid expansion beginning in 2020 and limits spending through a per capital cap  It also adds uncertainty by providing Medicaid funding through block grants to states that allows them to implement their own rules   The Graham Cassidy bill is looking to reduce funding for Medicaid in the longer term  That is a benefit that we have seen improve the earnings outlooks for these hospitals   said Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut   The proposal also repeals the requirement that individuals buy insurance or pay a fine  known as the individual mandate  which also could reduce insurance coverage  hurting hospitals  One possible positive for hospitals could be the bill s increase of funding to states that did not previously expand Medicaid under Obamacare  where some publicly traded hospital companies have facilities  said Ipsita Smolinski  managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street   HEALTH INSURERS  Like hospital stocks  shares of Medicaid focused insurers such as  Centene  Corp  N CNC  and  Molina Healthcare Inc   N MOH  stand to feel pressure should the legislation appear on track for approval   The perception would be fewer members on Medicaid and therefore less revenue   said Les Funtleyder  healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management  But Funtleyder said one benefit could be if the Medicaid block grants to states lead them to seek more services from the companies  Shares of bigger  more diversified health insurers such as Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH  have generally been more immune to news involving Obamacare repeal efforts this year  in part because they have largely pulled back from offering plans in the Obamacare individual health insurance exchanges  But Smolinski notes that while prior Republican repeal bills sought to roll back an industry fee   which was seen as positive for insurers   the Graham Cassidy bill does not end that fee  At the same time  these larger insurers have significant Medicaid businesses  and the bill leaves Medicaid funding uncertain after 10 years    If you think about them with regard to the Medicaid business  then that s probably a little bit of a headwind for them   Smolinski said  MEDTECH AND THE BROADER SECTOR The proposal repeals a tax on medical device manufacturers  seen as providing a modest boon for companies such as  Medtronic  Plc  N MDT    Stryker  Corp  N SYK  and Boston Scientific Corp  N BSX     They are the only industry that got relief here   Smolinski said  Overall  the passage of the bill could revive regulatory uncertainty over the broader healthcare sector  which hurt its performance ahead of the U S  election last year  Through Monday  the healthcare sector had climbed 18 2 percent in 2017  topping the 11 5 percent rise for the overall S P 500  SPX     If investors start worrying about what comes next or implementation issues  you could see a rotation into other sectors   Funtleyder said ,2017-09-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/health-stocks-to-watch-in-gops-latest-obamacare-repeal-gambit-533020,533020

Predictably  opinions vary on the GOP s new timeline 
Senator Bob Corker  R TN    Do I think there is a chance of them being successful  I do  I m not going to necessarily place a wager on it  
Senator Chuck Schumer  D NY    I understand that  for political purposes  the Republicans don t ever want to admit that ACA repeal is off the table  They promised it to the American people for seven years but deluded them on what it really meant  
GOP strategist Alex Conant   To the extent that we can make the healthcare debate about moving to a single payer  that is a positive for Republicans  I would much rather spend my time attacking Bernie Sanders  plan than defending a repeal and replace that never passed  
President Trump has stated his intention to press forward and negotiate with Democrats on healthcare legislation

114185,335700,THC,Hospital Industry Outlook  Rising Baby Boomers To Drive Growth,opinion,"The Zacks  industry comprises for profit hospital companies that provide healthcare facilities through different types of hospitals such as acute care  rehabilitation and psychiatricThese hospitals are engaged in internal medicine  general surgery  cardiology  oncology  neurosurgery  orthopedics and obstetrics  mental health care  and diagnostic and emergency services among others Hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program  state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs  managed care plans  including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges   private insurers and directly from patients Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes      Increasing Senior Population   According to the U S  Census Bureau  Americans aged 65 or older in the United States  comprising approximately 15 6  of the total population  are expected to increase to 19 3  in 2030 from 15 6  in 2017  Also  due to the anticipated increase in life expectancy of Americans  the number of people aged 85 years and older is also expected to increase to 9 million by the year 2030 from 6 million in 2015 This trend should drive demand for healthcare services and  consequently  for innovative  more sophisticated means of delivering those services  Hospitals  as the largest category of care in the healthcare market  will be among those impacted most directly by this increase in demand  Also  increase in healthcare expenditure will fuel demand for hospital services  Per CMS  in 2018  hospital care expenditures are projected to have grown 5 1   amounting to nearly  1 2 trillion  It further estimates that the hospital services category will amount to nearly  1 3 trillion in 2019 and projects growth in this category at an average of 5 7  annually from 2019 through 2026  This growth is expected to continue in the coming years on a surge in healthcare spending  which is estimated to grow by 5 5  in 2019 and 2020  and an average annual rate of 5 7  for 2021 to 2026      Consolidation   Consolidation activity in the hospital industry  primarily through  mergers and acquisitions involving both for profit and not for profit hospital systems  is continuing  Reasons for this activity include ample supply of available capital  attractive valuation levels  the desire to enhance the local availability of healthcare in the community  the need to recruit primary care physicians and specialists  to achieve general economies of scale and gain access to standardized and centralized functions  changes to healthcare models that emphasize cost effective delivery of service  and quality of outcomes for an entire episode of care and regulatory changes      Labor Shortage   However  the industry continues to face shortage of labor  labor costs form nearly 50 60  of hospital costs  specially relating to nurses  A decline in the number of nurses has led to an increase in hospital readmissions and stretches the length of stay  which has a negative impact on hospital companies  In order to better face the nursing shortage  which is expected to persist through 2025  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics   companies are designing their employee benefits to attract and retain nurses  Despite efforts to retain and expand its nursing staff  players will feel a financial pain  as turnover among nurses remains high and there are not enough new nurses entering the workforce Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects The Zacks Medical Hospital industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  103  which places it in the top 40  of more than 250 Zacks industries Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the top 40  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since January 2019  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone up by approximately 2  Given the industry s bright near term view  we will present some hospital stocks that one should hold on to  Before that  it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation Industry Beats Sector But Lags the MarketThe Zacks Medical Hospital industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Medical sector  but has lagged the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year Over this period  the industry has fallen 3 4 gained 10 7  versus the broader sector s declined of 12 5  rise of just 1 3  and the S P 500 s growth of 2 518 3  One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month EV to EBITDA ratio  which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks  the industry trades at 7 6X versus the S P 500 s 11 1X and the sector s 9 1X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 9 1X  as low as 7 1X and at a median of 7 8X  as the chart below  Ratio  TTM EV EBITDA Ratio  TTM Bottom LineFocus on expanding footprint and product portfolio through acquisitions  along with cost saving initiatives  are expected to drive the industry s growth  The efforts on the part of hospital companies to expand their healthcare network that provides convenience and choice to patients should drive admissions  Investments in technology will increase the efficiency of operations thus leading to superior care at lower costs  which should benefit all sections of the industry However  rising labor costs from shortage of nurses and skilled workforce have weighed on the industry s labor expense and will continue to do so

114209,335724,THC,Democrats urge full review before Senate vote on Obamacare attack,news,"By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    Democratic leaders in the U S  Congress on Monday demanded that lawmakers wait to find out the budgetary and healthcare impacts of a new  last ditch legislative effort by Republicans to repeal Obamacare before voting on it  In their long running war on former President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  Senate Republicans are now proposing to replace it with a system that would give states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programs  Drafted by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy  the bill was introduced last week  Graham and Cassidy said they were close to securing the votes needed for passage  but the bill s outlook was uncertain  If approved  it would replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act  known informally as Obamacare  which Republicans have long seen as government overreach into the healthcare business  The Graham Cassidy measure has revived a fight that many in Washington thought was over when an Obamacare repeal and replace bill flopped in the Senate in July  humiliating Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump  Two Senate committees  including the powerful Finance Committee  on Monday announced they would hold hearings on the bill next week  the first public hearings all year for any Republican Senate proposal to overhaul Obamacare   Republican Senator John McCain had called for a return to regular order and public hearings before voting against a repeal and replace bill in July  Senator Ron Wyden  the top ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee hearing  said next week s hearing  makes a mockery of regular order   The Congressional Budget Office  a non partisan fiscal analysis unit of Congress  said on Monday it will make a preliminary assessment of the bill s impact next week  But it said it will not be able to estimate the impact on the deficit or changes in insurance coverage or premiums for several weeks  Worried Democrats seized on the statement to urge Republicans to wait for a full CBO score before holding a vote   Have the courage and decency to wait for a CBO score   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor on Monday  The House of Representatives is on a break this week  A delay to wait for a CBO analysis is something Republicans can ill afford since in two weeks Senate procedural rules will make it much more difficult for them to advance the legislation  A special parliamentary procedure that would allow the bill to move forward in the Senate with a simple majority of only 51 votes will expire in two weeks  After that  it would need 60 votes  like most Senate legislation  Republicans have a slim 52 vote Senate majority   Schumer called Graham Cassidy a  Frankenstein monster of a bill  that would be costly for some states  He said Democrats would use every procedural tool to slow or stop its passage  Stock prices fell for small hospital chains that have high corporate debt loads and that likely would be hurt under the plan s probable decrease in government payments for patients  Community Health Systems closed down 35 cents  or 4 6 percent  to  7 26  and  Tenet Healthcare   NYSE THC  fell  1 01  or 6 0 percent  at  15 72  CONCERNS RAISED Trump has been telephoning members of Congress in recent days urging action on dismantling Obamacare  McConnell has not promised to bring Graham Cassidy to the floor for a vote  but he asked the CBO for a quick assessment  Not all the Senate s conservatives back the bill  Senator Rand Paul said it did not go far enough to repeal Obamacare  Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters he was worried that the bill would allow some states to set up their own single payer healthcare system  McCain and two other Republican senators  Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins  all of whom voted against the last Republican effort to repeal Obamacare  were said by aides to be undecided on the latest proposal  Collins  of Maine  told reporters she was still analyzing the measure  but listed several concerns  including possibly higher insurance premiums for older Americans  She said the Maine Hospital Association calculated her state would receive a billion dollars less in Medicaid and other federal healthcare spending over the next decade under the bill  and  that obviously is of great concern to me    But if it can get through the Senate  the plan may have a chance in the House of Representatives  also controlled by Republicans  Past Republican proposals to dismantle Obamacare have been hampered  in part  by CBO estimates that showed the bills would have left millions more Americans without health insurance

114231,335746,THC,Why Tenet  THC  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Tenet Healthcare  THC   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Hospital industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this hospital operator has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 96 25   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Tenet was expected to post earnings of  0 30 per share  but it reported  0 54 per share instead  representing a surprise of 80   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 24 per share  while it actually produced  0 51 per share  a surprise of 112 50  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Tenet  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Tenet has an Earnings ESP of  1 85  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 5  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-tenet-thc-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200445236,200445236
114232,335747,THC,Analysts Estimate Tenet Healthcare  THC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Tenet Healthcare  THC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This hospital operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 2  
Revenues are expected to be  4 48 billion  down 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tenet 
For Tenet  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tenet will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tenet would post earnings of  0 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 54  delivering a surprise of  80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tenet doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-tenet-healthcare-thc-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200446517,200446517

114237,335752,THC,Should Value Investors Pick Tenet Healthcare  THC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tenet Healthcare Corporation   NYSE THC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tenet Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 01  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 78  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Tenet Healthcare  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 72 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 51  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Tenet Healthcare has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 59  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tenet Healthcare  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tenet Healthcare has a P S ratio of about 0 12  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tenet Healthcare currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Tenet Healthcare a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Tenet Healthcare is just 0 55  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 06  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2  which is marginally better than the industry average of 4 97  Clearly  THT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Tenet Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of A  This gives THT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to three downward revisions  while the current year estimate has also seen five upward revisions compared to three downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate rose 31 8  in the past two months  whereas the current year estimate rose 0 85   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus   Even though the company has better estimate trends  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTenet Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than MarijuanaAmericans spend an estimated  150 billion in this industry every year  more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana Now that 8 states have fully legalized it  with several more states following close behind   Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand  One industry insider described  the future as  mind blowing    and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge ,2019-08-19,Zacks Investment

114244,335759,THC,Republicans try to pick up the pieces after healthcare defeat,news,"By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON  Reuters    The seven year Republican quest to scrap Obamacare  a major campaign vow by President Donald Trump  lay in ruins on Friday after the Senate failed to dismantle the healthcare law  with congressional leaders now planning to move on to other matters  John McCain  the maverick 80 year old senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee  cast the deciding vote in the dramatic early morning showdown on the Senate floor as a bill to repeal key elements of Obamacare was defeated  51 49  dealing Trump a crushing political setback  McCain  who flew from Arizona this week after being diagnosed with brain cancer and was heading back for further treatment starting on Monday  joined fellow Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski in voting with Senate Democrats unified against the legislation   It s time to move on   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  whose reputation as a master strategist was diminished  said on the Senate floor after the vote at roughly 1 30 a m   0530 GMT   While House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said fellow Republicans should not give up on healthcare  he cited other pressing issues that needed attention  including major tax cut legislation sought by Trump   We have so much work still to do   Ryan said in a statement  The Senate s healthcare failure called into question the Republican Party s ability to govern even as it controls the White House  Senate and House of Representatives   Trump has not had a major legislative victory after more than six months in office  and his administration is mired in investigations into contacts between his election campaign and Russia and high level White House staff infighting  He had promised to get major healthcare legislation  tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending through Congress in short order  Also on the legislative agenda are spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct  1 to avoid a government shutdown and raising the U S  debt limit  Speaking in Brentwood  New York  on Long Island  Trump expressed dismay at the bill s failure  saying   I said from the beginning  let Obamacare implode and then do it  pass legislation   I turned out to be right  Let Obamacare implode   Trump  who earlier on Twitter said the three Republicans who voted no  let America down   again took aim at lawmakers in his own party   Boy  oh boy  they ve been working on that one for seven years   he said in Brentwood   Can you believe that  The swamp  But we ll get it done    Some lawmakers urged a bipartisan effort to buttress the existing healthcare system  With the partisan divide as wide as ever in Washington  it remained to be seen if a bipartisan approach can get off the ground   McCain said the defeated bill did not offer meaningful reform and that its defeat presents  an opportunity to start fresh  on legislation crafted by lawmakers in both parties   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to trust each other  stop the political gamesmanship and put the healthcare needs of the American people first   McCain said  Top congressional Democrats urged a bipartisan effort to fix problems in the Obamacare law without repealing it   Change it  improve it  but don t just take a knife and try to destroy it and put nothing in its place   top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said  Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said he was working with Republican Collins on a bipartisan effort on healthcare  While Ryan was able to secure House passage of a comprehensive bill to gut Obamacare in May  McConnell earlier in the week was unable to win passage of similarly broad healthcare legislation amid intraparty squabbling and competing demands by hard line conservatives and moderates  On Friday morning  he failed to get even a stripped down  so called skinny bill over the finish line  BACKLASH FEARED Killing the Affordable Care Act  Democratic former President Barack Obama s signature domestic policy achievement dubbed Obamacare  has been a passion for Republicans since its 2010 enactment over their unified opposition  and was a key campaign promise by Trump last year  Republicans lawmakers  some of whom have been gleeful about razing Obama s presidential legacy  now fear a backlash from their conservative political base that could affect the 2018 congressional elections  For the moment  the Affordable Care Act  which extended health insurance to 20 million people and drove the percentage of uninsured people to historic lows  remains in place and must be overseen by an administration that is hostile to it  This leaves health insurers unsure of how long the administration will continue to make billions of dollars in Obamacare payments that help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income Americans  Schumer warned against any efforts to sabotage the law  The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  which represents insurers across the country  said it would work to ensure a smooth open enrollment period later this year and stabilize the individual insurance market under Obamacare for the long term  Shares of health insurers  which had fought against the bill s proposed repeal of the mandate that Americans obtain insurance  were up   Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  rose 0 9 percent  Anthem Inc gained 2 2 percent and  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  rose 0 5 percent   On Wall Street  shares of hospitals were mostly higher because of the dwindling prospects for big cuts in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled  Community Health Systems Inc rose 3 3 percent  HCA Healthcare Inc gained 0 5 percent and  Tenet Healthcare  Corp  NYSE THC  fell 0 6 percent   Republicans have long denounced Obamacare   which expanded Medicaid and created online marketplaces for individuals to obtain coverage   as an intrusion by government on people s healthcare decisions  Veteran House Republican Tom Cole said he thought there were  a number  of other Republican senators who were uncomfortable with the Senate s healthcare legislation but were able to vote  yes  knowing McCain s vote would kill it  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  a close friend of McCain  met on Friday with Trump to discuss Graham s proposal to take tax money raised by Obamacare and send it back to the states in the form of healthcare block grants  the senator s office said  
The skinny bill  released just three hours before voting began  would have retroactively repealed Obamacare s penalty on individuals who do not obtain health insurance  repealed for eight years a penalty on certain businesses that do not provide employees with insurance and repealed a tax on medical devices until 2020 ",2017-07-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senate-poised-for-healthcare-showdown-510791,510791

Corporation   NYSE THC    Tutor Perini Corporation   NYSE TPC    CommScope Holding Company  Inc    NASDAQ COMM   andCigna Corporation   NYSE CI   Top 5 Stocks with Solid Net Profit MarginThe primary motive of investors is to earn maximum returns from his stakes  Thus  they are always on the lookout for companies  which are raking in huge moolah Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same shows how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers

114270,335785,THC,Healthcare Tumbles On Trump s Price Disclosure Order,opinion,President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday  aimed at greater price disclosure of services provided by hospitals  This executive order  targeted at reforming healthcare  forms one of Trump s main political agenda  as he goes for re election in 2020 What the Executive Order StatesTrump s executive order calls for hospital and health insurance companies to make information public based on their negotiated rates  Hospitals are required to disclose to patients upfront  all the costs to be charged for routine services and medical procedures  It also requires patients to be informed about out of pocket costs like deductibles and copays for many procedures The news pulled down the stocks of major health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Humana Inc    NYSE HUM    Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   and Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   by 1 05   1 08   0 43  and 1 1   respectively Hospital stocks such as Community Health Systems and Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC  were down 5 17  and 2 57   respectively The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund was down 0 52  in yesterday s trading  Year to date  however  the fund has gained 10  compared with the S P 500 Index s rise of 0 3  What is Pinching Healthcare Providers The obscurity in healthcare pricing system is what is allowing hospitals and insurers to reap huge profits  while adding little value to the quality of service provided  The delivery of healthcare in the United States is provided by a closed network  with pharmaceutical companies at the nodal point  running all the way down to hospitals  In between  wholesalers  pharmacy benefit managers and insurers retain their share of profits and pass on the cost to the final consumers or patients  thus making the entire process rather expensive Hospitals in the United States get reimbursed for their services for many sources such as government for medicare and medcaid among others  and from private health insurers  While the reimbursement provided for government services is available to public  what is received from private insurers is confidential Contracts between hospitals and insurers have been in question for long   Key hospital systems use many shady terms that bind insurers to include them in every plan and prohibit the use of less expensive healthcare options  Deal terms also go to the extent of masking prices from customers  limited audit of claims and adding extra fee among others Participants from the healthcare industry defended the order by saying that the contractual agreements between hospitals and insurers are proprietary and should remain under wraps Managed care attempts to direct and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts from established gross charges  The health insurance industry reacted to the executive order by saying that any such law  if formed  would be of little help in bringing down costs  as hospitals which are providing discounts on their services will be forced to raise prices to match the top tier facilities Will It Serve the Purpose Industry participants are of the view that unveiling proprietary rates charged by hospitals might lead to an opposite effect  Due to different rates charged by different hospitals  the one offering low rates will be lured to increase their rates to match its competitor  which will in turn reduce competition and increase cost for patients Will the Pain be Felt Soon The executive order to be metamorphosed into law will have to pass through the rule making process  which might take time running from many months to even years  This means that there will be no immediate change in the industry Nevertheless  even a little hint of impending discomfort is enough to shoo away investors from the already heavily regulated industry Among the stocks mentioned above  Anthem carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  You can see Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2019-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/healthcare-tumbles-on-trumps-price-disclosure-order-200434521,200434521

114280,335795,THC,Senate Republicans unveil Obamacare replacement bill  fate uncertain,news,By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Senate leaders on Thursday unveiled a draft of legislation to replace Obamacare  proposing to kill a tax on the wealthy that pays for it and reduce aid to the poor to cut costs  The draft bill s fate was immediately thrown into question  however  by a statement from Senator Rand Paul and three other conservative Republicans  who said they were  not ready to vote  for it  Democrats need the support of only three Republicans to quash the measure in the Republican led chamber  The emergence of four Senate skeptics underscored the difficulty for Republicans of steering the legislation down a narrow path to passage  Democrats already deeply oppose Republican attempts to overhaul former President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  The 142 page proposal  worked out in secret by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with other Republican leaders  was welcomed by President Donald Trump  Despite celebrating its passage at the time  the president later privately bashed as  mean  a version approved last month in the Republican led House of Representatives  according to congressional sources   Trump  who said on Wednesday he wanted a health plan  with heart   told reporters at the White House that healthcare legislation would require  a little negotiation  but it s going to be very good   He said he doubted Democrats would help  Reaction to the proposal ranged from lukewarm to outright derision  Republican Senator John McCain said he would check with his constituents in his home state of Arizona   I expect there s going to be a number of changes between now and the final vote   said Senator John Barrasso  Obamacare  formally known as the Affordable Care Act  is credited with expanding health insurance to millions of Americans since its passage in 2010  Republicans say it costs too much and involves the federal government too much in healthcare  Trump made Obamacare repeal a centerpiece of his 2016 election campaign  Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare  and say the Republican bill will make healthcare unaffordable for poorer Americans while cutting taxes for the wealthy  MEDICAID EXPANSION PHASE OUT The Senate s draft bill proposes repealing the 3 8 percent net investment income tax on high earners retroactively to the start of 2017  The tax  which affects high income Americans and was imposed to help pay for Obamacare  has been a key target for Republicans  The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House bill  but differs in several key ways  It would phase out Obamacare s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled over three years  from 2021 to 2024  and then enact deeper cuts in the program than the House version  beginning in 2025  It would also allow states to add work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees   The legislation also reshapes subsidies to low income people for private insurance  The subsidies will be linked to recipients  income in the Senate bill  a  major improvement  from a measure approved last month by the House that tied them solely to age  Republican Senator Susan Collins said   The current bill does not repeal Obamacare   Paul said   It does not keep our promises to the American people  I will oppose it coming to the floor in its current form  but I remain open to negotiations    Democratic leaders of Congress  who want the Obamacare law fixed but not abandoned  immediately attacked Senate Republicans  version   The president said the House bill was mean   said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer   The Senate bill may be even meaner   McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill   I regret that our Democratic friends made clear early on that they did not want to work with us in a serious  bipartisan way to address the Obamacare status quo  But Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act  and we are   McConnell said  Like the House bill  the Senate would repeal a penalty associated with the individual mandate requiring most people to have health insurance or else pay a fine  Policy experts said that would keep more young  healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool  The legislation would also repeal the penalty associated with the employer mandate that they provide employees health insurance  The Senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market  allotting  15 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 and  10 billion a year in 2020 and 2021  The Senate bill proposes defunding Planned Parenthood for a year  but abortion related restrictions are less stringent than the House version  There is uncertainty over whether abortion related provisions will meet Senate rules  but those provisions could be included in another Senate bill  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the House bill would kick 23 million people off their healthcare plans  The CBO is expected to weigh in on the Senate draft bill early next week  As lawmakers made speeches about the legislation on the Senate floor  a protest erupted outside McConnell s personal office  with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway  holding signs and chanting   No cuts to Medicaid   U S  Capitol Police said 43 protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction  McConnell may have a tough job convincing enough Republican senators that the Senate bill improves on the House version  A Reuters Ipsos poll this month found nearly 60 percent of adults believed the House bill would make insurance costlier for low income Americans and people with pre existing conditions  Only 13 percent said it would improve the quality of healthcare   nL1N1JI12K  HOSPITAL STOCKS SURGE U S  hospital stocks were trading sharply higher after the bill was released  HCA Healthcare Inc  N HCA

Corporation   NYSE THC    Tutor Perini Corporation   NYSE TPC    CommScope Holding Company  Inc    NASDAQ COMM   andCigna Corporation   NYSE CI   Top 5 Stocks with Solid Net Profit MarginThe primary motive of investors is to earn maximum returns from his stakes  Thus  they are always on the lookout for companies  which are raking in huge moolah Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same shows how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers

114323,335838,THC,Trump gains traction on healthcare bill  vote set for Thursday,news,"By Steve Holland and Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s effort to roll back Obamacare gained momentum on Wednesday as Republican leaders scheduled a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday on newly revised legislation  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy expressed confidence the bill would pass and several moderate Republican lawmakers who previously objected to the bill said they could now support it  A vote was expected as early as midday Thursday  with lawmakers planning to leave town later that day for a week long recess  Late on Wednesday  the bill cleared a procedural step allowing it to advance to the House floor  Even if a narrow majority in the House approves the bill  it still faces a steep climb in the Senate  where only a few defections could kill the effort  Keen to score his first major legislative win since taking office in January  Trump threw his own political capital behind the bill  meeting with lawmakers and calling them in an effort to cajole their support  Trump  whose Republican party controls both the House and Senate  is seeking to make good on his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare  Aides said he worked the phones furiously  Wavering moderate Republicans had worried that the legislation to overhaul President Barack Obama s 2010 signature healthcare law would leave too many people with pre existing medical conditions unable to afford health coverage  But several Republican skeptics got behind the bill after they met with Trump to float a compromise proposal that is still expected to face unanimous Democratic opposition  The legislation s prospects brightened further after members of the Freedom Caucus  a faction of conservative lawmakers in the House who played a key role in derailing the original version of the bill last month  said they could go along with the compromise  The bill is also receiving a torrent of opposition from medical groups  including the American Medical Association  who say millions of Americans will lose coverage or face higher costs  Millions more Americans got healthcare coverage under Obamacare  but Republicans have long attacked it  They view it as a government intrusion into the healthcare system and blame it for driving up costs  Called the American Health Care Act  the Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes  including a penalty for not buying health insurance  It would slash funding for Medicaid  the program that provides insurance for the poor  and roll back much of Medicaid s expansion   The latest effort comes after earlier pushes by Trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice  underscoring the difficulty of rallying together the Republican party s divided factions  Earlier this week  prospects for the legislation appeared grim as several influential moderate Republicans said they could not support the bill  citing their concerns about protecting people with pre existing conditions  Putting a spotlight on the concerns about pre existing conditions  late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel made a tearful plea for keeping that provision in Obamacare as he recounted a medical emergency that arose with his newborn son   Kimmel s monologue about his son s congenital heart condition was viewed nearly 19 million times on his show s Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page and on Wednesday morning was the No  1 trending story on YouTube  Republican Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long  who were part of a group of moderate lawmakers who met at the White House with Trump  said the president endorsed their plan to add  8 billion over five years to help cover the cost for people with pre existing illnesses who could otherwise be priced out of insurance markets  Describing Trump s efforts to secure his support  Long said Trump told him    Billy we really need you  man    Representative Mark Meadows  chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus  said the new language on pre existing conditions was a  net plus  for garnering the votes needed to pass the healthcare bill  Critics of the changes to the law  including several health policy experts  said the  8 billion could not be enough to cover the cost of coverage for the sickest patients  Republicans did not await a new score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to see how many people would be insured under their revised plan and how much it would cost  UNCERTAINTY FOR STOCKS Health insurers  such as Anthem Inc  N ANTM   UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH    Aetna Inc   N AET  and  Cigna Corp   N CI   have faced months of uncertainty over healthcare s future  So have hospital companies  such as  HCA Holdings Inc   N HCA  and  Tenet Healthcare  Corp  N THC   On Wednesday  Aetna said it will exit the Obamacare individual insurance market in Virginia next year  citing  growing uncertainty  and expected losses this year  House Democrats rejected the latest change to the Republican legislation on Wednesday  saying patients with pre existing illnesses would be vulnerable to being pushed off their insurance in certain states and face higher costs    This is deadly   House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told a news conference   No Band Aid will fix it    Democrats have long thought their best chance of stopping the repeal would be in the Senate  where only a few Republicans would need to defect to stop the law from moving forward  
The difficulty in the House is now making Democrats optimistic that Republicans will face backlash from voters and face losing seats in the 2018 midterm elections ",2017-05-03,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-courts-moderates,-scrambles-to-head-off-healthcare-defeat-479766",479766

114325,335840,THC,U S  House passes healthcare bill in major Trump victory,news,"By David Morgan and Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  House of Representatives approved a bill on Thursday to repeal major parts of Obamacare and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan  handing President Donald Trump his biggest legislative victory but setting up a tough fight in the Senate  With the 217 213 vote  Republicans obtained just enough support to push the legislation through the House  sending it to the Senate for consideration  No Democrats voted for the bill   The bill s passage represented a step toward fulfilling a top Trump campaign pledge and a seven year Republican quest to dismantle Democratic former President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  But the effort now faces new hurdles in the Senate  where the Republicans have only a 52 seat majority in the 100 seat chamber and where just a few Republican defections could sink the bill   Thursday s vote was also a political victory for House Speaker Paul Ryan  demonstrating his ability to pull together a fractured Republican caucus after two failed attempts this year to win consensus on the healthcare legislation   Democrats are hoping that the Republicans  vote to repeal Obamacare will spark a voter backlash in next year s midterm congressional elections   Some 20 million Americans gained healthcare coverage under Obama s 2010 Affordable Care Act  which has recently gathered support in public opinion polls  But Republicans have long attacked it  seeing the program as government overreach and complaining that it drives up healthcare costs  The Republican bill  known formally as the American Health Care Act  aims to repeal most Obamacare taxes  including a penalty for not buying health insurance  It would slash funding for Medicaid  the program that provides insurance for the poor  and roll back much of Medicaid s expansion  UPBEAT TRUMP Even as lawmakers were voting  Trump announced plans to hold a victory celebration in the White House Rose Garden if the legislation was approved   Insurance companies are fleeing ObamaCare   it is dead  Our healthcare plan will lower premiums   deductibles   and be great healthcare    he said in a tweet as the debate wound up ahead of the vote  Despite having control of the White House and both chambers of Congress  Republicans have found that overturning Obamacare    which they have long criticized as government overreach   is politically fraught  in part because of voter fears that many people will lose their health insurance as a result  As Republicans crossed over the vote threshold to pass the bill  Democrats in the House began singing  Na na  na na na na  hey hey hey  goodbye   a rowdy reference to their belief Republicans will lose in the 2018 midterm elections due to their vote  One of the central issues in the House debate was the treatment of people with  pre existing  conditions  Obamacare prevented insurers from charging those with pre existing conditions higher rates  a common practice before its implementation  It also required them to cover 10 essential health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs  The Republican bill passed on Thursday would allow states to opt out of those provisions  While insurers could not deny people insurance because of pre existing conditions  they would be allowed to charge them as much as they want  In an analysis released on Thursday  healthcare consultancy and research firm Avalere Health said the Republican bill would cover only 5 percent of enrollees with pre existing conditions in the individual insurance markets   ZOMBIE  RETURNS  Obamacare expanded Medicaid  provided income based tax credits to help the poor buy insurance on individual insurance markets set up by the law  and required everyone to buy insurance or pay a penalty  Republicans have blamed it for driving up healthcare costs  and argued that their bill would give people more choice and reduce the role of government   We can have fair healthcare without trapping everyone in a government run system dreamed up by central planners   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in the closing minutes of the debate  Democrats blasted the bill  saying it would make insurance unaffordable for those who need it most and would leave millions more uninsured  They also accused Republicans of seeking tax cuts for the wealthy  paid for in part by cutting health benefits   It s come back like a zombie  even more scary than before   said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi  referring to the various versions of the Republican healthcare plan that have been floated in recent weeks  In a push to pass the bill before members leave on Friday for a week in their home districts  the House voted before the bill was assessed by the non partisan Congressional Budget Office  which estimates its cost and effect on insurance rolls  Republicans have said that the bill will be scored by the CBO and other fixes will be made before the Senate votes  Trump made overturning Obamacare a cornerstone of his 2016 campaign and has been frustrated as two efforts to push a bill through the House failed in the last two months  a reflection of the difficulty of reconciling Republican factions  PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS  Wavering moderate Republicans had worried that the legislation would undo a popular aspect of Obamacare and leave too many people with pre existing medical conditions unable to afford health coverage  But the skeptical Republican lawmakers got behind the bill after embracing a compromise proposal to add  8 billion over five years to help cover the cost for people with pre existing illnesses who could otherwise be priced out of insurance markets  Nearly every major medical group  including the American Medical Association  American Hospital Association and the AARP  was strongly opposed to the Republican bill and said last minute amendments further eroded protection for the most vulnerable groups  including the sick and elderly

114333,335848,THC,Is Tenet Healthcare  THC  A Good Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tenet Healthcare Corporation   NYSE THC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tenet Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Tenet Healthcare s current PE level puts it below its midpoint  17 2  over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting that it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Tenet Healthcare has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tenet Healthcare stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tenet Healthcare has a P S ratio of about 0 2  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  this is below the highs for this stock  0 4  in particular over the past few years If anything  the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tenet Healthcare currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Tenet Healthcare a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Tenet Healthcare is 0 6  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 9  which is far better than the industry average of 6 7  Clearly  THC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Tenet Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D  This gives THC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 19 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 20 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTenet Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 40   and strong Zacks Rank  Tenet Healthcare looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best

What s Next for Tenet

114352,335867,THC,Health industry breathes easier as post Obamacare path stabilizes,news,By Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    Hospitals and health insurers are gaining confidence that their nightmare scenario   millions of Americans instantly losing health insurance once President elect Donald Trump delivers on a promise to  repeal and replace  Obamacare   is looking more like a bad dream than becoming reality  The early view from the healthcare sector still includes an end eventually to President Obama s signature health program  But Trump s picks to head the U S  health department and its top regulator on Tuesday  along with his recent softening on some aspects of the existing law  is a sign to some sector insiders that instead of chaos  an orderly transition of up to three years to replace it with a plan that healthcare companies actually want could be in store  Trump tapped Republican Representative Tom Price  an orthopedic surgeon who drafted legislation years ago to replace the Affordable Care Act  ACA   as head of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  Consultant Seema Verma  who helped Vice President elect Mike Pence create a Medicaid expansion plan in Indiana  is his choice to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  Both must be confirmed by the U S  Senate   Democrats bemoan the choices  saying they will gut the 2010 law that gave insurance to about 20 million people through the creation of new individual health insurance and the expansion of Medicaid for the poor  But some healthcare companies  including insurers  doctors groups and hospitals  said they were encouraged by the appointments of experienced healthcare insiders   From our standpoint  we want to make sure that as many people as possible maintain  insurance  coverage   said Dr  Mario Molina  CEO of Molina Healthcare  which provides Medicaid and Obamacare individual insurance plans   I think the pieces of the healthcare puzzle are kind of coming together for us now   That picture looks increasingly like lawmakers will bring Trump a  repeal  bill in January that lays out at least a two year timeline for changing the law  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that the House would start working on repealing and replacing Obamacare  right away   but with a transition period to allow changes to be phased in over time  That period could be up to three years  warned Senate Finance committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  in order  to work through the problems    Kathleen Harrington  chair of Policy of Government Relations for the Mayo Clinic  said so far she likes what she hears from Republicans on changes to health insurance    We are very encouraged with the approach we re hearing so far from President elect Trump in terms of having a focused review and removing certain parts of it   she said  The key for Republicans is shifting the bulk of the oversight of individual insurance and the Medicaid program to the states  and changing the way both are funded   Insurers  who currently submit individual plans to both the state and the federal government  say this will allow them to sell more flexible health plans  For hospitals  the Verma appointment and Pence s Medicaid expansion in Indiana are signs that one of their major sources of government reimbursement for medical services could continue to grow  To be sure  it remains unclear what the overall impact will be on Medicaid and Medicare going forward  Both insurers and hospitals are watching for any negative impact from any changes  and anticipated cuts in funding  Investors have already been playing the winners and losers of reforming health insurance  The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has gained 7 percent since Trump was elected as the possibility of Hillary Clinton enacting new legislation on drug pricing disappeared  On the other hand  shares of hospital chains have sold off sharply  including a 26 percent decline for  Tenet Healthcare   NYSE THC   on the fears that millions of newly uninsured patients will need care but not be able to pay their bills if and when the ACA is repealed  MEDICAID EXPANSION   Pence  who is expected to take a large role in shaping the administration s healthcare policy  backed a plan in Indiana developed by Verma in which beneficiaries contribute to the cost of their healthcare   It s pretty clear that she is on the side of expanding Medicaid  but putting some conditions on it   said Joseph Antos  a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute  Antos expects the replacement plan to also include individual insurance that has a form of Federal subsidies  as envisioned in House Speaker Paul Ryan s proposed plan to replace Obamacare  AgileHealthInsurance com  which sells short term health insurance plans that are allowed to exclude benefits guaranteed under the ACA  expects the law to allow more choice so that insurers can design cheaper plans to hit a certain price point of  100 per month or  200 per month  as they did before the ACA  according to executive director Sam Gibbs   Prices of Obamacare insurance rose about 25 percent for 2017 and large insurers including UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  have abandoned plans for next year  saying that they are losing too much money on sick customers  Under Price and Verma  it could be the states once again making most of the decisions about mandatory benefits with the Federal government providing only a broad framework  Gibbs suggested   At benefits company Stride Health  which sells and manages healthcare benefits to  gig  workers like Uber drivers  CEO Noah Lang said that he would want to be sure that the replacement plan has tax credits available to people as they need them  rather than at the end of the year only  Blair Childs  senior vice president at hospital purchasing group Premier  said members of Congress are already asking healthcare companies for input on a roadmap for the ACA

114355,335870,THC,Industry questions higher insurance costs under Republican plan,news,"By Michael Erman and Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    The House Republican health insurance plan suggests health insurance after Obamacare will be less affordable  investors  insurers and industry sources said on Tuesday  raising questions about future enrollment and insurance company participation  The draft legislation  released on Monday night  rolls back some of the key tenets of former President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  known as Obamacare  including the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid  In addition to eliminating the requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance  it creates a system of new tax credits to coax people to purchase private insurance on the open market  The bill has the support of President Donald Trump  who has vowed to repeal and replace the 2010 law  But some Republican lawmakers whose support is needed for the final legislation   and Democrats   said they wanted details on how it would affect U S  consumers   Under the draft legislation  Obamacare s income based and location based tax credits are replaced by credits with fixed amounts up to a maximum income level   Because the bill has just been proposed and aims mostly to repeal the existing law rather than introduce new policies  it is unclear exactly how future changes could make the plan affordable and draw insurers into the market   But some initial reaction  particularly from hospitals  was critical  The American Hospital Association said in a letter to Congress that it could not support the draft legislation in its current form  The BlueCross BlueShield Association  which represents BCBS insurers across the country that cover the vast majority of the about 10 million people enrolled in 2017 Obamacare plans  said the insurers were glad to see the extension of many Obamacare aspects into 2019  But it emphasized the need for the replacement to be affordable    It is important that the tax credit for 2020 creates a marketplace that enables people to get the coverage they need at a price they can afford   BCBSA Senior Vice President Alissa Fox said in statement  The Association for Community Affiliated Plans  which represents health plans serving Medicaid for the poor and other public health programs  said it was concerned the structure would raise costs for people currently in the marketplace  Because insurance costs  healthcare costs and incomes vary so dramatically around the country  the new tax credit would affect some people more than others   I think there s a reasonable concern that people in high cost states who are lower income will have a hard time finding affordable care   said Paul Howard  director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute  But the draft legislation also sets up a  100 billion fund over 10 years that states could use to structure subsidies for their members and offset some of that  he noted  Insurers have also asked to be able to offer plans with fewer benefits that could be sold at lower prices  Howard said  Since the draft removes the mandate requiring people to have insurance  the impact on enrollment from that measure is not clear  Standard   Poor s estimated that the draft plan would reduce individual enrollment  now at around 10 million  by 2 to 4 million people  Steve Brozak  managing partner at WBB Securities  said he believed that under the Republican package   people will be forgoing insurance    He also said that  as it is currently designed  insurers will have difficulty attracting people who do not have an immediate need for healthcare  like younger  healthy people who are less expensive to insure  Still  Brozak expects that this draft is only a first step and likely to change  It is expected to be voted on this month in the House before moving to the U S  Senate   SHARES FALL The draft plan  along with Republicans  proposed restructuring of the Medicaid program for the poor and the loud opposition from some Republican lawmakers  created uncertainty that drove down shares of hospitals and insurers  Republicans will need the buy in from BlueCross BlueShield insurers like Anthem Inc  particularly after UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH    Aetna Inc   N AET  and  Humana Inc   N HUM  exited most of the states where they sold individual insurance plans under Obamacare   Shares of hospital operators sold off  with  Community Health  Systems  N CYH  down more than 8 percent and  Tenet Healthcare   N THC  off 7 percent  Reaction in health insurer stocks was more subdued  Molina Healthcare  N MOH  fell 1 3 percent and Cigna  N CI  dropped 1 percent  while Humana  N HUM  gained more than 2 percent and Anthem  N ANTM  was little changed  The American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association  which represents doctors  declined to comment on the draft legislation  Support for government run health insurance has risen over the past five years  according to the Reuters Ipsos national tracking poll   Between February and March  47 percent of Americans said the government should have at least a  major role  in providing health insurance  That was up from 39 percent who answered the same way when the poll first asked the question in January 2012  The Reuters Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states  The latest poll ran from Feb  25 to March 6 and included responses from more than 2 700 American adults  It has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of 2 percentage points

114358,335873,THC,Medical providers oppose Trump backed health plan  Democrats take aim,news,"By Susan Cornwell and Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    The top U S  doctors  organization and several hospital groups came out strongly on Wednesday against a Republican plan backed by President Donald Trump to overhaul America s healthcare system  as Democrats mounted a fierce battle to thwart the bill  Two House of Representatives committees began debating the plan and considering amendments two days after it was unveiled by Republican leaders  The legislation aims to repeal and replace the Obamacare law  which Republicans call a government overreach that has ruined healthcare in the United States  Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress campaigned last year on a promise to dismantle the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama   But they face resistance from conservatives in their own party who have condemned the bill as too similar to the law it is meant to supplant  Democrats  meanwhile  have denounced it as a gift to the wealthy that will take insurance away from millions of people   What they re doing is very destructive      It represents the biggest shift of money to the wealthiest people in our country  the top 1 percent  at the cost of working families   House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters  Doctors and other providers said the bill would probably cause many patients to lose insurance and raise healthcare costs  The American Medical Association doctors  group urged senior lawmakers in a letter to reconsider drastic changes to Medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor  The AMA  which supported Obamacare  said the replacement of income based subsidies with age based tax credits to help people buy insurance would make coverage more expensive  if not out of reach  for poor and sick Americans   Obamacare  formally called the Affordable Care Act  enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage  about half through a Medicaid expansion the new bill would end  Insurers are worried about the affordability of the tax structure and proposed major changes in Medicaid financing  In a letter to Congress  America s Health Insurance Plans  which represents Anthem Inc and others  indicated that was still a concern  despite many aspects of the draft that would help stabilize the individual insurance market  Seven hospital groups  including the American Hospital Association  America s Essential Hospitals and the Catholic Health Association of the United States  also voiced opposition  writing in a letter to lawmakers that the proposal could lead to  tremendous instability  for people seeking affordable medical coverage  including children  the elderly and disabled  Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade  But the bill s fate is far from certain  with a number of Republican conservatives saying it is not a full repeal and sets up new entitlement programs  Trump met with leaders of conservative groups on Wednesday who have concerns about the bill   I m encouraged that the president indicated they are pushing to make changes   David McIntosh from one of the groups  Club for Growth  told reporters after the meeting   CONSERVATIVE WISH LIST  The House Ways and Means Committee  with jurisdiction over taxes  and the House Energy and Commerce Committee  which oversees health issues  kicked off what could become marathon sessions working on the legislation  The plan would scrap the Obamacare requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance and would replace its income based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to coax people to buy private insurance on the open market  Trying to mollify skeptics in his party  House Speaker Paul Ryan  an architect of the plan  touted it as  a conservative wish list  and  monumental  exciting conservative reform   Representative Mark Walker  head of the Republican Study Committee  RSC   the largest group of conservatives in Congress  said RSC leaders might support the bill if two changes are made  The first  proposed by Representative Joe Barton in the Energy and Commerce Committee  would bring forward the end of enrollment in Medicaid expansion by two years to January 2018  The second would make age based tax credits for purchasing health insurance partially rather than fully refundable  With those changes   we d be a hard  yes    Walker told reporters  Democrats were using every procedural maneuver possible to delay the committee work  including demanding votes to adjourn on the House floor  The top Energy and Commerce Committee Democrat  Representative Frank Pallone  called the Republican plan  a prescription for disaster  and said not a single hearing had been held to develop the bill  Republicans insisted on committee action even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had not yet done its customary assessment of the cost of the measure and how many people it would cover   White House spokesman Sean Spicer said   If you re looking at the CBO for accuracy  you re looking in the wrong place   Ways and Means Democrats raised questions over the bill s proposed tax break for insurance company executives  with Representative Lloyd Doggett calling it a   400 million windfall  for insurance company executives

114359,335874,THC,Republican health plan clears first hurdles  fate uncertain,news,"By Susan Cornwell and Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Republican plan backed by President Donald Trump to overhaul the U S  healthcare system cleared its first hurdles in Congress on Thursday  but its chances for passage looked uncertain and top Republicans scrambled to bring disgruntled conservatives aboard  In the face of opposition by Democrats  healthcare providers and many conservatives  two House of Representatives committees approved the legislation that would undo much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  moving it closer to a vote before the full House  The Energy and Commerce Committee voted 31 23 along party lines  with Democrats unified against it  to back the plan after marathon proceedings lasting 27 straight hours  Hours earlier  the tax writing Ways and Means Committee similarly voted 23 16 before dawn to approve it after working 17 straight hours  House Speaker Paul Ryan sought to bolster support among conservatives in his own party  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said fellow Republicans must get in a  governing mode  while Trump denied the bill was in trouble   Despite what you hear in the press  healthcare is coming along great  We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture   the Republican president said on Twitter  The bill would replace Obamacare s income based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market  while ditching the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor  It would also end penalties for not having insurance  though insurers would be given permission to impose a 30 percent surcharge on customers who let their coverage lapse for more than two months and then seek to renew  Hospital stocks  which has fallen after the plan was unveiled on Monday  ended broadly higher on Thursday  with  Tenet Healthcare   NYSE THC  up 3 4 percent  Shares of health insurers were mixed  with most large insurers modestly higher and Medicaid focused insurers ending negative  including Molina Healthcare s 3 3 percent drop   While Republicans have been itching for seven years to dismantle Democratic former President Barack Obama s signature domestic policy achievement  the party has failed to coalesce behind the plan put forth by House Republican leaders  Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time in a decade  but passage of the legislation was not a foregone conclusion  Conservative lawmakers and lobbying groups have lambasted it as too similar to Obamacare  They have sharply criticized its proposed tax credits as an unacceptable new government entitlement program and have called for a quicker end to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion  The measure is the first major legislative test for Trump and his fellow Republicans amid questions about whether they can govern effectively after years spent as an opposition party under Obama  Ryan  with his shirt sleeves rolled up and using a video screen with facts and figures  held what he called a  townhall style  presentation for reporters on the proposal  But his intended audience appeared to be fellow Republicans  and he said his party must  actually make good on our word    The time is now   said Ryan  who long has been the target of criticism of some conservatives   This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare   Ryan added  McConnell had a similar message  saying   We need to get into a governing mode and start thinking about actually achieving something rather than just kind of sparring   Democrats denounced the bill as a gift to the rich that would force millions of people off of insurance rolls  Republicans said it was needed to roll back the government s  nanny state  role in the more than  3 trillion U S  healthcare system   Trumpcare is a loser for just about all of America  unless you re in the top 1 percent   Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said  The House Budget Committee next Wednesday is due to merge the provisions approved by the two committees into one bill to be voted on by the full House before it goes to the Senate  Republican leaders are eyeing April for congressional passage of the bill   ARBITRARY LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR  In a series of tweets early on Thursday  conservative Republican Senator Tom Cotton urged his House colleagues to pull back  saying their measure could not pass the Senate without major changes   What matters in long run is better  more affordable health care for Americans  NOT House leaders  arbitrary legislative calendar   Cotton wrote  But White House spokesman Sean Spicer expressed confidence in the legislation s prospects   We re not jamming this down people s throat   Spicer said   This bill will land on the president s desk  He will sign it  We will repeal Obamacare   The Brookings Institution think tank forecast that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  expected early next week to release its closely watched assessment of the bill s cost and coverage implications  would conclude that at least 15 million people would lose health insurance  Credit rating agency Standard   Poor s earlier estimated 6 10 million people could lose health insurance coverage  Before the Energy and Commerce Committee vote  conservatives at the request of the panel s chairman withdrew an amendment sponsored by Republican Joe Barton that would move up by two years  to next Jan  1  the end of the Medicaid expansion  Barton said he planned to try to offer the amendment on the House floor  Committee Chairman Greg Walden hailed the unanimity of Republicans on the committee in approving the bill  Obamacare enabled 20 million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage  About half came from the Medicaid expansion  The bill s proposed changes in Medicaid funding could hurt smaller  less diverse health insurers  Fitch Ratings said  and the unintended  unforeseen consequences of a bill this size are likely to create uncertainty for all health insurers

114363,335878,THC,Republicans weigh health bill changes as doubts mount,news,"By Susan Heavey and Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    The White House and congressional leaders said on Tuesday they were weighing changes to their plan to dismantle the Obamacare health law as Republicans  questions mounted following an estimate that it would cause 14 million Americans to lose insurance next year  Press Secretary Sean Spicer said White House officials and leaders in the Republican controlled House of Representatives were considering whether to tweak their bill  which faces growing doubts within party ranks   Obviously we re going to make some modifications   House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News  although he said the bill would remain largely intact   The nonpartisan U S  Congressional Budget Office estimated on Monday that by 2026  the plan would boost the number of people without health insurance by 24 million   Those findings prompted a few Republican defections and made it tougher for Republican President Donald Trump to sell his first major piece of legislation  Trump hopes to deliver on a longtime pledge by his political party to undo former Democratic President Barack Obama s signature domestic policy achievement  Trump spoke by phone on Tuesday with Ryan and with Joseph Swedish  chief executive of managed care company Anthem Inc  He also has hosted Republicans at the White House   Part of the reason we are engaging with these individuals is to hear their ideas   Spicer said   We are obviously in talks with House leadership about the contents   The debate comes as voter interest in the issue rises  Healthcare was a top priority for Americans  according to a Reuters Ipsos poll of 1 747 people in March  Sixteen percent picked healthcare as their No  1 issue  compared with 14 percent for the economy and 11 percent who chose terrorism   It was the first time healthcare topped the list since the poll started in 2012  The poll has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of 3 percentage points  Republicans  plan to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  would repeal a penalty against Americans who do not buy health insurance and slash spending on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled  It would also revamp tax subsidies that help people buy insurance if they do not get it from work  The amounts would be based on age  not income   Democrats say the Republican plan would hurt the elderly  the poor and working families but give tax cuts to the rich  Doctors  hospitals and advocates for patients and senior citizens also have panned it  After the CBO report  some House Republicans pulled support  Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey  who said the report  modified the dynamic   said the bill could not pass the Senate  Representative Ileana Ros Lehtinen  who is from south Florida  tweeted   As written the plan leaves too many from my district uninsured   Spicer said the CBO struggles to estimate insurance coverage  Before the 2010 law passed  the office projected more people would buy individual insurance plans through new online marketplaces than actually did  The White House  however  has promoted the CBO s estimate of the plan s effect on federal deficits  The report said it would cause deficits to fall by  337 billion between 2017 and 2026  CHANGES POSSIBLE Trump s administration must heal divisions in his party  Moderates  particularly in the Senate  worry about causing people to lose coverage  while conservatives do not think the bill goes far enough in undoing Obamacare  House leaders have resisted a conservative push to bring a quicker end to Obamacare s expansion of Medicaid  But they are considering changes to tax credits to help older  lower income Americans   The CBO said that group could see higher premiums because the Republican plan would let insurers charge older enrollees more than they can under Obamacare   Representative Kevin Brady  who heads a tax writing committee  said the House was exploring options  but gave no details  John Thune  the third ranking Senate Republican  has proposed modifying the plan s insurance tax credit to help lower income Americans  Republican senators had lunch on Capitol Hill with Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to discuss possible changes  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the bill could be amended in the Republican controlled Senate  SHARES FALL  Shares of hospitals and health insurers slipped  partly on worries the plan would mean fewer insured patients  Among insurer stocks  UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  closed down 0 7 percent  and  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  and  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  each dipped 0 5 percent    It looks like it s going to be the dismantling of the individual insurance market  which again means lower revenues   said Vishnu Lekraj  an equity analyst at Morningstar

114380,335895,THC,Mixed earnings for Tenet Healthcare  amid poor timing with provider fee,news,"Investing com    Shares in  Tenet Healthcare  Corporation  N THC  fell nearly 4  in after hours trading after one of the nation s largest hospital management companies reported mixed results with its fourth quarter results 
Tenet Healthcare  a Dallas based company  blamed the subpar results in part on the negative effects of timing differences in relation to its California Provider Fee program over the last two fiscal years  During the 2014 calendar year  as well as the fourth quarter of 2014  Tenet recorded  150 million in revenue related to the program  Of the total amount   112 million was earned over the first three quarters of 2014 since the program was not approved until the final three months of the year  In 2015  the company earned  166 million on a comparable hospital basis  including  42 million in the final quarter  Discounting the  112 million earned from out of period revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014  Tenet increased its same hospital net patient revenue per adjusted admission by 3 2  for the period 
By the same vein  Tenet saw its Adjusted EBITDA decrease  33 million or 5 1  for the quarter  When the provider fee was not accounted for  Tenet increased its Adjusted EBITDA by  91 million or 17 4  Tenet s net operating revenue in hospital operations increased 8  to  16 928 billion  up from  15 681 billion a year earlier 
 We delivered Adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of our Outlook for the fourth quarter and are on a path to deliver strong growth in Adjusted EBITDA and improved Adjusted Free Cash Flow in 2016   said Trevor Fetter  Tenet Healthcare s chairman and chief executive officer   Similar to our results in the third quarter  we experienced pressure on lower acuity inpatient hospital admissions and continued to drive increases in higher acuity admissions  
 Our Conifer Health Solutions and United Surgical Partners subsidiaries performed well  with Conifer meeting our expectations and USPI delivering stronger than expected results in the fourth quarter   Fetter added 
Moving forward  Tenet anticipates sales in the range of  18 8 billion and  19 2 billion for 2016 as a whole on adjusted earnings per diluted share of  1 18 a share to  2 25 a share  Analysts expect revenues of  19 billion

114381,335896,THC,Earnings Preview  Tenet Healthcare  THC  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Tenet Healthcare  THC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This hospital operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 24 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  82 9  
Revenues are expected to be  4 49 billion  down 9 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14 77  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tenet 
For Tenet  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tenet will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tenet would post earnings of  0 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 29  delivering a surprise of  163 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tenet doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-tenet-healthcare-thc-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200389342,200389342

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday repealing Obamacare is a  pretty high item on our agenda  for the new Congress  But a complete repeal of Obama s Affordable Care Act may not be immediately in the cards  as Republican lawmakers now hold 51 seats in the Senate at latest count  well short of the 60 seats required to overturn it  Instead  health policy experts said  Trump could try to dismantle key elements through a process called budget reconciliation  That would allow him to eliminate funding for the income based subsidies that make the new insurance plans affordable  or cut the money providing expanded Medicaid benefits in 31 states   Some of the policy experts on the Republican side would say tearing it up and starting over would be very disruptive   said Paul Howard  director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute  Parts of the law have been weakened through legal challenges  Several of the largest U S  health insurers have pulled out of the exchanges for individual coverage after losing money on a sicker than expected group of patients  Consumers not eligible for government subsidies have seen premiums rise sharply  including a projected average increase of 25 percent for 2017  Scrapping the law altogether without a clear plan for providing replacement coverage for so many people would be politically risky  experts said   Trump also would face a tight deadline were he to try to dismantle the insurance exchanges by 2018  many state based health insurance regulators require insurers to submit plans for the upcoming year by April or May   only a few months into a new administration  Trump also could seek changes to other provisions of the law  such as a tax on medical device makers  or the so called  Cadillac tax  that is due to hit rich employer based healthcare plans in 2020  However  some elements could not be eliminated by depriving the law of funds  For instance  the law prevents insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health or pricing insurance based on gender  Mandatory coverage of preventive benefits also would be unaffected   short of a complete repeal  It also is not clear if Trump would try to reverse the individual mandate  which requires people to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty  The goal of the requirement was to broaden the pool of policyholders to include more healthy Americans  Aetna  NYSE AET  Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on Thursday at a New York Times Dealbook conference that some elements of the law are so popular that they are likely to continue  even if there is something Trump calls  repeal   They include allowing young adults to stay on their parents  plans and people with health problems to buy insurance without paying more  Medicaid could continue to expand  he said  though with a different type of federal financing  SOWING CONFUSION OVER HEALTHCARE Trump s surprise victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton rattled healthcare investors on Wednesday  depressing shares in hospital operators and some insurers  Medicaid focused health insurer Molina Healthcare Inc  fell nearly 16 percent  and hospital chain  Tenet Healthcare  Corp  NYSE THC  dropped 25 percent  Large insurers  who have been losing money on the exchanges  gained  with Anthem Inc  up 1 5 percent  Enrollment opened on Nov  1 for 2017 coverage and once those plans are purchased  it would be legally difficult for Trump to cancel them before the one year contracts run out  said Molina Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Dr  Mario Molina   Any changes they make will have to be on a prospective basis to begin in 2018   Molina said  It s not clear what Trump s plan to replace Obamacare would look like  Options he raised on the campaign trail include replacing the Obamacare individual coverage with high deductible healthcare plans  and lumping the sickest people together into high risk pools that are insured separately   I think there is going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of anxious people   Molina said  Among the worries for some people covered under Obamacare is how long it will last  Before the law took effect  Marc Dobin  a 57 year old mediator and lawyer in Jupiter  Florida  said his insurer put a surcharge on his premium because he has heart stents  Under Obamacare  insurers are barred from charging more for pre existing conditions   Imagine the disaster if  part way through the year  they cancel it   Dobin said  For others  the cost of premiums bolstered their support for Trump  Crista Simmons  63  a

was charged for intentionally and systematically getting patients admitted to hospitals  without any requirement for the same and then charging the government for those unnecessary admissions Along with the debt burden  the company has also been plagued with dwindling patient admissions for several past quarters   Consequently  this has taken a toll on its revenues which has been declining from 2016 through the first nine months of 2018  High operating cost and constrained revenues weighed on EBIDTA which has been falling from 2015 through the first nine months of 2018 Additionally  doubts

The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates sluggish near term prospects  The Zacks Medical Hospital industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  213  which places it in the bottom 18  of more than 250 Zacks industries 
Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since October 2018  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down by approximately 1 5  
Despite the industry s gloomy near term view  we will present a few hospital stocks that one can hold on to  Before that  it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation 
Industry Beats on Stock Market Performance
The Zacks Medical Hospital industry has outperformed the broader Zacks sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year 
Over this period  the industry has gained 22  versus the broader sector s decline of 6 4  and the S P 500 s decline of 5 1  
One Year Price Performance

 
Industry s Current Valuation
On the basis of forward 12 month EV to EBITDA ratio  which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks  the industry trades at 7X versus the S P 500 s 10 4X and the sector s 9 5X 
Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 8 4X  as low as 6 5X and at the median of 7 2X  as the chart below shows 
EV EBITDA Ratio  F12M 

EV EBITDA Ratio  F12M 

 
Bottom Line
Focus on expanding footprint and product portfolio through acquisitions  along with cost saving initiatives  are expected to drive the industry s growth  The efforts on the part of hospital companies to expand its healthcare network that provide convenience and choice to its patients  should drive admissions  Investments in technology will increase the efficiency of operations thus leading to superior care at lower costs  which should benefit all sections of the industry 
However  rising labor costs from shortage of nurses and skilled workforce have weighed on the industry s labor expense and will continue to do so None of the stocks in the Zacks Medical Hospital space currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   So  here we present four stocks with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  that investors may want to hold on to for the time being You can see

Blog Midterm Elections Put These Health Insurers in FocusThe U S  midterm election  which saw the Democrats gain control of the House of Representatives  bought much cheer to the health insurance sector  as the elections saw the passage of ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act  ACA  The repeal of the ACA or more popularly called the Obamacare enacted in 2010 was largely aimed by the Trump administration However  government s many attempts to repeal the ACA  over the past two years  met no success  and now that Democrats have the control of the House  the repeal of the ACA should not to be in sight in the near term  It also means that reduction in Medicaid and Medicare spending  should be off the table Retention of ACA means bigger business for insurers as this legislation has expanded health insurance for millions of Americans  This also means that the insurance industry will be more stable  Medicaid Expansion Should Get a BoostWith change in control in the House  major alterations to the ACA like Medicaid Expansion would be difficult  This indirectly means that Medicaid expansion will likely remain intact Medicaid expansion under the ACA resulted in nearly 15 million people gaining coverage  At the same time  over the last decade  states have increasingly turned to insurers to manage their Medicaid programs  with the help of private insurance companies  Players like Centene  NYSE CNC  Corp  and Wellcare Health Plans that are primarily engaged in Medicaid business have seen their membership surge substantially since the Medicaid Expansion came into effect in 2014 Medicaid was one of the most debated issue going into the midterm elections Kaiser Health News reported that following the election  37 states including the District of Columbia have adopted the ACA s Medicaid expansion  It stated that many studies on the effects of ACA Medicaid expansion point to positive effects on coverage  access to care  service utilization  and state budgets and economies The midterm election also saw voters in three conservative states  Nebraska  Idaho and Utah approve Medicaid expansion  Medicaid expansion in these states will cover around 300 000 low income people  according to estimates Industry s PerformanceThe ACA has been a net gainer for health insurers  having led to an increase in enrollment  increase in business efficiency by mandated investments in technology  shift to payment for value from payment for fee for service and many other positives in the industry  These positive have overridden the headwinds from regulations bought in by the ACA The  has therefore been one of the best performing industries  having gained a whopping 235 33  compared with the Zacks S P 500 Composite index s growth

114459,335974,THC,U S  Supreme Court split over Obamacare challenge,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court appeared sharply divided on ideological lines on Wednesday as it tackled a second major challenge to President Barack Obama s healthcare law  with Justice Anthony Kennedy emerging as a likely swing vote in a ruling  The nine justices heard 85 minutes of arguments in the case brought by conservative opponents of the law who contend its tax credits aimed at helping people afford medical insurance should not be available in most states  A ruling favoring the challengers could cripple the law dubbed Obamacare  the president s signature domestic policy achievement  Kennedy  a conservative who often casts the deciding vote in close cases  raised concerns to lawyers on both sides about the possible negative impact on states if the government loses the case  suggesting he could back the Obama administration  But he did not commit to supporting either side  Chief Justice John Roberts  who supplied the key vote in a 5 4 ruling in 2012 upholding the law in the previous challenge  said little to signal how he might vote  The court s four liberals appeared supportive of the government  Conservatives Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito asked questions sympathetic to the challengers  Fellow conservative Clarence Thomas  following his usual practice  asked nothing  If the court rules against the Obama administration  up to 7 5 million people in at least 34 states would lose the tax subsidies that help low  and moderate income people buy private health insurance  according to consulting firm Avalere Health  The court challenge was financed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute  a libertarian Washington group   The legal question is whether a four word phrase in the expansive law saying subsidies are available to those buying insurance on exchanges  established by the state  has been correctly interpreted by the administration to allow subsidies to be available nationwide  Exchanges are online marketplaces that allow consumers to shop among competing insurance plans  Kennedy s concerns focused on the possibility that if the law allows subsidies only for states that set up their own insurance exchanges  it would raise a new  more serious question about whether the law is unconstitutionally coercive by essentially punishing states that fail to establish exchanges   There s a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument   Kennedy told the challengers  lawyer  Michael Carvin  Kennedy said throwing out subsidies would potentially unlawfully pressure states and cause an insurance  death spiral  because premiums would increase  But Kennedy indicated he had an open mind over the challengers  interpretation of the law   It may well be that you re correct as to these words  and there s nothing we can do   Kennedy said  Alito disputed Obama administration lawyer Donald Verrilli s assertions about the disruptive impact of a ruling allowing subsidies only in states maintaining their own exchanges  Alito said states could simply establish new exchanges   Going forward  there would be no harm   Alito said  Most of the 50 states have not created exchanges  Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have them  with another 34 run by the federal government and three operating as state federal hybrids  When Verrilli said people would lose tax credits immediately if the government loses  Alito suggested delaying the ruling s effective date to the end of the tax year  Scalia said Congress could potentially amend the law to avoid disruption if the government loses  Verrilli expressed skepticism the Republican led House of Representatives and Senate would do so   CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE  Asked about Alito s comments  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said there are  no contingency plans that could be implemented that would prevent the catastrophic damage  to the law from a ruling favoring the challengers   Earnest doubted a legislative remedy  saying Republicans who control Congress  struggle mightily to do even the simplest  most politically popular things  and have fought Obamacare  tooth and nail   One possible outcome is the court could find the law ambiguous and defer to the government s interpretation  In one of his few remarks  Roberts said that would allow a future president to reverse course  One Kennedy remark indicated he would not support resolving the case that way  On a chilly  damp  cloudy day  a couple hundred demonstrators mostly from pro Obamacare forces gathered outside the white marble columned courthouse  A couple dozen demonstrators from the conservative Tea Party movement rallied against the law  The Democratic backed Affordable Care Act  narrowly passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition  aimed to help millions of Americans without health insurance obtain coverage  Conservatives call Obamacare a government overreach   Hospitals have benefited financially from customers newly insured via exchanges  Their shares have been under pressure amid the risk Obamacare insurance would disappear if the subsidies are dismantled as the challengers demand  During Wednesday s arguments  Community Health Systems Inc shares rose 5 6 percent  HCA Holdings rose 7 7 percent and  Tenet Healthcare  Corp  NYSE THC  rose 6 percent as investors saw Kennedy s comments as an indication he would side with the government  analysts said

114460,335975,THC,Health Care stocks rise following Justice Kennedy s comments in ACA case,news,"Investing com    A plethora of stocks in the health care sector rose sharply on Wednesday after Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy questioned the constitutionality of an argument brought by plaintiffs who are attempting to strike down the Affordable Care Act 
The Supreme Court listened to oral arguments on Wednesday in King v  Burwell  a case that is challenging the tax credits in President Barack Obama s signature health care law  The key issue in the case focuses on whether the Federal Government can continue to subsidize insurance costs in more than 35 states that have not set up their own insurance exchanges  
Michael Carvin  an attorney for the plaintiffs  argued that a provision of the law suggests that subsidies are only available to people living in areas with insurance exchanges that had already been  established by the state  
If the plaintiffs are successful in winning the case  up to seven million people in those states combined could lose their insurance coverage unless the states set up their own insurance marketplaces 
 There is a serious constitutional problem here if we adopt your position   Kennedy told Carvin

114461,335976,THC,U S  House okays bipartisan bill to fix Medicare doctor payments,news,By Susan Cornwell and Caroline Humer WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  House of Representatives on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill to permanently repair the formula for reimbursing Medicare physicians  marking a rare bipartisan achievement and sending the issue next to the Senate  The measure drafted and driven forward by Republican House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi would fix a long standing problem with how Medicare pays doctors  It would also make adjustments to the health program for seniors  The House vote was 392 37  The Senate may not act until it returns from a two week recess that starts this weekend  Some senators in both parties had concerns about the bill  but it also had strong support  Democratic President Barack Obama praised the House passage and said he hoped the Senate would approve the measure too  because he wants to sign it   I called the Speaker  John Boehner  and the Democratic Leader  Nancy Pelosi  and I said  congratulations  this is how Congress is supposed to work  They came together  they compromised   Obama said during a trip to Birmingham  Alabama   This is great  Let s do more of this   The Boehner Pelosi measure would replace a 1990s formula that linked doctor pay to economic growth with a new one more focused on quality of care  It also would require means testing of Medicare beneficiaries so higher income people pay higher premiums  The legislation was designed to spare Medicare doctors a 21 percent pay cut effective April 1 under the existing payment formula  If the Senate does not act until mid April  doctors might still be able to avoid pay cuts because Medicare doctors  claims generally take at least 14 days to be paid  One of the government s largest social safety net programs  Medicare is health insurance that serves 54 million elderly and disabled people  Under the plan  a Medicare recipient with annual income of between  133 000 and  160 000 would see their Medicare premium share increase from 50 to 65 percent  and a recipient with annual income between  160 000 and  214 000 would pay 75 percent rather than 65 percent  But the conservative Heritage Foundation s Robert Moffit said this was  timid  reform affecting just 6 percent of the Medicare population   BOOST FOR HEALTHCARE COMPANIES Wall Street analysts  who have been skeptical about the bill  said it would help healthcare services companies whose revenues depend on government Medicare reimbursements     More broadly  the bill could be a positive sign for chances of bipartisan agreement on coping with health care industry changes that could come if the U S  Supreme Court in June rules against federal subsidies under Obamacare  said analyst Brian Tanquilut at investment bank Jefferies in a research note  He added that this could help the stock prices of hospital companies  such as Community Health Systems  HCA Holdings Inc and  Tenet Healthcare   NYSE THC   The proposal would add  141 billion to the U S  deficit over 10 years  the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday  Its overall cost would be about  214 billion  but about  73 billion would be offset through savings in the bill  CBO said  Despite the addition to the deficit  Boehner said it was the first real reform to U S   entitlement  programs in nearly 20 years and marked a start to solving the U S   spending problem    This is what we can accomplish when we are focused on common ground   Boehner said on the House floor  Pelosi said she hoped the bipartisan effort  will be a model of things to come   CHILDREN S HEALTH PROGRAM A KEY The legislation includes a two year extension of the Children s Health Insurance Program  CHIP  for low income children and a two year extension of funding for community health centers  Both were high priorities for Democrats  However  some Senate Democrats have expressed concern about anti abortion language in the bill and their desire for four years  not two  of CHIP funding  And conservative Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said Thursday he was concerned because the bill was not totally paid for  Congressional gridlock in recent years has decreased the chances of any bill s becoming law  Most of those voting against the bill in the House were conservative Republicans opposed to the deficit impact   You obviously have got to be concerned about the cost when you have a debt situation the way we do   said Representative Jim Jordan ,2015-03-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-house-approves-bipartisan-fix-to-medicare-doctors-pay-334352,334352

114463,335978,THC,Economists predict shockwaves if Obamacare subsidies are nixed,news,"By Sharon Begley and Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    As the U S  Supreme Court prepares to rule on whether people in 34 states can continue to receive Obamacare health insurance subsidies  economists are projecting billions of dollars in lost healthcare spending for hospitals  drugstores and drugmakers if the justices say the payments are illegal  The immediate consequences of such a ruling would fall on the 6 4 million people who receive the subsidies and live in states that did not establish their own insurance exchanges under President Barack Obama s healthcare law  instead relying on the federal HealthCare gov website   The case  known as King v Burwell  would not affect subsidies in the District of Columbia or in the 13 states that run their own exchanges  The decision is expected sometime this month   Health economists calculate the economic impact of a ruling against the subsidies in different ways  but one thing many agree on is that about two thirds of people who receive subsidies through HealthCare gov would drop their insurance altogether rather than foot the entire bill  Businesses that have benefited from spending by the newly insured would take a hit  though estimates of the lost revenues vary significantly based on which assumptions are built into the calculation  For instance  a Kaiser Family Foundation economist put the 2015 figure at about  15 billion  based on the proportion of insurance premiums that are earmarked solely for medical costs under the healthcare law    There will absolutely be these second order effects   said Larry Levitt  a senior vice president and healthcare researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation   A reasonable assumption is that  spending on  healthcare by people who lose their existing subsidies will drop by at least half    That would represent about  7 5 billion in spending on hospitalizations  doctor visits and prescriptions  depending on the baseline estimate   Another rough estimate based on 2014 medical claims data and 2015 government enrollment data  suggests the federal marketplace states will see about  22 billion in healthcare spending this year among Obamacare plan holders assuming subsidies remain in place  according to Katherine Hempstead  a director at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation  The majority of Obamacare members receive subsidies   Health policy experts who are critical of the law have taken a different tack  focusing more on the potential financial returns to individual citizens if the Supreme Court ruling exempts them from penalties for not having insurance    Conservative economist Douglas Holtz Eakin and Brittany La Couture of the American Action Forum wrote recently that such a ruling could give a boost to small businesses by removing requirements on employers to provide health coverage  Joseph Antos of the right leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute says the estimates of healthcare spending effects are imprecise at best  He expects that a ruling invalidating the subsidies would be followed by a  fix  in which Congress or states somehow restore subsidies  at least temporarily   In that case  he said  any drop in healthcare spending would be temporary and only  a very minor downward bump    They are going to extend the subsidies in some manner   Antos said   I don t know how they are going to do it  but they are going to find some way    The Affordable Care Act is one of the most politically divisive U S  laws  opposed by many Republicans  Party lawmakers have fought in particular against its requirement that all Americans have health insurance or pay an annual penalty  and say they have plans to replace the law if the subsidies are ruled out       HOSPITALS Without a legislative fix  however  policy experts and Wall Street analysts expect hospitals will take the biggest hit  as they bear the brunt of costs for patients who must be treated but can t pay their own medical bills  Hospital associations said an increase in such costs could  devastate  some of their members  according to a brief filed with the Supreme Court      When Obamacare was conceived  hospitals were so confident that newly insured patients would increase their revenues that they agreed to  269 billion in cuts to the government s Medicaid and Medicare health plan reimbursement over 10 years   It was a quid pro quo  with hospitals agreeing to these reductions in return for coverage of more people   said Kevin Brennan  executive vice president for finance at Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania  which relies on HealthCare gov   Geisinger offers an insurance plan through the Obamacare exchange and estimates that 80 percent of the 22 000 people who hold those polices receive subsidies   Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that plans to set up its own exchange if the Supreme Court rules against the subsidies  and has said it could be ready for 2016  Data from publicly traded hospital operators show their costs for treating uninsured patients have dropped since Obamacare took full effect in 2014   In the first half of that year  admissions of  self pay  patients  who are almost always uninsured and unable to pay the full bill  fell 14 7 percent at Community Health Systems  6 6 percent at HCA  Holdings  6 5 percent at  Tenet Healthcare   NYSE THC  Inc  and 9 3 percent at Universal Health Services  according to an analysis by consultants at PwC      Drug companies like Pfizer and Merck  NYSE MRK    Co and medical device makers such as  Medtronic   NYSE MDT  agreed to new taxes in exchange for the expected increase in paying Obamacare customers  The bet has paid off  Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co estimates that each Obamacare patient now accounts for an average of  79 per month in prescription drug spending  That works out to roughly  6 1 billion a year for the 6 4 million people whose subsidies would be eliminated  Not all of the  6 1 billion would dry up  since drug spending by the uninsured is not zero  said Rand Corporation economist Christine Eibner  who has studied healthcare utilization by Obamacare patients   On average  people will not fill as many prescriptions  if losing their subsidies causes them to drop their insurance  she said    
Insurers will see a more limited hit to revenue if the subsidies are thrown out  largely because Obamacare customers are only a small percentage of any single health insurer s total business  At the nation s largest insurer  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   for instance  about 1 percent of its 46 million members are receiving subsidies that are at risk ",2015-06-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/economists-predict-shockwaves-if-obamacare-subsidies-are-nixed-347003,347003

This Week  The Most Costly Trading Mistakes To Avoid

 Investing is the only business I know that when things go on sale  people run out of the store  

   Morgan Creek Capital Management 
Investors and traders alike  do a lot of silly things  and doing the wrong thing at the wrong time is certainly one of them  But before we get into the specific do s and don ts of  trading mistakes   here are some humorous do s from the always insightful   

Allowing yourself to get pulled in too many different directions  as described in Ben s  more than 28 hour per day  tweet  can certainly be a costly trading mistake and a sure fire recipe for failure  as we described in a previous issue of the Stock Exchange  It s important to have a disciplined trading strategy that works for you  We describe ours later in this report 
Returning to Mark Yusko s early quote about what to do when prices go on sale  here is a very insightful piece from Vivian Ning at S P Global Market Intelligence about   
One of the things Vivian explains  in a very insightful and data driven fashion  is that  dip buying  is not only a strategy that has worked  but it can be improved upon by combining it with short term technical indicators such as a form of price momentum  Specifically  she examined the 4 week to 52 week Price Oscillator  which is defined as the ratio of the 4 week exponential moving average of weekly closing price to the 52 week exponential moving average   and found a higher value of this ratio indicates a more attractive buying opportunity  And as we ll cover more later in this report  this is not dissimilar to the trading strategy used by our Road Runner trading model 
Finally  in the conclusion of this report  we share a list of some of  The Most Common Mistakes Of Amateurs  from legendary trader  included in this week s issue of The Kirk Report 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models  Our trading models have shown excellent performance in recent weeks as you can see below 

We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And for these reasons  I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination

Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by    Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas  
Road Runner  I purchased Extra Space Storage  NYSE EXR  on 5 17  What do you know about this stock 
Blue Harbinger  I know EXR is a self storage REIT  it offers an attractive dividend yield of 3 4   and it s one of those rare REITs that is actually performing well  it s up 11  this year  while the real estate sector  NYSE XLRE  is down 5 2   

Road Runner  That s correct  And as was alluded to earlier in this report  I like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  My strategy combines dip buying elements with momentum qualities  My strategy is not entirely dissimilar to what Vivian Ning described earlier in this report  Here is a chart to help you visualize the  buying a dip within a momentum channel  strategy 

BH  Interesting trade  Road Runner  How long will you hold 
Road Runner  My typical holding period is 4 weeks 
BH  Well as we saw in the earlier performance chart  your strategy has been working well in recent weeks  I know you are a shorter term technicals based trader  but here is a look at the FastGraph  below  in case you decided to consider fundamentals  I ll check back with you on EXR in 3 weeks  you bought it a week ago  now  to see how you did 

BH  Anyway  how about you  Felix any trades this week 
Felix  This week I sold my Vipshop  NYSE VIPS  shares  If you recall  I purchased these in February  and the trade didn t work out as I had hoped I sold at a lower price than I purchased 

BH  Sorry for your loss  Are you sad 
Felix  No  I am not sad  I am a trading model  not a human  And even though I am not a human  I am still smart enough to know that 

 placing far too much importance on any one trade instead of the last 30 in aggregate  

 is a terrible trading mistake  it s also one of the costly trading mistakes to avoid  per Charles Kirk  as described in the conclusion of this article   And if you look at my six and 12 month performance track record  in the table earlier in this report   I am doing very well for myself  thank you very much 
BH  Got it  Thanks Felix  Did you consider the fundamentals on Vipshop  Here is a look at the FastGraph 

Felix  Thanks for that information  I know it is extremely valuable to many  but I am a technical trader  More specifically  I am a momentum trader  and I typically hold for about 66 weeks  much longer than our other trading models   But I also consider macro factors and use dynamic stop orders to control risks  No one wins all of their trades  And  always trying to hit home runs in very high risk trades  is another amateur mistake as described in the conclusion of this report 
BH  Alrightly then  Thanks for those tips  Felix  Anything else 
Felix  Yes  I ran the entire S P 400 Midcap Index through my model this week  and I ve included the top 20 rankings below 

BH  I do appreciate those rankings  Felix so thanks  And I see you like Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC  and ABIOMED  Inc  NASDAQ ABMD   Those are a couple of healthcare stocks that have been exhibiting some strong price momentum  Anyway  how about you  Oscar Do you have anything to share this week 
Oscar  This week I ran the High Liquidity ETFs with price volume multiple of over  100 million per day  The top 20 are shown in the following ranking 

BH  Interesting  Remind us  Oscar what is your trading style 
Oscar  I take positions in ETFs based on momentum  And I usually hold for about 6 weeks before rotating into another sector  As you can see based on my top rankings  I like energy  oil in particular  right now  United States Oil  NYSE USO    NYSE XOP  
Conclusion 
Trading isn t easy  and many people shouldn t even try it  at least not with real money right off the bat   Some of the most costly trading mistakes include  running out of the store when things go on sale   allowing yourself to get pulled in too many different directions  not having a disciplined approach  and allowing your emotions to get the best of you  For added perspective  here are twenty five specific mistakes that amateurs commonly make  per legendary trader  Charles Kirk of The Kirk Report 
The Most Common Mistakes Of Amateurs

selling out because of fear
putting money to work out of FOMO
having ONLY a very short term focus
always trying to hit home runs in very high risk trades
trying to trade the news and especially your political bias
trading against the overall trend and the price action often
attempting to prove how smart you are in the markets by making challenging contrarian type trades without any price action support
placing far too much importance on any one trade instead of the last 30 in aggregate
risking capital that you cannot afford to lose or by using extensive amounts of leverage
fail to employ multiple trading and investing strategies as a path toward greater diversification
not consistently planning out your trades in advance in writing down justifications in addition to exits and reentries
overtrading in challenging  choppy  trading range markets instead of reducing position sizing and increasing selectivity
failing to properly track  review  evaluate  and learn from your past trades
refusing to take a loss because it hurts your ego and because you have a tough time admitting your mistakes
focusing far too much on the precise entry of a new position rather than proper risk management after a trade is made
failing to track and to take overall expenses into account including taxes when evaluating strategies
attempting to make another person s strategy their own
use quant and sentiment data to justify bias and current positioning instead of to directly challenge positioning
succumbing to the temptation to make it more complex
searching for news based narratives to justify your bias
not having a comprehensive portfolio strategy and trading positions randomly without any big picture plan
constantly changing and tweaking successful strategies in continued search for  perfect system 
lack of humility during the good times and the lack of courage during the bad times
refusing to utilize passive  low cost long term strategies as a path to long term financial success
allowing past  hurtful mistakes to negatively influence the your future perspective and strategy by making your self worth entirely dependent upon your current performance

Per Kirk 

 Understanding what you are doing wrong  is far more challenging that you think  which is why doing well requires so much intensive self evaluation and study

114490,336005,THC,Supreme Court to hear Obamacare subsidies case,news,"By Lawrence Hurley  WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear a legal challenge to a key part of the Obamacare health law which  if successful  would deprive millions of Americans of tax credit subsidies to help them afford health insurance coverage   In a one sentence order  the court said it would take up a case brought by conservative challengers of the law  the most sweeping overhaul of U S  healthcare in decades and President Barack Obama s signature domestic policy accomplishment   The Supreme Court will issue a ruling by the end of June in the case  in which the plaintiffs have appealed a July ruling by the 4th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the subsidies   At issue is whether the subsidies   a vital component of Obama s 2010 Affordable Care Act  known widely as Obamacare   should be available in all 50 states  or only in some states   Obamacare set up health insurance exchanges and a system of subsidies to help people afford insurance premiums  The plaintiffs say the language of the law restricts subsidy availability to states that run their own insurance exchanges   The legal question rests on a phrase in the law that authorizes subsidies for coverage purchased via an  exchange established by the state   The battle is over whether that phrase means subsidies are not available through the federally run exchange   If the court found the plaintiff s interpretation to be correct  the subsidies would not be available in 36 states that lack their own health insurance exchanges  In those states  the federal government runs the exchanges   The Obama administration remains confident that Congress wanted the subsidies to be available nationwide  said White House spokesman Josh Earnest in a statement    This lawsuit reflects just another partisan attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act and to strip millions of American families of tax credits that Congress intended for them to have   he said shortly after the Supreme Court took the case   The share prices of major hospital chains HCA Holdings Inc  N HCA   Community Health Systems Inc  N CYH  and Tenet Healthcare Corp  N THC  closed down more than 4 percent  while shares of health insurers UnitedHealth Group  N UNH   Aetna Inc  N AET  and WellPoint Inc  N WLP  dropped nearly 3 percent   Five million people could be affected  analysts have estimated  if the administration loses the legal fight and subsidies disappear from the federal marketplaces  In 2014  8 million consumers signed up for healthcare via the exchanges   LIBERTARIAN GROUP BACKS CASE  The plaintiffs in the legal challenge are business owners and individuals who object to the law  The court s decision to hear the case was welcomed by Sam Kazman  general counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute  a libertarian think tank that is funding the litigation    The need for a quick and final resolution of this question is undeniable   Kazman said in a statement   David Cutler  a professor of applied economics at Harvard University  said on Friday that if the court throws out the subsidies   the premiums would skyrocket and the thing would just die   He was speaking at an event at The Forum at Harvard School of Public Health in collaboration with Reuters   The case will give the Supreme Court a second shot at reviewing Obamacare  In June 2012  the nine justices upheld by a 5 4 vote the constitutionality of Obamacare s core feature that requires people to get health insurance   The court also ruled that the states are not required to sign on to the expansion of the Medicaid assistance program for people on low incomes that the law envisioned as mandatory   The high court s decision to hear the subsidies availability case is somewhat surprising since there is no split among federal appeals courts on the issue   In July  a three judge panel of the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the subsidies  but the court later threw out that ruling and decided to rehear the case  Oral arguments in that case are scheduled for Dec  17   
The case before the Supreme Court  expected to be argued in early March  is King v  Burwell  U S  Supreme Court  No  14 114     Reporting by Lawrence Hurley  Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New  David Morgan in Boston and Caroline Humer in New York   Editing by Chizu Nomiyama  Kevin Drawbaugh  Andre Grenon  Alden Bentley and Ken Wills ",2014-11-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-obamacare-subsidies-case-315930,315930

114532,336047,THC,Health Care Stocks Stumble On Trump s Executive Order,opinion,"President Trump has come up with an executive order to dismantle the health care reform act following the failure of the Graham Cassidy bill  which was a last ditch effort in achieving the objective What Does the Executive Order Say One of the most disturbing proposals is putting an end to cost sharing reduction  CSR  payments that help low income Americans pay for health insurance  Health insurers and hospitals have long pleaded the President to maintain the subsidies so that health insurers can function on the exchanges  Without these subsidies it would be uneconomical for insurers to sell policies on exchanges Other than CSR  the plan also proposes loosening standards with respect to pre existing conditions Insurers UnsureCutting of cost sharing subsidies that were directly paid to health insurers has prompted players to take another look at their participation on public exchanges  Already a number of players like UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH    Aetna Inc    NYSE AET    Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   have exited these exchanges after suffering huge losses Meanwhile  shares of some of the players having substantial presence on public exchanges such as Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   lost 3 3  and Molina Healthcare Inc    NYSE MOH   was down 3 4  in the trading session following the announcement Hospitals Too Sick to Suffer More Trump s executive order has sent jitters across the hospital sector that has been weighed down by a weak business environment  Players overall are suffering from weak business volumes in the form of low patient admissions and fewer patient visits  Also  an increase in uncompensated care and charity care have eaten into their bottom line The same is evident from comments by one of the leading industry players  HCA Healthcare Inc  which during second quarter earnings  said that its uncompensated care including bad debt and charity care are rising faster this year than in the last  It is seeing roughly 4  to 5  growth in uninsured admissions   which is a little higher than the last half of 2016 and first quarter  Another large for profit hospital operator  Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC  said uncompensated care costs that dropped from 2015 to 2016 are now on the rise  In its hospitals  volumes have been softer than anticipated and an increase in uninsured revenues has resulted in upward pressure on uncompensated care expense Players are all the more jittery since axing of cost sharing reductions would directly lead to a rise in uninsured patients  translating into unpaid hospital bills Industry s PerformanceDespite the uncertainty  the industry has performed strongly as evident by a rise of 80 6  in a year s time compared with a gain of 20 8  for the S P 500 What Lies NextTurbulences like this have been common in the health care space for the past one year or so from the time efforts are being made to pull back Obamacare  The ultimate implementation of the executive order will however bring real changes in the industry

Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
In this episode  Tracey is joined by Zacks Senior Strategist Kevin Cook who is also the editor of Zacks   It holds about 30 healthcare and medical stocks for the long term 
Tracey has been getting questions from listeners wondering if there is any value in healthcare stocks right now  Are any of them cheap 
Biotechs on Fire
The biotechs are hot again  The S P Biotech ETF  XBI  has soared 47  this year while the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF  IBB  has gained 27  
But can some value still be found in the biotechs  And what about all the other healthcare industries 
Zacks  Medical Sector has over 800 companies  including drug companies  hospitals  managed care insurers  medical device companies  dental companies and others  They re not all created equal 
Tracey and Kevin ran a screen to quickly find basic value stocks within the sector  They looked only in the Medical sector and chose a current year forward P E less than 20 and a next year forward P E of under 15 
They didn t screen for Zacks Rank 
It returned 61 stocks 
Tracey and Kevin discuss about a dozen of them on this week s podcast including these 5 big names 
5 Cheap Healthcare Stocks
1       Gilead    NASDAQ GILD    has been cheap for years  It trades with a forward P E of just 9 1  But earnings are on the decline  The company made  11 57 last year and expects to just make  8 74 this year  It recently bought KITE but will that be enough to give earnings a boost  Or is it a value trap 
2       Biogen    NASDAQ BIIB    is another big biotech that is cheap  It trades with a forward P E of just 15 6  Two analysts just raised their price targets to over  400 on the stock  Unlike Gilead  it s expected to see earnings growth this year and next year 
3       Teva    NYSE TEVA    is the cheapest in the group  It trades with a forward P E of 3 4 but investors have to be concerned about those falling earnings estimates  It made  5 14 in 2016 and is expected to make just  3 82 in 2018  Is it a value trap 
4       AbbVie    NYSE ABBV    has the rare combination of an attractive P E at just 16 4 and rising earnings estimates  Earnings are expected to jump 14  in 2017 and another 19  in 2018  Should ABBV be on your short list 
5       Aetna    NYSE AET    is in the managed care group  which  is one of the most difficult areas to be in right now due to Obamacare uncertainty  But Aetna has been reducing its exposure to the exchanges and it trades with a forward P E of just 15 9 
There are other industries that are also in the cone of uncertainty due to the unknowns surrounding Obamacare  including the hospitals 
Tracey and Kevin discuss the hospital group  especially Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC  
Additionally  Valeant  VRX  appears to be cheap  but Tracey fears it s a value trap 
And what about medical device companies  They ve been hot this year but are they just too expensive to make the list

114540,336055,THC,Top Stock Reports For PepsiCo  Walgreens Boots   EOG Resources ,opinion,"Wednesday  January 9  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including PepsiCo  PEP   Walgreens Boots  WBA  and EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
PepsiCo s shares have gained  15 7  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Soft Beverages industry  which has increased  17 4  over the same period  However  PepsiCo has been doing well on the back of significant innovation  continued momentum in Frito Lay business  revenue management strategies  improved productivity and cost saving initiatives  along with better market execution  
Moreover  an improving economy  better industry pricing dynamics and a consistency in positive innovation bode well  It rolled out several products recently which management believes will drive sales and profits in 2018  
That said  growing health awareness has been hurting the CSD category  resulting in a 4  volume decline in the first nine months of 2017 in North America  Again  rising volatility in global markets and increasing currency headwinds may dampen growth 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated Walgreens Boots have done better than the embattled Zacks Drug Stores industry over the last year  WBA is down  10 7  vs  decline of  12 3  for the peer group   Walgreens Boots reported an impressive first quarter of fiscal 2018  The increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International is a major positive  
Moreover  Walgreens Boots has been gaining on account of strategic tie ups  which brought more patients to its U S  pharmacies  The Zacks analyst likes the Rite Aid stores acquisition deal for which the company got regulatory approval recently  Also  the company is expanding its global footprint with its decision to acquire a 40  stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China which should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots  worldwide retail pharmacy business  
On the flip side  declining sales at the Retail Pharmacy was a disappointment  The company faces tough competition along with currency fluctuations  Also  slowdown in generic introduction continues to weigh on margins 
 You can   
Buy rated EOG Resources  shares have gained around  9  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Oil   Gas E P Industry  which has declines  11 1  over the same period  EOG Resources holds premium acreages in the Permian  Bakken and Eagle Ford oil shale plays in the United States  
The Zacks analyst likes the firm s plan to complete 505 wells in the resources in 2017  significantly higher than 443 recorded in 2016  Notably  during 2016  almost 50  of the wells drilled by the firm met the standard of premium wells  The company expected 80  and 90  of the wells to meet the standards in 2017 and 2018  respectively  
In the promising U S  shale plays  EOG Resources has identified 8 000 premium wells that can give access to almost 7 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves over a period of 10 years  The upstream energy player s pricing chart history is also impressive

a good year   Having suffered from falling revenues  weak volumes  high bad debts and overall industry weakness  the company s performance was weak The stock has lost 14  in a year s time  underperforming the  s decline of 0 7  The company s performance pales all the more compared to other hospital stocks like HCA Holdings  Inc   NYSE HCA   and Universal Health Services  Inc    NYSE UHS   that have gained 9 7  and 2 1   respectively  over the same periodWhat Affected 2017 The company incurred losses in the last two quarters owing to lower revenues and higher expenses  The last quarter  however  suffered from the adverse impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma Tenet Healthcare s revenues have been continuously declining over last two quarters due to reduced admissions  inpatient and outpatient surgeries  emergency department visits and total outpatient visits  At the end of the first nine months of 2017  revenues declined nearly 4  year over year The downtrend in revenues was due to the high deductible plans that result in more out of pocket expenses of the patients  Increase in uninsured rates due to the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act also caused a reduction in volume of patients  This apart  the company also suffered from lower payer rates and increased bad debt  Lower net revenues combined with increased operating expenses adversely impacted its margin Tenet Healthcare has been facing a continuous increase in its debt level over the past many years  The company uses a large portion of its cash flow to pay the interests on its debts  which in turn  lead to limited funds available for its operations  growth initiatives or capital expenditures  The cash flow started declining since 2016 and the company lowered its expectation

Healthcare projects revenues in the range of  18 9 billion to  19 1 billion for 2017  down 3  from the previously guided range of  19 1 billion to  19 4 billion  Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2017 are projected in the range of 59 cents to 74 cents  down 26  from the earlier projection of 69 99 cents Tenet Healthcare expects the recently enacted  Tax Cut and Jobs Act  law to affect its

5 Bargain Stocks with Enticing EV EBITDA Ratios to Own Now 

	Price to earnings  P E  is hands down the most popular metric used by investors to handpick undervalued stocks  The idea of chasing stocks with a low P E is ingrained in the minds of many value investors  But even this ubiquitously used valuation metric is not without its drawbacks 

EV EBITDA is a Better Approach  But Why 
	While P E enjoys great popularity in the value investing world  a less used and more complicated metric called EV EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also known as the enterprise multiple  has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  P E  on the other hand  considers only its equity portion 
	EV EBITDA  in essence  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents 
	EBITDA  the other element of the ratio  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings 
	Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is undervalued and vice versa 
	EV EBITDA also takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio ignores  For this reason  it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  EV EBITDA shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another key drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the contrary  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front 
	EV EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in evaluating the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt 
	However  EV EBITDA is also not without its downsides and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements 
	As such  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome  But you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks Screening Criteria
	Here are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median   A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median   A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median   This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000   The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5   This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

3 Hospital Stocks That Won t Make You Feel Better in Q1 

	The first quarter earnings season has kick started on an optimistic note  with expectations of year over year growth  While it is still very early in the reporting cycle  total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 7 6  on revenue growth of 6 3   This compares favorably with earnings growth of 7 4  and revenue growth of 4 7  in the fourth quarter of 2016 


	When it comes to Hospital companies  investors are a bit fuzzy as this corner is among the better performers in the past few quarters  Per our  Report  the aggregate dollar amount of earnings increase for the Medical sector is on the lower end of the16 Zacks sectors  with Medical earnings expected to shrink 0 6  year over year versus growth of 4 5  y y in the sequential quarter  Margins are also expected to fall 0 7  year over year 
	The doldrums over the future of Hospital stocks are due to the furor over the final shape of Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act  ACA   Last month  the lukewarm response to its replacement  the American Health Care Act  AHCA    has forced Republicans to propose amendments for setting aside funds for covering a portion of costs alongside insurers  However a decision on this matter is scheduled only at the end of the month Road Ahead for Hospital Stocks
	The foremost question that arises now is whether hospital stocks stand to gain or lose with regard to the AHCA conundrum  The medical device fraternity was happy with the original Trump action plan which had promised cancellation of major healthcare taxes including the two signature taxes of Obamacare  the unpopular Cadillac tax  40  excise tax on high cost healthcare plans  and the controversial 2 3  MedTech tax 
	Also  if the proposed amendment for AHCA is not implemented  around 6 10 million Americans are estimated to lose coverage under the new healthcare act  This would invariably result in shrinkage in the customer base for hospital companies as a significant chunk of the population would lose their healthcare coverage Hospital Stocks to Avoid This Earnings Season
	In such a mixed space we rely on our proprietary  and  to help us avoid Hospital stocks this earnings season  Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  along with an unfavorable Earnings ESP are best avoided 
	Using our Earnings ESP system can greatly increase your odds of sieving out these potential losers before they report  Excluding the three stocks mentioned below from your portfolio can actually increase returns  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc    NASDAQ          Headquartered in Franklin  TN  Acadia Healthcare Company provides behavioral health care services in the U S  and the United Kingdom  You can see

114625,336140,THC,Trump Wins Healthcare Vote  ETFs To Watch,opinion,After struggling for more than a month  President Donald Trump finally secured the necessary votes from House Republicans to pass the bill for repealing and replacing Obamacare with the revised American Health Care Act  AHCA   The bill was passed by a vote of 217 to 213  just one extra needed for passage  This represents Trump s first successful legislative move and a big victory for his administration   However  the fate of the bill is still uncertain  as it requires the Senate s approval before it goes to Trump for his signature Inside The New BillThe new bill would overhaul the U S  healthcare system and bring major changes to healthcare coverage for many Americans  This is especially true as the bill allows insurers to charge individuals  who are uninsured for more than two months  a 30  surcharge on their premiums  an incentive designed to encourage people to maintain insurance coverage  It would scrap the requirement of larger companies to provide affordable insurance to their workforces The revised bill calls for replacing income based tax credits with refundable age based tax credits for affordable insurance  It would offer tax credits of  2 000 per year for those in their 20s to  4 000 for those in their 60s with maximum tax credits of  14 000 a year for a family  Credits would be reduced for individuals making more than  75 000 a year and families making more than  150 000  read    Additionally  the new law allows older adults to be charged premiums that are five times higher the premiums charged to younger adults  instead of the 3 1 ratio established by Obamacare  It would also impose a premium penalty on people who do not maintain continuous health coverage The bill would cut federal funding for Medicaid  the insurance program for the poor  by  880 billion  or 25   over 10 years  Medicaid will be converted from an open ended entitlement to a per capita system  wherein states are given a set amount for the number of people in categories including disabled  elderly  childless adults and pregnancy   Further  the new system gives states the power to request waivers for insurers that allow them to charge individuals higher premiums with pre existing health conditions if they let coverage lapse  Critics claim that the state waiver process weakens coverage for those with pre existing conditions  While Obamacare absolutely bars any insurer from denying coverage based on a pre existing condition  the new law allows states to seek waivers that could allow insurance companies to set premiums based on one s medical background Last but not the least  the bill favors wealthy Americans with massive tax cuts and scraps most of Obamacare s taxes that are used to fund the law  including two taxes on high income earners  It also rolls back Obamacare s tax on health insurers  medical device manufacturers  drug manufacturers  and tanning bed salons Market ImpactThe passage led to a surge in many healthcare stocks  particularly hospitals and insurance  While the repeal of the Affordable Care Act  or Obamacare  threatened margins of hospitals and insurers given the expected decline in health insurance coverage  stocks gained on a lower Obamacare tax burden which when combined with Trump s corporate tax reform could result in handsome profits  read    Major names such as Humana   NYSE HUM    Tenet Healthcare   NYSE THC    UnitedHealth   NYSE UNH    HCA Holdings   NYSE HCA    and Aetna   NYSE AET   gained 2 2   1 8   0 9   0 8  and 0 8   respectively  at the close on the day In the ETF world  most of the healthcare funds are in the green with VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF   AX PPH   benefiting the most on the day with a 1 2  gain  First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund   LON FBT    First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF   SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals ETF   HN XPH   and Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF  are up nearly 0 9    see    Are The Gains Real Most of the gains in the healthcare stocks seem real  except hospitals  which are expected to be hit hard by Medicaid cuts  As such  SPDR S P Health Care Services  NYSE XHS  ETF   which tracks the performance of companies in healthcare services  healthcare facilities  managed healthcare and healthcare distributors  might be in trouble if the law is approved by Senate  Additionally  the bill is expected to cut billions of dollars in health care spending and result in millions of Americans going without health insurance  according to the Congressional Budget Office  read    However  the new legislation would be highly beneficial to health insurers as they will collect higher premiums  That said  iShares U S  Healthcare Providers ETF   which offers exposure to companies that provide health insurance  diagnostics and specialized treatment  would get a boost Medical devices stocks and iShares U S  Medical Devices ETF   MT IHI   would also likely benefit under Trump administration as all the taxes imposed under Obamacare will no longer be levied  Further  pharma and biotech ETFs would continue to gain from the healthcare overhaul Want key ETF info delivered

114626,336141,THC,HCA Healthcare Grows On Buyouts  Commercial Business Bothers,opinion,"HCA Healthcare Inc    NYSE HCA    one of the most diversified hospital companies in the U S  was still recently known as HCA Holdings  Its new name became effective earlier this month The company has made a number of acquisitions since its IPO in 2011 to surge in business 
The company s superior performance is reflective in its share price performance which has gained 7 7  over past one year  compared to a loss of 1 5   sustained by the Zacks categorized Medical Hospital industry The company has also been an outperformer in the industry  evident by negative returns of 36 6   20 5   10 2   sustained by its competitors like Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC    Community Health Systems Inc    NYSE CYH   and Universal Health Services Inc    NYSE UHS   respectively 

Since its IPO in Mar 2011 and through the second quarter of 2016  the company spent more than  4 billion on acquisitions and has purchased a number of hospitals  It invested  576 million   351 million   766 million and  481 million for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2016  2015  2014 and 2013  respectively 
Recently  HCA Healthcare announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire three Houston area hospitals from Tenet and two Texas hospitals from Community Health Systems  one in Tomball on the north side of Houston  and one in Jourdanton  These facilities will strategically complement these markets and enhance the company s ability to meet the medical needs and improve patient access to its provider networks in both communities  These transactions are expected to close sometime in the summer of 2017 
Also the company closed on a 231  acute care hospital  in Waycross  Georgia  which should complement its Jacksonville market  Also in April  the company announced the signing of a Letter of Intent to purchase Memorial Health in Savannah  Georgia  a not for profit acute care hospital with 604 beds 
Memorial Health is the only provider in the market for Level 3 PICU and NICU services  plus Level 1 trauma services  This should significantly strengthen its position along the Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville to Charleston  The acquisition is likely to close by year end 
These four transactions are expected to add seven hospitals with over 2 000 beds and approximately  1 5 billion in new annualized revenues to the company 
Nevertheless  the company s commercial business faces challenges with declining volumes of admissions recently  Management attributed the weakness in commercial volumes to two reasons  First  overall commercial demand in their markets has slowed down compared to the levels from 2014 till first quarter 2016  driven by lower exchange volumes  leap year effect  economic issues in a couple markets and less tourism traffic in two of its large markets    Texas and Florida 
Also  management indicated an increase in competitive pressures driven by more supply across various patient settings  payer dynamics in certain Texas markets and competitors regaining their network status in certain payer contracts   
The company witnessed a decline of commercial volumes in south Florida  Houston  West Florida  Orlando and Las Vegas  It has undertaken remedial measures by building up local networks and creating greater patient access both from outpatient facilities and digital media standpoints  Coupled with service line  care coordination and physician development initiatives  the company s overall efforts are required to compete effectively in the said segment 
HCA continues to believe that demand for their commercial business will increase 1 1 5  per year  We  however  remain cautious about its growth over next few quarters HCA Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

	Chicago  IL   May 26  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Humana Inc  NYSE HUM    NYSE           UnitedHealth Group Inc   NYSE           Tenet Healthcare Corp   NYSE           LifePoint Health  Inc   NASDAQ          and Community Health Systems  Inc   NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Insurance   Hospital Stocks in Focus on CBO Report on Trumpcare  

	The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  released its report on the direct spending and revenue impact of the revised American Health Care Act  AHCA  bill that got support from the House of Representatives earlier this month 
	According to the CBO report  enacting AHCA or Trumpcare  as it is often referred to  would cut federal deficits by  119 billion between 2017 and 2026 while about 23 million people would lose health coverage in 2026 compared to Obamacare 
	A detailed look at the report shows that while 14 million more people would be uninsured in 2018  this number is expected to reach 19 million in 2020 and 23 million in 2026  In 2026  about 51 million people under the age of 65 would be uninsured  compared to 28 million who would lack insurance that year under Obamacare 
	Earlier in Mar 2017  the CBO had said that enacting the AHCA would cut federal deficits by  151 billion over the coming decade but the number of uninsured people would go up by 24 million in 2026 relative to Obamacare 
	Another very important takeaway from the latest CBO report is that health care costs for people with pre existing or newly acquired medical conditions could shoot up significantly in some states under Trumpcare 
	We note that earlier this month  the House had faced intense criticism for voting on the bill before the CBO could issue a report on the revised bill  which was reintroduced with a few changes aimed at winning over some of the more conservative lawmakers 
	Some of the key points in the revised bill include age based tax credits  funding cuts to programs like Medicaid  allowing states to seek waivers from Obamacare regulations  removing several of Obamacare s requirements on employers and insurance companies  elimination of the individual mandate  defunding Planned Parenthood  removing the  Cadillac  tax  and repealing the medical device tax  The amendment also provides  8 billion incremental funding for those with pre existing conditions in States which chose to opt out with waivers 
	The next step is for the Senate to move forward in working to draft its own version of the health care legislation Stocks in Focus
	If Trumpcare does become law  insurers like Humana Inc   NYSE          and UnitedHealth Group Inc   NYSE          stand to benefit  Year to date  YTD   the Zacks categorized   HMO  industry has outperformed the S P 500 with the industry climbing 14  compared to the overall market gain of 7 7   UnitedHealth and Humana are both Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks    you can see    The HMO industry is among the top 30  of the Zacks ranked industries 

	Meanwhile  hospital stocks like Tenet Healthcare Corp   NYSE           LifePoint Health  Inc   NASDAQ          and Community Health Systems  Inc   NYSE          will all be under pressure if Obamacare gets replaced  Hospital stocks had benefited under Obamacare with more than 20 million people gaining coverage  However  Trumpcare is expected to result in an increase in uninsured people which does not bode well for this sector  The Hospitals industry is currently among the bottom 19  of the Zacks ranked industries 
	Trumpcare still has a long way to go before it becomes law  Several aspects of the bill have come under criticism including the possibility of millions of people losing coverage and weaker coverage for those with pre existing conditions  So expect volatility in this segment of the healthcare market in the near term 

Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside 
	Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana

114639,336154,THC,Senate Releases AHCA Draft Bill  Healthcare Stocks Surge ,opinion,"The Senate recently released the draft version of the healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  ACA  designed by former president Barack Obama  The Republicans long have been trying to undo Obamacare  Trump  on his taking his seat at White House  made it his top priority to devise a new and improved healthcare law   American Health Care Act  AHCA  After many adjustments to the AHCA provisions  the House bill went to Senate  which has now released its own modified version Health Insurers Take the Bill in Their Stride  Health insurers welcomed the Senate Bill that suggested a repeal of the Health Insurance Fee  HIF   Insurers were supposed to pay HIF annually based on net written premiums Insurers are also relieved as funding cuts to Medicaid will be made gradually  Per the Senate draft bill  all the 31 states that opted for Medicaid expansion will keep on receiving federal funding aid till 2023  albeit at a lower rate from 2021  The bill calls for curtailing federal support for Medicaid expansion in 2024  which then might cause states to end Medicaid expansion  But that is still far fetched and insurers can take it easy for now Moreover  Obamacare banned insurers from charging more than three times to older customers than their youngest ones  Under the draft bill  insurers have the liberty to charge older customers five times as much as younger ones Also  insurers struggling in the individual insurance market on public exchanges lauded the Senate bill s allotment of  15 billion each in 2018 and 2019 and  10 billion each in 2020 and 2021 to stabilize the market Insurers have also got some flexibility on a pre existing condition in Obamacare that denied coverage to people with pre existing diseases and higher prices on these policies  The Senate bill has kept this provision but has made it friendlier for insurers by limiting coverage and eliminating benefits requirements on such policies Essential health benefits requirement under Obamacare will also be put to end by 2020  The benefits included hospitalization  prescription drugs  maternity care and mental health treatment  which insurers were supposed to cover under ACA 
Despite significant regulatory uncertainty since the election of Trump last November  the Zacks categorized  industry has gained 34   outperforming the increase of nearly 14  for the S P 500  
All in all  the draft bill was well received by healthcare companies  as evident by share price gains for hospital companies like HCA Holdings Inc    NYSE HCA    Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC   and Community Health Systems Inc    NYSE CYH    The cheer also spread among health insurers  UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM    Humana Inc    NYSE HUM    Aetna Inc    NYSE AET    Cigna Corp    NYSE CI    Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   and Molina Healthcare Inc    NYSE MOH   that hit their respective 52 week highs Long Term EffectsThough the bill will have short term benefits  it can be precarious for the industry over the long term  Former CEO of Molina Healthcare commented that the Senate version of the bill is heartless  Though providing relief in the short term  its effects will be painful later on   Funding cuts to Medicaid would destroy the plan  which is most relied upon by low income Americans  The bill would also provide more wealth to the rich while taking away care from the poor  It is also feared to inflate the uninsured population and pinch pockets The Fate of Bill Still Remains CloggedThe likelihood of the bill to get converted into a law is still unknown  It received friction from four Republican senators  Also  Democrats don t seem to be providing any support to the bill and find it  even meaner   The fate of the bill will be decided next week  Till then  healthcare stocks may enjoy their ride The Best   Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full  up to the minute list of 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  free of charge  From 1988 through 2015 this list has averaged a stellar gain of  25  per year  Plus  you may download 220 Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sells   Even though this list holds many stocks that seem to be solid  it has historically performed 6X worse than the market ",2017-06-22,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/senate-releases-ahca-draft-bill,-healthcare-stocks-surge-200197164",200197164
114667,336182,THC,HCA Holdings Well Poised For Growth In Spite Of Headwinds,opinion,"On Dec 8  2016  we initiated coverage on HCA Holdings  Inc    NYSE HCA     one of the largest non governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the U S  At the end first nine months of 2016  the company had 169 hospitals and 117 freestanding outpatient surgery centers The company s scale and diversified business mix provides it a competitive advantage  The company s top line has been growing over the past several quarters due to robust volumes  an improved payor and service mix  and effective cost management Its numerous acquisitions over the past many years have helped it to gain a strong foothold in the industry The stock of HCA Holdings has gained recently  Year to date  the stock has returned 6 4  compared with negative returns of 8 3  by the Zacks categorized Medical Hospital industry  It has also outperformed other players in the same space  namely Life Point Health Inc    NASDAQ LPNT    Universal Health Services  Inc    NYSE UHS    Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC    and Community Health 
HCA Holdings s superior stock performance is reflective of its industry leadership  well diversified business profile  favorable earnings performance over the past many quarters and a number of accretive acquisitions  It also mirrors its balance sheet strength which is based on consistent cash flow generation to support its investments 
However  the company s bad debts are likely to drain its bottom line  Also  pricing growth in the medium term is likely to be affected as payor mix shifts from managed care to the lower priced Government business Also  President elect Donald Trump is almost certain to take steps to repeal former President Barrack Obama s Affordable Care Act  ACA   This has cast a pall on the hospital sector  The industry benefited under the ACA which led to a decline in uninsured rate and enabled hospitals to serve more people with insurance  leading to lower bad debts  Any change in the ACA now could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization  pushing up bad debts and ultimately cutting into the profits of the company HCA Holdings carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see

The euro was yesterday s worst performing currency and it s currently near 14 year lows  Many analysts expect the euro to reach dollar parity in 2017  However  thus far   1 034 appears to be providing strong support  and since hitting that level yesterday  the single currency has bounced back to  1 043

Oil climbed to an 18 month high yesterday as major oil producers  output in fulfillment of their OPEC deal requirments  Kuwait has cut output by 130 000 bpd  while Oman has decreased production by 45 000 bpd  Crude is currently trading at  52 87 while Brent is at  56 02 
Will OPEC s cuts be enough to keep prices rising  It looks like essentially it will be a  Goldilocks versus three bears  scenario 
Goldilocks in this scenario sees OPEC non OPEC nations remaining committed to their deal  reducing oil output by two million bpd in a bid to drive prices higher 
On the other hand  the three bears are

Boosted by higher oil prices  many energy companies did well yesterday  and the Energy Index gained 1 15   outperforming the S P 500 by 0 3

In other news  Trump took to Twitter again yesterday to let the world know his innermost thoughts on General Motors  NYSE GM  and Obamacare 
The President elect attacked GM for getting away with manufacturing cars in Mexico and avoiding border taxes once the completed automobiles return to the USA 

GM shares fell 1  in pre market trading  but the car maker quickly brushed aside the concerns after all  GM s chairman and chief executive  Mary Barra  is one of Trump s economic advisors and the stock was up 0 89  at the close 
Also of car making importance  Ford  NYSE F  announced yesterday that it was canceling plans for a new  1 6 billion factory in San Luis Potosi  Mexico  Instead  it will invest  700 million and add 700 new jobs to expand its plant in Flat Rock  Michigan  Shares of Ford Motor Company rose 3 79  on the day 
Mr  Trump also went after the Affordable Care Act 

More than 20 million Americans have gained medical coverage under the Affordable Care Act and health care facilities have benefited as result  since they now suffer fewer losses from uninsured patients 
Some of the big stocks that could be impacted if changes to Obamacare are made include Community Health Systems  NYSE CYH   which owns 188 hospitals  Hospital Corporation of America  NYSE HCA   which manages 166 hospitals  Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC   which owns 70 hospitals and hundreds of outpatient clinics  LifePoint Health  NASDAQ LPNT   which owns 56 hospitals  and Universal Health Services  NYSE UHS   which manages 28 hospitals and clinics 
However  yesterday at least  health care stocks and these companies in particular were completely unfazed by Trump s Twitter attack  As indicated in the chart above  the Health Care Index gained almost 1 4  on the day  Community Health Systems rose 3 94   HCA was up 0 59   Tenet Healthcare gained 3 77   LifePoint increased 2 2   and Universal Health finished 0 31  higher

114669,336184,THC,Ahead Of Thursday  Avoid These Healthcare Service Stocks,opinion,"With a relatively light economic calendar this week  the oresident s Obamacare replacement bill  the American Health Care Act if you want to use its formal name  Trumpcare if you don t  takes center stage as the House is tentatively scheduled to vote on it on Thursday 
The vote could literally go either way  which means healthcare stocks could be in for a volatile week in one direction or the other 
If the CBO s projection comes true that 24 million more Americans becoming uninsured by 2026 if the bill passes  healthcare companies will be deeply impacted  Insurers will no doubt be affected as fewer people covered would mean lower premium revenue  That s not even to mention the fact that premiums could be driven further down if price competition increases  a Trump selling point during the campaign  I think though that the hospitals and other healthcare facilities operators  in particular  could be most affected if the bill passes 
The SPDR S P Health Care Services ETF  NYSE XHS  portfolio is broken into four categories 

Healthcare service providers   These are companies that provide diagnostics  testing  administration and any other number of services  Top holdings in this group include Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  and Quest Diagnostics  NYSE DGX  
Healthcare facilities   These are the big hospital operators such as Tenet Healthcare  NYSE THC  and Community Health Systems  NYSE CYH  
Managed healthcare companies   These are primarily the big insurance providers such as Anthem  NYSE ANTM   Cigna  NYSE CI  and Humana  NYSE HUM  
Healthcare distributors   These companies are the distributors of drugs and other health care supplies to pharmacies  Holdings in this group include Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  and McKesson  NYSE MCK  

The argument as to why the hospitals could be most affected is fairly straightforward  If millions of individuals lose their healthcare coverage  they ll probably be less likely to seek out medical help  The ones that do show up may have less ability to pay their bills  The hit to hospital companies could be substantial if  as the CBO projects  the new bill disproportionately affects lower income people  Most hospital stocks were down several percent on the day that the bill was announced 
While hospital stocks could see the greatest impact from the bill s passage  the downward pressure would no doubt spill over into just about every area of the healthcare sector  The insurance providers might also be looking at a smaller customer base to work with and  if the sale of insurance across state lines becomes a reality  prices might be forced to come down amid greater competition  The service providers would be a downstream casualty of weaknesses in the hospital group  Fewer customers could mean lower demand for their services as well 
The upside  however  is it looks like the bill has only a modest chance of becoming law  This Thursday s vote in the House looks like a tossup although it appears that supporters of the bill may be gaining momentum  Passing the Senate  though  looks like a taller order with straw polls suggesting that the bill is several votes short of what it will need 
Recent losses in the Health Services ETF have been more modest but the broader Health Care Sector ETF  NYSE XLV  is down more than 2  just since the post Fed meeting highs  At a minimum  investors should be cautious adding healthcare stocks to their portfolios  but I d be avoiding the sector altogether right now 
The SPDR S P Health Care Services ETF  NYSE XHS  was trading at  57 60 per share on Monday afternoon  down  0 29   0 50    Year to date  XHS has gained 9 80   versus a 6 05  rise in the benchmark S P 500 index during the same period 
XHS currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A  Strong Buy   and is ranked  19 of 36 ETFs in the Health   Biotech ETFs category ",2017-03-20,ETF Daily News,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ahead-of-thursday,-avoid-these-healthcare-service-stocks-200179558",200179558

Not only were investors selling stocks  but they were getting rid of oil  the Mexican peso  and even the American dollar  gold  a traditional safe haven  however  and the Japanese yen soared  demonstrating  the hallmarks of what traders usually describe as a flight to safety   according to the 
But as the night wore on  the markets made their way back to more comfortable numbers  As of 11 30 AM EST  the S P 500 is up 0 68   the Dow is up 0 75   and the Nasdaq is up 0 70   Gold and silver are still in the green  increasing 0 98  and 2 05   respectively  but crude oil is down about 0 4  to  45 42 a barrel

Looking at currency  the biggest reaction to Trump s win was the Mexican peso  which saw 13  of its value disappear  the largest plunge in over 20 years   It s an unmitigated disaster   Jorge Casta eda  a former Mexican foreign minister  told the    There are very few tools to fix the relationship   Now  there are fears Mexico could slide into a recession

While half of the country is cheering the outcome of the 2016 presidential election  the other half is dealing with hard disappointment  Like Hillary Clinton said in her concession speech just a bit ago  we must come together and give Donald Trump  a chance to lead  this divisive  uncertain country  Even though we  as a nation  sharply disagree on many of this election s core issues  I think we can all agree on one thing  thank God it s over

Tenet Healthcare has also inked an agreement with UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   to renew and extend their national relationship for four years 
Tenet Healthcare remains focused on inorganic growth strategies  Numerous mergers  acquisitions  alliances and partnerships have helped the company to leverage on a strong revenues base and solid earnings 
However  the stock price movement has not been much favorable for the company year to date  The Tenet Healthcare stock has lost 49 3  and substantially underperformed the Zacks categorized Medical Hospitals industry  which has declined just 9 8  We  do not expect any respite in the near term owing to an uncertainty prevailing in the hospital industry as  President elect Donald Trump intends to repeal ObamaCare

114744,336259,THC,5 Stocks To Buy As Dollar Hits 7 Month High,opinion,"The dollar increased to its highest level in seven months versus a basket of currencies on Monday  Encouraging U S  data released last week raised expectations of a Fed rate hike in December  sparking off gains  Additionally  a substantial increase in U S  yields added further impetus to the greenback s ascent 
Companies which primarily conduct their business within the U S  are expected to gain from the dollar s surge  An improving economy will also give such stocks an added impetus  Adding these stocks to your portfolio makes good sense at this time 
Upbeat Economic Data Boosts Dollar
The dollar index  DXY  rose to its highest level since Mar 10 on Sunday before ending 0 1  higher at 98 095  Gains were primarily attributable to encouraging data about the U S  economy released recently  Meanwhile  retail sales rebounded in September  increasing by 0 6  last month after declining slightly in August  Higher auto sales and rising oil prices fueled the increase in retail sales 
The increase in retail sales was the highest recorded for the last three months  Additionally  the producer price index or PPI increased by 0 3  in September  This was also attributable to a rise in costs of all kinds of fuels  Also  core PPI  which excludes food energy and trade services  registered a year over year increase of 1 5  
Yield Surges  Rate Hike Chances Remain Strong
Another reason for the dollar s rise was a surge in 10 year and 30 year Treasury yields  Yields rose to their highest levels in four months following comments made by Fed Chair in Janet Yellen in Boston  Addressing prominent academics and policymakers the Fed Chair said that there may be some merit in  running a high pressure economy  on a temporary basis in order to fully recover from the effects of the last recession 
Such a statement led to speculation that the Fed may refrain from raising rates in the near future  which fueled the rise in yields  However  market watchers were of the opinion that Yellen s comments will not constrain the Fed from raising rates this year  Apart from retail sales and PPI  other domestic economic indicators have also been encouraging  The ISM manufacturing index for September increased while the ISM services gauge touched an 11 month high  Going by Fed fund futures  the probability of a rate hike by the Fed s December meeting has risen from the month ago level of 52  to 66  
Our Choices
Despite the Fed Chair s recent comments  bullish economic data has given the Fed the evidence it needs bring about a rate hike by December  The dollar is expected to rise further in this case  In such an event  companies which conduct all their business within the U S  are likely to be in an advantageous position compared to those with substantial overseas operations 
Domestically focused companies are likely to gain further with an uptick in GDP  This is why it may be a good idea to pick such stocks  At the same time  selecting winning stocks is a difficult task 
Adding select manufacturing stocks seems to be a good option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  
We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score

114745,336260,THC,Will Teladoc  TDOC  Show Any Improvement In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Telehealth provider  Teladoc Inc    NYSE TDOC   is scheduled to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 27 after the closing bell 
Last quarter  Teladoc beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 6   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Q3 Flash BackTeldoc   engaged in offering consumers virtual visits with physicians through voice or video   went public last July and got listed on NYSE  The company is therefore incurring heavy expenditure in the form of substantial investments made to acquire new clients  build its proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop its technology platform 
This time around  Teladoc is expected to post an operating loss on the back of huge expenses on higher advertising  sales  technology and development  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses We  however  expect the losses to reduce as the company has started to realize leverage from the scale of its operations While we expect to see a surge in revenues  led by new client wins and positive trends in utilization  the increase in expenses will outshine top line growth 
Also  the acquisition of HealthiestYou that closed in July is expected to result in higher visit and call volume 
Management expects third quarter revenues between  32 million and  33 million  EBITDA in the range of a loss of  12 million to  13 million  adjusted EBITDA loss between  9 million and  10 million  membership of approximately 16 5 million to 17 million  total visits completed between 205 000 and 215 000  and a net loss per share based on 45 7 million weighted average shares between 35 cents and 38 cents 
Earnings Whispers

Zacks Rank  Aetna carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP 
Factors to Drive Q3 Results
We expect Aetna s third earnings to see an upside from its Government business  which continues to be its key source of growth  Government premiums now represent nearly 50  of the company s total healthcare premiums and this business continues to outperform 
More specifically  within the government business  the company s Medicare business is expected to show a superior performance  driven by strong membership growth  The investments made by the company in its value based care models for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries should drive its financial performance 
We also expect to see a decline in operating expense ratio as a result of the company s strong commitment to drive productivity improvements and its disciplined focus on managing its operating costs Nevertheless earnings will see a bump from ACA small group and individual products continue to be challenged by a deterioration of the risk pool and an ineffective risk adjustment mechanism 
Membership declines in the company s Commercial Insured products will likely be due to attrition in its individual and small group membership We also expect to see favorable prior year reserve development across all of its core products which should lift its earnings However  the bottom line will be hurt by the absence of any share buyback during the third quarter due to the proposed Humana  NYSE HUM  acquisition AETNA INC NEW Price and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies from the health care sector that you may also consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter   VCA Inc    NASDAQ WOOF   will report third quarter earnings results on Oct 26  The company has an Earnings ESP of  1 24  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

114787,336302,THC,Supreme Court Justice Sentiment Boosts Hospital Stocks,opinion,"The Affordable Care Act  ACA  aka ObamaCare was issued a much needed reprieve by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy recently  His opinion is especially important  since he is regarded as a swing vote on many key rulings  At stake is the issue of whether state subsidies can be deemed invalid  Justice Kennedy is of the opinion that the Affordable Care Act which is law  will be unable to function if the challenge is upheld  While a final decision is not expected until June 2015  the expressed opinion has had an immediate impact on the healthcare sector  notably healthcare stocks 
These stocks rallied on Wednesday March 4th on the back of purported  Get Well  sentiment from the Supreme Court Justice  As it stands  an estimated 11 4 million people enrolled in Marketplaces during 2015  and 87  of those enrolees are receiving cost assistance  The number of people who paid their first month s premium is listed as 6 5 to 7 million people at most  By the end of 2014  15 million Americans were covered by health insurance  According to government stats  only 13 4  of U S  adults are now uninsured  HCA Holdings Incorporated led the Bull Run on Wednesday 4 March 2015 as the news broke  Such was the dramatic movement in the market  that hospital stocks outperformed all other sectors on the S P 500 Index The Affordable Care Act Greenlights Healthcare Sector Success Since the law was enacted in 2010  it is these very healthcare companies and U S  hospital companies that have benefited immeasurably  Stocks of top performing healthcare companies are at all time highs and the ruling has injected further momentum to the trend  Among the best performing healthcare stocks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  NYSE UNH   Anthem Inc  NYSE ANTM   HCA Holdings Inc  NYSE HCA   and Tenet Healthcare Corporation  NYSE THC   During 2015  the ACA is expected to dole out  22 billion in healthcare credits to assist people to purchase insurance 
Hospitals benefit financially by having more insured patients coming into their Emergency Rooms for treatment  In the unlikely event that the Supreme Court rules against the state subsidies  many people will forego their insurance plans and opt to visit the ER when they are taken ill  For healthcare companies  this is perceived as a worst case scenario  but as it stands they are likely to see increased growth and more insured patients the longer the ACA is in operation  Based on current projections  profits from hospitals are likely to enjoy earnings growth in the region of 7  in 2016  but this would be slashed in half should a ruling go against insurance subsidies  The Case of HCA Holdings Incorporated It is clear that HCA Holdings Incorporated has enjoyed strong growth since the passage of the Affordable Care Act  ACA  in 2010  The stock is currently trading at  75 15 per share  with a 52 week high of  77 08 and a 52 week low of  47 17 per share  The market capitalization of the company is  31 59 billion with a one year stock price target of  85 14  The price earnings  PE  ratio is 18 05  and the earnings per share  EPS  figure is listed as  4 16  HCA is the leading for profit U S  hospital  It generated almost 50  of its company profits from its Texas and Florida hospitals during 2014 
Besides for HCA Holdings Inc the other beneficiaries of the ACA include insurers like Aetna  NYSE AET  Incorporated and Cigna Corporation  NYSE CI   However there is a mood of caution from hedge fund managers as they have been cutting their clients  exposure to hospital stocks in 2014 and 2015  LifePoint Hospitals Incorporated has seen declines of 3 6  while Community Health stocks have seen declines of 4 9  from hedge funds  The fact of the matter is that hospitals stand to lose the most if the court rules against the subsidies  Patients will enjoy emergency room services regardless and the uninsured will still have access to emergency medical care at zero cost if they so desire ",2015-03-05,InterTrader .com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/supreme-court-justice-sentiment-boosts-hospital-stocks-243993,243993

114829,336344,THC,If You Own These Stocks  Get Out Now,opinion,With European economies slumping anew  investors have been figuring out ways to trim their exposure to that region  Business conditions are weak and could spiral even lower in coming quarters before an eventual rebound  That s why I wrote an article  which says that you should revaluate holding shares of U S  companies that derive more than one third of their revenue from Europe  as it may see sales fall below forecasts in coming quarters    Yet Europe isn t the only concern  In roughly eight months  another major source of revenue may experience real trouble  Of course  I m talking about the U S  government  which is on the cusp of a major pullback in spending so that it can get the federal budget into balance    Defense contractors will feel the pain  If legislators fail to hammer out more agreements on when and where to cut  then automatic cuts will begin  For example  the Department of Defense is scrambling to adapt to the possibility that a cumulative  492 billion in spending cuts will take place through 2021  Lawmakers may decide to instill less draconian cost cutting  but it s increasingly clear that defense contractors will probably be chasing a smaller pie of revenue    These defense contractors have been scrambling to line up foreign customers  but have only made moderate headway  Raytheon  NYSE  RTN   SAIC  NYSE  SAI   Northrup Grumman  NYSE  NOC   Lockheed Martin  NYSE  LMT  and L 3 Communications  NYSE  LLL  all derive more than 80  of their revenue from Uncle Sam    Meanwhile  investors have poured back into defense stocks  figuring they are inexpensive based on 2012 sales and profit forecasts  But with zero or even negative growth prospects  they aren t a bargain at any price    As of now  the Department of Defense looks set to shrink 3  to 4  in each of the next five years  This doesn t even include spending drops associated with the U S  troop withdrawal from Afghanistan  Whether these cuts are more focused on personnel or equipment remains to be seen  but the leading defense contractors are vulnerable because they are counting on expensive plane and ship programs that may get the budget ax  Health care spending will plunge  It s not just defense stocks that will feel the pain of reduced government spending  As of now  Uncle Sam will make an equivalent  492 billion in cuts in other parts of government as well  Again  lawmakers may manage to come to an agreement  averting these massive cuts  but investors should expect at least some degree of spending cuts    At least 40  of the currently planned  984 billion of cumulative spending cuts through 2021 will be borne by the health care industry  Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on the issue of President Obama s health care plan  spending cuts are coming    A decade of rising costs has been great for drug companies  insurers  hospital operators  software supplier and many other players in the industry  The coming decade should represent a reversal of fortune for them as pricey drugs  six figure surgical procedures  diagnostic testing services and extended patient stays within facilities are just some of the areas slated for cutting    Companies at risk  Insurer Humana  NYSE  HUM  derives roughly 75  of revenue from Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement  Dialysis services firm DaVita  NYSE  DVA  gets 66  of revenue from the government  while this figure stands between 40  and 50  for Tenet Healthcare  NYSE  THC  and United Healthcare  NYSE  UNH     And there s more     The for profit education sector is hugely vulnerable in light of the growing debate of whether these institutions are delivering a sufficiently robust education for the tuition they charge  Some lawmakers hope to see reduced government support for student loans  which would lead to drops in enrollment for these institutions  DeVry  NYSE  NYSE  DV   for example  has 80  of its revenue base tied to government sponsored student loans  This figure is more than 30  for the Washington Post  NYSE  WPO   which runs the Kaplan Education services division    Lastly  companies that sell products to government research labs are quite vulnerable to a spending drop as well  These include Life Technologies  Nasdaq  LIFE   Thermo Fisher  NYSE  TMO  and Sigma Aldrich  Nasdaq  SIAL   Risks to Consider  As an upside risk  government cuts won t be nearly as severe if lawmakers instead decide to largely focus on tax increases to close the budget gap  which looks awfully unlikely    Many of these companies lack visibility into the long term ramifications of a smaller government  and instead are relaying what business conditions look like right now  Investors would be wise to exit any government focused stocks before the topic becomes more widely discussed in investment circles and share prices plunge  by David Sterman,2012-05-06,StreetAuthority,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/if-you-own-these-stocks,-get-out-now-122321",122321
114830,336345,THC,Fly To Safety  And Not On American Airlines ,opinion,Given the market s performance over the last month  we feel that investors should consider reducing the more speculative portions of their portfolio Last week opened with a couple of days of modest profit taking after a market surge from four stimulus packages adopted by the U S   Europe  Japan  and finally China  A very strong Consumer Confidence and a positive S P Case Schiller report on home prices kept the selling reasonably in check and the market losses small  A better than expected drop in Initial Jobless Claims on Thursday recharged the market despite an expected decline in Q2 GDP  most assumed the number would be lower due to the stimulus action taken the week before  and an almost frightfully sharp decline in Durable Goods that was buffered by a strong uptick from auto sales  Thursday s gain recovered about half of the first three days  losses  Alas  weak numbers from Chicago PMI and Michigan Sentiment on Friday sent the market down about 0 50   resulting in a loss for the week in most style caps and sectors from 1  to 2   Only utilities were in the black  A classic  flight to safety  week  Health Care and Consumer Non Cyclicals were the two next best sectors  confirming the investor sentiment as a  flight to safety  What about this week  What will the market want  Likely more of the same  Monday  our markets opened sharply higher on the backs of a solid Consumer Sentiment reading this morning and a generally positive overnight market in Asia and Europe  notwithstanding weakness in the Nikkei and Ryder Cup euphoria in Europe  Unfortunately  the market went into reverse and ratcheted almost all the way back to even from a full 1  gain before a mini rally at the close brought the S P 500 back to a 0 25  gain and a full two percent below the recent four year high of 1474 5 on September 14  2012 Yesterday s market performance can be placed in the  flight to safety  category  continuing last week s performance  as Consumer Non Cyclicals  Energy  and Healthcare led the way  The Nasdaq closed in the red  albeit only by 0 1   Transportation stocks ended the day negative We all know investors hate uncertainty  But we are swamped with uncertainty as each of the four stimulus programs have their doubters  and how could they not since recessionary forces are not guaranteed to be resolved by any of these scenarios   Furthermore  our Presidential and Congressional elections  just over a month away  are not certain to generate a functional government  Then there is the turmoil in the Middle East and the South China Sea  We can only say  Fly to safety   and not on American Airlines  given their recent failure to properly bolt down passenger seats   If you have speculative portions of your portfolio and are concerned about this climate of uncertainty  we recommend that you consider shifting the more speculative positions into larger caps and flight to safety stocks  like Healthcare 4 Stock Ideas for this Market This week  I used the GARP preset search in  and filtered for mostly large cap stocks and higher growth  Since Healthcare is our highest ranked sector looking forward  not including Financials  see market stats   we have included three Healthcare stocks for you to consider  as well as one Energy stock  Tenet Healthcare Corp   THC    Healthcare Marathon Petroleum Corporation  MPC  Energy Humana Inc   HUM  Healthcare Celgene Corporation  CELG  Healthcare,2012-10-02,David Brown,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fly-to-safety-(and-not-on-american-airlines)-138310,138310
114831,336346,THC,How To Trade The U S  Election,opinion,With less than a week to go until the U S  Presidential election  traders have only a handful of sessions left to align their portfolios Obama s To Bonds As Romney s To StocksA Barclays survey of investors indicated that the consensus view is for a Romney victory to be positive for stocks  while an Obama victory would support bonds  Traders may view a Romney presidency as catalyst for a more favorable environment for business  and therefore the equity market  On the other hand  an Obama re election might mean a worse business environment  and thus funds would flow from equities into fixed income Is this view realistic  Stocks under Obama have done remarkably well  with the S P 500 more than doubling during Obama s first term  This remarkable performance has continued even in the face of 2012 s questionable business environment  confounding bearish investors who cite declining revenues and poor guidance as fundamental reasons for why the market ought to be trading sharply lower The Fed EffectIt might not be the president at all affecting stocks  but rather the Chairman of the Federal Reserve  Ben Bernanke  As the Fed has followed an aggressive monetary policy through multiple rounds of quantitative easing  the stock market has gradually drifted higher If Bernanke has been the one sending the market higher  then keeping Obama in place would seem to be a better recipe for market success regardless of the underlying business factors  Although originally appointed by former President George W  Bush in 2006  Bernanke was re appointed by Obama in 2010  With his term set to expire in 2014  whoever wins the presidential election next week will have the opportunity to nominate the next Federal Reserve Chairman According to reports published earlier this month  Bernanke    even if nominated to continue his term    will leave the Fed in 2014  Of course  it might be that Obama would be more likely to appoint a more dovish chairman as Bernanke s successor  one more concerned with the employment rate  On the other hand  Romney might appoint a more hawkish chairman concerned with keeping inflation at bay More interesting is the possibility that Romney may try to push Bernanke out the door prematurely  maybe even asking for his resignation  That seems unlikely  but could lead to turmoil in the markets Turning to individual stocks  investors might look to specific sectors or companies for performance in the face of the election outcome Defense vs  Energy And HealthcareFor a Romney victory  stocks involving the defense  energy and financial sector might benefit  For Obama  traders may look to insurance  alternative energy and hospitals Should the country go over the  fiscal cliff   defense stocks might be battered on expectations of reduced military contracts  Romney  if elected  would not be inaugurated until January 2013    after the fiscal cliff cut off  The fiscal cliff carries a high degree of uncertainty  and it would be foolish to predict exactly how the issue will be resolved  if at all If recent actions are any indication of future performance  Congress will manage to find a way to extend the fiscal cliff deadline just a bit longer  That would mean that Romney as president would be able to influence the outcome  In that case  Romney might be more likely to give priority to protecting the defense budget over Obama  thereby limiting the downside to defensive names  Romney s budgets over his term  too  would likely include more spending on the military than Obama s  further boosting defensive names like Lockheed Martin  LMT  or Raytheon  RTN  Financial StocksAs for financials  the underlying companies could see better profits under Romney as president  Following the financial crisis  Obama signed the Dodd Frank act into legislature  establishing extensive new rules covering financial regulation  He also pushed for the Volcker Rule    intended to stop the banks from prop trading Romney might not have any chance to abolish these rules  but if elected  his administration may limit the potential for additional regulation    a win for financials like JP Morgan  JPM  and Citigroup  C  EnergyAs for energy  President Obama has presided over a resurgence in American oil production  That said  Obama has blocked projects like TransCanada s  TRP  Keystone XL pipeline  Romney as president may be more favorable to projects like Keystone  and push for expanded use of the nation s natural gas  perhaps even pushing for increased exports of liquefied natural gas  Companies like Cheniere Energy  LNG  could benefit in that scenario But what if Obama wins TelecomS P Capital IQ argued in September that the Obama administration has been supportive of telecommunications thus far  and would continue to do so during his second term  Obama s administration has encouraged broadband expansion and shifted wireless spectrum from television broadcasters to telecom providers  Verizon  VZ  and AT T  T  are staple plays in this sector Alternative EnergyAlternative energy has been a favored industry for Obama s administration  and future Obama budgets could include more tax credits and subsidies for companies operating in the sector  Companies like NextEra  NEE  and First Solar  FSLR  might see a notable boost during a possible second Obama term HealthcareFinally  hospital stocks could rally if Obama wins next week After being confirmed as constitutionally permissible by the Supreme Court  the only possibility for Obamacare to be abolished would be under a Romney presidency  If Obama wins next week  Obamacare might be legal for the foreseeable future Under the provisions of Obamacare  more Americans are expected to be covered by private insurance  As it stands  hospital emergency rooms are legally required to treat people who do not have insurance    weighing on their bottom line  With less of these emergency room free riders  hospitals might see their profitability increase in coming years  Stocks in this industry include Tenet Healthcare  THC  and HCA Holdings  HCA  With only three full U S  trading sessions left before polls open  traders should act quick if they wish to rebalance their portfolios ahead of the election  c  2012 Benzinga com  Benzinga does not provide investment advice  All rights reserved
