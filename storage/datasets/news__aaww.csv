GameStop Corp  is the world s largest video game and entertainment software retailer  The company operates more than 5 800 stores across the U S  and in fourteen countries worldwide  GameStop also sells new and used video game software  hardware and accessories for next generation video game systems from Sony  Nintendo and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Additionally  the company sells PC entertainment software  related accessories and other merchandise 
Holiday Quarter Results Were Rough
Adjusted earnings of  1 45 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 59 per share  mostly due to an asset impairment charge and other one time items totaling  334 5 million 
Revenues of  3 06 billion also missed our consensus estimate and plunged 7 6  year over year  but comparable sales managed to pick up 1 4  thanks to two things  the timing of Call of Duty and a calendar shift 
Despite that comps growth  sales in the majority of GME s business segment s declined  New software sales fell 7 8   new hardware sales dropped 9 8   and pre owned sales plunged 21 3  year over year 
On top of these weak results was a weak outlook for GameStop s fiscal 2019 
Comparable store sales are now expected to decline by 5  to 10   and total sales are projected to decrease by the same percentage  GameStop did not give any earnings guidance  due to planned cost savings and a new CEO hire 
Falling Estimates
Analysts have since turned bearish on GameStop  with four cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  Earnings are expected to decline roughly 27 5  for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 73 cents during that same time period from  2 28 to  1 55 per share 
This sentiment has stretched into 2021  Earnings could decline almost 12   but our consensus estimate has dropped significantly in the past two months 
GME is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Shares of the video game retailer have fallen 19  since January  In comparison  the S P 500 is up over 16  year to date 
Bottom Line
GameStop does plan to improve its annualized operating profit hopefully by  100 million as part of a new cost savings initiative  The company will focus on supply chain  operations  expense  and pricing efficiency 
But  things aren t looking too bright for GME right now  as the cost cutting plan won t likely benefit the retailer in 2019

32972,254487,AAWW,Is Atlas Air Worldwide  AAWW  Stock A Suitable Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ AAWW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Atlas Air Worldwide has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5 67  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 13  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Atlas Air Worldwide s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 53  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Atlas Air Worldwide has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 5 59  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Atlas Air Worldwide stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Atlas Air Worldwide has a P S ratio of about 0 39  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 28 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  AAWW is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Atlas Air Worldwide currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Atlas Air Worldwide a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 27  which is far better than the industry average of 5 84  Clearly  AAWW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Atlas Air Worldwide might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C  This gives AAWW a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and four downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 60 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAtlas Air Worldwide is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 14   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated

32973,254488,AAWW,Amazon Roundup  India  Indonesia  Canada Logistics  Policing  Audible  IRS,opinion,"Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   is strengthening its position in India despite regulatory setbacks  it is investing in a leading Indonesian ecommerce company  increasing logistics capabilities in Canada  and helping the police  getting sued by publishers and defeating the IRS in the U S 
India
India s crackdown on fraudulent practices by non banking financial institutions and its move to ban international auditing firm Deloitte and a KPMG affiliate has rattled corporate heads  contributing to lower growth rates and impacting the stock market  Amazon India head Amit Agarwal took the opportunity to say that India could improve its growth rates by promoting ecommerce rather than holding it back with red tape and unfriendly laws 
He also said that Amazon s push for SMB exports had contributed a billion dollars to the country s exports and that the next three years would see this number climb to  5 billion 
Amazon is specifically opposing the government s move to protect small sellers that can t compete with the deep discounts on the platform  The Confederation of All India Traders  CAIT  are accusing big retailers like Amazon of continuing to use complex measures to circumvent the protective law that went into effect this February 
Agarwal s comments seem to indicate that the company is opposing rather than requesting time to build the data centers necessary to store Indian data within its borders  in line with global sentiments 
Amazon has however inaugurated a new campus in the southern city of Hyderabad and there are no known plans of slowing down investment in the country  where Prime memberships continue to grow at the fastest rate in the world 
Amazon is making arrangements to acquire a larger stake in Future Retail  one of the leading traditional retail chains in India  So  through Amazon Com NV Investment Holdings LLC it has agreed to buy a 49  stake in Future Coupons Ltd  which holds warrants that can be converted partly or wholly into Future Retail shares  The warrants can be exercised in the next three to 10 years  It was earlier reported that Amazon was looking to buy a 10  stake in the company  valued at 20 billion rupees  or  278 million 
Investment in Indonesia s Gojek App
Bloomberg and Reuters are saying that Amazon is in talks to acquire a stake in Indonesian super app Gojek 
Presumably the super prefix is because the app lets you hail rides  order dinner  shop groceries  make payments through a digital wallet  appoint cleaners  masseuses  hairdressers  etc  order medicines  and many other things  Its usefulness has enabled its expansion across Indonesia  the Philippines  Singapore  Thailand and Vietnam  where it serves 260 million people and competes with Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Shopee  In Indonesia  where it launched  ecommerce sales are expected to jump from the current  12 2 billion to  53 billion in the next five years 
The terms of the deal aren t known  but it definitely looks like a good place to kick start Amazon s investment in the region 
Equity Stake in Canadian Airline Cargojet
Amazon continues to corner logistics capabilities in an attempt to serve its customers better  So similar to its agreements with U S  air carriers Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings   NASDAQ AAWW   and Air Transport Services Group   NASDAQ ATSG    it has signed an agreement with Toronto based Cargojet  which operates 21 freighters  Boeing  NYSE BA  757s and 767s  
Accordingly  Cargojet will issue warrants that can  after seven years  be converted into voting shares  giving Amazon a 9 9  stake in the company  In exchange  Amazon will make sure it contributes C  400 million in volumes through the period  There s also a separate agreement giving Amazon warrants to buy  after seven years  an additional 5  of variable voting shares  for C  200 million 
Partnership with 400 Police Forces
Amazon owned Ring has set itself up for fresh controversy by partnering with 400 police departments across the country 
It allows law enforcement access to video recorded by the camera system that typically detects motion and transmits to the user  which can be viewed and shared as desired  Policemen won t get live access to the data unless publicly shared  but only by requesting the home owner  who has the prerogative to refuse   
Privacy advocates and critics fear this could increase racial profiling  while turning police officers into salespeople for surveillance systems and increase community paranoia 
Amazon has also been criticized by at least 25 prominent artificial intelligence researchers  including experts at Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    for selling its facial recognition technology called rekognition to law enforcement  The problem with so doing is its inability to correctly identify colored people 
Amazon  however  has said that the technology is so great that it can also identify emotions like fear  happiness  sadness  anger  surprise  disgust  calmness and confusion although it isn t against a certain amount of regulation 
Its shareholders rejected proposals to stop selling the technology to government agencies and also to investigate privacy violations 
Amazon s Audible Sued for Copyright Infringement
Amazon doesn t appear to learn well from past mistakes  or tries to stretch what it can do with everything at its disposal  In the past  the company has got on the wrong side of publishers  authors and the Authors Guild because of unauthorized use of copyrights  And now it s doing pretty much the same thing with its audio book company Audible 
Its new speech to text feature called  Captions  can use machine learning to reproduce voice recordings so children can see the text that they re hearing  The text may not be a hundred percent accurate  Amazon warns  and is intended to be more an education aid than anything else  according to the company  This is supposed to legalize the textual reproduction notwithstanding the fact that it will in all probability impact sales of print and digital book sales  hurting authors and publishers  
Of course  publishers  including Hachette  HarperCollins  Macmillan  Penguin Random House  Simon   Schuster  Chronicle Books and Scholastic don t agree with the thinking  So they and the Association of American Publishers  to which they subscribe  have sued Amazon in the Southern  NYSE SO  District Court of New York for copyright infringement 
IRS Appeal in U S  Tax Dispute
Amazon won a 3 0 ruling in its favor at the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle  The court upheld the 2017 U S  tax court ruling against the IRS  represented by the Justice Department 
The case was in relation to the definition of intangibles that were transferred to its Luxemburg headquarters in Europe  Amazon claimed that the value was limited to independently transferable assets  while the IRS wanted to include things like goodwill  employees and  culture of innovation  
A 2017 amendment to the tax law does include these things  and would have enabled the IRS to increase the tax bill  But the judge held that since the increased scope of intangibles in 2017 did not apply to what Amazon transacted in 2005 and 2006  it couldn t be held liable

33020,254535,AAWW,The jumbo jet faces a make or break year at Boeing  Airbus,news,"By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher
Seattle Paris  Reuters    The jumbo jet  for many years the workhorse of modern air travel  could be close to running out of runway 
Last year  there were zero orders placed by commercial airlines for new Boeing 747s or Airbus A380s  reflecting a fundamental shift in the industry toward smaller  twin engine planes  Smaller planes cost less to fly than the stately  four engine jumbos  which can carry as many as 525 passengers 
The slump in sales of the jets has raised questions over how long manufacturers can sustain production  It has also fueled internal debate in both companies over the future of the planes  sources said 
The outcome of those discussions will affect the value of existing fleets and thousands of production jobs at the plane makers and their many parts suppliers 
Sales forces at Airbus Group NV  PA AIR  and  Boeing Co   N BA  are fighting for potential orders plane by plane as they seek to keep production going beyond the end of the decade  said other aviation market sources  The aircraft makers are offering discounts of at least 50 percent from catalog prices of around  400 million for a jumbo jet  those sources said  Airbus has said it is also considering a revamp to make its  superjumbo  more attractive to buyers 
Boeing in September plans to slow the pace of production of its latest 747 8 model to an average of 1 3 planes a month from 1 5 currently  At that rate the orders it already has in hand will only keep the production line going for 2 1 2 years 
The crunch  though  will come earlier because it can take up to two years from ordering the first part to finishing a jet  and no one wants to start the process if it is unclear whether the plane will be completed and delivered to a customer 
 I can see demand for the 747 8 in small numbers  but you have got to ask if they can keep the production line open if they don t get some new orders   said Tony Whitty  chief executive of UK based aircraft re marketing firm Cabot Aviation  which trades  manages and leases jets   You also wonder at what price they are selling  
 
LONG DESCENT
Use of the 747 has dropped steadily over the last two decades  reflecting the rise of two engine jets that have come close to matching its range  Over the same period production of large twin engined jets like the Boeing 777 has risen seven fold  Last year  Boeing booked 283 new orders for the 777 and now has a backlog of 547 orders 
Airbus is more upbeat than Boeing about the prospects for jumbo jets but both now agree it has become a niche category  Airlines still need jumbo jets but only for certain polar flights   where a two engine jet may be less safe than a four engine jumbo because of the lack of places for an emergency landing   and busy routes where landing slots are scarce 
The risk is most visible for Boeing  where investors could face a  1 billion accounting charge if 747 production is shut down  according to company disclosures 
Boeing recently received a high profile boost with a provisional order for two new jets to serve as Air Force One for the U S  President but the 747 s future depends a lot more on sales of the much less glamorous windowless freight model  That has a unique hinged nose and can carry very large equipment  such as oil drilling rigs 
So far this year  Boeing has sold three   Atlas Air Worldwide   O AAWW  recently said it plans to order more for its cargo fleet  but wouldn t say when or how many  The world s biggest 747 freight customer  Cargolux  CLUX UL   also says it likes the plane  but has a pending order for only three 
A sustained upturn in air freight traffic could secure the 747 a longer future  International freight traffic rose 4 8 percent last year  but volume has only just recovered from a collapse in 2009 during the financial crisis 
 
CARGO HAULER
Boeing reckons some 143 older freighters will need to be replaced  stretching demand for the 747 through the 2020s  the program vice president  Bruce Dickinson  said in an interview 
 We know there is a long term market for this airplane and some of the unique things it can do   Dickinson said from his office overlooking the 747 production line at the giant Everett plant near Seattle 
But Boeing s effort to sell new 747s is overshadowed by the many older 747s available for lease  which have suddenly been made more attractive because of a big slide in fuel prices since the middle of last year  Leasing companies say there is scant interest in new 747 8s when 82 freighters are baking in desert parking lots 
The older planes can be leased for as little as  400 000 a month  compared with up to  1 4 million in monthly lease payments for a new 747 8 freighter  experts say 
 That s a pretty big difference   said Gueric Dechavanne  vice president at Collateral Verifications  a Connecticut based aircraft appraisal firm 
Some companies have extended 747 leases for three to four years  said Aengus Kelly  chief executive of leasing company AerCap  N AER  
 It s a challenge to lease a freighter   Kelly told Reuters   It s definitely a challenge to sell them  
Airbus s A380 is a newer plane   its first flight was almost exactly 10 years ago   and has become a mainstay of Middle East carriers that offer opulent suites to first class passengers  But the drop in demand is prompting Airbus to weigh whether to revamp the plane with new engines  or carry on with the existing model  
Airbus has 161 orders for the planes in hand  or more than five years of production  But it acknowledges that not all of those jets will be delivered  leaving it with barely three years of guaranteed output  Given the long lead times  Airbus must bring in more orders soon to avoid having to taper production 
 We are always looking at product improvements  but there is so much untapped potential in the existing aircraft   said Airbus marketing head Chris Emerson 
Airbus could announce an A380 revamp as early as the Dubai Airshow in November  but must first find a way to assure investors it can recover several billion dollars of development costs  sources said  Analysts say on option could be to apply for more European government loans  though that risks exacerbating trade tensions with the United States 
Top customer Emirates is offering to double its planned purchase of 140 A380s if Airbus carries out the improvements  which the Dubai carrier s Chief Executive Tim Clark tells Reuters will be  extremely good for the  airline s  bottom line  

But Airbus s board is unlikely to back a new A380 model for just one customer ",2015-04-16,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-jumbo-jet-faces-a-make-or-break-year-at-boeing,-airbus-337355",337355

Proper guidance is often the difference between success and failure in life  The same holds true for the investing world  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   Proper guidance  as far as investing is concerned  comes from brokers  who are deemed to be experts  equipped with vast knowledge of investing 
Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors 
Brokers  irrespective of their type  attend company conference calls presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action  Individual investors  more often than not  do not have access to such detailed and well researched information 
Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Proper Guide
Broker ratings are backed by sound logic and are by no means arbitrary  Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock 
Naturally  when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock  they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade 
Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario

33217,254732,AAWW,Key Predictions For Q3 Earnings Reports Of EXPD And AAWW,opinion,"The third quarter earnings season is in its tail end with majority of the companies having already unveiled their quarterly financial numbers  The picture that has emanated so far is a healthy one and this earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note  displaying substantial growth The already reassuring picture is expected to get rosier by the end of this week  During the course  826 companies including the 49 S P 500 players are expected to report their financial figures  Consequently  we will have reports from the 455 S P 500 players as 406 companies in the highly sought after space had already posted results as of Nov 3 Per the latest   the top and bottom lines for the 406 S P 500 companies expanded 6 3  and 7 5   respectively  on a year over year basis  Additionally  approximately 66 7  and 73 9  of the S P 500 members have outperformed on the revenues and earnings front  This progress in the quarterly performance can be attributed to a turnaround in the economy and improved job market scenario  among other factors In fact  stocks in the highly sought after fraternity are projected to end the third quarter with their top and bottom lines expanding 5 6  and 6 5   respectively  Also  nine of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year over year basis Turbulent Q3 for TransportsThe widely diversified  does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14   due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes Evidently  the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   in the third quarter has contracted a respective 7 6  and 28 6   on a year over year basis  Thus  substantiating the fact that the transportation sector has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters  Harvey  Irma  Maria and the earthquake in Mexico   For example  airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues Additionally  these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines leading to rapid increase in freight costs  Also  the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads  For trucking companies  shortage of drivers remains a major headwind  Meanwhile  the rise in labor costs has hurt J B  Hunt Transport Services    NASDAQ JBHT    and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of the quarter Given this backdrop  investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await third quarter reports from sector participants like Expeditors International of Washington   NASDAQ EXPD   and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings   NASDAQ AAWW   that are scheduled for Nov 7 According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise  You can see  Expeditors International of Washington provides logistic services globally  The company is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight Higher operating expenses are likely to hit this transportation company s bottom line in the quarter  In fact  increased volumes might lead to higher operating expenses at all the three primary divisions   Airfreight services  Ocean freight and ocean services  and Customs brokerage and other services   of the company  Personnel expenses are also expected to be high  owing to higher headcount However  the top line is anticipated to improve in the soon to be reported quarter  Despite the prevalent imbalance between demand and supply in the Airfreight market  volume growth is likely to drive revenues at this flagship division  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Airfreight services segment s third quarter revenues is pegged at  692 million  higher than the  672 million reported in the previous quarter Total revenues from the Ocean freight and ocean services unit are also expected to increase  backed by volume growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s third quarter revenues is pegged at  547 million  higher than the  529 million reported in the second quarter of 2017 Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Customs brokerage and other services segment s third quarter revenues is pegged at  476 million  higher than the  472 million reported in the last quarter Yet  the chances of this transportation company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are less  even though it carries a Zacks Rank  3  This is because Expeditors has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 60 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  In fact  our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well  Previously  when we issued its   the company had an Earnings ESP of  0 28   while the Zacks Rank remained the same Expeditors International of

33244,254759,AAWW,Should Value Investors Pick Atlas Air Worldwide  AAWW  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ AAWW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Atlas Air Worldwide has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Atlas Air Worldwide s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 10 4  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Atlas Air Worldwide has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Atlas Air Worldwide s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Atlas Air Worldwide has a P S ratio of about 0 8  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Atlas Air Worldwide currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AAWW a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too

bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAtlas Air Worldwide is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 17  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is
