23084,244599,BHLB,Zacks com Highlights  Accuray  Berkshire Hills Bancorp  A  Schulman  Sysco And Tailored Brands,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 1  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Accuray   NASDAQ ARAY    Berkshire Hills Bancorp   NYSE BHLB    A  Schulman   NASDAQ SHLM    Sysco   NYSE SYY   and Tailored Brands   NYSE TLRD   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Why the P S Ratio Is My Favorite Valuation MetricThis week  I m going to focus on the Price to Sales ratio for finding great stocks at great values The Price to Sales ratio is a great valuation metric  And given the recent run up in stocks  value  to me  is becoming more and more important In fact  aside from the Zacks Rank  if I could only use one item to screen and pick stocks with  this item would be the one DefinitionLet s first start with a definition The Price to Sales ratio is simply  Price divided by SalesIf the Price to Sales ratio is 1 that means you re paying  1 for every  1 of sales the company makes A price to sales ratio of 2 means you re paying  2 for every  1 of sales the company makes As you might have guessed  the lower the Price the Sales ratio  the better A price to Sales ratio of  5 means you re paying 50 cents for every  1 of sales the company makes And paying less than a dollar for a dollar s worth of something is a good bargain One of the reasons I like the Price to Sales ratio is because it looks at sales rather than earnings  like the P E ratio does And sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement than earnings Secondly  I d be hard pressed to find a screen where adding the Price to Sales ratio didn t improve it Price to Sales StudyFor me  I prefer to look for stocks with a Price to Sales ratio under 1  Although  I m willing to go up to 4  depending on the industry But in my testing  as the illustration below shows  those with a Price to Sales ratio of 1 or less produced the best returns  Between 1 and 2 also outperformed pretty significantly  But once you got over 4  the odds were against you           P S range greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1 Average Annual Return  17 8           P S range greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2  Average Annual Return  11 1           P S range greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3  Average Annual Return  7 3           P S range greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4  Average Annual Return  3 8           P S range greater than 4  Average Annual Return   7 9 But the best way to use it  I ve found  is to find stocks with a Price to Sales ratio below the median for its Industry And that s what we ll be focusing on in this week s screen And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article
