27433,248948,AZO,When Does Market Timing Actually Work    December 31  2019,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to consistently time the market and always make a profit is the dream for most people who trade their own accounts 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Retail Wholesale stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Abercrombie   Fitch Company  ANF   Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc   ARCO   Aaron s  Inc   AAN   ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS ADR  ASOMY   AutoZone  Inc   NYSE AZO 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

27434,248949,AZO,All You Need To Know About AutoZone  AZO  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"AutoZone  NYSE AZO  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for AutoZone is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For AutoZone  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AutoZone
This auto parts retailer is expected to earn  66 10 per share for the fiscal year ending August    2020  which represents a year over year change of 4 2  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AutoZone  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of AutoZone to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-autozone-azo-rating-upgrade-to-buy-200495730,200495730

All of these companies will be releasing results for their fiscal quarters ending in November  which we count as part of the December quarter tally  In fact  by the time JPMorgan  JPM  comes out with Q4 report on January 14  2020  we will have seen such November quarter results from almost two dozen S P 500 members 
This earnings season is not expected to change the market s earnings view in any meaningful way  Growth has been constrained in the first three quarters of 2019 and results of the last quarter of the year are not expected to be any different  A big contributing factor holding growth back has been tough comparisons to the very high levels of profitability in 2018 when earnings were boosted by the tax cut legislation  We will see this factor at play in the Q4 earnings season as well  But the expectation is that positive growth resumes in 2020  which we will show below 
For 2019 Q4  total earnings  or aggregate net income  for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 5  from the same period last year on  3  higher revenues  with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have lower earnings than the year earlier period

The magnitude of negative revisions that Q4 estimates suffered is in line with historical trends for comparable periods

Sectors experiencing the biggest negative revisions include Autos  Aerospace  Industrial Products and Basic Materials 
The Autos sector was expected to enjoy earnings growth of  6 1  at the start of October  which has now dropped to a decline of  56 4   This dramatic shift is primarily a function of how estimates for General Motors  NYSE GM  have evolved lately  with the current Zacks Consensus EPS of 6 cents for the automaker in Q4 down from  1 77 two months back

27572,249087,AZO,Timing The Market  Is It Possible    November 08  2019,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Lost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts  How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Retail Wholesale stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels  Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all time highs  AutoZone  Inc   NYSE AZO   Abercrombie   Fitch Company  ANF   Aaron s  Inc   AAN   Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc   ARCO   ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS ADR  ASOMY 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

27573,249088,AZO,S P 500  The Long And Short Of It  AZO  JPM  VRSK  COG,opinion,"The S P 500 nudged its way up to a fresh all time high yesterday  Without any obvious signs of a top forming  the bias remains bullish above 3069 90 8 of 12 sectors trade at or just below their 52 week highs  or all time highs  more to the point  Energy is the only sector to decline over the past five sessions and trade lower compare with 52 weeks ago   Whilst there are plenty of equities rising within the S P 500  finding the ones which don t appear overextended to the upside  and therefore require consolidation or a retracement  has proven tricky  But on the plus side  we have a large list of bullish equities that will hopefully provide opportunities further out 




AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO   The automotive parts retailer closed at record highs yesterday  although only just  Still  the equity remains in a clear uptrend and has formed a potential double bottom  which can be a continuation pattern in an uptrend   so we re looking for this to break higher  Keep in mind that prices have struggled to push higher around current levels twice previously  so bullish momentum need to hold up if the double bottom is to be believed  If prices turn lower  we can reassess   although the trend remains bullish whilst prices hold above the 1040 lows 
Bias is for the bullish breakout to continue in line with its trend If successful  the double bottom pattern projects and approximate target around 1336 Given its at record highs an open upside target can be used  Or bulls can refer to the monthly pivot levels  R2 is currently around 1228 and R3 around 1300   these levels will obviously change on December 1st  However  if bearish momentum takes it back beneath the breakout level it may provide a near term counter trend opportunity  Prices have failed to push higher twice near these levels  so it s certainly a scenario to look out for 




JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Around mid October  JPM finally broke out of a 20 month consolidation pattern and now sits just off its record high  A decent trend is taking shape and prices are accelerating away from the trendline  which leaves potential for the upper channel to be broken  Moreover  prices are bobbing along the 10 day eMA to show how strong momentum is and a swing low has formed at 127 42 
Near term bias remains bullish above 127 42  although a break beneath it merely flags a deeper correction and not a trend reversal A break to record highs could also breach the monthly R2 bring R3 into focus Alternatively  an open upside target could be used with a trailing stop  given prices would be at record highs following a significant breakout of a major  sideways pattern Other bullish setups to consider  along the same lines as JPM  are  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS   Valero  LKQ  Hewlett Packard and Paccar Inc 





 Verisk Analytics Inc   NASDAQ VRSK   Prices hit a record high in early October before shedding over  17 9  over the next few weeks  taking it on the cusp of a technical bear market  Prices have retreated into a zone of resistance around 144  which comprises of the 20 and 200 day eMAs  38 2  Fibonacci level and swing lows 
Bias remains bearish whilst prices trade beneath the resistance clusterA bearish hammer has formed at the highs to warn of a hesitancy to push higher  although bears may want to wait for bearish momentum to returns and   or see if prices print a more compelling top  such as a series of doji s or a 2 bar reversal pattern  Initial target is around 134 30 40 where the monthly S2 and structural low reside A break beneath 134 bring 130 into focus  which is a psychological round number and where an upside gap appeared in March 




 Cabot Oil   Gas  Corporation  NYSE COG   The independent oil and gas company suffered its most bearish close in nearly 4 months yesterday  That it occurred in line with the dominant  bearish trend suggests it could be headed to new lows  Still  its not uncommon to see a stock rebound the day after a heavy loss  so it s simply a case of waiting for key support to be broken   whether it be today or thereafter 
Bias remains bearish whilst prices hold beneath 18 30  where the 50day eMA  monthly pivot and swing high reside  A break beneath 16 99 brings the lows around 16 into focus  However  a double top formed around 19 30 which  if successful  projects an initial target around 14 67",2019-11-19,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-the-long-and-short-of-it-azo-jpm-vrsk-cog-200486195,200486195

27580,249095,AZO,The Keys To Successfully Timing The Markets   December 05  2019,opinion,"There is no better feeling for an investor than trusting your gut or doing your research and timing the markets correctly  right 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Lost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts  How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Retail Wholesale stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels  Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all time highs  AutoZone  Inc   NYSE AZO   Abercrombie   Fitch Company  ANF   Aaron s  Inc   AAN   Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc   ARCO   ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS ADR  ASOMY 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

27581,249096,AZO,Why AutoZone  AZO  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering AutoZone  NYSE AZO   which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry 
This auto parts retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 69  
For the most recent quarter  AutoZone was expected to post earnings of  21 64 per share  but it reported  22 59 per share instead  representing a surprise of 4 39   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  15 23 per share  while it actually produced  15 99 per share  a surprise of 4 99  
Price and EPS Surprise

For AutoZone  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AutoZone currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 80   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on December 10  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-autozone-azo-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200490452,200490452

Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Fruitful market timing requires three key parts  1  A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks  or securities  gold or different kinds of investments   2  The capacity to act on the sign accurately  3  The control to follow up on it 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades

27701,249216,AZO,The Market Timing Secrets No One Talks About   October 17  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Lost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts  How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Retail Wholesale stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels  Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all time highs  Aaron s  Inc   AAN   Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc   ARCO   ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS ADR  ASOMY   AutoZone  Inc   NYSE AZO   Abercrombie   Fitch Company  ANF 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

Industry s Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt  For capital intensive companies  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non cash expenses On the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA   the industry is currently trading at 22 83X compared with the S P 500 s 11 10X and the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 9 48X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 23 23X  as low as 15 23X and at a median of 20 23X  as the chart below shows

 Bottom LineA robust economy and conducive labor market conditions are favorable factors for the industry  While the economy is on track now with increasing consumer disposable income  wage growth and healthy employment levels  the risk to economic expansion is mounting because of the rising tariff war between the United States and China  Regular model launches and shifting consumers  preference have increased demand for more sophisticated auto parts  Higher demand has brightened revenue growth prospects of the industry The tech savvy millennial generation is the chief driver of sustainable and convenient mobility solutions  Auto companies have to rethink their business model and focus their attention on the user  The fast and widespread reorganization of the automotive sector is likely to have far reaching impacts on the industry   We are presenting one stock with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that is well positioned to grow  There are also a few stocks with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  that investors may currently retain in their portfolio  You can see  U S  Auto Parts Network  Inc   PRTS  California based U S  Auto Parts Network is one of the leading online providers of automotive aftermarket parts  including body parts  engine parts  performance parts and accessories  The company holds a Zacks Rank  2 and has an expected earnings growth rate of 71 43  for 2020

27729,249244,AZO,AutoZone Data Looks Sharp As Retailer Chases New Highs,opinion,"AutoZone  NYSE AZO  s on a roll  
The auto parts retailer is seeing stock chase all time highs  and shares are up about 5 5  over the course since the second half of 2019 started  When it announces earnings September 24  analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research are looking for EPS  21 64  But alternative data suggests that there could be more good times ahead for AutoZone  its employees  and investors  





Any time you ve got a half million of something you re already headed in the right direction  AutoZone s Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Were Here Count   a measurement of how often users of the social network make posts and other actions at certain locations  like a retailer  or restaurant  indicates continued growth in terms of foot traffic to AutoZone 





AutoZone doesn t quite have a half million job postings   only around 30 000  covering roughly 6 000 stores mostly in the US but also in Mexico and Brazil  And although they appear to have drifted down about 1 5  over the course of the most recent quarter  it s not necessarily a bad sign   at least  not with so many other open roles  
Finally  AutoZone is potentially a beneficiary of a new trend that s emerging in the used auto world   right now  used cars are seeing prices shoot up on secondary sales sites like CarMax  NYSE KMX    and more cars going online for sale  While increasing prices may  or may not  help revenue at parts sellers like AutoZone  NYSE AZO    an influx of more used cars being sold via the web invariably requires some degree of maintenance and upkeep   and that s only a positive net benefit

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
AutoZone shares have added about 36 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 3  
What s Next for AutoZone 
While AutoZone has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AutoZone was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

27805,249320,AZO,Tractor Supply  TSCO  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Tractor Supply  TSCO   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5 3  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  114 25 in the previous session  Tractor Supply has gained 34 8  since the start of the year compared to the 21 1  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 25 1  return for the Zacks Retail   Miscellaneous industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 25  2019  Tractor Supply reported EPS of  0 63 versus consensus estimate of  0 56 
For the current fiscal year  Tractor Supply is expected to post earnings of  4 77 per share on  8 43 billion in revenues  This represents a 10 67  change in EPS on a 6 56  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 29 per share on  8 97 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 96  and 6 38   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Tractor Supply may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Tractor Supply has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 23 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 19 2X versus its peer group s average of 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 08  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Tractor Supply currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Tractor Supply passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Tractor Supply shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Tractor Supply Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Tractor Supply have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Hibbett Sports  HIBB   Tractor Supply  TSCO   and AutoZone  NYSE AZO   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Tractor Supply  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tractor-supply-tsco-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200442502,200442502

27842,249357,AZO,The Truth About Market Timing   August 22  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Retail Wholesale stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc   NYSE AEO   AutoZone  Inc   NYSE AZO   Asbury Automotive Group  Inc   ABG   Advance Auto Parts  Inc   AAP   Amazon com  Inc   NASDAQ AMZN 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

27844,249359,AZO,Transitioning Business Model Creates Buying Opportunity,opinion,"These days  businesses want direct relationships with consumers  Content providers are launching streaming services and retail brands are moving online  It s easier than ever for companies to reach consumers directly  and with the rise of Big Data  that direct relationship is more valuable than ever 
This recent spin off is transitioning from a business model that primarily sells to consumers through third party retailers to one that owns the customer relationship  This transition creates volatility in the short term  but it will make the company significantly more profitable in the long term  Valvoline  NYSE VVV  is this week s Long Idea  
Increasing Focus on Quick Lube
Valvoline  established in 1866  was the first trademarked motor oil brand in the U S  Historically  the company has focused on selling its branded products to consumers through third party retailers such as NAPA Auto Parts  AutoZone  NYSE AZO    Advance Auto Parts   NYSE AAP   and O Reilly Auto Parts  NASDAQ ORLY  
However  this business faces pressure due to the decline of  do it yourself   DIY  car maintenance and the rise of  do it for me   DIFM   A variety of factors  including increased complexity of newer cars and a growing consumer preference for convenience  have led consumers to opt for professional service rather than changing their oil or performing other car maintenance themselves 
Valvoline targets this growing group of consumers through its Quick Lube segment  which owns or franchises  1 300 service locations throughout the U S  and Canada  Since its spin off from Ashland  NYSE ASH  in 2016  Valvoline has rapidly grown this segment to offset the decline in its third party retail business  which it calls  Core North America    Figure 1 shows that operating income for the Quick Lube segment surpassed Core North America for the first time during the TTM period 





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Operating income for the Quick Lube segment grew from  95 million in 2015 to  153 in 2018  or 17  compounded annually  Quick Lube operating income is up to  162 million TTM  From 2015 to the TTM period  Quick Lube s share of segment operating income has grown from 26  to 41  
GAAP Earnings Mislead Investors
Transitioning from a 3rd party retail model to the Quick Lube model has been challenging for Valvoline  In particular  the Core North America segment has struggled due to the decline of the DIY customer base as well as increasing competition from private label motor oil brands 
However  GAAP earnings exaggerate the extent of the company s challenges  Figure 2 shows that GAAP net income declined by 45  in 2018 even though net operating profit after tax  NOPAT  increased by 59   Longer term  TTM GAAP net income is down 18  from 2015  while NOPAT is up 15  over the same time 





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The disconnect in 2018 comes from  77 million  3  of revenue  in non recurring charges due to tax reform  In addition  2017 earnings were inflated due to  138 million  7  of revenue  in non cash pension gains 
As a result  Valvoline s GAAP net income tells the story of a company that is struggling  Valvoline has missed earnings expectations in 6 out of the past 8 quarters  contributing to a 15  decline in the stock price over the past two years 
Our adjustments  on the other hand  suggest the company s profits  despite recent volatility  have grown over the past year 
Steady Increase in Demand
The strength of Valvoline s business can be seen in the long term increase in volume of lubricant sold  Figure 3 shows the total gallons of lubricant sold by the company has grown from 159 million in 2012 to 182 million in 2018  or 2  compounded annually 





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
No matter the channel it sells through  consumer demand is rising  and Valvoline has shown an ability to consistently grow the overall sales of its products 
Advantages of the Quick Lube Model
Over the long term  the transition to a more Quick Lube focused model will make Valvoline a safer and more profitable business  Quick Lube has significant advantages over the 3rd party retail model  including 
Direct Customer Relationship  As noted above  Quick Lube lets Valvoline own the relationship with its consumers  It can gather data to personalize service and market more effectively  and it gets the opportunity to upsell higher value products and services 
Vertical Integration  As both the manufacturer and distributor of its products  Valvoline can earn higher margins than when it has to split profits with the retailer 
Higher Barriers to Entry  It s relatively easy to start a motor oil brand to sell through retailers or online  By contrast  the Quick Lube model requires significant real estate investment and the ability to attract and train employees to deliver an adequate level of service 
Due to these advantages  Valvoline s Quick Lube segment has an operating margin of 22  compared to 15  for the Core North America segment 
Valvoline doesn t break out its assets by segment  so we can t analyze the return on invested capital  ROIC  of these business lines  However  over 60  of the company s Quick Lube locations are franchised  which suggests the capital requirements for this segment are relatively low  and the ROIC is fairly high  A recent company presentation said that new investments earn 2x their cost of capital  WACC   and that the company overall earns an ROIC above 20   This latter number matches our own data and calculation that shows VVV s overall ROIC is 20 4  for the TTM period 
Gaining Market Share
Valvoline isn t just shifting sales from DIY consumer to DIFM  It s also rapidly gaining market share in the DIFM oil change market  Consumers are already shifting more towards quick lube operators in the DIFM segment  and sales by oil change and lubrication shops increased by 4  in 2018  according to data from the Auto Care Association  Valvoline s Quick Lube locations grew same store sales by 8   or double the industry rate  as shown in Figure 4  Through the first six months of 2019  same store sales grew by 10  year over year 





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
On top of its same store sales growth  Valvoline is rapidly growing its store count through new store openings and acquisitions of smaller quick lube chains  This rapid expansion drove a 22  increase in overall revenue  and 18  in reported operating income  for the Quick Lube segment in 2018 
Superior Efficiency Provides Advantages
Valvoline s vertical integration and highly recognizable brand make its locations more efficient and profitable than independent quick lube operators  The average quick lube shop earned   862 thousand in revenue in 2018  while the average Valvoline quick lube shop topped  1 million in sales  which means their stores earn at least 16  more revenue than an average shop  According to a recent company presentation  their locations average  40 oil changes per day compared to  30 for the quick lube industry as a whole 
This superior efficiency explains Valvoline s ability to earn a high return on new investments  The company can acquire independent quick lube operators  re brand  add them to its distribution network  and quickly increase sales and profits 
In addition  the company s superior efficiency may be related to its emphasis on promoting from within  According to a Wall Street Journal report from 2018  employees who started as technicians manage nearly all of the company owned quick lube locations and occupy 83 out of the 84 regional manager roles  This emphasis on promoting from within helps to establish a consistent corporate culture  ensure that management understands the problems faced by technicians  and makes Valvoline a more attractive choice for prospective employees 
Bear Case  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Basics Threat Is Overhyped
The bear case for Valvoline assumes that the growth of the Quick Lube segment won t be enough to offset the decline of Core North America  In particular  the concern is that competition from private label brands will cause margins in this business to collapse 
This concern intensified last fall when Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  announced it would start selling private label motor oil under the AmazonBasics brand  In the wake of this announcement  JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM  downgraded VVV to  Underweight   and the stock fell 6  
However  AmazonBasics is not the category killer that many investors believe it to be  Research shows that AmazonBasics has gained significant market share in electronics and accessories  but it s struggled to break through in other categories  In particular  there are two key reasons why Amazon s private label motor oil doesn t represent a major threat to Valvoline 
Oil Recycling  Most DIY oil changers recycle their used motor oil  and many take advantage of the oil recycling services offered by major auto parts retailers  If you re already going to the store to recycle your oil anyway  it s easier to just buy new oil there rather than online  so the typical convenience advantage of e commerce doesn t exist in this space  As a result  e commerce accounts for just 5  of motor oil sales 
No New Value Proposition  AmazonBasics motor oil is manufactured by Warren Distribution  the same company that already manufactures Walmart s  WMT  private label motor oil brand  Supertech  With no real innovation on the production side and a price point equal to many other private label brands  there s no reason to believe AmazonBasics motor oil will be a significant disruptor in this space 
Competition from private label brands has been and will continue to be a challenge for Valvoline s Core North America segment  but Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  doesn t represent the threat that bears believe 
Bear Case  EV s Won t Spell Doom for VVV
Longer term  the bear case against Valvoline is that the growth of electric vehicles   which don t require motor oil and need less servicing than traditional vehicles   will make its business model obsolete  However  the widespread adoption of EV s is farther off than most realize  and even if they do become dominant  Valvoline has the potential to adapt its business 
Despite the hype around EV s  they currently account for just one in 250 cars on the road and 2  of new global auto sales  Even the most optimistic projections of EV adoption have them accounting for only 32  of the world s passenger vehicles by 2040 
If EV s do completely replace gas powered cars  Valvoline s Quick Lube model will enable it to adapt and survive  Its bread and butter oil change service might go away  but the company still performs plenty of services   such as tire rotation  air conditioner recharge  air filter replacement  light bulb replacement  and wiper blade replacement   that will still be required on EV s 
In addition  the company could add new services as EV adoption grows  For instance  it could install rapid charging stations at its locations  introduce software troubleshooting  and develop more advanced coolants for batteries and fuel cells 
The significant backlog at Tesla s  TSLA  service centers shows that there will continue to be demand for maintenance services as the share of EV s grows  Who knows  perhaps Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  or another automaker dealer could consider Valvoline as an acquisition target in order to improve their service capabilities  Surveys show that millennials are significantly less likely to use dealerships for service and maintenance than previous generations  so automakers and dealers might be looking to get into the quick lube business 
ROIC Analysis Shows Shares Are Undervalued
Numerous case studies show that getting ROIC right is an important part of making smart investments  Per Figure 5  ROIC explains 61  of the difference in valuation for the 14 companies Valvoline lists as peers in the lubricants chemicals space in its proxy statement  VVV trades at a discount to peers as shown by its position below the trend line 





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
If the stock were to trade at parity with its peers  it would be worth  31 share   53  above the current stock price  With Valvoline taking market share from other oil change peers  it arguably deserves a premium valuation compared to its peers 
Cheap Valuation Creates Buying Opportunity
VVV is down 15  since its spinoff in 2016 despite the fact that the firm s NOPAT and economic earnings have increased since then  As a result  shares now have significant upside potential 
At its current price of  20 share  VVV has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 0  This ratio means the market expects no meaningful growth in VVV s NOPAT over the remaining life of the firm  This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that is steadily growing sales volume and shifting to a more profitable business 
If VVV can maintain its current NOPAT margin of 13  and grow NOPAT by just 5  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  32 share today   a 60  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
Even if you believe that the rise of EV s will be a long term headwind  VVV still has upside  If we use the same 10 year forecast from the above scenario  but then assume that revenue will decline by 3  annually and NOPAT margins will shrink to 11  over the following 20 years  the stock is worth  22 share   an 11  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario  In this scenario  VVV s NOPAT decreases by 1  compounded annually over the course of the next 30 years 
Sustainable Competitive Advantages That Will Drive Shareholder Value Creation
Here s a summary of why we think the moat around Valvoline s business will enable the company to generate higher profits than the current valuation of the stock implies  This list of competitive advantages helps VVV offer better products services at a lower price and prevents competition from taking market share 
Highly recognizable brand with a reputation for quality and reliability
Vertical integration leads to higher cost efficiency for Quick Lube business
Ability to rapidly integrate newly acquired locations at a high ROIC
Direct customer relationships create lasting value no matter what type of car people drive
What Noise Traders Miss with VVV
These days  fewer investors focus on finding quality capital allocators with shareholder friendly corporate governance  Instead  due to the proliferation of noise traders  the focus tends toward technical trading tends while high quality fundamental research is overlooked  Here s a quick summary for noise traders when analyzing VVV 
Understated earnings growth due to the impact of tax reform on 2018 GAAP net income
Despite short term volatility  transition from 3rd party retail to Quick Lube model will be beneficial long term
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is not as significant a threat in this space as investors fear
Electric cars still need service  and manufacturer service locations cannot meet existing demand
Catalyst  Earnings Beats Can Send Shares Higher
Valvoline faces significant pessimism from analysts due to its recent history of earnings misses  Five out of the nine sell side analysts covering the stock rate it as a Hold or Sell  Consensus estimates have earnings flat year over year for the current quarter 
As Quick Lube becomes a larger part of Valvoline s business  its growth should become enough to offset the struggles of Core North America  In addition  the company has announced a cost saving initiative and promotional pricing in order to stabilize its legacy business 
Longer term  international expansion could be a major growth driver for the company  Valvoline announced a joint venture with Masters Too to develop a quick lube model in China earlier this year  If the company successfully exports this high growth business to an international consumer base  the upside potential is enormous 
Exec Comp Should Return to ROIC Emphasis
Due to its recent spinoff from Ashland  ASH   Valvoline s executives continued to earn long term awards based on targets set by its former parent company through 2018  These targets included return on investment  ROI   which is similar to ROIC 
However  the new long term targets set by the company focus on EPS and total shareholder return  while annual bonuses are based on operating income and lubricant volume  The company continues to emphasize ROIC in reports and presentations  but it would be better if it continued to clearly link executive compensation to this important metric 
Dividends and Buybacks Provide 4  Yield
Valvoline has increased its dividend in each of its three years as an independent company  Since 2016  Valvoline has increased its dividend by 47  compounded annually  Its current annualized dividend of  0 42 equates to a dividend yield of 2 1 
In addition to dividends  Valvoline returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases  In 2018  the company repurchased  325 million  8  of market cap  worth of shares  The company currently has  75 million remaining on its purchase authorization  If it exercises the rest of this authorization  Valvoline s dividend and buyback activity provide shareholders with a potential 4  yield 
Insider Trading and Short Interest Trends are Minimal
Insider activity has been minimal over the past 12 months  with 33 thousand shares purchased and 94 thousand shares sold for a net effect of 62 thousand shares sold  These sales represent less than 1  of shares outstanding 
There are currently 5 7 million shares sold short  which equates to 3  of shares outstanding and 4 days to cover  There doesn t appear to be much appetite to bet against this stock

27847,249362,AZO,AutoZone  AZO  Is Up 3 04  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at AutoZone  NYSE AZO   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if AZO is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this auto parts retailer holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For AZO  shares are up 3 04  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry is up 3 04  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 07  compares favorably with the industry s 3 07  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of AutoZone have increased 11 56  over the past quarter  and have gained 62 37  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 57  and 8 42   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to AZO s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  AZO is currently averaging 196 509 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AZO 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AZO s consensus estimate  increasing from  61 74 to  62 49 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that AZO is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep AutoZone on your short list ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autozone-azo-is-up-304-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200441993,200441993

27854,249369,AZO,Casey s  CASY  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Caseys General Stores  CASY   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5 2  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  161 24 in the previous session  Caseys General Stores has gained 25 1  since the start of the year compared to the 22 4  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 23 7  return for the Zacks Retail   Convenience Stores industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 10  2019  Casey s reported EPS of  0 68 versus consensus estimate of  0 42 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 15  
For the current fiscal year  Casey s is expected to post earnings of  5 86 per share on  9 8 billion in revenues  This represents a 6 35  change in EPS on a 4 81  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 19 per share on  10 7 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 5 54  and 9 12   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Casey s may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Casey s has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 27 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 13 1X versus its peer group s average of 7 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 92  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Casey s currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Casey s fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Casey s shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Casey s Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Casey s have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Expedia Group  NASDAQ EXPE   Dollar General  DG   and AutoZone  NYSE AZO   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 2  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Casey s  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/caseys-casy-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200440906,200440906

27986,249501,AZO,CarMax  KMX  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CarMax  NYSE KMX   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  89 09 in the previous session  CarMax has gained 41 7  since the start of the year compared to the 20 3  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 22 1  return for the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 21  2019  CarMax reported EPS of  1 59 versus consensus estimate of  1 49 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 77  
For the current fiscal year  CarMax is expected to post earnings of  5 27 per share on  19 67 billion in revenues  This represents a 10 02  change in EPS on an 8 23  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 7 per share on  20 81 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 8 11  and 5 82   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
CarMax may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
CarMax has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 16 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 8X versus its peer group s average of 17 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 34  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  CarMax currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if CarMax passes the test  Thus  it seems as though CarMax shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does CarMax Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of CarMax have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including AutoZone  NYSE AZO   Caseys General Stores  CASY   and Costco Wholesale  COST   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 12  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CarMax  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/carmax-kmx-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200437093,200437093

Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One stock to keep an eye on is AutoZone  NYSE AZO   AZO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 16 88  which compares to its industry s average of 17 63  Over the last 12 months  AZO s Forward P E has been as high as 17 36 and as low as 12 02  with a median of 13 89 
Finally  we should also recognize that AZO has a P CF ratio of 15 32  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 23 14  Over the past year  AZO s P CF has been as high as 15 75 and as low as 10 61  with a median of 12 49

Looked at this way  the 2019 Q2 earnings season has officially gotten underway already  The fact is that by the time the big banks come around to report June quarter results on July 14th  we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S P 500 members already 
Expectations for 2019 Q2   Beyond
Tough comparisons to last year when growth was boosted by the tax cut legislation were all along expected to weigh on earnings growth in 2019  Moderating U S  economic growth and notable slowdowns in other major global economic regions are having a further negative impact  Uncertainty about the global trade regime and growing resort to tariffs are not helping matters either 
As a result  earnings were essentially flat in the first quarter of 2019 and no significant improvement is expected in the growth trajectory in the June quarter either  In fact  this trend of flat to negative growth is expected to persist through the September quarter  with current consensus estimates looking for positive growth resuming in the last quarter of the year   But Q4 is still far from away and a lot can happen between now and then 
The mid single digits earnings growth for the S P 500 index currently expected in Q4 is partly a function of the Tech sector stopping to become a drag on overall index growth  But the semiconductor space may have to endure further pain  as we saw with the Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   AVGO  report 
For the June quarter  the expectation currently is that earnings for the S P 500 index will decline by  3 1  from the same period last year on  4 3  higher revenues  with 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have negative earnings growth  including the Tech sector 
The overall tone and substance of management guidance during the last earnings season was on the negative side  This reflected a combination of slowing economic growth  particularly beyond the U S   and rising input expenses  As a result  analysts steadily lowered their estimates for 2019 Q2  as you can see in the chart below 
 
 
The weak guidance from Applied Materials suggests that we will likely see a replay of what we experienced in the last earnings season and that pushed estimates lower  We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q3 evolve as companies report Q2 results and share their outlook for Q3 and beyond 
The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture for the S P 500 index for Q2  contrasted with what was actually reported in the preceding 4 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 periods 
 
 
The table below shows the summary picture for 2019 Q2  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period 
 
 
The Tech Sector Drag
As you can see  growth is expected to be in negative territory for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Basic Materials  Aerospace  Technology  Conglomerates and Construction sectors expected to experience double digit declines 
It is the weak Tech growth that is dragging the aggregate Q2 earnings growth rate for the S P 500 index into negative territory  The Tech sector is the biggest earnings contributor in the S P 500 index  bringing in 22 6  of the index s total earnings in forward 4 quarter period  Excluding the Tech sector s drag  total earnings growth for the remainder of the index would be down only  0 5   
Driving the Tech sector s weak earnings growth expectation for the quarter is Apple  AAPL  and the broader semiconductor space  For Apple  June quarter earnings are expected to be down  16 2  on  0 4  higher revenues  The table below shows the Q2 expectations for the constituent medium level industries in the Tech sector  with total Q2 earnings for the semiconductor space expected to be down  36 2  from the same period last year on  14  lower revenues 
 
 
The expectation is that the semiconductor industry s earnings declines bottom in Q2 and start improving from Q3 onwards 
The chart below reflects this expectation  though the fallout of the Huawei issue could be a lot more painful for the space than current estimates suggest  as Applied Materials  guidance showed

28023,249538,AZO,Casey s  CASY  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Caseys General Stores  CASY   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 19 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  156 82 in the previous session  Caseys General Stores has gained 21 7  since the start of the year compared to the 17 9  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 20 5  return for the Zacks Retail   Convenience Stores industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 10  2019  Casey s reported EPS of  0 68 versus consensus estimate of  0 42 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 15  
For the current fiscal year  Casey s is expected to post earnings of  5 82 per share on  9 8 billion in revenues  This represents a 5 63  change in EPS on a 4 81  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 19 per share on  10 7 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 29  and 9 12   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Casey s may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Casey s has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 26 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 12 7X versus its peer group s average of 7 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 86  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Casey s currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Casey s meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Casey s shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Casey s Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Casey s have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including IAC InterActiveCorp  IAC   MercadoLibre  MELI   and AutoZone  NYSE AZO   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 1  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Casey s  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/caseys-casy-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200436126,200436126

28056,249571,AZO,Top Research Reports For Mastercard  Disney   Abbott ,opinion,"Friday  June 7  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Mastercard  MA   Disney  DIS  and Abbott  ABT   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Mastercard s shares have increased  28 9  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry s rally of  17 3   The Zacks analyst thinks the company is poised for growth  given its solid market position  ongoing expansion and digital initiatives  and opportunities from the shift toward electronic payments  Its numerous acquisitions have aided revenue growth 
For several quarters now  the company has been gaining from higher switched transactions  increase in cross border volumes and gross dollar volumes  and gains from acquisitions  partly offset by an increase in rebates and incentives  However  escalating costs will weigh on margins 
Also  in order to gain customers and more business  Mastercard has been incurring quite a high level of cost in terms of rebates and incentives  which remains a concern  However  its strong balance sheet enables business investment  thereby driving growth 
 You can   
Shares of Disney have gained  25 5  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry s gain of  22 3  during the same period  The company s top line in the near term is expected to benefit from the solid performance of Avengers  Endgame  Currently  the film holds the record for the fastest earning  1 billion film globally  beating Avengers  Infinity War s record  
The Zacks analyst thinks Disney is likely to benefit from the strong adoption of ESPN   Further  Disney   to be launched this November   which will be supported by Disney and Fox s content  may give tough competition to Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   
But increasing investments in ESPN  and Disney  and losses from streaming technology services are expected to hurt margins  Higher programming costs at ESPN due to increase in contractual rates for a few sports programs may keep profits under pressure 
 You can   
Abbott s shares have gained  26 6  over the past year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has increased  2 2  over the same period  Abbott exited first quarter 2019 with better than expected earnings and revenues figures 
The Zacks analyst likes the company s strong and consistent performance by the company s EPD and Medical Devices segments on an organic basis  The company has been hogging the limelight within Diabetic Care on the growth it has enjoyed with FreeStyle Libre  Within Structural Heart  worldwide strong uptake of MitraClip has improved further following the FDA approval of its upgraded version  
This apart  synergies from Alere consolidation in the form of revenues from Rapid Diagnostics have been driving growth  On the flip side  sluggish Rhythm Management arm in the United States is denting growth  Increasing currency headwinds has somewhat dented Abbott s international performance in the past reported quarter

28198,249713,AZO,Stocks   Dow Plummets as Trade War Boogeyman Returns to Spook Investors,news,"Investing com   The stock market plunged Tuesday as President Donald Trump fueled trade war jitters and a slump in longer term U S  bond yields wreaked havoc on the bank stocks 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 1   The S P 500 fell 3 24   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3 8  
Trump unleashed a tweetstorm Tuesday  saying he would  happily sign  a fair trade deal with China  but referred to himself as a  Tariff Man   sending a stark reminder that U S  China trade relations remain vulnerable 
Trade sensitive stocks like industrials wiped gains from a day earlier as investors questioned whether Trump s trade advisors  led by Robert Lighthizer  could achieve anything in the 90 day ceasefire agreed by Trump and China President Xi Jinping over the weekend 
 Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  and Boeing  NYSE BA   barometers of trade given their large international exposure  ended the day sharply lower 
Financials and tech  meanwhile  led the rout on Wall Street 
Short dated Treasury rates rose above longer dated rates  referred to as an inversion of the Treasury yield curve  a signal of a potential economic recession 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  fell 3 8  and  Citigroup   NYSE C  lost 4 4  
Inverted yields are seen as headwind for banks  weighing on their net interest margin  the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders 
The curve between three year and five year Treasury notes and between two year and five year notes inverted on Monday  the first parts of the Treasury yield curve to invert since the financial crisis  excluding very short dated debt 
Analysts expect the two year  10 year yield curve    seen as a possible precursor to a recession    to follow suit  The spread has already narrowed to its lowest in over a decade 
 While interest rate hikes have sent short dated yields higher  tepid inflation and slowing economic growth expectations have kept longer dated yields pinned down   said Michael O Rourke  chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich  Connecticut 
 Right now it s a bearish sentiment  As soon as investors digested the information from the discussions  they focused on the uncertainties and lack of details   Ryan Nauman  market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove  Nevada said

Besides trade  there will also be important testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  who appears Tuesday and Wednesday before congressional panels on the economy and monetary policy 
Several important economic reports also expected  with fourth quarter GDP  which was delayed because of the 35 day government shutdown  topping the list 
The week ahead also marks the last big week of the fourth quarter earnings season on Wall Street  with names like  Home Depot   NYSE HD  and Macy s  NYSE M  set to report 
A summit between U S  President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday and Thursday in Vietnam will also be on the agenda 
Elsewhere  in Europe  market players will focus on flash euro zone inflation figures  which may shed further light on the European Central Bank s monetary policy outlook 
Brexit will also occupy minds as U K  Prime Minister Theresa May faces another parliamentary vote on the exit deal she agreed with the European Union last year 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  U S  China Trade Deadline 
U S  and Chinese negotiators will meet again in Washington on Sunday  the sixth straight day of talks between the world s two biggest economies  as they race to seal an agreement before a March 1 deadline imposed by President Trump 
An industry source briefed on the talks said both sides have narrowed their differences on intellectual property rights  market access and narrowing a nearly  400 billion U S  trade deficit with China  But bigger differences remain on changes to China s treatment of state owned enterprises  subsidies  forced technology transfers and cyber theft 
The Chinese delegation is scheduled to leave for Beijing on Monday  according to a person familiar with their itinerary 
Trump said on Friday there was  a very good chance  a deal would be struck  and that he was inclined to extend his March 1 tariff deadline and meet soon with Chinese President Xi Jinping 
2  Fed Chair Powell Testifies
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will deliver his semi annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC 
Powell is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 00AM ET  15 00 GMT  Tuesday  On Wednesday  he will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee  also at 10AM ET 
Powell s comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on his views on the economy and how that can affect monetary policy in the months ahead 
After the Fed hiked rates four times in 2018  investors now expect the U S  central bank to halt its monetary tightening policy this year as risks to the U S  economy mount 
3  U S  Advanced 4Q GDP
Investors will keep an eye on a preliminary reading of fourth quarter U S  growth due at 8 30AM ET  13 30 GMT  on Thursday for fresh clues on the strength of the economy 
The data  which was originally scheduled for Jan  30 but delayed by the government shutdown  is expected to show the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 4  in the last three months of 2018  cooling from growth of 3 4  in the preceding quarter 
This week s calendar also features data on personal income and spending  which includes personal consumption expenditures  PCE  inflation figures  the Fed s preferred metric for inflation 
Other top tier economic data due this week includes the CB consumer confidence report  as well as the latest ISM survey on service sector activity 
4  Retailers Highlight Last Big Week of Earnings
While just 13 S P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week  retailers are just getting started in what will be the last big wave of the fourth quarter earnings season 
Home Depot and Macy s unofficially kicks things off when they both report on Tuesday  results from Lowe s  NYSE LOW   TJX  NYSE TJX   L Brands  NYSE LB   and  Best Buy   NYSE BBY  are on the agenda for Wednesday  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JCPenney  NYSE JCP  and Gap  NYSE GPS  post results Thursday  while  Foot Locker   NYSE FL  is on tap for Friday morning

5  Euro Zone Flash Inflation
The euro zone will publish flash inflation figures for February at 5 00AM ET  10 00 GMT  on Friday 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show consumer prices rose 1 5   a tad quicker than the 1 4  increase a month earlier  but remaining short of the European Central Bank s target of just below 2  
Perhaps more significantly  the core figure  without volatile energy and food prices  is seen holding steady at 1 1   unchanged from the preceding month 
Germany  France  Italy and Spain will produce their own CPI reports throughout the week 
The ECB last month acknowledged that growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than previously expected  although it stuck to its guidance that it intends to raise interest rates later this year for the first time in a decade

Investors are also hoping to get a better idea of the Fed s plan for shrinking its balance sheet 
The U S  central bank  in its accompanying semi annual Monetary Policy Report sent to Congress late last week  described a U S  economy that was doing well on many fronts  but facing weaker growth in the year to come and a number of intensifying risks

5  May to Rule Out No Deal Brexit

The pound jumped 0 8  to  1 3202  GBP USD   a level last seen on Jan  28 
U K  Prime Minister Theresa May will propose formally ruling out a no deal Brexit at a crunch cabinet meeting later in the day  The Sun newspaper reported 
That news follows a move by the opposition Labour Party last night to back a second referendum on Brexit if no parliamentary majority can be found for a withdrawal agreement that would ensure a smooth transition to life outside the European Union 
The news was a relief to investors who had feared Britain would crash out of the EU without a deal

28213,249728,AZO,Fastenal  FAST  Q1 Earnings  Can Solid Sales Ease Margin Woes ,opinion,Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 11  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  That said  it surpassed the consensus mark in two of the trailing four quarters  while met the same twice  with average positive earnings surprise of 3 8  Notably  fourth quarter 2018 earnings and revenues recorded an improvement of 34 9  and 13 2   respectively  courtesy of accelerated growth across its non residential and construction sections of the business Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise   How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at 66 cents  remaining unchanged over the past 60 days  Nonetheless  this reflects an increase of 8 2  from the year ago earnings of 61 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  1 3 billion  up 9 6  year over year Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key FactorsSolid underlying industrial market demand and growth in core product offerings like Onsite Locations vending machines managed inventory are expected to benefit Fastenal in the first quarter of 2019 Higher End Market Demand  Robust construction market  especially the non residential one  has been acting as a major tailwind for Fastenal s performance over the last few quarters  The company s sales grew 13 2  year over year in fourth quarter 2018  marking the sixth straight quarter of at least 13  growth  Non residential construction grew 14 8  and manufacturing increased 13 3  during the quarter Vending Machines to Drive Growth  Over the last few quarters  Fastenal s sales have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines  Sales through vending devices continued to grow at a double digit pace  primarily due to higher installed base  Moreover  Fastenal s signings of industrial vending devices grew 13 6  year over year in 2018 and increased 16 7  in the fourth quarter Onsite Locations to Boost Sales  A consistent increase in the number of on site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal s market share and boost quarterly numbers  As of Dec 31  2018  it had 894 active sites  up 47 8  from a year ago  The increased number of onsite locations is likely to expand Fastenal s market share  The trend is expected to continue in first quarter 2019 as well  The company aims at achieving 375 400 onsite signings in 2019  reflecting an increase from 336 signings a year ago In a nutshell  sustained strength in most of its end markets  and strong momentum in vending machine installations and onsite locations are likely to support top  and bottom line growth in the to be reported quarter However  increased product costs  higher freight expenses  and changes in product and customer mix have been impacting its gross margins for quite some time now Gross Margin Pressure  Fastenal s changes in product and customer mix have been hurting gross margin for quite some time now  In 2018  gross margins contracted 100 basis points year over year mainly due to product and customer mix  as well as freight inflation Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Our proven model does not suggest that Fastenal is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for the company is 0 00  as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 66 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Fastenal currently has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions You can see  Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Zacks  sector  which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarters to be reported The Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD   has an Earnings ESP of  0 62  and a Zacks Rank  3 AutoZone  Inc    NYSE AZO   has an Earnings ESP of  2 49  and holds a Zacks Rank  2 Advance Auto Parts  Inc    NYSE AAP   has an Earnings ESP of  3

28215,249730,AZO,U S  value stocks capitalize on  FANG  stumbles  with room to run,news,"By James Thorne
NEW YORK  Reuters    The summer roller coaster in two of the four big cap  FANG  names    Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  and Google parent Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc   has led to a shift  albeit slight  into value stocks 
In the last four weeks  the Russell 1000 Value Index has outperformed its growth counterpart by the largest monthly margin since September 2017  thanks in part to stumbles in Facebook and Netflix shares that stemmed from slowing user growth  Moreover  disappointing second quarter results have reignited fears the tech giants  which have been responsible for much of the equity market s gains this year  are becoming vulnerable 
Funds that follow a value investing strategy attracted  791 million in July and August  reversing a trend in the first half of the year  when investors withdrew  4 9 billion from such funds  according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data 
 The  economic  outlook is significantly better than it was six months ago  and yet stock prices haven t gone up very much  As a result  there are more value opportunities   said Charlie Bobrinskoy  vice chairman at Ariel Investments in Chicago 
Value stocks are even more attractive on a relative basis  fund managers said  The gap between forward price to earnings ratios for the two categories has swelled to the widest level in the past 15 years  Reuters data showed 
 You re starting to see the market differentiate   said Drew Wilson  investment research analyst at Fenimore Asset Management in Cobleskill  New York 
The growing difference in earnings multiples gives buyers of value stocks an added margin of safety  which was rare when they were tighter  Wilson said 
Value investors also say undervalued companies can be found in sectors such as energy  healthcare and financials 
 If you re trying to find companies that are trading for less than 15 times earnings or less than two times book value  you end up with a lot of banks and a fair number of insurance companies as well   said Bobrinskoy 
Fenimore s Wilson has been taking advantage of value stocks that have come under selling pressure in the wake of threats from disruptive companies like Amazon com 
 Any time Amazon even looks the way of an industry  it sells off   he said  Wilson said he has found buying opportunities in companies pressured by the online retail giant  such as  Dollar General Corp   NYSE DG  and AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO   which have shown resilience to such competition 
Strategists said macroeconomic trends have also lined up to give value a boost 
Higher levels of gross domestic product growth and more widely shared earnings growth among companies should help value stocks  said Steven DeSanctis  SMID cap strategist at Jefferies in New York 
DeSanctis said he expects value to outperform growth in the second half of 2018 
Rising interest rates likewise aid many value stocks that languished in the slow growth  low yield environment of years past that favored growth oriented companies  said Charlie McElligott  head of cross asset macro strategy at Nomura 
Mutual fund managers who adhere to a value strategy said they were cautiously hopeful that a rotation was in its early stages 
Investors have pulled cash from value oriented mutual funds for seven of the past 10 years  chasing gains by growth stocks and shifting to lower cost exchange traded funds  according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper 
More than twice as many value funds have closed than have launched during that period  Lipper said 
Value stocks  however  tend to outperform growth over the long term  prompting many to wonder how long the current rout can last 
 These style cycles tend to come and go   said Aaron Anderson  senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments in Woodside  California

With President Donald Trump slapping tariffs on items like car gaskets and ignition wiring sets in July  American buyers of the company s LED car lights pushed hard over the summer to get their orders delivered early in case they got caught up in the next salvo  Now  with the U S  poised to target another  200 billion of Chinese goods as soon as this week    including the car lights made by E D  Opto    export manager Melissa Shu wonders what s going to happen to the business 
 If the tariffs are implemented  we ll have trouble selling our products   Shu said   Customers might ask us to reduce our prices but the cost of raw materials has been soaring  
As relations between the U S  and China deteriorate  small suppliers like the car light manufacturer and their U S  customers are being caught in the middle  Auto parts makers were already grappling with spikes in the cost of steel and aluminum  and now the trade war is threatening to upend an industry that s become increasingly dependent on the U S  China s exports of auto parts to the U S  increased almost 18 percent between 2012 and 2017 to hit  17 6 billion last year  according to data from the U S  Commerce Department 
Companies such as E D  Opto  which has only 125 employees and exported about 50 million yuan   7 3 million  in parts last year  are in the direct line of fire  Further down the supply chain  David Ni s company buys aluminum alloy wheels from Chinese makers and exports them to retail outlets in the U S  He s weighing whether to give up some of its thin profit margin to hold onto customers  The company will likely raise its prices as much as 5 percent at the same time 
 The U S  is the largest auto after market in the world   said Ni  chief executive officer of Jiangsu Siborui Import and Export Co   which employs 30 with  3 million in sales   It s irreplaceable  
The company also began operating a US subsidiary in Anaheim  California last year  The company s wheels are premium items  and Ni said he fears that tariffs will curb demand for them 
Many auto parts come from the small and medium sized enterprises that have been the backbone of China s industrial ascent and are the workshops of the global manufacturing supply chain  Small and medium sized businesses account for more than 60 percent of China s gross domestic product and private enterprises  mostly SMEs  made up 47 percent of exports in 2017  according to government data 
Growth at Risk
Before talk of a trade war started  Chinese auto parts makers exporting to the U S  had reason to be optimistic about 2018  They exported about  9 8 billion to American customers in the first six months of the year  almost 13 percent more than the same period a year earlier  according to U S  Commerce Department data 
Now that growth is at risk  Windshield wipers  bumpers  mufflers and car seats are among the list of products published by U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in early July that the U S  plans to penalize next 
That s bad news for the Chinese producers  who can do little to stave off an increase in costs for buyers  Janny Zhou is an export manager at a Chinese maker of auto engine parts with 200 employees in the eastern city of Taizhou  Most of Zhou s U S  customers who usually place recurring orders every month didn t put in for deliveries in August  she said  That s added more pressure  as the company is already facing higher tariffs on some of its products that were targeted in the first round of U S  levies 
 We haven t heard from practically any of our clients   said Zhou  whose customers include large auto parts retailers in the U S  She declined to name them or her company because of confidentiality agreements   We re afraid to rush them for a decision since we can t offer any discounts  
U S  Buyers
The problem for U S  buyers    companies like AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO   and Advance Auto Parts Inc     needing to source cheap  high quality parts is that many of the Chinese suppliers may also be hard to replace  Buyers have often spent years developing supply chains of reliable manufacturers that can meet quality controls and shipment schedules 
Still  some customers in the U S  are trying to look for alternative suppliers  Hopkins Manufacturing Corp   a supplier of aftermarket auto parts based in Emporia  Kansas  sources from about 45 Chinese factories but is considering using suppliers in Taiwan instead  its chief executive officer Brad Kraft told Bloomberg News in August 
At E D  Opto Electrical Lighting  export manager Shu said she s concerned that as the trade war drags on between the world s two biggest economies  the relationships that her company took years to build may be destroyed forever 
 Buyers might not return   she said ",2018-09-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trumps-trade-war-with-china-may-hit-parts-of-your-car-first-1596054,1596054

28219,249734,AZO,Stocks   S P Closes Flat as Fed Minutes  Energy Weigh,news,"Investing com   The S P 500 closed flat on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve s minutes pointed to further monetary tightening  while a slump in oil prices pressured energy stocks 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0 36   The S P 500 fell 0 03   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0 04  
Wall Street s attempt to extend its rally following its biggest one day gain since March on Tuesday was undone by concerns that further Fed rate hikes could fuel a rally in U S  government bond yields  denting investor appetite for risker assets like stocks 
The Federal Reserve s minutes showed that members remained committed to gradually raising interest rates as the economy was on pace to churn out  strong  growth in the third quarter of the year 
U S  government bond yields surged following the release of the Fed s minutes as the 10 year Treasury note yield hit session highs 
Mostly upbeat corporate earnings  which have helped shift investor focus away from rising bond yields to corporate fundamentals  helped offset losses somewhat in the broader averages 
Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  posted third quarter earnings postmarket Tuesday that handily beat expectations  as subscriber numbers came in well above analysts  estimates amid strong growth in both U S  and overseas markets  Its stock closed 5 3  higher 
M T Bank  NYSE MTB  and US Bancorp  NYSE USB  results also topped estimates  adding to a recent wave of bullish earnings from banks  triggering broad based gains across financials 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   both of which reported above forecast earnings and revenue on Tuesday  rose nearly 3  
But a weaker than expected report from  IBM   NYSE IBM  saw its stock spiral 7 6  lower as the company struggled to maintain revenue growth  though its earnings came in above Wall Street s estimates 
Falling energy stocks inflicted much of the damage on the broader averages owing to a slump in oil prices after data showed a larger than expected build in domestic oil supplies 
The yo yo day of trade on Wall Street  which was characterized by violent swings in both directions  was not helped by soft housing data  triggering a slump in homebuilders 
The Commerce Department said Wednesday U S  homebuilding fell 5 3  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 201 million units in September  Building permits fell 0 6  to a rate of 1 241 million units 
Shares of  Lennar   NYSE LEN   KB Home  NYSE KBH  and DR Horton  NYSE DHI  slumped more than 2

28251,249766,AZO,Retail Sales Witness Largest Increase In 18 Months  5 Picks ,opinion,In March  retail sales rebounded strongly from the decline suffered in the previous month  This latest release from the U S  Census Bureau added to the series of economic reports  which indicate that the economy is gathering steam after a soft start to the year  Gains were led by autos  gas stations  apparel stores and home furnishing outlets Meanwhile  jobless claims for the week ended Apr 13 plunged to their lowest level since September 1969  defying most expectations  It is quite clear that a robust job market and a pickup in wage growth are fueling a rise in consumer spending  This is why it makes sense to invest in those categories that are the primary catalysts for the rebound in retail sales Spike in Gas Prices Boost Receipts at Gas StationsRetail sales for March increased by 1 6   the sharpest gain registered since September 2017  This was significantly higher than the consensus estimate of an increase of 0 9  and represents a rebound from February s decline of 0 2   Gains for the month were led by gas stations  where receipts climbed by 3 5  Spending at gas stations increased after the average price of gas climbed 10  across the country in March to  2 62 a gallon  per government data  These are the highest prices experienced since last November Autos  Furniture  Apparel Lead GainsOther major gainers include motor vehicles and parts dealers  Sales of automobiles and related parts increased by 3 1   the highest gain registered so far this year  This was the primary driver of the headline number since auto receipts make up nearly 20  of all retail sales Other major gainers for the month were furniture and home furnishing stores  and clothing and accessories stores  sales at which increased by 1 7  and 2   respectively  While department store sales remained flat  sales at nonstore retailers  which include online retailers  increased by 1 2  Robust Labor Market  Wage Gains Fuel Spending Meanwhile  a report from the Department of Labor revealed that jobless claims for the week ended Apr 13 declined by 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted level of 192 000  This is the lowest level recorded in nearly 50 years and a drastic departure from the consensus estimate for an increase to 206 000  The metric has now moved lower for five successive weeks  This gives credence to the view that a robust labor market is boosting wage growth  which in turn is raising American purchasing power In March  average hourly earnings increased 4 cents to  27 70  The year over year increase in earnings declined from 3 4  to 3 2   But even then  wages continue to increase at their fastest pace in a decade   Read   Our ChoicesMarch s retail sales provide fresh evidence that the U S  economy is gathering momentum as the year progresses  Category wide gains testify to a significant improvement in economic conditions Meanwhile  the recent plunge in jobless claims indicates that a robust labor market and jobless claims are boosting purchasing power  Investing in retail categories  which led gains in March  looks prudent  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our

28253,249768,AZO,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Yield Curve Inversion Sending Bearish Signals 
The economic data calendar is pretty empty tomorrow  but there will be plenty of chatter about interest rates after part of the yield curve inverted today 
A yield curve inversion is when the shorter dated bond yields rise above the longer term yields 
When this happens with Treasuries  many see it as a sign of an approaching recession  with traders betting that rates will be lower due to economic weakness down the line 
The yield on the 5 year Treasury fell below the yield of the 3 year Treasury today  something that hasn t happened since 2007 
The 3 Year yield stood at 2 841  at the time of writing  with the 5 Year at 2 831   The spread between the 2 year and the 10 year was also at an 11 year low 



2  AutoZone  Dollar General Set to Report Earnings
Retail earnings are still trickling in  with AutoZone  NYSE AZO  reporting before the bell tomorrow 
Shares are higher over the last three months  with the auto parts retailer recovering from a hit it took in mid October when rival  Advance Auto Parts   NYSE AAP  said it was teaming up with Walmart  NYSE WMT  
On average  analysts a predicting a profit of  12 21 per share on sales of  2 6 billion 
Dollar General  NYSE DG  will also weigh in  looking to repeat the solid performance of competitor Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  recently 
The Wall Street forecast is for  1 27 a share on sales of about  6 4 billion 
3  Can Oil Continue Its Rally 
The oil market promises to be active again as traders continue to analyze how U S  and China trade negotiations will impact demand and the possibility of supply cuts from OPEC and Russia 
Oil prices jumped today  helped by Canada surprising the market with a commitment to reduce output with crude prices struggling 
OPEC will meet in Vienna on Thursday  with Russia also expected to be in the discussion  Also that day  the latest U S  oil inventories numbers will released  a day later than usual with the federal government closed on Wednesday in honor of the late President George H W  Bush 
 Admittedly  the outcome of the OPEC meeting in Vienna is not a given   Goldman Sachs said in a note   Non core OPEC members  Iraq Iran  are likely to ask that the burden of the cut be footed by the countries that have most aggressively ramped up  Saudi UAE Kuwait   Further  we don t expect Russia to offer more than a token reduction from current production levels  ",2018-12-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1709107,1709107

28322,249837,AZO,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why AutoZone  AZO  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at AutoZone  NYSE AZO   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AZO that show why this auto parts retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For AZO  shares are up 4 37  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry is up 3 32  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 37  compares favorably with the industry s 9 99  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of AutoZone have increased 25 22  over the past quarter  and have gained 67 94  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 14 85  and 10 65   respectively 
Investors should also take note of AZO s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  AZO is averaging 306 675 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with AZO 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AZO s consensus estimate  increasing from  59 55 to  61 44 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that AZO is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep AutoZone on your short list ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-autozone-azo-is-a-great-choice-200403226,200403226

28324,249839,AZO,Is February Retail Sales Spooking You  Play These 4 ETF Areas ,opinion,"After rising 0 7  in January  U S  retail sales dropped 0 2  in February  The reading lagged analysts  expectations of a 0 3  increase  Reduced purchase of building materials  furniture  clothing  food  electronics and appliances as well as gardening equipment led to the sudden decline  read    
Sales at building material stores dropped 4 4   the steepest   Sales at food and beverage stores declined the maximum since February 2009  down 1 2  versus a rise of 1 4   and those at electronics and appliances stores posted the largest decline since May 2017  down 1 3  versus a 0 6  uptick  
Waning benefits from  1 5 trillion in tax cuts and increased government spending seem to have weighed on retail sales in February    the surprise decline in February sales can be blamed on delays in processing tax refunds in the middle of the month  Tax refunds have also been lower on average compared with the prior years due to the tax reform in January 2018  Inclement weather conditions are other reasons for the slack in sales 
Barring automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  retail sales dropped 0 2  in February  after an upwardly revised 1 7  increase in January  On a year over year basis  retail sales increased 2 2  in March compared with a 2 8  rise in the prior month

28325,249840,AZO,AutoZone  AZO  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of AutoZone  NYSE AZO   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  1049 58 in the previous session  AutoZone has gained 24 7  since the start of the year compared to the 15 6  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 16 7  return for the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 26  2019  AutoZone reported EPS of  11 49 versus consensus estimate of  9 97 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 16  
For the current fiscal year  AutoZone is expected to post earnings of  61 7 per share on  11 8 billion in revenues  This represents a 22 57  change in EPS on a 5 16  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  64 81 per share on  12 05 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 5 03  and 2 14   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
AutoZone may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
AutoZone has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 16 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 15 9X versus its peer group s average of 16 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 41  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if AutoZone fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though AutoZone shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does AutoZone Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of AutoZone have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including CarMax  NYSE KMX   Costco Wholesale  COST   and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 10  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AutoZone  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autozone-azo-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200404000,200404000

28351,249866,AZO,China vows to hit back over U S  proposal for fresh tariffs,news,"By Tony Munroe and Eric Beech BEIJING WASHINGTON  Reuters    China accused the United States of bullying and warned it would hit back after the Trump administration raised the stakes in their trade dispute  threatening 10 percent tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese goods and rattling global markets  China s commerce ministry said on Wednesday it was  shocked  and would complain to the World Trade Organisation  but did not immediately say how Beijing would retaliate in the dispute between the world s two biggest economies  In a statement  it called the U S  actions  completely unacceptable   The Chinese foreign ministry said Washington s threats were  typical bullying  and described the dispute as a  fight between unilateralism and multilateralism    U S  officials on Tuesday issued a list of thousands of Chinese goods to be hit with the new tariffs  The top items by value were furniture at  29 billion of imports in 2017  network routers worth  23 billion last year and computer components to the value of  20 billion  The list is subject to a two month public comment period  Some U S  business groups and lawmakers from President Donald Trump s own Republican Party who support free trade were critical of the escalating tariffs  The Republican controlled Senate voted 88 11 in favor of a non binding resolution calling for Congress to have a role in implementing such tariffs  Republican U S  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said the U S  announcement  appears reckless and is not a targeted approach   Republican U S  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan accused China of unfair trade practices but added   I don t think tariffs are the right way to go   The U S  Chamber of Commerce has supported Trump s domestic tax cuts and efforts to reduce regulation of businesses  but does not back Trump s aggressive tariff policies   Tariffs are taxes  plain and simple  Imposing taxes on another  200 billion worth of products will raise the costs of every day goods for American families   a Chamber spokeswoman said  Among the potential ways Beijing could hit back are  qualitative measures   a threat that U S  businesses in China fear could mean anything from stepped up inspections to delays in investment approvals and even consumer boycotts  HOLDING UP LICENSES The Wall Street Journal  citing unnamed Chinese officials  said Beijing was considering holding up licenses for U S  companies  delaying approvals of mergers involving U S  firms and stepping up border inspections of American goods  China could also limit visits to the United States by Chinese tourists  a business that state media said is worth  115 billion  or shed some of its U S  Treasury holdings  Iris Pang  Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong  wrote in a note  The  200 billion far exceeds the total value of goods China imports from the United States  which means Beijing may need to think of creative ways to respond to such U S  measures  It also highlights how dependent U S  businesses and consumers are on Chinese goods  In Trump s first round of tariffs  China accounted for 20 percent of total U S  imports  meaning that substitutes were readily available  In this round  China accounted for more than half of the imports  There was a price to be paid by American companies as government policies legislated winners and losers   Home furnishing retailers are expected to be hit particularly hard because China supplies 65 percent of U S  furniture imports  according to analysts at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS    The prospect of a 10 percent tariff on Chinese furniture imports sent shares of online home store WayFair Inc  N W  down nearly 4 percent  while shares of Restoration Hardware  N RH  tumbled nearly 6 percent  Auto parts retailers  which would also be affected by the latest tariff threats the U S  lobbed at China  fell more steeply than the broader market  Shares of  Advance Auto Parts  Inc  N AAP  were down 1 6 percent   Autozone Inc   N AZO  fell 1 8 percent and O Reilly Automotive Inc  O ORLY  almost 2 percent  Investors fear an escalating Sino American trade war could hit global growth and damage sentiment  By early afternoon  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  was down 0 72 percent  the S P 500  SPX  was down 0 65 percent  and the Nasdaq was off 0 62 percent  The MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan  MIAPJ0000PUS  fell 1 12 percent  while the main indexes in Hong Kong  HSI  and Shanghai  SSEC  recovered somewhat after falling more than 2 percent  Trump has been following through on pledges he made during his 2016 presidential campaign to get tough on China  which he accuses of unfair trade practices including theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer that have led to a  375 billion U S  trade deficit with China  The U S  president has said he may ultimately impose tariffs on more than  500 billion worth of Chinese goods  roughly the total amount of U S  imports from China last year  The new list targets many more consumer goods than those covered under the tariffs imposed last week  raising the direct threat to consumers and retail firms and increasing the stakes for Republican U S  lawmakers facing elections in November  U S  financial analysts said Trump appeared to believe there was a political benefit to waging a trade war  although that could change quickly amid economic fallout  
 It is now much more likely that the dispute will continue for a prolonged period of time and that we will see ratcheting up of protectionist measures   said Elena Duggar  an associate managing director at Moody s  the credit rating agency ",2018-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-ramps-up-trade-row-with-china-threatens-new-tariffs-1524732,1524732
28359,249874,AZO,Republicans kill border tax  focus on corporate rate cuts,news,"By Ginger Gibson WASHINGTON  Reuters    A proposed border tax in the House of Representatives was killed on Thursday  bringing relief to retailers and other large importers whose profits faced threats and removing a hurdle that had kept negotiations on the long promised Republican overhaul of the U S  tax code from advancing  The border adjustment tax was part of a broad reform of the tax code being pushed by House Republican leaders  It was meant to discourage companies from manufacturing products overseas and then importing them into the United States for sale instead of producing goods in the U S   The tax would have generated roughly  1 trillion in revenue  allowing tax code writers to slash the corporate tax rate without increasing the nation s deficit  Removing the controversial provision could make it easier to pass tax legislation  but likely narrows the scope of what could become law  It suggests Republicans are more likely to implement simple rate cuts and not accomplish sweeping tax reform on the scale of the last major overhaul in 1986  such as moving to a territorial tax system  in which companies would pay tax only on profits earned in the United States  Without a new source of revenue  it will make it more difficult for Republicans to make tax code changes permanent and deficit neutral  The Republicans are looking to use rules that would require passage of a tax bill only with a simple majority   meaning they would not need any Democratic votes  Those rules restrict creating long term deficits  so if the bill is not deficit neutral the tax cuts would likely carry an expiration date  The group of six Republican negotiators working on tax reform on Thursday did not announce any agreement on their target for corporate rate cuts   a signal that tax lobbyists said shows continuing divisions among Republicans about the closely watched rate   Corporate profits are currently taxed at 35 percent  but President Donald Trump wants them slashed to 15 percent  which he says will promote business spending  economic growth and job creation    While we have debated the pro growth benefits of border adjustability  we appreciate that there are many unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this policy aside in order to advance tax reform   the  Big Six  Republican tax negotiators said in a joint statement  Large retailers and other importers had lobbied aggressively against the border tax proposal  including a coalition that included automakers like Toyota  T 7203  and stores like  Target   N TGT   Autozone  N AZO  and  Best Buy   N BBY   The retailers argued that the border tax would drastically increase consumer prices  hitting low  and middle class households the most  The Big Six is comprised of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn  the head of the National Economic Council   both representing Trump   House Speaker Paul Ryan  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the heads of the two tax writing committees in Congress  Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Kevin Brady  In addition to killing the border tax  the group offered other vague goals but no details  saying they remain committed to increased expensing for corporations  or allowing them to write off the cost of new equipment more quickly  and to return profits held by American companies overseas  known as repatriation  at a lower tax rate than the current 35 percent  The statement offered no specific goals or targets on the personal income tax code   We have always been in agreement that tax relief for American families should be at the heart of our plan   the Big Six said  Trump has vowed to finish a tax overhaul by the end of this year  Republicans leaders in Congress are hopeful that the current debate on repealing and replacing Obamacare  which is now before the Senate  can be completed quickly  allowing Congress to then turn its attention to the tax code  The U S  Chamber of Commerce praised the announcement as progress toward an ultimate goal of overhauling the code   
 We re pleased  but we re not satisfied until we get an outcome   said Neil Bradley  the head of policy for the business group ",2017-07-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/republican-leaders-announce-end-of-border-tax-proposal-511187,511187
28361,249876,AZO,AutoZone  AZO  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of AutoZone  NYSE AZO   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  984 73 in the previous session  AutoZone has gained 16 4  since the start of the year compared to the 14  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 8 3  return for the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 26  2019  AutoZone reported EPS of  11 49 versus consensus estimate of  9 97 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 16  
For the current fiscal year  AutoZone is expected to post earnings of  61 44 per share on  11 8 billion in revenues  This represents a 22 05  change in EPS on a 5 12  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  64 88 per share on  12 06 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 5 59  and 2 23   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
AutoZone may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
AutoZone has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 15 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 9X versus its peer group s average of 15 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 32  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if AutoZone meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though AutoZone shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does AutoZone Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of AutoZone have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Tech Data  TECD   ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS  ASOMY   and Restoration Hardware Holdings  RH   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 42  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AutoZone  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-03-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autozone-azo-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200398983,200398983
28362,249877,AZO,Should Xtrackers Russell 1000 Comprehensive Factor ETF  DEUS  Be On Your Investing Radar ,opinion,"Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market  You should consider the Xtrackers Russell 1000 Comprehensive Factor ETF  DEUS   a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 11 24 2015 
The fund is sponsored by Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   It has amassed assets over  200 88 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market 
Why Large Cap Blend
Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above  10 billion  Overall  they are usually a stable option  with less risk and more sure fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies 
Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks  blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments 
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds  assuming all other factors remain equal  it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF s expense ratio 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 17   making it one of the cheaper products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 1 84  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  a deep look into a fund s holdings is a valuable exercise  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
Looking at individual holdings  Target Corp  TGT  accounts for about 0 88  of total assets  followed by Autozone Inc  AZO  and Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI N  
The top 10 holdings account for about 6 61  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
DEUS seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Comprehensive Factor Index before fees and expenses  The Russell 1000 Comprehensive Factor Index provides exposure to domestic equities based on five factors Quality  Value  Momentum  Low Volatility and Size 
The ETF has added about 13 32  so far this year and is up about 0 97  in the last one year  as of 03 19 2019   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  27 13 and  34 12 
The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 11 42  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 831 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
Xtrackers Russell 1000 Comprehensive Factor ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3  Hold   which is based on expected asset class return  expense ratio  and momentum  among other factors  Thus  DEUS is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box   Large Cap Blend area of the market  Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space 
The iShares Core S P 500 ETF  IVV  and the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  track a similar index  While iShares Core S P 500 ETF has  169 66 B in assets  SPDR S P 500 ETF has  264 B  IVV has an expense ratio of 0 04  and SPY charges 0 09  
Bottom Line
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors  passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs  transparency  flexibility  and tax efficiency

28388,249903,AZO,5 Value Stocks With Impressive PEG Ratio,opinion,Value investing is gaining popularity by the day  The success of value investors like Warren Buffett further underscores this  According to an article by Rajiv Bhuva  Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger have managed to drive 20 9  compound annual growth in the market value of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  from 1965 to 2017  Book value per share rose at a CAGR of 19 1   from  19 to  211 750 in these 53 years However  this apparently simple to understand investing discipline has its own share of pitfalls  Value investors often miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  In their quest for cheaper stocks  they often end up picking stocks that have weak prospects Buffett believes that proper understanding of the  intrinsic value  of a stock may ease out many problems with regard to value investment  According to him  going by the fundamentals of value investing  while picking undervalued stocks  investors need to focus on the stocks  earnings growth potential While yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings  sales or book value are the most common value investing metrics that can single out stocks trading at a discount  these ratios fail to consider the potential of a stock  PEG is the ratio with the earnings growth component in it The PEG ratio is defined as   Price Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth  followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than M Industry Median  for more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five out of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS    It is one of the leading global food companies  Its brands include Cheerios  Annie s  Yoplait  Nature Valley  H agen Dazs  Betty Crocker  Pillsbury  Old El Paso  Wanchai Ferry  Yoki  Blue and more  The stock can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  2 and Value Score of A  The company s long term historical earnings growth rate is 7 3  Career Education Corporation   NASDAQ CECO    The company owns academic institutions that offer quality education to a diverse student population in a variety of disciplines through online  campus based and blended learning programs  Apart from a Zacks Rank  2 and a Value Score of B  the stock has an impressive long term expected growth rate of 12 5  AutoZone  Inc    NYSE AZO    This is one of the nation s leading specialty retailers of automotive replacement parts and accessories  operating in the Do It Yourself  DIY  retail  Do It for Me  DIFM  auto parts and products markets  The stock can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  2 and Value Score of B  Apart from a discounted PEG and P E  the stock has a stellar long term expected growth rate of 12  Tenet Healthcare Corporation   NYSE THC    It is a diversified healthcare services company  Through its subsidiaries  partnerships and joint ventures  including United Surgical Partners International  the company operates general acute care and specialty hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers  urgent care centers and other outpatient facilities  The stock has an impressive expected growth rate of 30 7  for the current fiscal  It has a Value Score of A and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see ProPetro Holding Corp    NYSE PUMP    This is an oilfield services company providing pressure pumping and other complementary services to leading upstream oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration and production of North American unconventional oil and natural gas resources  It has a Value Score of B and carries a Zacks Rank  2 Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start

Phillips 66 is strongly committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases  However  Phillips 66 is bearing the brunt of increasing turnaround costs  which is hurting its refining business  Moreover  lower crack spread   the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel   is denting cash flow at its refining unit

We are still a few weeks away from big bank earnings results that now serve as the unofficial starting point of the reporting cycle since Alcoa  NYSE AA  relinquished that role following its split  Officially  however  the reporting cycle got underway with the Costco  COST   AutoZone  NYSE AZO   AZO   FedEx  FDX  and other reports 
Costco  AutoZone and a number of other major players on deck to report results in the next few days use fiscal quarters that end in February  All of these February quarter reports get counted as part of our Q1 tally  We will have seen such Q1 results from almost two dozen S P 500 members by the time JPMorgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC  kick off the earnings season on April 12th 
Estimates for the period have been steadily coming down  as the chart below of Q1 earnings growth expectations show 
 
 
This is only an estimate at this stage and actual March quarter earnings growth could very well be in positive territory  But it nevertheless shows that the growth picture will be a lot more challenged and problematic in the coming quarters  The chart below of quarterly earnings and revenue growth shows this picture 
 
 
The very strong growth we experienced in 2018 was primarily because of the tax cut legislation that was enacted towards the end of 2017  The pure arithmetic of the lower corporate tax rate represented a one time boost to corporate bottom lines that will be part of base comparisons for this year  On top of this comparability issue is the impact of slowing economic growth  particularly beyond the U S  shores 
Recent revisions trend shows that these low growth expectations for the coming quarters still remain vulnerable to further downward revisions  In other words  it is reasonable for market participants to nurse some doubts about the current earnings backdrop

This is only an estimate at this stage and actual March quarter earnings growth could very well be in positive territory  But it nevertheless shows that the growth picture will be a lot more challenged and problematic in the coming quarters 
The very strong growth we experienced in 2018 was primarily because of the tax cut legislation that was enacted towards the end of 2017  The pure arithmetic of the lower corporate tax rate represented a one time boost to corporate bottom lines that will be part of base comparisons for this year  On top of this comparability issue is the impact of slowing economic growth  particularly beyond the U S  shores 
Recent revisions trend shows that these low growth expectations for the coming quarters still remain vulnerable to further downward revisions  In other words  it is reasonable for market participants to nurse some doubts about the current earnings backdrop

28434,249949,AZO,Slow flow of U S  tax refunds getting back on track,news,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The flow of income tax refunds to U S  consumers is getting back on track following a slow start this year that has had some retail chains worried about spending 
As of Feb  24  the Internal Revenue Service has sent out  127 billion in tax refunds  10 percent less than the  142 billion paid at the same time last year  according to newly released IRS data 
Due to legal changes  income tax return filings and refunds got off to a slow start  raising concerns that consumers might have less money to spend at retailers already struggling with dwindling mall traffic and harsh competition from Amazon com  O AMZN  
Income tax refunds  which last year totaled  265 billion  represent a chance for many consumers to buy appliances  do overdue car maintenance or pay down credit cards 
Behind the delay is a new law requiring the IRS to wait until Feb 15 to issue refunds related to some kinds of tax credits 
In early February  tax refunds had amounted to just 31 percent of what the IRS had sent out by the same time in 2016 
Employers typically pay income taxes to the IRS on behalf of their employees  Often  the amount paid is more than the employee owes after tax deductions are taken into account 
After  Best Buy   N BBY  reported weak December quarter results on Wednesday  Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry said on a conference call that delayed tax refunds have hurt demand for TVs and computers 
Even without the delayed tax refunds  many U S  retailers are finding it hard to attract consumers who remain cautious about the slow pace of economic growth 
Shares of Macy s  N M  are down 8 percent in 2017 and Nordstrom  N JWN  has fallen 6 percent 
Of U S  consumers expecting a tax refund  30 percent plan to spend their money to buy everyday  or big ticket products  down from 32 percent last year  according to the National Retail Federation survey  It found that people mostly planned to save their refunds or pay down debt 
Car parts retailer Autozone  N AZO  on Tuesday blamed the slow flow of tax returns for quarterly sales that missed analysts  estimates  but it said it expects to benefit as people eventually receive their refunds 
 We expect performance to improve in Q3 if for no other reason than the shift in timing of income tax refunds   CEO Bill Rhodes told analysts on a conference call ",2017-03-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/slow-flow-of-u.s.-tax-refunds-getting-back-on-track-463118,463118

28518,250033,AZO,Will AutoZone  AZO  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  AutoZone  NYSE AZO   which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This auto parts retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 01  
For the most recent quarter  AutoZone was expected to post earnings of  12 21 per share  but it reported  13 47 per share instead  representing a surprise of 10 32   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  17 88 per share  while it actually produced  18 54 per share  a surprise of 3 69  
Price and EPS Surprise

For AutoZone  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AutoZone has an Earnings ESP of  0 25  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 26  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-autozone-azo-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200380667,200380667

28527,250042,AZO,AutoZone  AZO  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"AutoZone  NYSE AZO  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for AutoZone is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for AutoZone imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AutoZone
This auto parts retailer is expected to earn  59 70 per share for the fiscal year ending August 2019  which represents a year over year change of 18 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AutoZone  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of AutoZone to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-02-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autozone-azo-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200386373,200386373
28528,250043,AZO,AutoZone  AZO  Is Up 4 33  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at AutoZone  NYSE AZO   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if AZO is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this auto parts retailer holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For AZO  shares are up 4 33  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry is up 2 76  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 65  compares favorably with the industry s 4 89  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of AutoZone have increased 7 91  over the past quarter  and have gained 21 64  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  3 05  and 6 96   respectively 
Investors should also take note of AZO s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  AZO is averaging 281 689 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with AZO 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AZO s consensus estimate  increasing from  59 05 to  59 70 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that AZO is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep AutoZone on your short list ",2019-02-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autozone-azo-is-up-433-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200386297,200386297

28560,250075,AZO,AutoZone sales disappoint as customers prefer new cars to repairs,news," Reuters    Auto parts retailer AutoZone Inc  N AZO  reported weaker than expected quarterly revenue as a strengthening U S  economy encouraged consumers to buy new vehicles instead of repairing existing ones 
Autozone s same store sales rose only 2 1 percent in the fourth quarter ended Aug  30  compared with a 4 percent rise in the third quarter 
Sales at the company s fast growing commercial repairs business  which sells parts to auto repair chains  increased 5 3 percent  down from 14 percent in the previous quarter 
 AutoZone s higher exposure to the slower growing do it yourself  retail  segment and lower exposure to the higher growth commercial delivery business was a bit of a competitive headwind   RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli said 
Vehicle parts retailers have been increasing sales to garages  dealers and service stations as more Americans turn to them to repair their increasingly complex vehicles 
AutoZone s rivals such as Advance Auto Parts Inc  N AAP  and O Reilly Automotive Inc  O ORLY   got more than 40 percent of their 2013 revenue from commercial repairs 
Commercial repair accounted for only 17 5 percent of AutoZone s 2014 sales 
The company s fourth quarter revenue increased 4 5 percent to  3 05 billion  Analysts on average had expected revenue of  3 07 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Net income increased to  373 7 million  or  11 28 per share  for the fourth quarter  from  347 8 million  or  9 76 per share  a year earlier  Analysts had expected  11 26 per share

28615,250130,AZO,Consumer Discretionary Sector  Holiday Season Results,opinion,"Ahead of upcoming earnings  the consumer discretionary sector has seen some volatility as many retailers issued new guidance once the holiday shopping season came to an end  Overall it s been a mixed bag  with much of the weakness appearing to be concentrated in clothing and department stores 
Macy s Inc  NYSE M   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Men s Wearhouse and Tailored Brands Inc  NYSE TLRD   and Ann Taylor parent Ascena Retail Group Inc  NASDAQ ASNA  were just a few of the names that lowered guidance after their holiday quarter apparently came up short of what they were expecting 
For some time  different pockets of the consumer discretionary sector have faced challenges amid a competitive environment  For example  sporting goods retailers had a string of bankruptcies over the past few years  resulting in a more consolidated industry with a few major companies like Dick s Sporting Goods Inc  NYSE DKS   Toy stores have faced similar challenges  Toys  R  Us filed for bankruptcy  although a group of their lenders has decided to try to revive the brand 
Despite the challenges that have faced some consumer discretionary companies  there are still many that have thrived over the past several years  And there are a number of macro reasons that have likely provided a positive backdrop for the sector 
Overall  the health of the U S  consumer has been strong  The labor market remained strong in recent readings  with the unemployment rate coming in at 3 9  in December  up slightly from November s 49 year low of 3 7   according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Even though unemployment ticked up in December  analysts weren t too worried because the report showed that roughly 400 000 additional people started to look for work again 
At the same time  average hourly earnings in December increased by 3 2  over the previous year  above the 3 1  growth seen in October and November  Inflation has also been muted in recent readings  indicating consumers aren t seeing too much of their wage gains being eroded 
Outside of the positives  there have been some concerns among analysts regarding the impact of rising rates denting consumer spending and borrowing  And consumer confidence remained high in December  although it slipped compared to previous months 
From an earnings perspective  the consumer discretionary sector is expected to deliver earnings growth of 11 6  year over year  YoY  and revenue growth of 4 6  YoY in the fourth quarter  according to FactSet  Looking at 2019  FactSet s earnings growth estimate is pegged at 9 4  YoY and revenue growth is expected to come in at 5 5  over last year better than the S P 500 s  SPX  expected 6 9  earnings growth and in line with its forecasted 5 5  revenue growth 

Bouncing Back  The S P Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index  IXY  over the past year is charted above  After the broad selloff in December  the sector has been bouncing back and has returned to positive territory  outperforming both the Nasdaq Composite  COMP  teal line  and the S P 500  SPX  purple line   Chart source  thinkorswim  by TD Ameritrade  Not a recommendation  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Tariffs and Geopolitical Uncertainty
The back and forth between the U S  and China regarding tariffs has added to an already uncertain global environment  The effect of tariffs  combined with softening economic data in China and other regions  has varied from one company to another 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  recently lowered its guidance  with CEO Tim Cook saying  we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration  particularly in Greater China   In addition  Cook pointed to increased consumer uncertainty in China resulting from heightened trade tensions as a cause 
Out of the few companies that have reported results so far  some have acknowledged challenges in the region while others were more optimistic  AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  indicated it will continue to work with industry associations to express their concerns about the negative impact of increased tariffs  When Nike  NYSE NKE  reported in late December  management said they hadn t seen any impact on their business there  which posted its 18th consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth 
Data Delay
Investors looking for data have been left a little empty handed lately due to the government shutdown  which has delayed reports that the Census Bureau puts out  such as U S  retail sales  Their latest report covered November and showed U S  retail sales were  513 5 billion  up 0 2  over October and 4 2  YoY  Excluding auto related and gas station sales  retail sales were up 4 6  YoY 
Those results painted a mixed picture  Department store sales were down 0 2  compared to the previous year  whereas online retailers were up 10 8   Electronics and appliance stores saw a 4  increase while sporting goods  hobby  musical instrument and bookstores were down 8 8   The divergence among different classes of retail has been going on for some time 
Labor Inflation and Other Costs
Labor inflation and transportation costs have been two areas that both company execs and analysts expressed concerns about over the course of 2018 
Regarding the former  the labor market can be a double edged sword for retailers  On one hand  wage growth and a tight labor market typically help support consumer spending  On the other  it can make it more challenging to attract and retain qualified workers  common issue companies have expressed lately  Labor cost inflation was commonly cited on retail earnings calls as a source of margin pressure in 2018 
Freight costs denting margins was another common refrain heard regularly on earnings calls in 2018  There are varied opinions among analysts about where transportation costs will go in 2019  but many retailers have indicated they still expect them to negatively impact bottom lines in 2019

28622,250137,AZO,Exclusive  U S  executives pledge stock for loans  raise margin call concern,news,"By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON  Reuters    U S  corporate executives and directors have pledged at least  15 billion of their own company stock holdings to secure personal loans  in spite of recent examples of these arrangements creating bigger losses for other investors during selloffs  Most U S  companies say they limit or prohibit stock pledging because they can increase downward pressure on a company s stock price if an executive s pledged shares are sold under duress  such as a margin call  Still  some boards make exceptions for their stars  corporate disclosures show  And they rarely disclose what these insiders are doing with their borrowed money   Earlier this month  shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  International  TO VRX  fell 14 percent during a single trading session after 1 3 million shares of the company s stock was dumped on the market in a margin call  Valeant CEO Michael  Pearson   L PSON  had pledged the stock as collateral to secure loans from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  totaling about  100 million   The money partly financed contributions to Duke University and to help fund a community swimming pool  Pearson disclosed  His latest disclosed total pay was  10 3 million  according to Valeant s proxy statement    Nothing good can come from these arrangements from a broader shareholder perspective   said Mark Borges  a principal at Compensia  an executive compensation research firm in San Francisco   When you pledge shares you are essentially giving someone else the ability to sell the stock out from under you  It exacerbates the situation when they are sold into an already anxious market    Oracle Corp   N ORCL  founder and chairman Larry Ellison leads the pack with about  11 billion of company stock pledged for personal loans  The arrangement  which accounts for 7 percent of Oracle s market cap  is reviewed every quarter by Oracle s governance and compensation committees to ensure Ellison has enough money to pay off the loans without selling the pledged shares  Ellison s latest disclosed total annual pay was  63 6 million  according to Oracle s proxy statement  Oracle declined to comment   A Reuters analysis of thousands of U S  corporate disclosures shows that most of stock pledging activity is concentrated at Oracle   Tesla Motors  Inc  O TSLA    Estee Lauder  Companies Inc  N EL   FedEx Corp  N FDX   AutoZone Inc  N AZO  and by T  Boone Pickens at Clean Energy Fuels Corp  O CLNE   Tesla chairman and CEO Elon Musk has pledged 7 4 million shares of company stock to secure personal loans worth about  1 6 billion  according to company disclosures  Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley   N MS  have been named as lenders in the arrangements with Musk  Tesla did not return messages seeking comment   Tesla has warned investors in U S  regulatory filings what could happen if Musk had to sell the shares    The forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business   Musk  who owns 35 53 million shares of Tesla worth about  7 6 billion  does not accept his annual salary of  35 360  CLEAR ADVANTAGES  To be sure  there are some clear advantages to executives and directors using their stock as collateral for loans or for hedging purposes  Investment banks are eager to give them low cost loans  which allow the executives to diversify their holdings without selling their stock  The companies don t disclose the rate of interest the executives pay on their loans  Executives can also defer tax gains into future years because there is no liability when a pledge of shares is executed    If they can t pledge the stock  they might just sell the shares   said Kevin McManus  vice president of proxy services at Egan Jones Proxy Services  He said stock pledges are not necessarily a problem as long as executives  share ownership meets company requirements and keeps them aligned with the interests of other investors   At FedEx  there is a policy against pledging shares or using them for hedging transactions  But exceptions have been made for Chairman and CEO Frederick W  Smith  who has almost  700 million worth of company stock pledged to secure loans to fund his personal business ventures  FedEx has disclosed  Among other things  Smith backs a Los Angeles based film production company called Alcon Entertainment  which counts  The Blind Side  among its financing and production credits   The company said its general counsel and lead independent director granted Smith an exemption from its anti pledging policy because he has shown he has enough financial resources to repay the loans without resorting to selling the pledged shares  Smith s latest disclosed total annual pay was  13 8 million  according to a company proxy statement   In 2013  the company defeated a shareholder proposal that would have banned all pledges  FedEx s board said an absolute prohibition on pledging could create a disincentive for officers and directors to hold substantial amounts of FedEx shares for long periods   J R  Hyde III  a director at  Autozone Inc   N AZO   has pledged about  72 million worth of company stock for personal loans  But Hyde has assured the company in writing he has the financial capacity to avert a margin call  Autozone spokesman Ray Pohlman said  Hyde  who gets paid  200 000 as a director  owns 116 007 shares of company stock worth  89 million   Ronald S  Lauder  chairman of Estee Lauder s Clinique Laboratories  has pledged 10 million shares of company stock worth about  830 million to secure loans and his obligations under a prepaid variable forward sales contract  Estee Lauder declined to comment  but his forward sales contract typically would allow Lauder to obtain immediate cash in exchange for a commitment to surrender shares or cash at a predetermined future date   
Corporate governance experts say prepaid sales contracts can be a problem because they require an executive to take a short position on their own stock  Estee Lauder says it does not restrict stock pledges  but requires they be precleared by the company s legal department  However  the company says its preclearance policy does not include stock pledged in margin accounts ",2015-11-17,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-u.s.-executives-pledge-stock-for-loans,-raise-margin-call-concern-371668",371668
28623,250138,AZO,Low interest rates  weak stock market hurting U S  corporate pensions,news,"By David Randall
NEW YORK  Reuters    Low U S  interest rates and a stuttering stock market are hitting corporate pensions hard  but instead of boosting contributions some companies are taking advantage of a new regulatory rule that allows them to contribute fewer dollars now and make up the difference later 
The average pension among companies in the S P 1500 was funded at just 78 1 percent of its liabilities at the end of February  down from nearly 95 percent in late 2013  according to the most recent numbers from human resources consultant Mercer  a part of Marsh   McLennan  N MMC  
At some companies  the funding levels are much lower  the pension plan at Delta Airlines Inc  N DAL   which has the worst funding status among large corporate pension plans  only has enough assets to cover 45 4 percent of its pension obligations 
For a graph showing the funding status of U S  corporate pensions from 1998 2015  see 
In September 2015  the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission decided to allow companies to adopt a different way of measuring their discount rates  which can bring the immediate funding needs down  The only problem with this way of seeking relief is that their longer term obligations remain the same  according to David Zion  a veteran accounting and pensions analyst at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  
So far  19 companies in the S P 500 have either adopted or are planning to adopt the new so called spot rate approach  Zion said  They range from auto parts retailer  Autozone Inc   N AZO  to media company Walt  Disney  Co  N DIS  and tractor maker Deere   Co  N DE   The savings vary  with telecom giant AT T  N T  saying that it expects to get a  1 billion pre tax boost to its bottom line while Disney expects a  137 million reduction in costs  both in the current fiscal year 
The plans concerned are usually what are known as defined benefit plans  Many companies now only offer 401K defined contribution plans that are largely funded by employees rather than their employers and therefore don t create such corporate obligations 
Many of the companies that have legacy defined benefit plans are older companies in industrial businesses  particularly manufacturing businesses whose workers belong to labor unions 
Federal law requires a company with an underfunded pension to eventually make additional payments into their plans to make up the difference  rather than requiring retirees to accept fewer benefits 
The main culprit behind the dramatic decline in funding levels is exceptionally low interest rates that continue to eat into the bond income that pension plans have long relied on to meet  or at least measure  their future obligations 
The so called discount rate   the proxy that pension plans use as the expected income they will make annually from a corporate bond   is at 4 06 percent  compared with nearly 5 percent two years ago and 6 2 percent at the end of 2008  Pension funds have in the past had to use that discount rate to calculate the net present value of their obligations 
 You ve just seen a ballooning effect of liabilities  as the discount rate continues to fall to new lows  said Zorast Wadia  a principal at actuarial firm Milliman 
At the same time  weakness in the U S  stock market wiped out  83 billion in plan assets in the first two months of this year  widening the overall pension funding deficit to  487 billion  according to Mercer 
 In just two months we have seen the entire improvement in funded status from last year disappear   said Jim Ritchie  a principal in Mercer s retirement business  A recovery in stocks this month will have helped to mitigate the problem 
Of the pension plans operated by S P 1500 companies  59 percent are below 80 percent funded  Mercer estimates  In 2007  before the financial crisis  the average corporate pension was 104 3 percent funded  while in 2000 the average pension plan was 121 9 percent funded  according to Mercer data  A few companies such as  General Electric  Co  N GE  and General Motors Co  N GM  have announced plans to increase their pension contributions this year  rather than pay higher premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp  a federal government agency that insures private defined benefit pension plans 
As of the start of this year  companies that operate their own plans pay a variable rate premium of  30 per  1 000 of underfunded benefits  up from a rate of  24 in 2015  GE  for instance  expects to contribute  930 million into its plan this fiscal year  while GM expects to contribute  2 billion into its plan  Zion estimates that 48 companies in the S P 500   a group including aluminum maker  Alcoa  Inc  N AA   Boeing  N BA   and electric utility PG E Corp  N PCG    could see their cost of servicing pensions drop 5 percent and interest costs drop 20 percent under the new SEC rules  resulting in a more than 5 percent increase in their pre tax income ",2016-03-14,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/low-interest-rates,-weak-stock-market-hurting-u.s.-corporate-pensions-389758",389758
28624,250139,AZO,Wall Street drops as hawkish Fed trend continues  oil slumps,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks traded down as the hawkish trend in comments from the Federal Reserve  Fed  continued on Wednesday and investors watched oil slump as inventories managed the second largest buildup in a year and hopes for an impact from a production freeze were put into question 
At 16 14GMT or 12 14ET  the Dow 30 traded down 39 points  or 0 22   while the S P 500 fell 7 points  or 0 34   and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite lost 35 points  or 0 73  
Ever since the beginning of the week  the Fed hawks have been increasing their voice as first San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said in separate news reports on Monday that a rate hike could come as early as next month 
Then late on Tuesday  Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that the central bank should consider another interest rate hike as early as next month and added to the hawkish tone by stating that he would prefer at least three hikes before year end 
The dollar reacted hitting a one week high  even as St  Louis Fed President James Bullard took up the hawkish tone on Wednesday by saying another strong jobs report showing a firming labor market  could probably make a case for moving in April  
Bullard s comments may hold more sway with markets since he forms part of the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC    and thus holds voting rights on policy decisions this year 
Fed fund futures still price in the first increase in interest rates occurring in September  though speculation runs across the board with some experts still betting on three hikes this year and others questioning if there will even be one 
Complicating the situation are what have been dubbed  misinterpretations  of the Fed s own projections of the future path of rate hikes  known as the dot plot 
 I ve even thought about dropping out unilaterally from the whole exercise   Bullard said on Wednesday 
At the same time  former Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota referred to the dot plot and wrote in a Bloomberg op ed that  investors and the media consistently misinterpret it  
Kocherlakota explained that the dot plot does not reflect officials  interest rate forecasts  but  rather  it shows what each participant thinks the Fed should do  based on his or her individual forecast of how the economy will evolve and what the optimal response would be  
Amidst all the speculation  investors might do well to remember that Fed chair Janet Yellen insisted in her post decision press conference that every meeting of the U S  central bank should be  live  and that opposition was already shown by Kansas City Fed president and FOMC voting member Esther George when she dissented on the latest decision due to her preference to increase rates by 25 basis points 
Meanwhile  oil prices also maintained the market s attention as bearish news on black gold continued to flow 
The U S  Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that crude stockpiles increased by a whopping 9 357 million barrels  the second largest buildup in a year and far outstripping forecasts for an increase of 3 090 million barrels 
That data came on top of the already bearish sentiment provoked by the American Petroleum Institute s own inventory data released after the market close on Tuesday and an International Energy Agency report that suggested that an April 17 meeting among major oil producers to discuss a production freeze could be  meaningless  
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 3 23  to  40 11 a barrel by 16 16GMT or 12 16ET  while Brent oil fell 2 66  to  40 68 
On the data front  February new home sales rebounded from January s sharp decline  with the total number of units sold topping the consensus forecast  The year on year data painted a bleaker picture of the U S  housing market with its largest annual drop  6 1   since June 2014 
In company news   Nike   NYSE NKE  was hard hit in Wednesday s  falling almost 4   after reporting earnings after Tuesday s market close

28722,250237,AZO,Stock Exchange  Bear Trap Rally  ,opinion,"The Stock Exchange is all about trading  Each week we do the following 



Discuss an important issue for traders
Highlight several technical trading methods  including current ideas
Feature advice from top traders and writers
Provide a few  minority  reactions from fundamental analysts


Review  How Much Cash Are You Keeping On The Sidelines 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  How Much Cash Are You Keeping On The Sidelines  We noted the increased market volatility and asked readers if they were keeping more cash  less cash  or if it was simply trading and investing as usual  We also discussed the optionality of cash  and its quality as an attractive hedge considering there is no chance of unforeseen losses if markets turn against you 
This Week  Are You Watching Out For Bear Trap Rallies 
The Dow Jones is up four trading sessions in a row  the most consecutive up days since September  But is it a bear trap rally 

According to Investopedia  a bear trap is 

A Bear Trap is a technical pattern that occurs when the performance of a stock or an index incorrectly signals a reversal of a rising price trend 

Markets rarely make V shaped recoveries  yet we usually hear only about the rare  bottom caller  that gets it right  instead of the many more that call false bottoms 
As a trader  it can feel good to get aggressive and make big bets  calling bottoms  for example   but it can be more important to exhibit prudence  According to Dr  Brett Steenbarger  the two ingredients of trading success are  emphasis ours  

There are two necessary ingredients of trading success and it sometimes seems as though they are at odds with one another  prudence and aggressiveness 
Prudence is all about staying in the game with proper risk management  position sizing  and selectivity of trading 
Aggressiveness is all about making the most of the game with proper risk taking  position sizing  and assertiveness of trading 

For our own trading models  we get aggressive when conditions are right  but exhibit prudence when they re not  For example  our momentum models need momentum to work best  And four consecutive  yet volatile  up days in a row isn t exactly a trend compared to the myriad of a highly volatile down day in recent months 
According to Larry McDonald  editor of The Bear Traps Report fed speak may have a lot to do with the recent 4 day up move in the market  Specifically  after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the fed could afford to be patient  McDonald explains 

 All the minutes are doing is confirming what they had already hinted at  The Fed speak before the minutes was like a fire hose to calm down the markets  

From our perspective  recognizing when risk is no longer excessive pays off much better than trying to do bottom calling  In particular  when your system is momentum based  you need to see some momentum 
Model Performance 
We are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models  as our readers have requested  as shown in the following table 

We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns

Expert Picks From The Models 
Note  This week s Stock Exchange is edited by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  Being the aggressive yet prudent dip buyer that I am  I bought shares of AutoZone  NYSE AZO  this week  And as you know  I typically hold for about 6 weeks 

Blue Harbinger  I was about to tell you I like that purchase  being a bit of a dip buyer myself until you reminded me of the 6 week thing  You ve got to be quite exacting to have comfort on your  dip buys  if you re holding for such a short period  I like to pay more attention to the long term fundamentals  For example  here is a look at the long term price correlated with fundamentals from Fast Graphs  See the relationship  for example  with the price to the price earnings ratio 

Holmes  Buy and Hope  Yawn  I ll stick to my technical dip buying strategy  It s objective and unbiased  not emotional nor narrative prone  like you   Plus  my strategy is less correlated with the long term ups and downs of the market a big plus for diversification benefits 
BH  Suit yourself  Holmes  I admire your contrarian bravery  I m also glad current market conditions are conducive to your trading strategy  And at least if this is a bear trap rally  I know you ve got price targets and stop loss orders in place  Your time horizon should help you avoid the dangers of trying to catch a falling knife if this is indeed a bear trap rally  Anyway  how about you Road Runner and Athena Do you two momentum traders have any trades to share this week 
Road Runner  No trades  We need a little more proven market momentum before we start placing trades  It s called being prudent 
BH  I can respect that  This market has been nuts lately  How about you  Felix do you have anything to share 
Felix  Yes  This week I ran the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average through my technical model  and I have ranked the top 20 for you in the following list 

BH  Thanks for that ranking  Felix  And thanks also for including General Electric  NYSE GE  in the list  per my request  even though it got kicked out of the Dow last year  It s interesting to me that GE ranked high on your list  You are a momentum trader  right  You must be talking about its momentum so far this year because I think of it as more of a  dip buying  opportunity after its horrendous 2018 
Felix  Yes  GE has been terrible  but up a bit so far this year  buying following last year s tax loss selling  perhaps    And just so you remember  I am a momentum trader  I typically hold for around 66 weeks  I use stops and pay attention to macro conditions for risk management reasons  And as you know  I recently exited all my trades because near term conditions have gotten a bit unhealthy  My exit is not a bet on market direction just risk management  Or being  prudent   as you keep saying 
BH   Well maybe I m being a little more aggressive than prudent  but GE is tempting to me here for the price appreciation potential  It seems like this stock has gotten so cheap because the market absolutely hates it  the shares have experienced a historic fall  the quarterly dividend has been reduced to only a penny  and they re on their 3rd CEO in the last two years 
However  it s actually been starting to get a few street analyst upgrades  you know  Here is a look 

Specifically  almost half of the 22 analysts covering the stock now have to buy ratings  and the price target   11 52  is 33  higher than the current share price 
Also  there s been news that private equity group Apollo Global Management is showing interest in buying GE s Jet Leasing business  which is worth as much as  40 billion  Not only could this create a lot of much needed near term cash flow for GE  but it s a good indication of just how beat up General Electric shares actually are  Apollo and private equity  in general  wouldn t be interested if GE s market value wasn t extremely beat up they like to buy very low  

Further still  despite the market s pure hatred for GE s stock  the company is expected to generate powerful cash flows from operations in future years  according to analysts  as shown in the following table 

And even Wall Street s  Dean of Valuation   Aswath Damodaran  says it s a good buy  Specifically  regarding GE  Damodaran says 

 This is not a turnaround story  This is a story of disentangling a company and selling off its pieces for the best prices they can get  

Per the article 

Damodaran is still buying shares of  GE  because the stock could see a  significant recovery  if it  plays its cards right  

Oscar  Thanks for that info on GE  Felix and Blue Harbinger  But if you re interested  I also have a ranking to share  This week I ran our  High Liquidity ETFs with Price volume over 100 million  through my model  and the top 20 are ranked in the following list 

BH  Interesting  And remind us  what is your trading strategy 
Oscar  I am into momentum  I typically hold for 6 weeks  and then I usually rotate into a new sector or style ETF 
BH  I see a lot oil ETFs on your list  For example  VanEck Vectors Oil Services  NYSE OIH   SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production EFT  NYSE XOP  and the United States Oil EFT  NYSE USO   In my mind  oil is a contrarian play because it s down so much in recent months  However  considering your typical holding period is only 6 weeks  and considering oil is up a bunch in the last week maybe that s the momentum to which you re referring  Interesting ideas  Oscar  thanks for sharing 
Conclusion 
Even though this is the first time in months that the Dow is up four trading days in a row  that doesn t necessarily mean momentum has shifted upwards  Markets rarely form a V shaped bottom  and correctly calling one is usually an unsuccessful and dangerous endeavor  Rather  achieving the right balance between aggressiveness and prudence is usually the much better approach  And so too is always sticking to a market strategy that is consistent with your own personal trading goals

28747,250262,AZO,AutoZone  Adobe  Costco  FedEx And Oracle Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 17  2018   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes AutoZone   NYSE AZO    Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE    Costco   NASDAQ COST    FedEx   NYSE FDX   and Oracle   NYSE ORCL   How Low Can Earnings Estimates Go All of us knew that the roughly  25  earnings growth pace in the first three quarters of 2018 was unsustainable  with the pace trending down in a major way starting 2018 Q4 and continuing to decelerate in 2019  All of this has been part of consensus earnings expectations for quite some time and primarily a function of the tax cut arithmetic But this deceleration in earnings growth is not the only development on the corporate earnings front as the market s evolving economic growth expectations  for the U S  as well as the global economy  has raised legitimate concerns about consensus earnings estimates  This earnings uncertainty compounds the market s pre existing worries about Fed policy and global trade  The market s ongoing weakness  which is contrary to its typical behavior at this time of the year  reflects this confluence of headwinds Earnings estimates for 2018 Q4 and full year 2019 have been coming down lately  but they likely have more to go down given the headwinds Q4 estimates have come down for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with the Transportation sector the only one that has experienced positive estimate revisions  which is a reflection of the pullback in fuel expenses  Estimates have come down the most for the Conglomerates  Construction  Consumer Discretionary  Utilities and Basic Materials sectors This type of negative revisions is not unusual in historical terms  though they do represent greater estimate cuts than was the trend in the last few quarters  Please note that the negative revisions trend isn t restricted to Q4 estimates  as expectations for full year 2019 have started coming down in a meaningful way lately as well The S P 500 index is now in negative territory while the Nasdaq Composite is still holding onto a modest gain for the year  Keep in mind that the pronounced downtrend in the market in early October coincides with the downtrend in earnings estimates It hard to envision stocks stabilizing if the market s collective earnings outlook for 2019 continues to deteriorate  And to get stability in earnings outlook  we need clarity and visibility on the interconnected economic growth and tariff fronts  In other words  there is likely further downside to consensus expectations for full year 2019  Q4 Earnings Season Gets UnderwayThe Q4 earnings season will not take the spotlight at least through the middle of January  but the reporting season officially got underway with the December 4th AutoZone report  followed by the December 13th reports from Adobe Systems and Costco  All three of these companies reported results for their fiscal November quarter results  which we count as part of the December quarter tally  We have 14 index members on deck to report results this week  including FedEx  Oracle and others Total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  12 3  from the same period last year on  5 7  higher revenues  which would follow the  25 6  earnings growth on  8 4  higher revenues in 2018 Q3 Earnings growth is expected to be in double digits for 6 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy   77 4  growth   Finance   22    Construction   26 6   and Transportation   23 6   has the strongest growth  Tech sector earnings are expected to decelerate meaningfully in Q4  up  6 7   after back to back quarters of very strong growth Four sectors are expected to have lower earnings in Q4 relative to the year earlier period  namely Conglomerates   12 9  decline   Autos   13 5    Utilities   6 3   and Consumer Staples   0 4   Whether we look at the growth picture on a quarterly basis or on a rolling quarter basis  there is no doubt that growth peak is now behind us  The question now is how much estimates for the coming quarters have still to come down  And the answer to that question will depend on the evolving economic backdrop that we discussed at the start Note  Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department  He is an acknowledged earnings expert whose

28794,250309,AZO,5 Excellent GARP Picks With Cheap PEG Ratio,opinion,Investors seeking long term growth often wonder whether they should resort to any of the fundamental strategies like growth or value  or follow an approach that combines the best of both  Going by Warren Buffett  these two approaches are joined at the hip  In other words  to make a long term investment more effective  the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined It has been observed that strategic mingling of both growth and value investing principles gives us a mixed investing strategy  Termed as GARP  growth at a reasonable price   this approach is getting popular with each passing day  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  And here lies the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks  P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate  followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Here are five stocks that qualified the screening AutoZone  Inc    NYSE AZO    This

28797,250312,AZO,Has AutoZone  AZO  Outpaced Other Retail Wholesale Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Retail Wholesale space have likely heard of AutoZone  NYSE AZO   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Retail Wholesale peers  we might be able to answer that question 
AutoZone is one of 226 companies in the Retail Wholesale group  The Retail Wholesale group currently sits at  6 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors 
The Zacks Rank is a proven model that highlights a variety of stocks with the right characteristics to outperform the market over the next one to three months  The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks  AZO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AZO s full year earnings has moved 2 13  higher  This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend 
Based on the most recent data  AZO has returned 17 50  so far this year  In comparison  Retail Wholesale companies have returned an average of  2 42   As we can see  AutoZone is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
Looking more specifically  AZO belongs to the Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  which includes 5 individual stocks and currently sits at  29 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 23 46  so far this year  so AZO is slightly underperforming its industry in this area

Review  Are You Selling The Rips Or Buying The Dips 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question   Are You Selling The Rips Or Buying The Dips   We noted that dip buying strategies have been increasingly challenged in recent weeks  And with market uncertainty and intraday volatility higher  a  selling the rips  strategy has been getting more attention  The high intraday volatility continues  for example Wednesday we saw the market go from up significantly in the morning  to down significantly in the afternoon following the Fed s interest rate announcement 
This Week  Is Technical Damage Driving This Market 
The market reacted badly to the Fed s announcement on Wednesday  and the S P 500 reached a new low for 2018  But just how bad is the technical damage  And is that really what s driving this market 

The above chart  from a recent post by Jesse Colombo suggests that  A Major Technical Breakdown Just Occurred In Stocks   And Jesse is not alone  For example  Patti Domm at CNBC lends some support to this notion when she writes  The Market Is In No Man s Land 
For additional perspective  this next chart shows how the S P 500 can have a tendency to skip along its 200 day moving average  This basic technical trading indicator  200 day moving average  is used by so many market participants that it often serves as a magnet  and then support or resistance  However  when something sends the market through this level  many stops are often triggered  thereby increasing the market move 

For more information  we ve written about trading around moving averages in the past 

Trading the 200 Day Moving Average
Do You Trade The 50 Day Moving Average 

Of course the market is not driven entirely by technicals  There are economic conditions and fundamental factors that matter  But those don t necessarily seem to warrant such a sharp sell off  according to Dr  Brett Steenbarger  Per his recent post   What In The World Is Going On With The Stock Market   it may not even be about the US market  He writes 

Perhaps what is going on in the U S  stock market is not about the U S  Perhaps it is not about President Trump  not about the daily dose of polarized  politicized commentaries from MSNBC  FOX  CNN  and not about chart patterns and wave counts of American markets 

Regardless of the volatile conditions  our technical models continue to find compelling trading opportunities  But before getting into the details of a few of our most recent trades  here is an update on the performance of our trading models 
Model Performance
We are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models  as our readers have requested  as shown in the following table 

Worth noting  the model results look weak in various time frames  but it is actually a reflection of only the last month or so  Our system of exits is more complex  and more effective  than most simple  price based methods  Without going into the details  it is a bit more  patient  than most  For perspective  the models do well in up markets and flat markets  In large declines they outperform the general market via a complete exit  For more than a month we have been operating on the edge of the effective range   something that we report in the indicator snapshot each week on WTWA  The recent market action illustrates the effectiveness of our approach  which will start to show up in next week s table  Unlike our models  systems that use aggressive stops have difficulty in re entry  Our models are less likely to miss the subsequent rebound after the market sells off

Blue Harbinger  Do any of you technical trading models have any trades to share with us this week  How about you  Holmes  I know you are our resident  dip buyer   Any recent activity to share 
Holmes  This week I purchased AutoZone  NYSE AZO  on a price dip  are you familiar with that company 

Blue Harbinger  Yes AutoZone sells car parts and accessories  Are you thinking the recent market decline is an indication that the economy will weaken  and people will start spending more money on fixing their existing cars  to the benefit of AutoZone  instead of buying new cars 
Holmes  No  That s not at all what I am thinking  My typical holding period is only 6 weeks  so I ll be out of this trade long before the phenomenon you described plays out if it is even a real thing  Besides  the Fed just raised interest rates  which is an indication that they think the economy is strengthening 
BH  Do they really think the market is getting stronger  Holmes  or are they just trying to get rates back to a normal level so they have some dry powder available if things start to get really bad  You know Fed chair Jerome Powell just said he expects 2 more rate hikes in 2019  but the market thinks he s full of it  According to the CME s FedWatch tool  the futures market is thinking it s more likely there will be zero rate hikes in 2019  Conditions aren t so rosy out there Holmes 

Holmes  Again  I typically hold for 6 weeks  Your full year 2019 story is not all that important to my trade  And neither are the long term fundamentals for AutoZone  but I m sure you re going to tell me something about fundamentals too 
BH  I won t get into the fundamental details since you re not listening to me anyway  but if you change your mind  check out some of the fundamental data in Chuck Carnevale s fantastic FastGraphs site  For example  here is some concise and powerful data for your to consider 

Holmes  Thanks  And how about you  Felix any trades to share this week 
Felix  I bought Ctrip com International  NASDAQ CTRP  this week  Ever heard of it 

BH  Travel related services  Ctrip provides hotel accommodations  airline tickets and packaged tours  and they re headquartered in Shanghai  China  I don t know much about the company  but I like the concept  and I think emerging markets  e g  China  are really depressed right now  and this could be a good time to  buy low   In fact  I do see in your chart that Ctrip is well below its 50 day and 200 day moving averages  Assuming the volume of the sell off slows  this could be an interesting time to consider buying  but I am not really into trying to catch falling knives 

Felix  I hold for 66 weeks  on average  So I am not necessarily trying to bottom tick here  However  I am actually seeing various attractive momentum indicators for Ctrip  and that is why I bought the shares  I have a specific Ctrip price target in mind  and in case I am wrong I have stops in place  Plus I also monitor macro conditions closely on my trades 
BH  Well I can see Ctrip s EPS recently broke out  and revenues have been accelerating  Perhaps that is the  momentum  you re talking about  This will be an interesting one to keep an eye on  thanks Felix 
Felix  If you re looking for something to  keep an eye on  Blue Harbinger  I also ran the 30 Dow Jones stocks through my model this week  and here are the top 20 rankings 

BH  That is interesting  Felix  I like those types of rankings  I see Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  ranks highly on your list  That s a name I like because it s a US company with significant emerging markets exposure  That exposure has held it back in recent years  but it could become a tailwind in the years ahead  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Athena any trades to share this week 
Athena  This week I sold my Zayo Group Holdings  NYSE ZAYO  shares  I bought them at a higher price back on November 20  however I am using prudent discipline in accordance with my strategy and I sold the shares 

BH  Glad you are using  prudent discipline   In this market it can make sense to take a few chips off the table  assuming that is consistent with your strategy 

Athena  As you know  I am a technical trader  I am big on momentum  and my typical holding period is around 17 weeks  I run a  king of the mountain  best ideas strategy  and Zayo has fallen out of my top 10 list  therefore I sold 
BH  Got it  Thanks for the info  And how about you  Oscar  anything to share this week 
Oscar  This week I ran the High Liquidity ETFs with Price volume over 100 million through my technical model  Here is the ranking of my top 20 

BH  I see the Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  at the top of your list  Are you betting on a little more market fear driving investors to the safety of gold 
Oscar  These are gold miners  not the commodity gold  but yes there is a correlation there  I also have utilities  NYSE XLU  ranked highly that s another  flight to safety  trade  You might also appreciate that I have emerging market countries Brazil  NYSE EWZ  and India  NYSE INDA  ranked highly 
Conclusion
With volatility and uncertainty high  it can seem that technicals are increasingly driving the moves in the market  And while the Fed increased rates on Wednesday  and indicated they are expecting 2 more rate hikes in 2019   the market sold off  again  and arguably broke a significant technical support level  Further still  the market sank further below its closely watched 50 day and 200 day moving averages  and thereby the S P 500 set a new low for 2018  But before  you go running for the hills  recall that markets are driven by both technicals  often in the shorter term  and economic and fundamental factors in the longer term  Keeping these in mind  be sure you re following a strategy that is consistent with your personal needs and goals

28817,250332,AZO,Auto Stock Roundup  General Motors To Rehire Employees  Tesla Lowers Price In China,opinion,"General Motors Company   NYSE GM   announced that around 2 700 workers of its U S  plants  which will close  will be offered jobs at other factories of the company  Notably  in November  General Motors took the decision to shut down production at four plants in the United States and one in Canada due to the shift in consumer preference 
Waning popularity of passenger cars amid higher demand for SUVs and trucks compelled General Motors to lower manufacturing of six car models and cut its workforce  But  now the company plans to rehire some of these employees in its other plants Navistar International Corp  s   NYSE NAV   fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings and revenues beat estimates  Further  the figures improved year over year  driven mainly by 45  rise in sales volume of Navistar s Class 6 8 trucks and buses in the United States as well as Canada Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Tesla  Inc    NASDAQ TSLA   reduced Model S and Model X car prices in China  per Reuters  The announcement was made after China reported that it will briefly suspend additional tariffs that it imposed on U S  manufactured cars and light trucks  The price of the company s Model S was reduced by 105 000 yuan   15 200  and Model X s by up to 65 000 yuan Beginning Jan 1  2019  China will slash the additional rate of 25   which will reduce tariffs to 15   The reduced rate will put the U S  exports at par with other countries within the World Trade Organization  The additional tariff suspension was followed by a trade truce between China and the United States  It will be effective on Mar 31 In November  the company announced a similar price cut of its Model X and Model S cars in China to make the cars more affordable for its customers in China  During that time  it slashed the prices of these two models by 12 25  Steep tariff rates from July strained this U S  based electric automaker s financials in 2018  During the announcement of third quarter 2018 results  the company reported that high import duties on Model S and X vehicles reduced its growth in China  In fact  CFRA s analyst  Garrett Nelson  reported to CNBC that Tesla s deliveries to China accounted for 6  in the third quarter s total revenues compared with 17 2  in 2017 Huge prospects for electric vehicles make China a worthwhile market for Tesla that offers alternate energy cars  However  Tesla s dependence on imports at times of high import taxes hampered growth  In a bid to increase affordability and reduce shipping costs  the company will start manufacturing vehicles in China by 2019   Read more   Tesla currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  2     General Motors announced that around 2 700 workers of its U S  hubs

shutting down of one manufacturing site will lay off 8 000 white collared workers and 2 600 factory workers in Canada Out of 3 300 workers in the United States  2 700 will be offered jobs at other plants of the company while a few will retire  New job allocation will also consist of relocation for a few of the workers  The blue collared workers will be hired in factories  which will raise their vehicle production targets New job opportunities at existing plants offer good prospects for the blue collared workers  who are likely to lose their jobs at factories that are slated to close in the next year  However  the closures will still hit the white collared workers  who are currently working at those four U S  hubs  The company will offer similar openings to a few of these workers while others will get assistance to find new jobs In the last month  General Motors announced that it will close production at four plants in the United States and one in Canada  owing to change in consumer preferences  Plummeting demand for passenger cars  and increased demand for SUVs and trucks impelled General Motors to trim productions and slash manufacturing of six car models The decision has been taken to raise the long term profitability of the company beside improving the potential of cash generation  General Motors anticipates that the closing of factories and cutting of car models will elevate annual adjusted automotive free cash flow by  6 billion by the end of 2020 and lower capital expenditure by roughly  1 5 billion   Read more   General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank  2

8 trucks and buses in the United States as well as Canada For fiscal 2018  Navistar reported earnings of  340 million or  3 41 per share  up from  30 million or 32 cents per share recorded in the

28864,250379,AZO,AutoZone  AZO  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects AutoZone  NYSE AZO  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto parts retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  12 21 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  22 6  
Revenues are expected to be  2 63 billion  up 1 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 35  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AutoZone 
For AutoZone  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 29  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AutoZone will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AutoZone would post earnings of  17 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  18 54  delivering a surprise of  3 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AutoZone doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autozone-azo-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200362828,200362828
28865,250380,AZO,5 Stocks With Impressive PEG Ratio For Value Investors,opinion,The popularity of value investing is on the rise  The success of billionaire value investors like Warren Buffett is testament to the fact  Over the past five years  his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  s book value has grown at a compound annual rate of 11   The Economist  According to an article by Rajiv Bhuva  Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger have managed to drive 20 9  compound annual growth in the market value of Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 to 2017  The book value per share has risen at 19 1  CAGR  from  19 to  211 750 in these 53 years However  apparently simple to understand  this investing discipline has its own share of pitfalls  A value investor mostly misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects and in their quest for cheaper stocks  they often end up picking stocks that have weak prospects Buffett believes that proper understanding of the  intrinsic value  of a stock may ease out many problems with regard to value investment  According to him  going by the fundamentals of value investing  while picking undervalued stocks  investors need to focus on their earnings growth potential While yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings  sales or book value are the most common value investing metrics that can single out stocks trading at a discount  these ratios fail to consider the potential of a stock  PEG is the ratio with the earnings growth component in it The PEG ratio is defined as   Price Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth  followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than M Industry Median  for more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks

A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism

upside potential  Here are five out of the 24 stocks that qualified the screening General Motors Company   NYSE GM    Detroit  MI based General Motors is a leading global automotive company  The

28869,250384,AZO,AutoZone  Costco And Adobe Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   December 10  2018   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes AutoZone   NYSE AZO    Costco   NASDAQ COST   and Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE   
Earnings Growth in a Slowing Economy
Earnings aren t the market s primary concern at present  the focus rather is on the evolving economic picture that is expected to decelerate from its recent pace  We are not seeing much evidence of this growth deceleration in recent economic data  the weaker than expected November jobs report notwithstanding  but the slowdown is expected to arrive over the coming months 
The market is hoping that the Fed takes note of this evolving growth expectation and adjusts its monetary policy stance accordingly  Fed officials  public comments and media speculation suggest that the central bank may be leaning in that direction as well 
So what s driving the slowdown  It s a combination of factors  ranging from the fading of the tax reform s impact and trade tariff uncertainty to economic weakness abroad  While many in the market are starting to see the flattening yield curve and pockets of inversion as signs of something a lot more ominous on the horizon  The consensus view appears to be that the U S  economy is putting the 2018 GDP growth pace of  3  plus behind it  with the growth pace going forward in the  2  plus range 
This isn t an abstract discussion as the economy s growth trajectory not only has implications for Fed policy  but also for consensus earnings expectations  Earnings estimates for 2018 Q4 and full year 2019 have been coming down lately  but they likely have more to go down given the headwinds 
Q4 estimates have come down for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors  The Transportation sector is the only one that has experienced positive estimate revisions  which is a reflection of the pullback in fuel expenses  Estimates have come down the most for the Conglomerates  Construction  Consumer Discretionary  Utilities and Basic Materials sectors 
This type of negative revisions is not unusual in historical terms  though they do represent greater estimate cuts than was the trend in the last few quarters 
Q4 Earnings Season Gets Underway
The Q4 earnings season will not take the spotlight at least until the middle of January  but the reporting season has officially gotten underway already  with the AutoZone report on December 4th as the first reporter of this earnings season  AutoZone  which handily beat EPS and revenue estimates  reported results for its fiscal quarter ending in November  Two more S P 500 members  Costco and Adobe  will be releasing their November quarter results this week and will get counted as part of the Q4 tally 
Total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  12 7  from the same period last year on  5 8  higher revenues  which would follow the  25 6  earnings growth on  8 4  higher revenues in 2018 Q3 
Earnings growth is expected to be in double digits for 6 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy   83 5  growth   Finance   22 7    Construction   27   and Transportation   23 5   has the strongest growth  Tech sector earnings are expected to decelerate meaningfully in Q4  up  6 9   after back to back quarters of very strong growth 
Four sectors are expected to have lower earnings in Q4 relative to the year earlier period  namely Conglomerates   12 9  decline   Autos   13 5    Utilities   6 4   and Consumer Staples   0 5   
Whether we look at the growth picture on a quarterly basis or on a rolling quarter basis  there is no doubt that growth peak is now behind us  The question now is how much estimates for the coming quarters have still to come down  And the answer to that question will depend on the evolving economic backdrop that we discussed at the start

28935,250450,AZO,Dick s  DKS  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of DICK S Sporting Goods  DKS   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  39 75 in the previous session  DICK S Sporting Goods has gained 30 7  since the start of the year compared to the 6 6  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 18 8  return for the Zacks Retail   Miscellaneous industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 29  2018  Dick s reported EPS of  1 2 versus consensus estimate of  1 04 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 2 63  
For the current fiscal year  Dick s is expected to post earnings of  3 14 per share on  8 48 billion in revenues  This represents a 4 65  change in EPS on a  1 31  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 31 per share on  8 63 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 5 24  and 1 77   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Dick s may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Dick s has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 6 9X versus its peer group s average of 7 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 7  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Dick s currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Dick s passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Dick s shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Dick s Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Dick s have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including MarineMax  HZO   Tractor Supply  TSCO   and AutoZone  NYSE AZO   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 42  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Dick s  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-11-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dicks-dks-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200359617,200359617

28958,250473,AZO,What Makes AutoZone  AZO  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at AutoZone  NYSE AZO   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if AZO is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this auto parts retailer holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For AZO  shares are up 4 3  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry is down 0 6  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 11 56  compares favorably with the industry s 1 54  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of AutoZone have risen 6 93   and are up 29 54  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved  6 94  and 3 93   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to AZO s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  AZO is currently averaging 320 740 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with AZO 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AZO s consensus estimate  increasing from  57 82 to  57 93 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that AZO is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep AutoZone on your short list ",2018-11-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-autozone-azo-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200361725,200361725

29031,250546,AZO,AutoZone  AZO  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of AutoZone  NYSE AZO   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  802 22 in the previous session  AutoZone has gained 12 3  since the start of the year compared to the 9 9  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 30  return for the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on September 18  2018  AutoZone reported EPS of  18 54 versus consensus estimate of  17 88 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 76  
For the current fiscal year  AutoZone is expected to post earnings of  58 44 per share on  11 77 billion in revenues  This represents a 16 09  change in EPS on a 4 87  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  62 21 per share on  11 98 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 45  and 1 82   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
AutoZone may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
AutoZone has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 13 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 12 2X versus its peer group s average of 14 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 12  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if AutoZone fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though AutoZone shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does AutoZone Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of AutoZone have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Advance Auto Parts  AAP   Burlington Stores  BURL   and Stamps com  STMP   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 5  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AutoZone  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-11-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autozone-azo-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200357607,200357607

29102,250617,AZO,Can AutoZone  AZO  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  AutoZone  NYSE AZO   which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This auto parts retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 50  
For the most recent quarter  AutoZone was expected to post earnings of  17 88 per share  but it reported  18 54 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 69   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  12 99 per share  while it actually produced  13 42 per share  a surprise of 3 31  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for AutoZone  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AutoZone currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 08   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on December 4  2018 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-autozone-azo-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200354782,200354782
29103,250618,AZO,Ross Stores  ROST  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  101 4 in the previous session  Ross Stores has gained 26 2  since the start of the year compared to the 6 9  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 26 4  return for the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 23  2018  Ross Stores reported EPS of  1 04 versus consensus estimate of  1 01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 01  
For the current fiscal year  Ross Stores is expected to post earnings of  4 15 per share on  14 97 billion in revenues  This represents a 24 25  change in EPS on a 5 89  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 53 per share on  15 89 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 27  and 6 16   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Ross Stores may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Ross Stores has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 24 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 24 3X versus its peer group s average of 17 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 44  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Ross Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Ross Stores meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Ross Stores shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Ross Stores Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Ross Stores have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Target  TGT   Dollar General  DG   and AutoZone  NYSE AZO   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 35  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Ross Stores  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-11-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ross-stores-rost-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200355418,200355418

Here are the key points      The Q1 earnings season turned out to be very strong  with growth reaching a 7 year high and broad based momentum on the revenue side  The focus will now shift to the Q2 earnings season whose early results will start coming out in the next few days      Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  17 9  from the same period last year on  7 9  higher revenues  with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double digit earnings growth      For the 498 S P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already  total earnings are up  24 4  from the same period last year on  8 7  higher revenues  with 76 9  beating EPS estimates and 74 5  beating revenue estimates  The earnings season has ended for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors       Except for the proportion of these 498 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates  which are tracking roughly in line with the preceding quarter s level  growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods      Q1 Earnings growth was in double digit territory from the year earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors  including the Technology and Finance sectors  The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors  with  0 3  earnings growth on  1 4  higher revenues      Energy sector earnings increased  75 7  from the same period last year on  14 2  higher revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total S P 500 earnings growth drops from  24 4  to  22 7       For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q1 results from 96 7  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these companies are up  30 6  on  9 3  higher revenues  with 54 4  beating EPS estimates and 72 3  beating revenue estimates  In addition to earnings and revenue growth  revenue surprises are notably tracking above historical periods for the small caps      For full year 2018  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  19 6  on  6  higher revenues  For full years 2019 and 2020  earnings are expected to be up  9 6  and  9 7   respectively  Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by  4 5  in 2019  and  4 6  in 2020      The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2018 P E of 17 7X and index close  as of June 7th  is  156 64  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  171 75 for 2019  P E of 16 1X  and  188 40 for 2020  P E of 14 7X   The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year    Q2 earnings season ExpectationsWith the Q1 earnings season now effectively behind us  we are shifting our focus to the June quarter whose early results start coming out in the coming days  Most of these early results will be for companies with fiscal quarters ending in May  but they form part of our June quarter tally  The recent AutoZone  NYSE AZO     and Costco    reports fall in this category  We will have seen results from almost two dozen S P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out Q2 results on July 13th Total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  17 9  from the same period last year on  7 9  higher revenues  with double digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  including Finance and Technology  This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double digit earnings growth for the index  a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year earlier level  up  127 5   Excluding the Energy sector  Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up  14 8    The one concerning part is the lack of positive revisions to Q2 estimates since the quarter got underway  The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway  as the chart below shows 

This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season  A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts  But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well  This didn t happen  as the above chart shows There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either  as the chart below shows 

While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven t moved much  they haven t been that static at the sector level  with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up  On the negative revisions side  estimates for the Conglomerates  Construction  Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut On the positive side  the Energy sector really stands out  but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well  Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector s Q2 earnings estimates  aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods 

As you can see  the growth picture remains very strong  even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1 s lofty level  The worrying part isn t the seeming deceleration  but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond  This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U S  dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market s less than enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results

estimates  The earnings season has ended for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors      Except for the proportion of these 498 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates  which are tracking roughly in line with the preceding quarter s level  growth in Q1 is notably tracking above historical periods      Q1 Earnings growth was in double digit territory from the year earlier level for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors  including the Technology and Finance sectors  The Auto sector has the weakest growth of all 16 sectors  with  0 3  earnings growth on  1 4  higher revenues      Energy sector earnings increased  75 7  from the same period last year on  14 2  higher revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total S P 500 earnings growth drops from  24 4  to  22 7       For the small cap S P 600 index

29178,250693,AZO,What Will Q2 Earnings Season Bring ,opinion,"For most folks  an earnings season means the 4 to 6 week period at the end of each calendar quarter when earnings announcements dominate market headlines  For us  however  who have to monitor and record each and every earnings release  the definition and duration of each earnings season isn t that simple  Take for example  the 8 S P 500 members coming out with quarterly results this week Since we are still a couple of weeks away from the end of the June quarter  most folks would assume that all of these reports represent the tail of the 2018 Q1 earnings season  The reality is that all of these reports get counted as part of the Q2 earnings season  For example  the Oracle    and FedEx    reports on Wednesday are for those companies  fiscal quarters that ended in May  which will form part of our Q2 earnings tally  Looked at this way  the Q2 earnings season actually got underway with the Costco    and AutoZone  NYSE AZO     earnings releases with the tally reaching almost two dozen S P 500 members by the time the big banks  unofficially  kick off the earnings season on July 13th The weekly reporting calendar  below  for the S P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another four weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off 

Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  18 2  from the same period last year on  7 9  higher revenues  with double digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  This would follow  24 3  earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on  7 2  revenues  the highest growth in almost 7 years The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations  As you can see  the growth rate has ticked up a bit  but nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season 

A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes  which was obviously a one off development  Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes  we would have seen only EPS estimates go up  with no changes to revenue estimates  But that wasn t the case  as revenue estimates had gone up as well  which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction But as the chart above shows  we didn t see much in positive revisions  In other words  while the overall growth picture remains very strong   there is no other way to describe  18 2  quarterly earnings growth   there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond  The recent strength in the exchange value of the U S  dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding  June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors  The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology  Energy  Medical  Industrial Products  Basic Materials  Business Services  and Retail  Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector  reflecting momentum in oil prices  Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector  the aggregate revisions picture for the S P 500 index would be in negative territory The table below shows the summary picture for Q2  contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q14  please note that we have not officially closed the books on Q1 yet  as 2 index members still have to report quarterly results  

The chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters 

Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter s impressive level  the overall level of total earnings is in record territory  as the chart below shows

29179,250694,AZO,Is AutoZone  AZO  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AutoZone  Inc    NYSE AZO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AutoZone has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  AutoZone s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AutoZone has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AutoZone stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AutoZone has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  AZO is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AutoZone currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AutoZone a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for AutoZone is just 0 9  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 2  which is better than the industry average of 15 2  Clearly  AZO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though AutoZone might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A  This gives AZO a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current fiscal quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen nine upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 1  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AutoZone  Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though AutoZone has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAutoZone is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 21   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-06-17,Zacks Investment

Most recently  data from Trade Alert pegs the implied daily earnings move at 8  for AZO stock  higher than the post earnings next day swing of 4 9  the stock has averaged over the last two years  These earnings reactions have mostly been to the downside  including the two most recent  Of those eight results  just three were large enough to exceed the move expected for tomorrow s trading    a 9 5  drop in May  an 11 1  plunge in February  and an 11 8  slide in May 2017

29198,250713,AZO,Here s My No  1 Stock Market Prediction  And A 7 2  Dividend To Buy Now ,opinion,"A game changing story about stocks just broke and you almost certainly missed it 
That s why I m writing about this surprising news today  because it s just what you need to know if you re struggling with how to approach this interest rate obsessed market  especially in the wake of the recent pullback 
Why haven t you heard it 
Because good news like this doesn t grab as much attention as Chicken Little panic articles  so the financial press skips it  But what I m about to tell you is crucial to your financial well being and something I ve been saying on Contrarian Outlook and in our CEF Insider service for months now 
Luckily  not everyone is ignoring the story  Bloomberg Businessweek just wrote an in depth analysis of this piece of news  which is simply this  fears of a recession are way overblown  and the market is set for strong gains in the months ahead 
 In a moment  I ll reveal a fund set to roll higher as the market surprises the doomsayers and takes off  Best of all  this ignored fund pays a safe 6 9  dividend  
I was glad to read this upbeat news  because it echoes a piece I wrote over a year ago  The theme of that article was simple  there are several clear recession indicators and none of them have been in the danger zone for a while  Fast forward to today and they still aren t and aren t likely to be for a long time 
First  let s take a look at the data Bloomberg compiled  as you can see  the chances of a recession happening in the next 0 to 12 months have nosedived 
Doomsday Predictions Turn Sunny
Also note that chances of a recession happening in the next two to three years have also plummeted  bringing all readings except for the 12  to 24 month one to at or near their lowest levels in the last couple years 
Taking this at face value  it seems the chances of a recession happening soon are diminishing 
But let s dig a little deeper  What exactly is the data being charted by these lines  Bloomberg s recession predictor blends a lot of information  but the factor that has caused the red and black lines above to fall steeply is US Treasuries 
The Yield Curve Horror
A couple weeks ago  I took a close look at the  yield curve panic  that has been facing markets in 2018  If you were paying attention in February and March  when the markets sold off  you ll remember that the bears couldn t stop talking about the flattening yield curve specifically  the difference between 2 year and 10 year Treasury yields 
When this yield curve inverts  or when 2 year yields are higher than 10 year yields   a recession tends to follow in the next 12 months  And that curve has gotten flatter throughout 2018 up until my article a couple weeks ago  which said that  An inverted yield   isn t coming yet  
Recession Indicator Pulls a 180
Notice how this isn t the first time that downward trend suddenly saw a reversal  The same thing happened in February 
But this time is different 
Back then  the widening yield curve happened during a sharp  sudden decline in stocks  and while stocks have had a rough few days  the decline we ve seen  as I write  we re just 6 7  down from the all time high the S P 500 set on September 20  is still well below the 10 1  plunge we saw in February  What s more  compared to February  the current market downturn has lasted longer and been much less severe 

To call this the start of a bear market is just silly  What we are seeing over the longer term is a new trend  higher stock prices happening alongside a steeper yield curve 
This is a really good pattern to see 
Steep yield curves indicate higher expectations for inflation and  more crucially  economic growth  Just as negative yield curves are the market saying a recession is going to come  a positive yield curve is the market saying growth is going to get faster 
And what benefits when the economy is growing faster  Stocks 
A 6 9  Dividend From Your Favorite Blue Chips
So what should you buy 
An index fund like the S P 500 SPDR ETF  SPY  NYSE SPY   would get you exposure to the stocks that will win in such a market  but you can compound your gains and get a higher total return by buying an equity fund that s trading at a large discount to its portfolio value  or NAV 
While ETFs almost never trade below their NAVs  closed end funds  CEFs  do and that unusual inefficiency in CEFs is an opportunity for contrarian investors to get high quality stocks at a discount 
For example  the Dividend   Income Fund  NYSE DNI  has a 7 2  dividend yield while also holding high quality stocks like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   CVS Health  NYSE CVS  and AutoZone  NYSE AZO   but it trades at an almost unthinkable 24 8  discount to NAV  meaning  1 of those shares is up for sale with DNI for just 75 2 cents 
DNI isn t the only fund with many high quality companies in its portfolio and a double digit discount  Right now  our CEF Insider service is keeping tabs on 37 US equity CEFs with discounts of 10  or more and 27 of those funds have yields above 5   or roughly 3 times what SPY pays 
I think the choice here is obvious  And here s the best news  I ve got 4 more CEFs for you today that boast even higher dividends than DNI  
My 4 Top CEFs to Buy Now  7 1  dividends and fast 20   gains ahead 
I m talking about 4 funds throwing off a 7 1  average dividend yield  with the 2 highest payers throwing off near 8  cash payouts   
All 4 also trade at unbelievable discounts to NAV as I write this 
I say  unbelievable  because these markdowns are far wider than normal and they simply must return to their usual levels  it s the  law of gravity  in CEF land   When they do  they ll ignite these 4 funds  share prices and catapult us to easy 20   price upside in the next 12 months 
And that s not even the best part 
Unbeatable Nest Egg Protection
This is  even if these latest recession predictions somehow turn out wrong and the market falls out of bed tomorrow  you re still covered  Because these 4 funds give us crucial  insurance   they re already so heavily discounted that they ll simply trade flat 
And we ll still collect their massive 7 1  average dividends 
Plus  these 4 bargain CEFs also pay dividends monthly  so your cash stream will perfectly line up with your bills  Or you can reinvest your dividends faster than you would if you were getting quarterly payouts  further boosting your gains and income stream 
Add it all up and you re looking at 27   in gains and dividends over the next 12 months  with a nice chunk of that profit in CASH thanks to the outsized 7 1  average payout on these 4 unsung funds 
Many investors know that this is the right way to invest for retirement  But they don t know where to find the 7   dividends and upside to get there  That s where CEFs like these 4 come in 
Click here and I ll show you all 4 of these cash rich funds  including their names  ticker symbols  buy under prices and everything you need to know before you buy

Commentary I was right  until the very last day when all at once the market reversed almost all its accumulated worries 

The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   bounced back from yet another test of still uptrending 200DMA support  Friday s 1 3  gain put it within yet another encounter with downtrending resistance from its 50DMA 


The 1 7  gain in the NASDAQ was enough to nick 50DMA resistance 


The 1 9  gain for the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  was enough to break through 50DMA resistance 
As usual  there are a host of catalysts to cherry pick to explain what happened  a   showing strong growth but wage growth  weaker than expected   b   between Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and China s state owned Datang Telecom Technology Co  in a hopeful sign of thawing trade tensions between the U S  and China  and or c  news that Warren Buffett added another 75 millions shares to his investment in Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  bringing his share of Apple s stocks to a notable 5  
I could be missing some catalysts  and conveniently ignoring something the market also ignored on the day   but I will focus in on AAPL since in my last Above the 40 post earlier post I noted how AAPL s repeated pre earnings failure to break through 200DMA resistance was a sentiment killer  I even   gasp   flipped puts several times and used this behavior as part of my argument to remain cautiously bearish on the market 
The story with AAPL is simple now  The stock made a new all time high  It completely reversed the last iPhone panic  It is one of the few big cap tech stocks which sustained a positive post earnings response  It has major backing from a major investor of influence  The company is pumping a literal tidal wave of cash into the hands of shareholders through another  100B in its buyback and another dividend hike  These are not the tailwinds to fight  They are the tailwinds to ride 

Apple  AAPL  ended an incredible week with a 3 9  gain on Friday alone  The week that finally produced a new all time high also delivered a whopping 13 3  gain 
At this point  pretty much only fresh news of China vs  U S  trade tensions could stand in AAPL s way in the coming weeks and months  Yet  while AAPL s stellar performance tempts me  I am not yet ready to declare the all clear for the stock market 
I have a few stubborn reasons left for staying cautiously bearish the market in general  The S P 500 remains firmly stuck in a triangle pattern  I need to see the index close above the peak from the last 50DMA breakout AND show follow through buying  My favorite technical indicator  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  was very weak until Friday 
Even with the S P 500 making another amazing 200DMA comeback on Thursday  AT40 closed at a 3 week low  At 53 5   AT40 has more upside  but it is still in  show me  mode after a bearish rejection from the 70  overbought threshold on April 19th  Finally  the S P 500 has now responded poorly to the last three meetings from the Federal Reserve  In other words  I think it is very possible AAPL powers higher without dragging much of the general market with it as investors and traders seeking  safety  in equities bias their money toward AAPL and away from a lot of other options 
The volatility index  the VIX  is at a critical juncture  It jumped around the 15 35 pivot all week only to close at 14 8  If downward momentum continues  I will have to assume bullish sentiment is similarly growing  I was fortunate during the week to sell my last tranche of call options in ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  for a small profit and then quickly flip through a short position in iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Exp 30 Jan 2019  NYSE VXX   I bought a new tranche of UVXY calls near Friday s close 

The volatility index  the VIX  looks ready to cave to downward pressure as the hold of the 15 35 pivot weakens   Note I think the long tail is a charting pricing error  
CHART REVIEWS
Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG 
The wait continues  CMG has calmed down since its amazing post earnings pop  I am itching to pounce long  I just need to see the stock trade over the intraday high of a previous trading day  I let Friday s high go though  A hit in SwingTradeBot s  calm after the storm  stock scan would seal my resolve to dive in 

Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG  spent the week stabilizing  It looks like a coiling spring 
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT 
CAT joined the S P 500  SPY  in a resounding defense of 200DMA support  I used the last two days to return to using CAT as a hedge against more market malaise  Despite Friday s 1 8  gain  CAT did not quite make a post earnings high 

Caterpillar  CAT  survived a major test of the on going downtrend from January s all time high with an immediate bounce off 200DMA support 
Boeing  NYSE BA 
Despite my bearishness  I could not resist testing BA s relatively consistent behavior when it neared the bottom of its trading range  Sure enough  I was able to sell my call options at a profit after the stock made a 180 off support from the range  I will be looking to buy puts when if BA hits the top of the range regardless of my trading call at the time 

Boeing  BA  remains well defined by its 2018 trading range 
Cboe Global Markets  Inc   NASDAQ CBOE 
I invested in CBOE for a longer term trade  so I am trying not to get distracted by its on going technical weakness  CBOE closed at a post earnings and 8 month low  If it closes below February s intraday low  I will likely have to rethink my thesis and the investment in it 

Cboe Global Markets  Inc   CBOE  is back in bearish territory with a second confirmation of its 200DMA breakdown and notable weakness relative to the general stock market 
Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF 
The surprising weakness in CBOE parallels the lackluster performance of financials  On Thursday  XLF broke down below its 200DMA support  Unlike the S P 500  it failed to bounce back  XLF s breakdown seemed to add a confirmation to my short term cautious bearishness  It took Friday s big market rally to drag financials kicking and screaming out of the bearish abyss  XLF gained 1 3  on the day  I remain leery 

Despite a rebound above 200DMA resistance  the Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  still looks broken 
Autozone  NYSE AZO 
In my previous Above the 40 post  I noted my surprise that AZO received tepid sympathy lift from the stellar post earnings response in O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY   With the S P 500 snapping back and AZO trading above its 200DMA  I decided to rush in with a position  My move turned out to be very timely as AZO soared on Friday as much as 3   I sold my call option for 3 5x what I paid 
While I was prepared to hold the call option for the two weeks left until expiration  I followed the rule to sell options which double or more in price very quickly after purchase  It is a profit preservation rule that assumes such quick gains are hard to sustain  Needless to say  AZO is going to stay on my radar all the way through its next earnings report on May 22nd  I expect to have a bullish position ahead of those earnings if the stock remains around current levels 

Autozone  AZO  gained 2 1  and a 7 week closing high  This move looks like a very convincing breakout above converged 50 and 200DMA resistance 

Logitech  NASDAQ LOGI 
I heaved a major sigh of relief when LOGI popped post earnings over its 50DMA resistance  My position is back in the green after buying the second tranche of stock ahead of earnings  and I think my longer term bullish thesis on this trade remains intact 

Logitech  LOGI  fell 1 2  to close the week  but I remain optimistic that its latest post earnings pop refreshed the bullish momentum for the stock 

Fluor  NYSE FLR 
I breathed a sign of relief for a different reason in FLR  When material stocks bearishly broke down in late March  I sold my long standing position in FLR as a precaution  On Friday  FLR imploded by 22 4  after reporting earnings that clearly disappointed investors bigtime  I am now looking for an excuse to buy back in  but I have not yet had time to investigate the earnings news 

Fluor  FLR  gapped down well below its 50 and 200DMAs and closed at a near 6 month low  In just one day  the stock lost around half of its impressive recovery from an 8 year low in August  2017 

Pandora  NYSE P 
For the first time ever  I am getting bullish feelings about Pandora  The stock gapped up 19 8  after reporting earnings  The move easily cleared 200DMA resistance and a 6 month trading range in place since Pandora s last post earnings disaster  At its high of the day  P almost closed the gap from its previous collapse  Importantly  bears are all over Pandora with 31  of its float still sold short 

It looks like the bottom is FINALLY in for Pandora  P   A fresh post earnings high should confirm the signal 
Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA 
It took me too long  but I returned to the bullish camp on ULTA this week  I covered an ill fated short the previous week and bought the pullback to the lower part of the uptrend channel through the upper Bollinger Bands  BBs   The 2 8  gain on Friday seemed to confirm the wisdom of my change in heart 

Ulta Beauty  ULTA  looks like it is in accumulation mode with a near relentless upward push through its upper Bollinger Bands  BBs  
Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN 
If AMZN resumes its upward push  I will be hard pressed to stick to my bearish biases on the general stock market  AMZN is surviving its gap and crap post earnings move with a stabilization in its shares  The stock looks ready to climb up its upper BB  As a reminder I bought a calendar call spread in AMZN as a hedge against my bearishness  Now I find myself near ready to root for the bulls ",2018-05-06,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-apple-temptation-of-the-stock-market-200313423,200313423
29209,250724,AZO,A Different Kind Of Amazon com Panic For Auto Parts Retailers,opinion,"Another day  another Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  panic 

 Sears Auto Centers announced today that it is working with Amazon com to provide full service tire installation and balancing for customers who purchase any brand of tires on Amazon com  The service will be rolling out to customers across the U S  over the coming weeks 
With this collaboration  Sears Auto will become the first nationwide auto service center to offer Amazon com customers the convenient Ship to Store tire solution integrated into the Amazon com checkout process no matter what brand of tire is purchased on Amazon com  Sears Auto Center s 2 100 highly skilled technicians will provide installation and conduct a free multi point Performance Snapshot on the vehicle to ensure 100  customer satisfaction     from  

Traders immediately sought to punish any stock caught in the wake of this announcement  The Sears news was reminiscent of rumors in January  2017 that AMZN would enter the auto parts market  and stocks like AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  and O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY  dropped sharply 2 7  and 2 6  respectively  Yet  the final tally was different than other AMZN panics  Most of the stocks snared in the headlines recovered quickly and completely the same day of the initial panic 

Autozone  AZO  dropped back to converged 50 and 200DMAs but support held firmly as buyers sent AZO to a 0 5  GAIN for the day 


O reilly Automotive  ORLY  dropped to the bottom of its recent uptrend channel before bouncing  ORLY ended with a 0 1  loss 
The technicals won over panic in these stocks  AZO turned in a picture perfect test of 50 and 200 day moving average  DMA  trend lines  I was too slow to enter a fresh trade  with call options  as I had planned if AZO dipped again ahead of earnings  ORLY demonstrated that the strength of its last earnings report still holds sway over traders and investors  The stock s rebound did not quite result in a gain for the day  but the steady move higher remains intact  ORLY still looks on track to challenge its 2018 high 
Monro Muffler Brake Inc  NASDAQ MNRO  was not so lucky  Buyers only tentatively stepped into MNRO after the stock pushed through its 200DMA support  The 50DMA support barely slowed down the sellers  MNRO lost 7 8  and is now about 5  above where it closed after October earnings  Note that  50 26 level held as support during the February sell off 

Monro  MNRO  closed right at its 200DMA  The trendline has held as support in 2018 
MNRO weighed heavily because the company was supposedly the anointed one for AMZN s ambitions to distribute tires   On October 24  2017  during a morning earnings conference call   that his company was talking to AMZN about a tire installation partnership  MNRO gapped down steeply from the open and rallied enough for a flat close 
Yet  the stock never closed higher until more than a month later  In other words  it seems doubtful that the market was all that excited by the potential deal  The contrast intrigued me enough to take a flyer on call options as a bet the stock will recover  or start to recover  in the next week 
The MNRO sellers must have rushed to Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD  as that stock gained 15 9  for the day  It was up as much as 25  at the intraday high  The fade was an echo back to July 20  2017 when SHLD announced a deal with AMZN to sell Kenmore Appliances  The stock popped  faded  and the sellers kept on pushing the stock down from there  SHLD is down a whopping 66 7  since that announcement  In this latest announcement  SHLD talked of DieHard products AMZN added to its site in December and February  duly noted that AMZN also sells    Something tells me that another AMZN panic is due to expire

29213,250728,AZO,Auto Stock Roundup  March Sales Up  TSLA Production Grows  GM To End Monthly Report,opinion,"The auto sector staged a comeback in March after sagging sales performance in February  A majority of automakers reported a rise in their March U S  sales  A robust economy  product launches and fat discounts enabled auto players to witness a year over year rise in new vehicle sales  Even concerns over high interest rates and elevated gasoline prices could not deter Americans  new found liking for sport utility vehicles  SUVs  and pickup trucks  albeit at the cost of sedans and passenger cars Per Autodata  auto industry sales rose 2 5  to 1 653 529 while new vehicle sales gained 6  in March  Moreover  the seasonally adjusted annual rate  SAAR  was 17 5 million in comparison to 16 8 million  a year ago Also  during the week  just prior to the March sales release  General Motors Company   NYSE GM   reportedly said that it will do away with the age old monthly sales report in favor of quarterly reporting  The U S  auto giant is of the opinion that 30 days is too short to absorb short term volatility  therefore rendering the monthly figures exaggerated  It feels that the quarterly reporting system would better provide the correct picture of the health of the company as well as that of the industry Also  the electric vehicles  EVs  maker  Tesla  Inc    NASDAQ TSLA   published its production figures for first quarter 2018  which totaled 34 494 vehicles  up 40  sequentially  This happens to be the most productive quarter in the history of Tesla  Out of the total vehicles produced  24 728 were Model S and Model X  and 9 766 were Model 3  The Model 3 output increased significantly on a sequential basis  However  the company missed its target of producing 2 500 Model 3s a week by the end of first quarter 2018  Actually  it produced 2020 Model 3 cars over the last seven days  Despite the production target miss  the first quarter 2018 performance of Tesla looks encouraging  Read the previous roundup here   Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Per Fox Business  Tesla has announced that it will voluntarily recall 123 000 of its luxury Model S sedans across the globe to fix the issue of faulty steering components The Palo Alto  CA based company stated that the recall includes Model S vehicles built before April 2016 and is devoid of any Model X or Model 3 versions  The company explained that it has detected  excessive corrosion  in the power steering bolts of the recalled vehicles  This glitch might result in reduced power steering The EV maker will repair damages by replacing the specific bolts in the power steering component  The company has also intimated its plans to contact the affected customers directly for scheduling an appointment once the parts are available in their respective regions However  the recent recall has further added to Tesla s woes  which is already grappling with several challenges  particularly with respect to the production of Model 3 sedan  the low cost EV targeting the mass market   Read more   Tesla carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  2     In a pioneering move  General Motors has reportedly taken the decision to abandon its usual practice of reporting sales on a monthly basis in favor of quarterly reporting  The U S  auto giant is of the opinion that sales releases every month do not provide the true picture of the company s intricate operations or the health of the auto industry  as it includes short term fluctuations  However  per management  quarterly sales releases will give a better idea about the same Abandoning monthly sales reports can be attributed to a number of factors  It has been witnessed that the effect of volatility does not smoothen adequately in the 30 day period  This has sometimes resulted in exaggerated monthly sales figures  According to the automaker  incentive campaigns  abnormal weather or product launches tilt monthly sales figures up or down However  the company intends to provide investors and others a less volatile  longer term metric to evaluate its performance  Replacing the monthly cycle with a quarterly one is likely to aid the company in this respect  This is echoed in the statement of Kurt McNeil  General Motors  U S  vice president for sales operations   Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short term fluctuations in a very dynamic  highly competitive market   McNeil further said   Reporting sales quarterly better aligns with our business  and the quality of information will make it easier to see how the business is performing    Read more   General Motors sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  3     CarMax Inc    NYSE KMX   posted earnings per share of 67 cents in the fourth

29214,250729,AZO,The Bears Engulf An Otherwise Uplifting Week For The Stock Market,opinion,"AT40   45 9  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   44 0  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   17 4Short term Trading Call  neutral
Commentary The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained 2 0  for the week  Yet the week felt like a loser given the way it ended  The S P 500 dropped marginally on Friday  just 0 3   but the close represented a fade from a gain and a near test of downtrending resistance at the 50 day moving average  DMA  

The S P 500  SPY  melted in the face of 50DMA resistance as a Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze starts to form 
That sinking feeling really came from the financials  Several big banks reported earnings  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  and Citigroup  NYSE C  came out the gate strong with gaps up  While Citigroup rammed right into resistance at its downtrending 50DMA  JPM seemed to confirm the previous day s 50DMA breakout  Sellers took over from there for the rest of the day  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  gapped DOWN at the open and ended the day with a 3 4  loss and a new 7 month low 
The end result for the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  was a bearish engulfing pattern that started with a gap up to unyielding declining 50DMA resistance  I cannot see anything better than more churn ahead with the financials failing this important test of earnings season  My XLF calls went from near even to slashed in half  I only held on to see whether the financial earnings in the coming week can help salvage things 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  is stuck between slowly converging resistance from its 50DMA and support from its 200DMA  The bearish engulfing print warns of a negative outcome of the convergence 
The main positive from XLF is that  so far  it is surviving the critical test presented from the March 23rd plunge toward 200DMA support that practically stopped on a dime 
Tech stocks also suffered a bearish engulfing end to the week that confirmed powerful resistance at declining 50DMAs  Unlike XLF  the NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  are still trading above the big up day on April 4th that seemed to confirm 200DMA support  In fact  an uptrend from those lows remains in place and a distinct V pattern can provide some hope to bulls that a breakthrough can still happen in the near future 

The NASDAQ still has upward momentum from its test of 200DMA support despite the setback at 50DMA resistance 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  is in the same boat with the NASDAQ 
Small caps are in the best position  A bearish engulfing pattern did not tank the iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  back below its 50DMA 
The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  made a bullish breakout this week  A bearish engulfing conclusion to the week may have brought that bullish move to an end for now 
The big surprise of the day was the volatility index  the VIX  Even with the fade underway across the stock market AND despite going into a weekend full of geo political uncertainty over Syria and the political uncertainty around the latest round of  Trump versus Comey   the VIX could not hold traction  The VIX lost 5 9   closed at its low of the day  and finally confirmed the reversal of the surge on March 22nd  When the VIX bounced early in the day  I decided to take profits on my short in iPath S P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN  NYSE VXX  
I assumed that I would be able to short again at a higher price later in the day or on Monday  Now I am not so sure   I still see VXX eventually returning to its all time low and beyond  so I see great risk reward here   Still wary  I decided to load up on call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  at the end of the day 

The volatility index  the VIX  went into the weekend limping and burdened by the growing pressure of a downward bias 


The iPath S P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN  VXX  may have finally topped out but still has a ways to go to reverse the big surge from the VIX s largest percentage gain ever 


The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  has failed multiple times at its declining 200DMA resistance  It closed below its now sharply increasing 50DMA for the first time in over 2 months 

And then there is the currency market  Remarkably  the currency market seems relatively unconcerned with the chop in the stock market  The Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  has powered higher since its March low  AUD JPY surged the last two days and even broke out above declining 50DMA resistance  Like the stock market  AUD JPY ended the week with a big fade  I was tempted  but I avoided re shorting the currency pair  I see no point in using it as a hedge at this juncture  Instead  I will wait to short into weakness  like a fresh  confirmed  breakdown below its 50DMA 

AUD JPY survived a test of its 2017 lows  but has the rally come to a screeching halt with the bearish fade to end the week 
Finally  there is AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  AT40 closed the week at 45 9   At its high  AT40 matched the high from March  its highest point since the big bounce from February s oversold conditions  So even with the bears making a strong statement to end the week  the market in general is still on the edge of a major  bullish breakthrough  One week after fighting off the barbarians posturing at critical 200DMA support  the S P 500 needs just one more spark to get its big breakthrough  If earnings season fails to provide this spark  look out for May 
CHART REVIEWS
Boeing  NYSE BA  In a choppy weel  it was a relief to find a consistent trade in Boeing  BA   True to form  BA bounced up and down like a yo yo in a tight formation  Given I am using it as a hedge against bullishness  I faded each bounce and closed out the position on the next drawdown  I closed out my latest put a little early on Friday 

Boeing  BA  completed a third week of chop tightly capped by its 50DMA and supported by the February intraday lows 

Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   NASDAQ BBBY  After I started tempering my expectations for the 2018 trade in retail stocks  I continued to hang on to Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY   The stock looked relatively resilient as it stuck to a trading range that  despite the slight downward bias  looked like it could be providing consolidation  A 20 0  plunge in reaction to the latest earnings report starkly reminded me that there will be no tide that lifts all boats for retail this year  I will be exiting this stock in the coming week  Note that BBBY last traded this low in the throes of the financial crisis 

A fresh post earnings collapse for Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   BBBY  and a fresh 9  year low 

Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  Caterpillar  CAT  met stiff resistance at its downtrending 50DMA  I added two more put options to my hedge against bullishness  The next CAT sell off  if one comes  should create a direct test of support at the uptrending 200DMA 

A 50DMA rejection keeps a downtrend from the all time intact for Caterpillar  CAT 
Lennar  NYSE LEN  Lennar looked great for all of two days after a tremendous post earnings response  The sellers took over from there for every single day except to end trading this week  This was a stunning 100  reversal of a big post earnings gain  For a minute  it looked like the homebuilders were ready to rally again with LEN s big breakout  After accumulating a fresh position of call options in LEN  I reinstituted pause on housing plays 

Lennar  LEN  is back where it started before its last earnings report  The stock is back to the lows of 2018 for a third time  Can support hold yet again 
KB Home  NYSE KBH  I had to put another pause on housing related plays because LEN s reversal reminded me of the catastrophic reversal that KBH experienced after January earnings  That selling was like the early topping signal for the sector and even the stock market  Sellers faded the last earnings report even faster than January s  I bought more call options on KBH in the wake of LEN s good earnings  I was encouraged by the 50DMA breakout the next day  Sellers essentially took over again from there and poof went my quick profits  I am trying to stay optimistic that the return to consolidation is firming up support at the 200DMA 

KB Home  KBH  is getting squeezed between a downtrending 50DMA and uptrending 200DMA 

Autozone  NYSE AZO  and O reilly  NASDAQ ORLY Back on December 13th  I suggested Jim Cramer was a little late pointing out the bottoming in the stocks of auto parts retailers  The stocks had one more burst in January  a month that made all of us with almost any bullish opinion look like geniuses   but now they trade below those mid December levels  ORLY is down 6 5  year to date and is struggling to hold on to critical 200DMA support  AZO is faring a lot worse  the stock is down 14 7  year to date and sliced right through 200DMA support to start the month of April  Now that I have the pullbacks I wanted to start a fresh position  I find myself wary of what looks like freshly persistent weakness  sharply declining 50DMAs and failing 200DMA supports  I will stay content to wait for the next round of earnings before making any trades here 

Autozone  AZO  seriously technical issues  The last earnings generated a sharp breakdown from a head and shoulders top  Now the stock is breaking down below 200DMA support with rapidly declining 20 and 50DMAs 


O Reilly Automotive  Inc   ORLY  experienced an increase in volume as it tested 200DMA support  Can the stock regain momentum 
Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE  Energy stocks look like they are waking up from their collective slumber  XLE made a convincing breakout on Tuesday with a gap above its 50 and 200DMAs and a close above the recent consolidation range  I loaded up on call options on Thursday in anticipation of a run up similar to the last 50 200DMA breakout

The big slam has yet to come in the form of a definitive breakout or breakdown  Since the January all time high  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   has chopped widely and sometimes wildly  If not for the context  I would have claimed the chart below is quite encouraging  The S P 500 has held a breakout above its 50 day moving average  DMA  for the longest period since the February swoon   now 10 days and counting  The index broke out from its short term downtrend from the all time high  Moreover  this latest move is the FIRST time the index has managed to trade higher than its high the day of a Fed monetary policy meeting 

Most things considered  the S P 500  SPY  is sneaking into a bullish posture 
The NASDAQ and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  are also holding breakouts  granted these moves are much less impressive than their abilities to mark new all time highs in the first bounceback from the February swoon  The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  is still impressive despite a 0 7  pullback from an all time high   a move that may have ended the upward momentum for May 

The NASDAQ s 50DMA breakout has stalled out over the last 9 trading days 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  has stalled out similarly to the NASDAQ 


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  is experiencing an impressive May run up even with today s 0 7  pullback 
Yet  here on the cusp of confirming broad bullishness  the stock market is failing  Buyers still cannot muster enough force to push the market into overbought territory as defined by AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  AT40 above 70  marks an overbought market  On Tuesday  AT40 got as high as 69 7   In   Tuesday s action is mildly bearish  A further pullback from current levels will confirm a bearish change in sentiment 


AT40  T2108  pulled back ominously from the overbought threshold of 70  
Laying in wait for a decision is the volatility index  the VIX  The fear gauge looks like it is finally tired of going down  It has held its ground for 8 trading days  Combined with AT40 s ominous pullback  I loaded up on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  call options 

The volatility index  the VIX  is trying to hold current low levels 
Given the headlines and macro events  I recognize that the technicals could all change again in a flash  However  given the market s record on pullbacks from the overbought threshold  I am putting the buyers and the bulls in the  show me  box 
The currency market confirmed new yellow flags  The Swiss franc  NYSE FXF  suddenly keeps getting stronger  The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  dropped sharply on the day  At the time of writing  this important indicator of sentiment is still selling off vigorously 

AUD JPY is flashing fresh caution signs as the jump from May lows comes to an abrupt end 
CHART REVIEWS
Boeing  NYSE BA  BA is right back in the hotseat  After the stock gapped up and gained 3 6  on news that the U S  and China hit the pause button on trade war tariffs  BA appeared to confirm the bullish tidings I described in the last AT40 post  The trade fairies giveth  and they taketh away  With President Trump refreshing the specter of trade disagreements  BA went into freefall  I was quick to jump on a put option ahead of BA s close and a loss of 2 5  on the day Monday s gap is almost filled 

Boeing  BA  not only plunged back into its impressive gap up but also it pulled back sharply from a test of all time highs 
Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  Perhaps the most disappointing news on the day was the market s reaction to TOL s earnings  The stock lost an incredible 9 6  to close at an 8 month low  TOL s big breakout in September is completely gone now  The bearish sentiment and trading action made me very relieved that  as planned  I finally gave up on most of my home builder positions on Monday  I will write more about the fresh carnage in home builders in my next Housing Market Review  Five Point Holdings  NYSE FPH  is my last home builder  and I even ADDED to it  

The chart says it all   Toll Brothers  TOL  has imploded as investors and traders can t seem to sell fast enough 
Autozone  NYSE AZO  AZO was a whirlwind  I missed out on the call spread that I wanted to buy ahead of earnings  I kicked myself a second time when I saw the first reaction to AZO s earnings  the stock soared right to and then past my  490 target on its way to a quick  710 intraday high  If I had a position  I would have had to sell quickly  After the conference call got underway  sellers overwhelmed the stock almost all the way to the close  AZO finished the day at its low and  602  a head spinning 100 point swing  I decided to speculate on a call spread into the teeth of the carnage  I just need a recovery back to 50 or 200DMA resistance 

Autozone  AZO  had one of the most vicious post earnings fades I can imagine  The market took the stock from  pole to pole  on its way to a massive bearish engulfing post earnings pattern 
Monro  NASDAQ MNRO  MNRO was another post earnings loser  The stock is not only below its 200DMA support  but also it made a fresh post Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  panic low  I am NOT looking to buy the dip again just yet 

Monro  MNRO  lost 8 4  in a post earnings move that put right it below 200DMA support 
Best Buy  NYSE BBY  Perhaps it was just a very bad day for retail with too many earnings reports for the market to properly digest  BBY was dumped for a 3 6  loss on no ostensible news  With volume picking up on the last 5 days of down trading  BBY looks like it has brought to an end the steady momentum that dominated its trading since the March low  I will be watching earnings before market on Thursday  May 24th 

Best Buy  BBY  lost 3 6  on high volume in a move that looks like topping action 
Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  Given the poor showing in retail  it was probably appropriate that I decided to take profits in ULTA  I have not liked the trading action ever since I triumphantly pointed out the breakout that I thought confirmed ULTA s comeback  I finally got impatient with the choppy topping action and took profits here ahead of earnings on May 31st next week 

Since its primary upward momentum ended  Ulta Beauty  ULTA  has chopped a lot and traded down more days than traded up

29248,250763,AZO,A Manic Stock Market Instantly Forgets Its Italian Angst,opinion,"AT40   66 9  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   54 3  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAs  a near 4 month high VIX   14 9Short term Trading Call  neutral
Commentary Oh the hazards of changing short term trading calls in this churning market  Reluctantly  I switched my short term trading call from neutral to bearish after Tuesday s sell off drove AT40  T2108  out of its May uptrend with a lower low  My rules forced the issue  Fortunately  Wednesday s trading opened so strongly that I barely had a chance to act on my bearish trading call  After doubling down on Boeing  NYSE BA  put options  I took a step back and recognized the sellers and bears were beating a hasty retreat  While nothing on the ground in Italy changed  perceptions of its importance clearly changed  The currency markets confirmed the change in mood with the euro  NYSE FXE  snapping back and the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  quickly reversing 
By the close of trading  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gained 1 3  and neatly closed Tuesday s gap down  The NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  were just strong enough to make new 2 1 2 month highs  Small caps led the way with the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  gaining 1 6  and a fresh all time high 

The S P 500  SPY  looks rallied well but it remains stuck in the muck of May s churning highs 


The NASDAQ needs to keep powering higher to avoid printing a potential head and shoulders top 


Ditto for the PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ   a head and shoulder top looms if the buying momentum does not continue from here 


The Shares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  looks as strong as ever  What pullback 

Needless to say  I snapped my short term trading call right back to neutral  It is not bullish because  even though small caps look great  the fat cat indices still have a lot to prove as described in the charts above  Moreover  AT40  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs  has yet to confirm buying strength by flipping into overbought territory  over 70    In fact  the last two rejections from the overbought threshold have taught  reminded  me that I need to get bearish upon the first rejection rather than wait for confirmation  The confirmations keep coming toward the tail end of the bearish run 
AT40 soared from 58 4  to 66 9   Stocks clearly participated broadly in the rally  AT200  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  stood out  AT200 jumped three percentage points to a level it has not seen since early February  If AT200 can stay above 50   and even move higher from here  it will add some bullish healing to the broader market 

T2107 still has a longer term downward trend  but bulls and buyers can take some encouragement from AT200 s ability to climb over 50  

The volatility index  the VIX  confirmed the strength of the rally  The VIX gapped down and finished with a 12 2  loss  It closed at 14 9  just under the 15 35 pivot  I did not expect such a rapid reversal  I figured Tuesday s spike meant selling pressure  and thus the VIX  could sustain itself through the remainder of the week  I took this opportunity to take profits on my short position in iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Exp 30 Jan 2019  NYSE VXX   VXX lost 5 1  on the day 

The volatility index  the VIX  was only able to spend one day above the 15 35 pivot 
CHART REVIEWS
Autozone  NYSE AZO  I missed the memo on AZO getting featured on Jim Cramer s Mad Money  but I am glad I was one step ahead of today s 3 9  continuation rally with the position I established last week  I dove right into post earnings carnage and was fortunate to see the selling essentially stop on a dime after that day  After hours  Cramer stepped over Advanced Auto Parts  AAP  to target AZO as undervalued  Given I have a 640 650 call spread  I will likely close out the position this week on a further rally from current levels 

Autozone  AZO  soared 3 9  on the day with a picture perfect bounce off 50DMA support and a slice right through 200DMA resistance 
Alcoa  NYSE AA  I had AA targeted for a buy given the re awakening in commodity related stocks  AA is perfectly positioned with a small bounce off 200DMA support  This support line held well in March  I was a little too conservative with my limit order and failed to establish a position  After hours  news headlines suggested that the Trump administration would not renew the European Union s exemptions from steel and aluminum tariffs  Now I may need to chase a bit to ride AA s latest rebound 

Alcoa  AA  makes another bid to solidify support at its uptrending 200DMA 

Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS  After I gave up on a broad based retail revival for 2018  I narrowed my focus to a few promising retail stocks  Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  is my last one  I thought DKS would also be my last mistake as it could not break free of its declining 200DMA going into earnings  DKS delivered bigtime post earnings with a 25 8  gain and a definitive breakout that confirms this stock is a buy on the dips  The move allowed me to salvage a call option  which I still sold a bit too early   I will also likely profit from my covered call position with the position being taken out at June expiration 

Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  broke out in style with a 25 8  post earnings blast higher 

iShares US Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  and iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NASDAQ TLT  The trading action in ITB suggests to me that the bots and algorithms are in control  higher interest rates   sell ITB  lower interest rates   buy ITB  This relationship is the main way I can explain the bizarre behavior in home builder stocks which features massive post earnings skepticism and then rate related buying and selling in between earnings related data points 
When the 10 year Treasury first cracked the 3 0  level  the move caused major angst in home builder stocks  ITB plunged and confirmed 200DMA resistance  Between then and now  buying has dominated the trading action as investors first anticipated and then were rewarded with lower rates  Bonds rallied sharply starting May 18th  ITB was even able to gain on Tuesday when the S P 500  SPY  fell over 1  because bonds rallied sharply  apparently the biggest one day gain since Brexit in 2016   Today  bonds sold off again with TLT gapping all the way down to Tuesday s big open  ITB responded by closing with a 0 4  loss that well under performed the S P 500 s 1 3  gain 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  fell back despite the stock market s sharp rally  While the decline was small and happened on very low trading volume  it may yet confirm resistance at around the 200DMA 

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  gapped down sharply at the open before recovering slightly  It finished with a 0 7  loss  Now it is not clear at all what higher lower rates are supposed to say about economic health 
I quickly doubled down on my TLT puts but of course was left wishing I had done so during Tuesday s TLT rally 
On a related note  Lennar  NYSE LEN  was one of the biggest losers among home builders with a 1 5  drop  LEN s pullback erases about 50  of the one day gain it earned after CNBC s Fast Money featured LEN for a trade  I still do not like the call  but I am watching the trading action closely

29309,250824,AZO,Top Research Reports For Visa  AIG   Delta,opinion,"Monday  March 12  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Visa  V   AIG  AIG  and Delta  DAL   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated Visa s shares have marginally underperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the last one year   38 2  vs   38 6    But Visa s key business drivers  payments volume  cross model volume and process transactions remained strong and stable across the globe  
Numerous strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing have paved the way for its long term growth that have led to consistent revenue growth over the past several years  The Zacks analyst thinks Visa is well poised to gain from the growing electronic payment processing and strong international business  
A solid balance sheet ensures effective capital deployment  Visa s first quarter fiscal 2018 results beat the estimates and were up year over year  Nevertheless  high client incentives  forex volatility are some of the headwinds 
 You can   
Shares of AIG have underperformed the Zacks Multi Line Insurance industry over the last three months  losing  4 1  vs   3 6   AIG s fourth quarter 2017 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and deteriorated from the year ago quarter  
The underperformance stemmed from the negative impact of huge catastrophe losses and low premium in the General Insurance segment  However  the Zacks analyst thinks a number of asset sale and business divestitures made over the past many years have streamlined the company to some extent  
Recently  the insurance giant appointed Brian Duperreault as its new CEO with expectations of improving operations by completing ongoing restructuring initiatives and making additional changes  The company has been suffering from tough market conditions and its massive size with numerous uncorrelated businesses creating little or no synergy  Weakness in its General Insurance segment and an exposure to catastrophes continue to remain concerns 
 You can   
Buy rated Delta s shares rallied  18 5  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Airline industry s  17 4  gain  Delta has been performing well on the unit revenue front and is expected to continue doing so in 2018 as well  
Notably  it expects total unit revenues  excluding refinery sales  to increase in the band of 2 5  to 4 5   on a year over year basis  in the first quarter of 2018  The company s efforts to reward shareholders are also impressive  In 2017  it returned  2 4 billion to shareholders  
The Zacks analyst also likes the company s initiatives to reduce its debt levels  The new tax law  which reduces its corporate tax rate significantly  is anticipated to aid the company s performance  going forward  
However  high fuel costs do not bode well for the company  Fuel price  including taxes and refinery impact  is envisioned between  2 05 and  2 10 per gallon in the first quarter of 2018

The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All 
Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early

29311,250826,AZO,Q1 Earnings Season To Show Growth Acceleration,opinion,"It is too early to start talking about the 2018 Q1 earnings season  as we are almost a month away from the big banks kicking off the latest reporting cycle  That s when everyone in the market will start paying attention to the Q1 earnings season  Unfortunately for us  we don t have the luxury to wait that long as we are responsible for maintaining the  books  on every earnings season While we haven t  officially  closed the books on the 2017 Q4 earnings season yet  we have results from 499 S P 500 members at this stage   the 2018 Q1 earnings season has actually gotten underway already  Including Adobe s    better than expected fiscal February quarter top  and bottom line results  we now have Q1 results from three S P 500 members   AutoZone  NYSE AZO     and Costco    are the other two that have already reported fiscal February quarter results The bulk of 2018 Q1 results will be comprised of companies coming out with fiscal March quarter results  But as we all know  fiscal and calendar quarters don t match for all companies  as is the case with Adobe  AutoZone and Costco whose fiscal quarters ended in February  We club such fiscal February quarter results as part of our March quarter tally  It is in this context that the 2018 Q1 earnings season has gotten underway for us already  We have another 10 S P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in February on deck to report such 2018 Q1 results this week  which includes a number of industry leaders like FedEx     Oracle     Nike  NYSE NKE     and others The fact is that by the time the big banks come around to report March quarter results  Alcoa  NYSE AA  thankfully no longer has this honor   we will have seen Q1 results from almost two dozen S P 500 members  The chart below shows the weekly calendar of the Q1 earnings season 

Expectations for 2018 Q1The strong momentum we saw in the preceding earnings season is expected to continue this reporting cycle as well  with total earnings for the S P 500 index expected to be up  15 5  from the same period last year on  7 2  higher revenues  This would follow the  13 5  earnings growth on  8 5  revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season  the best quarterly performance in more than 6 years There were two aspects of the preceding earning season that really stood out and put that reporting cycle in a category of its own  It will be interesting to see to what extent we see a repeat performance on those two counts in the 2018 Q1 earnings season These two standout features of the 2017 Q4 earnings season were the very strong momentum on the revenue front and impressive turnaround on the estimate revisions front The revenue momentum likely reflected a combination of the synchronized global growth environment and a favorable foreign exchange backdrop  With both of those factors still very much in play in Q1 as well  we can reasonably expect to see the revenue momentum trend continue this earnings season as well The story about trends in 2018 Q1 estimate revisions is better told by the chart below 

What this chart shows is that earnings growth expectations for 2018 Q1 moved up significantly since mid December 2017  This represented a major trend shift relative to what we have been seeing over the last many years when estimates would actually be moving in the opposite direction  To be fair  the revisions trend had stabilized in the preceding quarters as well  with estimates for 2017 Q4 essentially remaining unchanged in the three months ahead of the start of that reporting cycle A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts  but that isn t the only reason  as you can see in the revisions trend for revenues in the chart below 

We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond  Estimates for Q2 went up as well  as they did for the following quarters  when the same was happening to 2018 Q1 estimates  As of today  total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  17 8  from the same period the year before on  7  higher revenues The chart below shows 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  the growth pace is expected to accelerate in Q2 and continue in the following quarters 

As you can imagine  expectations for full year 2018 are for an impressive showing  with total earnings for the S P 500 index expected to be up by  21  from the year earlier level on  6 8  higher revenues  If achieved  this will be the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010 The table below shows the summary picture for 2018 Q1  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period 

Standout SectorsAs you can see  the Energy sector remains a big growth contributor in Q1  with total earnings for the sector expected to be up  65 7  from the year earlier period on  15 4  higher revenues  But growth for the quarter would still be in double digits even on an ex Energy basis  last row in the table above  What is driving the strong Q1 growth isn t the Energy sector  but rather the breadth of growth across all sectors  with double digit earnings growth for 10 out of the 16 Zacks sectors  including Technology and Finance For the Technology sector  total Q1 earnings are expected to be up  19 5  on  11 4  higher revenues  which would follow the sector s impressive  24 2  earnings growth on  11 5  higher revenue growth The Finance sector  which sat out the preceding quarter with an essentially flat showing  total Q1 earnings are expected to be up  18 7  from the same period last year on  4  higher revenues Driving the Finance sector s strong growth in Q1 and beyond is the combined effect of tax cuts  higher interest rates and an improved domestic growth environment  Finance sector s earnings were only up  1  in full year 2017 and in low single digits in the three years prior to that  but are on expected to be up an impressive  25 3  in full year 2018 The Technology sector  on the other hand  has already been on stronger ground  with full year 2017 earnings for the sector up  10 7  and expected to be up  22 4  in 2018  The enterprise spending environment was expected to improve this year even before the tax cuts  with the tax windfall expected to give a much needed boost to those trends  On top of these we have the existing secular trends in cloud computing  artificial intelligence and big data that are expected to remain growth areas in the space Please note that Technology and Finance aren t just any two sectors out of the 16 in the S P 500 index  these two sectors combined are the twin pillars of index s total profitability  bringing in more than 40  of the index s total earnings this year  The Energy sector s outlook has improved  but the sector simply lacks the heft of these two  The Energy sector is expected to bring in about 5  of the index s total earnings this year Note  Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department  He is an acknowledged earnings expert whose commentaries and analyses appear on Zacks com and in the print and electronic media  His weekly earnings related articles include Earnings Trends and Earnings Preview  He manages the  and  portfolios and writes the Weekly Market Analysis article for  subscribers

growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season  the best quarterly performance in more than 6 years There were two aspects of the preceding earning season that really stood out and put that reporting cycle in

29344,250859,AZO,4 Investment Ideas Amongst The Sell Off,opinion,"Without a doubt  days like yesterday and for that matter  the past week or so can be very unsettling for any investor   The key is to have an investing plan and a source for solid investment ideas  These two simple rules will allow for intelligent additions to one s personal portfolio during times of market tumult   Zacks Rank  1 stocks provides a great tool set for an investor to make those intelligent additions   I believe you should spread your investments amongst sectors and use times like these to add quality companies who have been rated  1 by Zacks  
I have 4 stocks today that fit that bill and would add to portfolios at or near today s closing prices  If you were so inclined  I would suggest buying a half position in these names and add the other half 5 10  lower from here in case the selling isn t over  Hang in there  the stock market will stabilize as the move higher in rates decelerates and Zacks Rank  1 stocks will improve your portfolio s performance   Remember  the market at various times gives investors the opportunity to pick up solid stocks at advantageous valuations  this very well may be one of those times  LM   37 79  Legg Mason is a Baltimore based investment manager with nearly  790 billion under management   LM provides a breadth of services including asset management  securities brokerage and investment banking   The stock is trading at a slight discount to its industry peers and a solid discount to the S P   The stock yields a solid 2 8  dividend and closed today near the lower part of its 52 week range  which should provide a nice entry point for investors  
Earnings estimates are heading higher with a 28 4  upward revision to the current fiscal year   The company s acquisitions over the past few years should propel top line revenues   All in all  this solid financial with a Zacks  1 rank  improving earnings estimates and a higher interest rate environment should prove to be a solid addition to the portfolio    STX   47 44  Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  is a Computer and Technology company whose main business is storage devices   Seagate s latest deal with Toshiba will help it better compete with Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  in the hard disk drives  HDD  arena   The company is expecting higher revenues and increased margins as it improves operational efficiencies   With the stock close today  the price is about 10  above the midpoint for its 52 week range  
The stock sports a very healthy 5  dividend yield and very importantly  earnings estimates include a 21 2  upward revision for this fiscal year   On a valuation basis  the stock trades cheaper relative to its industry group and versus the S P as well   This technology stock with a Zacks  1 rank trading at these levels is worthy of being added to portfolios    AZO   718 57  AutoZone  NYSE AZO   the company that even Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  can t destroy   This stock was on a wild ride of its own long before this recent market sell off   Many analysts on the street had begun to talk about Amazon intruding on the turf of this automotive parts supplier but AZO has proven to have an incredible mote  tremendous management and very strong cash flows   As the average car age begins to push toward 11 5 years old  the demand for AZO s parts and services increases as well   Earnings estimates are rising to the tune of 6 64  for the current fiscal year and again  this stock trades at a discount to its peer group and the S P 
And although AZO does not pay a dividend the company uses its prodigious cash flow to purchase its own shares amounting to nearly  353m in the fiscal first quarter at an average price of  590  well above today s closing price   In addition to the shares purchased already  the company had nearly  471m of dry powder at the end of the quarter for further repurchasing   Although AZO is only off its 52 week range by about 10   a purchase near these prices could provide a nice lift to your portfolio  HUBB   129 65  Hubbell designs  manufactures and sells electrical and electronic products to various industrial and commercial markets   The company enjoys not only a Zacks  1 rank but also is  1 in the Zack s Industry Rank   Earnings estimates for the current fiscal year are trending 16 5  higher and the stock trades at an industry valuation along with its Manufacturing peers   The stock closed today at nearly the exact midpoint of its 52 week range and you receive a healthy 2 32  dividend yield while you wait out the stock s move higher   Year to date the stock is down 1 88  while the average manufacturing stock is down approximately 7  so a nice relative out performance for a very strong stock  
Hubbell could also benefit mightily if there were to be a meaningful infrastructure bill passed by the US Congress this year   Hubbell could well prove to be a good building block for your portfolio  especially at these prices The markets are convulsing and gyrating not due to economic fundamentals and solid corporate earnings but rather because of mechanical adjustments being made to global portfolios   The move higher in rates will abate soon enough and the inventory of short volatility hedging will run its course as well   Have your game plan  include solid additions to the portfolio like the Zacks  1 ranked stocks above and in time  these turbulent market periods will subside

29421,250936,AZO,Stock Market Showing New Signs Of Fatigue  ,opinion,"AT40   57 0  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   58 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   10 2Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary The stock market is looking a little tired 
The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   closed at another all time high on Tuesday and at one point hit a new all time intraday high  Buyers tried again on Wednesday but failed as a post Fed fade closed the index with the smallest of losses 


The S P 500  SPY  is shooting upward through its upper Bollinger Band  BB  channel  Yet  it may be time for buyers to rest yet again 
The above chart does not look like much cause for pause until the covers roll back with AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   Ten trading days ago  AT40 lost its bid to hit overbought levels as it faded from an intraday high of 66 4  and closed at 60 7   The past two trading days suggest AT40 is losing its battle to regain that momentum  My favorite technical indicator faded from highs twice and closed Wednesday at 57 0   In other words  AT40 is back to playing spoiler with non confirmations of the all time highs on the major indices 
Other major indices show subtle signs of fatigue  The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  has yet to mount a comeback since it started December with a notable tumble from an all time high  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  rallied strongly into the latest statement on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve only to end on Wednesday with a 1 2  loss  The NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  bounced off December lows but slowed down significantly into the approach to the all time high 

Did the Fed just bring the rally in Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  to an end  The upper BB channel gave way slightly on Wednesday s loss 


The intraday fade on the NASDAQ has the look of an end to a comeback 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  looks slightly better than the NASDAQ since it closed within its upper BB channel  A violation of this week s intraday low could lead the way to a more sustained pullback 
The volatility index  the VIX  is back to extremely low levels but gained ground the past two days  It looks poised for another one of those quick roundtrips through a volatility spike  Recall that the VIX historically spends precious little time below 10 and not much more time below 11 

The volatility index  the VIX  flirted with making another all time low  It now looks ready to snap higher 
Industrials  like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   are the main stocks reminding everyone that the bull s momentum remains fierce  The stock gained a healthy 3 6  on the heels of its latest sales report  CAT is up over 50  year to date 

Caterpillar  CAT  streaked to another all time high  What an incredible year for one of my favorite bear bull stock indicators 
Ode To Janet Yellen One of the main headlines for the day was of course the latest rate hike from the U S  Federal Reserve   contained no surprises as the Fed continued its pattern of telegraphing its moves and moods well in advance of action  However  I think it is important to point out that  aggregate  inflationary pressures are still nowhere to be found 

 On a 12 month basis  both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2 percent  Market based measures of inflation compensation remain low  survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed  on balance  

Below target inflation is eventually going to slam into the Fed s rate hike regime  Tax reform may be the salve that finally brings inflationary pressures as an already healthy  high employment economy is about to get a lot more stimulus  The lack of inflationary pressure also comes through in the ability of the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NASDAQ TLT  to keep flirting with its high of the year 
Fed rate hikes have done little to nothing to push long term rates higher   meaning the yield curve continues to flatten  Note that Yellen cautioned against reading too much into this development  particularly because  things have changed  that suggest the yield curve should be flatter than in the past and the yield curve is still within historic norms anyway 

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  is floating toward its 2017 high 
The Fed rate hike had minimal impact on market expectations for the next rate move 

December s rate hike barely changed expectations for the timing of the next rate hike  assuming it is 25 basis points  
Source  
The impact on the U S  dollar index  USD  was notable in that the market rolled back about half of the gains for the month 

The U S  dollar index  USD  responded poorly to the Fed s rate hike and accompanying statement on monetary policy 
Barring any emergencies  Janet Yellen made her last appearance in a press conference as the Chair of the Federal Reserve  I personally think it is too bad Yellen was not allowed to leave on her own terms like her recent predecessors  but at least she has handled her removal from office with grace  The disappointment was expressed by one reporter who noted the melancholy she heard from numerous female economists 
Reporters also peppered Yellen with questions about tax reform and Bitcoin  BTC   It was interesting to hear Yellen attribute at least part of this year s rally in the stock market to anticipation over tax reform  She doubted that 4  economic growth was a likely outcome of tax cuts but said the Fed would welcome such growth  She also acknowledged that should a recession come  the space for a fiscal response will be limited by the existing proposals for tax cuts  On Bitcoin  Yellen was of course careful to note that the cryptocurrency is not legal tender  and the Fed has no role in regulating its use  She does not see any risk to the financial system from the wild fluctuations in Bitcoin

I got a kick out of Jim Cramer s recent segment pointing out the bottom in the stocks of auto parts retailers  Cramer is back on board with these stocks after earlier shying away partially because of the threat of Amazon s encroachment  I have documented this bottoming process for some time now  However  note that I took my profits in ORLY last week after it gapped up in sympathy with AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  earnings  At that point  the stock was once again well above its upper Bollinger Band  BB   While the stock did fade from there  it is so far hanging tough  Still  the stock is up a LOT from its 2017 multi year low  I am content to wait for the next wave of angst to buy back in  assuming such an opportunity comes again

29422,250937,AZO,Retailers Continue Positioning For A Strong Recovery In 2018,opinion,"The reports on U S  holiday shopping are coming fast and furious  The early tally looks quite bullish  and retail stocks responded  The SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  jumped 1 1  today to a new high for the year  Surprisingly  trading volume of 3 7M shares remained well below the 90 day moving average of 5 0M 
Post Christmas cheer pushed SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  to a new high for 2017 
 results from Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  indicating consumers spent a record  800B this holiday season 

 The report said holiday sales in stores and online between Nov 1 and December 24 rose 4 9 percent  the fastest year on year pace of increase since 2011  Mastercard  which tracks spending by combining sales activity in its payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms  excluded automobile sales from its figures  

These numbers validate XRT s rally going into Christmas  I am relieved I went ahead and started accumulating call options on   However  there were no subsequent dips to allow me to grow a larger position at lower prices  I ended up locking in profits well ahead of schedule and sold the call options last week  Note that XRT is now retracing a major one day sell off ahead of Christmas 2016  The latest breakout for XRT has me wondering whether the ETF will dip much at all in the coming few months as was my hope to setup what I still think will be a key trading and investing play for 2018  Needless to say  I am keeping a firm grip on the shares I still own of various individual retailers 
Individual Retailers
O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY  was one of the retailers I closed out to lock in profits  Now  along with AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO   a potential turning point is already developing in the form of a Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze  As a refresher  a BB squeeze occurs as volatility implodes on a stock at the end of a period of consolidation  In most of the charts I post  the BBs are represented by the two toned grey areas that bound most of the price action in a stock  A breakout or breakdown from a BB squeeze typically sustains itself for quite some time  If this pattern resolves into a breakdown  I will be looking to buy a test of support at the converging 50 and 200 day moving averages  DMAs   If the pattern resolves into a breakout  I will probably stay on the sidelines despite the endorsement these stocks recently received  I think the recovery cycle is a bit mature at this juncture and do not want to chase these particular stocks higher 

O Reilly Automotive  Inc   ORLY  experienced a gap and crap in sympathy with earnings from Autozone  It quickly stabilized and found support against its uptrending 20DMA  The resulting BB squeeze looks ready to resolve to the upside with today s small pop 

Like ORLY  Autozone  AZO  found support at its uptrending 20DMA after its post earnings gap and crap  Its resulting BB squeeze also looks ready to resolve to the upside 
I DID open one new position  Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   NASDAQ BBBY   In early December  I offered up BBBY as a very cheap and undervalued retail play  Yet  I wanted to wait for the buyers to prove their interest  Instead  buyers waited to show more interest until after the stock sold off heavily post earnings last week  Buyers successfully defended 50DMA support  I decided not to wait for more confirmation and loaded up my first tranche of shares 

Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   BBBY  found post earnings support at its 50DMA  Can the stock soon confirm the earlier 50DMA breakout with a new post breakout high

29424,250939,AZO,The S P 500 Rubberband Stretches Further,opinion,"AT40   67 5  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   63 2  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   9 2Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary In my last Above the 40 I complained that market breadth was once again suffering thanks to an S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   stretching upward while AT40 continued to churn below the overbought threshold of 70   The first trading week of 2018 closed out with a subtly new wrinkle on an even more stretched rubberband 
The S P 500 reached well above its upper Bollinger Band  BB  and a 0 7  gain  AT40  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   nudged just slightly higher  However  AT40 closed at a fresh 2 1 2 month high  At 67 5   AT40 is now within striking distance of overbought and transitioned the churn into a sloth like uptrend  The volatility index  the VIX  was even more interesting  it scooted higher only to fade to a flat close on the day  It is hard to imagine the S P 500 pushing even higher from here without AT40 breaking into overbought territory to support an overstretched technical condition  Moreover  with the VIX holding the line just above all time lows  some kind of snapback of the rubberband seems imminent  The S P 500 should only be able to stretch further in the coming week with the VIX managing a breakdown below its all time low  at which point I would feel compelled to double down on my hedge of call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   

The S P 500  SPY  surged to a fresh all time high and stretched well above its upper Bollinger Band  BB  


The volatility index  the VIX  held its ground just above its all time low 
Thanks to MOST of the usual suspects  tech stocks sprinted higher similarly to the S P 500  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  has once again appeared as the important laggard  the stock faces some critical resistance  AAPL closed the week by finally filling last month s gap down on iPhone X supplier news  The move also confirmed 50DMA support  YET  the 175 to 177 range has stopped AAPL in its tracks three times before  Needless to say  I held off on making a fresh weekly AAPL call option trade  last week s trade worked out particularly well  

The NASDAQ stretched above its upper BB to notch another all time high 


The PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  also stretched its way to yet another all time high 


Apple  AAPL  rallied back to close the last gap down but can it break through for a new all time high 

STOCK CHART REVIEWS
DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM  Northland Capital downgraded DXCM to underperform  That action was enough to create a devastating gap down below the 50DMA and forced me to abandon ship and lock in my remaining profits  I will be keeping an eye on DXCM in case I can get back in at an even lower price  I explained my bottom fishing on DXCM in    

DexCom  Inc   DXCM  broke down thanks to an analyst downgrade 
Macy s Inc  NYSE M  Macy s increased guidance and was rewarded with a pullback  This reaction indicates that the retail recovery has entered a new stage  no more benefit of the doubt based on low valuation  Still  Macy s reported strong results and the stock bounced off 200DMA support  This drop is a buying opportunity with a clear stop below 50DMA support 

Macy s is caught in wide ranging churn above 200DMA support 
Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  It looks like Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  is not quite ready to rebound  The early bounceback gave way to a resumption of selling  The stock closed below 50DMA support on Friday 

Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  closed at a post earnings low below its 50DMA 
L Brands  NYSE LB  LB added its own brake to the retail rally with disappointing guidance  I will be watching to see whether its 200DMA holds up as support 


L Brands  LB  dropped 12  after posting disappointing guidance  The breakdown below its 50DMA brought an end to the impressive rally from August lows 
Ulta Beauty Inc  NASDAQ ULTA  ULTA found a fresh fan in Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   The upgrade to outperform sent the stock slamming into 200DMA resistance  I did not have a fresh position in place ahead of the upgrade  but I bought back in with a call option on Friday just as the incremental gain from the upgrade reversed 

Ulta Beauty  ULTA  is still in rally mode form its October low  The upgrade increased the odds ULTA will soon break out above 200DMA resistance even though sellers stepped right on cue at resistance 
Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY  BBY fell back on Thursday in sympathy with the pause in retail stocks  Buyers returned the next day in a sign that portends well for the retail recovery trade

AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  Auto parts companies are helping to carry the torch for retailers in 2018  The Bollinger Band  BB  squeezes I pointed out in my last discussion on the space resolved to the upside  AZO is at a 52 week high 

Autozone  AZO  started 2018 with an upside resolution to its Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze  and it has not looked back since 

Align Technology Inc  NASDAQ ALGN  ALGN had a rough December as its impressive upward momentum came to an abrupt end  A 50DMA breakout on Friday finished the reversal of the 50DMA breakdown in mid December  Buyers look ready to return 

Align Technology  ALGN  broke out above 50DMA resistance and looks to resume its status as a momentum stock 
Shotspotter Inc  NASDAQ SSTI  It took a month of growing pressure  but SSTI finally broke out above 50DMA resistance  The market failed to respond much to important insider buying last month  This month may mark the time buyers put an end to the bear raid especially given the series of good news SSTI experienced in the last month

29448,250963,AZO,Top Analyst Reports For Apple  Adobe   Anheuser Busch,opinion,"Tuesday  November 21  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Apple  AAPL   Adobe  ADBE  and Anheuser Busch  BUD   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Apple s shares are up  46 7  in the year to date period  handily outperforming the S P 500  up  15 7   and the Zacks Technology sector  up  27 3    Apple reported spectacular fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results with both top and bottom lines beating expectations  Steady iPhone sales  spurt in Services segment and a resurgent Macs and iPad business backed the impressive results  
Business in China saw massive reacceleration driven by iPhone  Services and Mac sales  In India revenues grew twofold  The company also gave a very encouraging outlook for the current quarter  which includes the holiday season  given the anticipation of strong performance by its latest smartphone  iPhone X  
Going forward  the Zacks analyst thinks foray into fast growing technologies like automobile  AI   AR VR are long term drivers  But the new iPhone X at  999 is quite pricey  particularly for cost sensitive markets like India  Intensifying competition from cheaper Chinese handset makers cannot be ignored 
 You can   
Shares of Adobe have gained  77 1  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Software industry which has increased  35 7  over the same period  The company s fiscal third quarter earnings exceeded expectations backed by demand for the company s Creative Cloud software tools  
The Zacks analyst likes Adobe s market position  compelling product lines  continued innovation  solid adoption of Creative Cloud and Adobe marketing cloud   Also  its acquisition of TubeMogul will help the company to build its position in the expanding Digital Marketing space  However  end market recovery appears slow  which remains a matter of concern 
 You can   
Anheuser Busch s shares have underperformed the Zacks Alcoholic Beverages industry so far this year   9 6  vs   20 3    largely due to the company s dismal earnings history  The company s last reported quarter marked its seventh straight earnings miss  while revenues missed expectations for the second consecutive quarter  
However  the Zacks analyst likes Anheuser Busch s robust brand portfolio and solid geographical reach  The company keeps introducing near beer alternatives  along with no  and low alcohol beers to resonate with changing consumer demand  Anheuser Busch is also likely to benefit from its constant expansion in the craft beer space  given the rising demand for this beer category  
Furthermore  SABMiller s buyout has helped it gain a dominant share in the global beer market  However  it continues to anticipate increased cost of sales  owing to lingering currency woes and growth of premium brands  Also  volatility in some of key regions remains a threat

Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius

European equity markets mostly ticked higher  overcoming early losses with the euro and British pound paring losses versus the U S  dollar and despite caution ahead of tomorrow s monetary policy decision by the U S  Federal Reserve  Global monetary policy remained in focus as the Fed decision will be followed by the Bank of Japan s policy statement  while the Bank of England signaled last week that a rate hike may be delivered in the coming months and the European Central Bank suggested at its last monetary policy decision that it will begin to discuss in detail dialing back its stimulus measures this autumn 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly lower following the recent global market rally  with caution appearing to set in ahead of tomorrow s monetary policy decision out of the U S   which will be followed by the Bank of Japan s decision later this week  Markets in mainland China  Hong Kong  Australia  India and South Korea were all lower  However  Japanese equities bucked the trend  finishing solidly higher in their return to action from yesterday s holiday  playing catch up with the markets and bolstered by the recent weakness in the yen

development Last week  German automaker Volkswagen announced that along with Chinese joint venture partners  it will recall 4 86 million vehicles in China  Once again  the reason was faulty air bags

29455,250970,AZO,Auto Retailers Reverse Hard,opinion,"The auto parts retailers opened up strong on Tuesday then reversed down hard  closing their gaps 

You can see this on a larger scale with AutoZone  NYSE AZO  

As well as O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  ",2017-09-19,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/auto-retailers-reverse-hard-200214213,200214213
29456,250971,AZO,Apple Falls From The Tree  Stock Market Bends Without Breaking ,opinion,"AT40   63 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   54 9  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   9 6Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary The stock market stubbornly held onto its bullish positioning despite the tumble of one of its biggest stalwarts  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  
AAPL fell 5 0  for the week  In the process the stock printed a bearish breakdown below support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  and completely reversed the bullish breakout from the August earnings gap up  The resulting pattern looks like a top  Buyers finally delivered a reprieve of sorts on Friday after AAPL plunged well below its lower Bollinger  Band and created a short term oversold condition  The bounce from the lows created a hammer that needs follow up buying for confirmation 
Sellers reactivated ever since Apple  AAPL  made its latest product announcements  The current breakdown looks like a topping pattern 
I cut AAPL some slack and stuck to the current trading strategy of having call options in play on a weekly basis  Needless to say  I had to watch one tranche of calls expire worthless last week  My second tranche timed for the coming week was laid to waste  My third tranche  my last until AAPL s bullish flair returns  should be well positioned as I bought it when AAPL flirted with  150 in deeply oversold territory  If not for the weekly call trading strategy  I would have flagged AAPL as a potential short with the 50DMA breakdown last Wednesday  Moreover  AAPL s product rollout is in a strange and complicated place with the coming introduction of the iPhone 8 which will be followed in another month by the more powerful iPhone X 
The rest of the market is doing its best to ignore AAPL s latest travails  While the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   ended the week around where it started  the index made more all time highs in between  The upper Bollinger Bands  BBs  are clinging to their bid to guide the index ever higher 
The S P 500  SPY  is in a bullish position with the 20  50  and 200DMAs all trending upward 
AAPL made its presence felt in the tech laden NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ   On Friday  the NASDAQ managed to bounce off uptrending 20DMA support  AAPL s impact was much greater on QQQ which barely escaped with a bounce off uptrending 50DMA support 
The NASDAQ retested 20DMA support as Apple  AAPL  weighed on the index 

Apple  AAPL  weighed heavily on the PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  this week as the index was forced into a 50DMA retest 
The volatility Index is doing its best to make new history  Starting September 11th  the VIX closed with a loss all but one day  The march is in inches  but the VIX is now within sight of a 24 year low and perhaps an all time closing low  This bullish behavior is all the more remarkable considering the continuing heating of wartime rhetoric between North Korea and the U S  That rhetoric  and the season of the calendar  keep me rotating into call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  

The volatility index  VIX  has begun another drive to make history 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  held steady for the week in the low to mid 60s  So with one eye on current conditions I keep the short term trading call on cautiously bullish  With another eye looking around broadly  I see plenty of reason to BE cautious  My trades last week reflected this mix 
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  TSLA was hit by an analyst downgrade last week and sellers stepped right in  After it looked like the selling would come to a quick end at the bottom of the upper BB channel  I bought a call option in anticipation of a rapid bounce  For a brief moment the next day the trade looked smart  When sellers took TSLA below the channel  I quickly reached for a put option to hedge my position  TSLA closed an ugly week with a 4 2  loss on Friday  I took profits on the put to pay for the call option but left some good money on the table 

Tesla  TSLA  found resistance at its all time high from June and tumbled right back to a test of 50DMA support 
Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  CMG started the week with a nasty tumble  I pounced on the decline as a fresh buying opportunity  Yet  when CMG cracked the previous low I reached for put options in preparation for what then looked like a bigger sell off  Buyers soon rushed in and turned the day into a bullish looking like  hammer   I can only imagine that sellers took out stops at the previous lows and or the  300 level  The subsequent rebound signals once again that sellers are exhausting themselves  It is just too bad I did not stick to my bullish bottoming thesis  I should have waited for confirmation of selling pressure before buying the put options  On Friday I salvaged some of the value of the call option and watched the put options get laid to rest   just another one of those lessons learned  The difference here from the TSLA trade is that I do not have a standing bullish thesis on TSLA 

Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG  printed a hammer after ever so briefly piercing the major low from August  With the 20DMA turning upward  it seems sellers may finally have exhausted themselves 
Autozone  NYSE AZO  and O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  The initial response to Autozone s earnings was bullish as buyers stepped in right at the open  Hoping to participate in the confirmation of my bullish call on AZO  I placed a low ball offer for a call option hoping the order might fill as post earnings implied volatility imploded  Instead  the stock quickly reversed  and my bid was met as sellers in the stock rushed for the exits  The proximate cause was a series of dour comments from the CEO in his introductory remarks during the conference call  Here is a sample from  

 There are certain factors present today some macro and others that relate to actions we have taken as part of our long term strategy that have created challenges to us delivering the same level of profitability growth that we have been delivering 
We intentionally made the decision to invest in our business at an accelerated rate in inventory  capital expenditures and operating expenses  Unfortunately  as we increased our investment profile  our sales have been slower than we would have thought due to poor performance in several of our weather sensitive categories and our multiple frequency of delivery initiative did not generate the benefits yet that we expected 
Additionally  as our commercial program openings have slowed  our overall commercial sales growth has declined as well  Simultaneously  we faced several other pressure points  Over the last year  we ve experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than I have experienced in my nearly 23 years of Autozone  Some of this is attributable to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities  while the balance and probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers 
The regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years  Additionally  we are experiencing increased levels of shrink in our interest expense after years of lower rates is beginning to increase 
The collective combination of these factors have significantly hampered our earnings per share growth  

ORLY first soared and then sold off in sympathy with AZO  I thought the selling was just the buying opportunity I was looking for and I snatched some call options  In the heat of the moment  I neglected to adjust  or cancel  my order on AZO  That order filled to my initial chagrin  The next day  buyers swiftly returned to AZO  and I quickly took some nice profits  sometimes it is better to be lucky than good   Per the chart below  I clearly should have held on  I am at least still holding my now profitable call options on ORLY 

Autozone  AZO  gets redemption  Buyers rushed in so quickly for the bargain that the entire post earnings loss is now erased and then some 

O reilly Automotive  ORLY  found firm support at its uptrending 20DMA but has not quite erased the entire post AZO loss 
First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  I pointed out the bullish breakout in FSLR in my last Above the 40 post  Much to my delight  I got a chance to  re participate in the stock s run up when it proceeded to reverse the breakout and test 50DMA support  On Friday  fresh news about solar tariffs reignited the stock for a gain that almost reached 7  at one point  Given tariff related moves can be oh so capricious  I decided to take my profits 
First Solar  FSLR  found firm support at its uptrending 50DMA and closed the week at a fresh 16 month high 
Intercept Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ICPT  I have not written about ICPT for a long time     Suffice to say that I am little surprised that the stock finally completed a reversal of 2014 s remarkable run up  in two days ICPT soared from  72 39 to  275 87 and to  445 83  The stock has not closed higher since 

The beginning and the end of the good ol  days for Intercept Pharmaceuticals  ICPT  

I was slow on the uptake when ICPT experienced a post earnings breakdown below its 50 and 200DMAs following July earnings  That breakdown received confirmation when ICPT met stiff resistance at its converged 50 200DMAs earlier this month  The confirmation of a bearish turn of events came on the big gap down the very next day  I was STILL slow to move when ICPT sold off anew on Thursday after the FDA issued a warning letter  I FINALLY made a trade on Friday in the middle of fresh selling  My lateness forced me to combine a small short on the stock with a call option to cover any upside surprises  ICPT is obviously trading well below its lower BB and subject to a sharp relief rally  In such a case  I will likely add to my small short position  I learned a fresh lesson in following the scent of the technicals 

A stomach churning collapse for Intercept Pharmaceuticals  ICPT  
U S  Steel  NYSE X  I have followed U S  Steel all the way up its recovery from the May lows  In early June  I wrote about the bullish second half thesis on steel stocks like X  Buying the dips and selling the rallies worked until last week  U S  Steel finally broke down below its uptrending 50DMA in a move that seems to signal the end of the rally  I will hang onto my latest tranche of call options  expiration in October  given the thesis  but I will add no more until X gets back its bullish strut  Note that a July downgrade from Citi  NYSE C  dragged X to this very same spot 

Can U S  Steel  X  conquer the latest severe downgrade 
Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  I am still waiting for my next trade in ULTA  The current slide down the 20DMA validates my exit the moment ULTA sold downward from this point of resistance  I am looking for buyers to come back to life around  216 where ULTA will meet its lower BB 

Ulta Beauty  ULTA  has been trapped by its downward sloping 20DMA ever since its broke down below its 50DMA 
KB Home  NYSE KBH  Friday was a WILD day for KBH  In the first 25 minutes of trading  the stock soared 6 7   By the  witching hour  of 2 30pm Eastern  KBH lost that entire gain  Buyers barely dragged the stock back to a fractional gain at the close  According to briefing com  M A speculation was swirling around the company 
The move befitted a bizarre news week for KBH  Earlier in the week  news broke of  between KBH CEO Jeffrey Mezger and the now increasingly notorious actress and comedienne Kathy Griffin and her live in boyfriend  Mezger hurled enough invectives to earn himself  from KBH s board in the form of a lost bonu  Griffin and her boyfriend moved in just a year ago and have already filed five noise complaints with the police about Mezger s household  KBH reports earnings this coming week on the 28th  I will be ALL ears 

KB Home  KBH  lost all its post earnings gains back in July  A LOT is at stake for the next earnings report with the 50DMA trending downward and 200DMA support coming up fast 
In other trades  I sold my U S  Concrete  NASDAQ USCR  call option as the stock bounced perfectly off 200DMA support and slammed into 50DMA resistance  I bought the breakout for Zynga  NASDAQ ZNGA  that I pointed out last week  I executed the Rio Tinto   NYSE RIO  versus BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP  pairs trade  but I am already reconsidering given a ballooning buyback and dividend from RIO

29491,251006,AZO,Is AutoZone  AZO  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AutoZone  Inc    NYSE AZO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AutoZone has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  AutoZone s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AutoZone has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AutoZone stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  AutoZone P CF ratio of 9 8 is lower than the broader industry average of 6 4  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AutoZone currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AutoZone a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though AutoZone might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives AZO a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  Both the current quarter and full year have seen seven estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to no movement in the opposite direction This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 0 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AutoZone  Inc  Price and Consensus
    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAutoZone is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 27  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2017-09-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-autozone-azo-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200212506,200212506
29492,251007,AZO,Underneath the Hood  AutoZone shows 17  Upside,opinion,"Value investors should take a closer look into AutoZone  Inc   NYSE  NYSE AZO  as the company boasts a healthy moat and the stock trades at a reasonable discount to intrinsic value 
Finding The Moat
One investment criteria that value investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger use is what Buffett calls a  moat   In his  to Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  partners  Buffett explained 

A truly great business must have an enduring  moat  that protects excellent returns on invested capital  The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business  castle  that is earning high returns 

While Buffett looked for  cigar butts  early on in his career  or stocks that looked cheap regardless of the quality of a business  Charlie Munger tipped him to the idea of buying quality businesses at reasonable discounts to their intrinsic value  Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have enjoyed the fruits of this shift in philosophy  with Buffett crediting the move for Berkshire s massive success 
So how does an investor identify stocks with moats  Usually  evidence of a moat bears out in the company s financials  More specifically  and as Buffett eluded to  the company will enjoy excellent returns on invested capital  ROIC  
Fortunately  finbox io makes it easy to screen for companies with potential moats  A quick screen set with a mid teen ROIC filter and positive Upside  using Wall Street analyst s consensus 1 year target  generates the following list of stocks 
source  finbox ioInvestigating this list further will find that AutoZone actually hasn t achieved less than 30  ROIC since 2008 
source  finbox ioWith nearly 40  ROIC  over 20  upside and a business likely familiar to most investors  let s take a closer look at AutoZone before it reports earnings next week 
The AutoZone Business Model
AutoZone is the leading retailer and distributor of aftermarket automobile parts and accessories in the United States  The company operates 5 381 stores throughout the nation and Puerto Rico with additional stores in Mexico and Brazil  AutoZone also operates 26 Inter american Motor Corporation stores  a chain carrying import replacement parts 
AutoZone primarily targets do it yourself  DIY  customers but also offers credit and delivery of parts and other products to commercial customers  repair garages  dealers  and service stations   Domestic commercial represented approximately 17  of net sales in fiscal year 2016 
AutoZone also sells diagnostic and repair software through alldata comand alldatadiy com and its DIY and commercial products through dedicated websites  The company does not perform its own repairs or installations 
Pit Stop  Stock Performance and Moat Analysis
2017 has not been kind to auto parts retailers  with AutoZone and peers O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  and Advance Auto Parts  NYSE AAP  all off at least 30  year to date 

source  finbox ioThe sector first took a hit in late January on news Amazon  Nasdaq  NASDAQ AMZN  struck deals with the largest parts makers in the country  AutoZone then took another leg down in May after a worse than expected third quarter earnings report  Finally  O Reilly s disappointing report  announced in June  took the stock down once again 
In the third quarter call  AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes attributed the relatively weak performance to delayed income tax refunds  another mild winter  and sluggish consumer demand during the first 5 weeks of the quarter 
To mitigate sales weakness  management has re evaluated one of its inventory initiatives and is in the process of reducing the frequency of deliveries  In addition  a closer look at the quarter shows sales acceleration during the last seven weeks  with comps increasing approximately 2   Management expects that trend to carry over into the fourth quarter 
Amazon s entrance into the fray  while not to be taken lightly  may be a bit overblown for a few reasons  First  the challenging environment in brick and mortar retail may be more due to a shift in consumer discretionary spending preferences than most investors expect  This aspect appears corroborated by CEO Bill Rhodes third quarter call s comments that it seemed more tax refunds were being directed outside of the sector 
While a shift in discretionary spend would not be a favorable development  there are several underlying consumer trends that will likely provide tailwinds  Key drivers affecting demand for failed parts  a category that contributes nearly half of AutoZone s revenue  include miles driven and vehicle age  Both are trending in the right direction as vehicle age is up to 11 6 years in 2016 from 10 6 in 2010 and miles driven increased 3  in 2016 
In addition  and speaking to AutoZone s moat  the auto parts business is largely relationship driven  AutoZone has long been a trusted provider of parts for repairs with an accessible  highly trained customer service team offering knowledge  advice  and simple diagnostics at no charge  This puts pure play e commerce operators such as Amazon at a significant disadvantage 
Furthermore  both DIY and commercial customers are generally very time sensitive  Both need parts as soon as possible to address transportation needs or to turn over their service bays  Amazon has taken measures to increase delivery times  but AutoZone s mega hubs and distribution services allow for a wide range of products that appears difficult to compete with  at least in the short term 
AutoZone s Valuation  17  Margin of Safety
AutoZone has averaged mid single digit revenue growth over the past 5 years  with EBITDA margin steady at around 22   Consensus Wall Street analysts expect low to mid single digit revenue growth over the next several years with EBITDA margin relatively constant 

Under these assumptions  Finbox io s eight valuation models produce an average fair value estimate of  646 24  implying 17  upside to the stock at the time of writing 

Lap  AutoZone Attractive for Long Term Investors
Screening for companies with high returns on invested capital is one approach for identifying companies with potential moats  AutoZone appears to have a healthy moat due to a well known brand and cost advantages from scale  While the stock has taken a hit in 2017  favorable underlying consumer trends and responsive management will look to boost the stock over the long term  With approximately 17  upside  AutoZone appears worth a closer look ahead of earnings next week ",2017-09-14,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/underneath-the-hood-autozone-shows-17-upside-200213273,200213273

Commentary North Korea launched another ballistic missile over Japan  this one with enough range to hit Guam  The general market response was a collective yawn  In an earlier post I claimed that further militaristic actions from North Korea were not likely to spook markets until unless the U S   or some country  actually responded  That assessment rang true in this latest incident 
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   hit a fresh all time high  On Monday of last week the index made a new all time high and met my criteria for flipping the short term trading call from neutral to cautiously bullish  On Tuesday  the S P 500 confirmed the change in trading call with a higher close 
The S P 500  SPY  looks set up for more gains as it reaches higher into its upward trending Bollinger Band  BB  channel 
The NASDAQ and PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  faded from their respective highs and just missed joining the S P 500 in the all time party 
The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  faded off a new all time high back into the month s trading range 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   is still confirming the bullish mood  AT40 closed the week at 60 4   its highest close since July 27th  A fresh visit to the overbought threshold  70   appears imminent  Unlike past approaches in recent times  this run has a very bullish implications  A close into overbought territory will likely mark the beginning of a strong  overbought rally  This seasonally weak period for stocks continues to surprise 
The volatility index  the VIX  is a full participant in the surprise  I have been targeting September as the month when the period of extremely low volatility came to a definitive end  Instead  the VIX finds itself plunging right back to extremely low levels  below 11   Sure the past month has featured at least 4 separate VIX spikes  depending on how you want to count   but the current drop to 10 2 serves as a reminder that nothing has happened to create any sustained level of concern in the market 

The volatility index  the VIX  finds itself right back at extremely low levels after multiple rejections from higher levels including twice from the 15 35 pivot 
The financials have yet to confirm the bullish sentiment in the market  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  has struggled mightily since the bullish breakout in late June early July  An extension rally in August stopped short of confirming the bullish break from the previous head and shoulders pattern  XLF sold off from there right back to the February breakout point  Like clockwork  traders bought the test of support and now XLF is struggling to break through 50DMA resistance  I have not made a trade on XLF in a while  but I have put it back on the radar 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  has effectively spent most of 2017 churning around 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  has effectively churned since its bullish post earnings breakout in early August  Yet  the rhythm has been good enough to deliver gains on the weekly call option trade  In the previous week  sellers delivered as expected by taking AAPL down after its product announcements  I started into my weekly call purchase on Thursday  but took profits on Friday s pop  I recognize that there are times the market will attempt to get ahead of the typical Monday pop in AAPL 
Taking a step back  I recognize that AAPL has essentially churned above its former all time high  I daresay a test of converged support from the uptrending 50DMA and the former all time high is imminent 
Retailers have been sneaking back  I suppose traders and investors are sniffing around for bargains in a market rally that  feels  very mature  For example  I have been carefully watching the auto parts retailers for a new opportunity to make a buy  The small positives seem to be building  O Reilly Automotive Inc  NASDAQ ORLY  initiated a buyback after its last earnings  Last week  ORLY neatly bounced off 50DMA support  AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  broke through 50DMA resistance this month and continued to rally to a higher high  Combine that move with a higher low in August and a complete reversal of the loss in sympathy with ORLY  and AZO looks like it is bottoming  If AZO produces positive earnings before the market open on September 19th  I become a buyer 
O Reilly Automotive  Inc   ORLY  is on the verge of confirming a bullish test of 50DMA support 

Autozone  AZO  is forming a bottoming pattern with a higher low and higher high that includes a 50DMA breakout 
Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY  is making a valiant comeback from a huge post earnings breakdown  BBY reversed its entire incremental post earnings loss with a 50DMA breakout  This is a great spot for a hedged play as the stock is poised for a major setback or the continuation of a gap fill play  I own calls and puts 
Best Buy  BBY  buyers have returned in force  Do they have enough gas to continue into a gap fill play 
The saga with Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  continues apace  A downgrade caused a huge gap down on CMG on September 8th  but buyers stepped in to keep CMG from setting a lower low  At one point last week  the gap even filled  These are the VERY faint signs of the start of a bottoming process for CMG  When I make a short term trade on CMG  I am sticking with the long side  I am not yet ready to make another try on investing in a bottom 
Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG  is fighting to overcome two damaging downgrades 
First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is exceeding my most optimistic expectations  I long ago covered my short put for a profit  Now I wish I had loaded up on shares  An upgrade on Friday generated a breakout above recent congestion which confirmed a successful test of 50DMA support 

Another bullish breakout for First Solar  FSLR 
A much more speculative  but near similar breakout  comes from Zynga Inc  NASDAQ ZNGA   Remember them  While I focused on improving my Words with Friends skills  ZNGA quietly rallied from near death below the  2 barrier in early 2016  Now  ZNGA sits at 40 month highs and a bullish breakout from an extended trading range  I like buying right here with a potential stop below the trading range with risk down to a test of uptrending 200DMA support  Given this is a speculative play  it makes sense to keep the trading size small and widen the window for trading 
Zynga  ZNGA  made a classically bullish breakout with high volume above a tight and extended consolidation range 
U S Concrete Inc  NASDAQ USCR  continues to intrigue  I have written several articles on USCR already  Here  I just want to point out that on Friday  USCR printed a picture perfect bounce from 200DMA support  I tried to double down on my position here  but my limit order failed to trigger 
U S  Concrete  USCR  stemmed the recent loss with a picture perfect bounce from 200DMA support on strong volume 
I end this tour of notable stock charts with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB   IBB bounced strongly off the last low but met stiff resistance at an important milestone  the Clinton bash  When I wrote about the Clinton bash two years ago  I staked a claim on an eventual recovery  However  I did not have a two year horizon for that recovery  Buyers are struggling to complete the recovery as IBB has failed all month to get through resistance  Now  IBB is very vulnerable to a fresh bash from somewhere in the U S  political apparatus  Stay tuned

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including TOTAL  TOT   Kimberly Clark  KMB  and Salesforce  CRM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
TOTAL shares have gained  7 5  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry  which has gained  1 4  over the same period  TOTAL s earnings missed expectations in the second quarter  However  it continues to benefit from new startups and acquisition  which is helping it boost production 
The Zacks analyst likes the company s commitment toward cost savings initiatives  After savings of  2 8 billion in 2016  TOTAL aims to save  3 5 billion this year  Going forward  the company will continue to benefit from upstream startups and cost management initiatives  The strategic acquisition of Maersk Oil will further strengthen its portfolio 
However  fluctuating commodity prices  operations in some politically troubled regions and increasing competition could impact the company s profitability 
 You can   
Shares of Kimberly Clark have declined  7 8  over the last six months  underperforming the Zacks Consumer Staples industry  which has lost  5 6  over the same period Kimberly Clark posted dismal second quarter results  with both earnings and revenues lagging expectations  The company also anticipates soft earnings guidance for the full year 
The Zacks analyst likes the company s higher cost savings  continued product innovation and strong international presence  However  Kimberly Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth  due to highly competitive promotional activity over several of the previous quarters 
Also  Kimberly Clark s second quarter earnings results were hampered by higher input cost inflation and lower sales due to softness in North America  A difficult economic environment in Latin America also remains a concern 
 You can   
Buy rated Salesforce shares have handily beat the broader Tech sector this year  with the stock up almost double the Zacks Technology sector s  17 4  gain in the year to date period  Salesforce reported strong Q2 results with both top and bottom lines faring better than expectations  Additionally  there was marked significant year over year improvement and the company also provided a strong outlook 
The Zacks analyst likes the company s announcement of achieving  10 billion in sales in FY18  Salesforce s diverse cloud offerings and strong spending on digital marketing remain major catalysts 
Additionally  strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are anticipated to prove conducive to growth over the long run  Furthermore  last year s move to utilize Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  data center s geographical reach to expand its international business is commendable

29558,251073,AZO,Here s Why O Reilly Automotive  ORLY  Shares Plunged Today,opinion,"On Wednesday  shares of auto parts retailer O Reilly Automotive   NASDAQ ORLY   are plunging  down about 20  to  174 30 per share in morning trading after the company reported weak second quarter same store sales growth 
O Reilly said same store sales only grew 1 7  during the quarter  well below its projections of 3  to 5  growth  and also falling short of FactSet s estimated guidance of an increase of 3 9   This caused the stock to be the S P 500 s biggest decliner so far today 
 We faced a more challenging sales environment than we expected for the remainder of the quarter   after April  O Reilly CEO Greg Henslee said   due to what we believe were continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand   
He added   The comparable store sales shortfall will also have a consequent impact on our operating profitability   The company reports its full second quarter earnings on July 26 
O Reilly s disappointing performance has had a rippling effect on other auto parts stocks  Both Advance Auto Parts   NYSE AAP   and AutoZone   NYSE AZO   shares are down about 15  and 10   respectively  in trading so far today

29562,251077,AZO,Profit From The Aging Population Of Cars,opinion,"Reported earnings don t tell the whole story of a company s profits  Without analyzing the footnotes and MD A  investors don t see the entire picture  This firm s reported earnings understate its true profitability  and future profit growth expectations embedded in the stock price look overly pessimistic  With improving profitability  strong macro economic tailwinds  and an undervalued share price  this stock could outperform moving forward  Standard Motor Products  SMP   49 share  is this week s  

Standard Motor Products  Improving Profitability

Since 2008  Standard Motor Products has grown revenue 4  compounded annually  Over the same time  after tax profit    has increased by 28  compounded annually to  75 million in 2016 and  78 million over the last twelve months  TTM   Profit growth has been fueled by SMP s improving NOPAT margin  which has increased from 1  in 2008 to 7  TTM per Figure 1 

However  investors analyzing Standard Motor Products reported GAAP net income see an understated version of the firm s profitability  In 2016  we made  27 million of total adjustments with the net effect of removing  15 million in non operating expenses  After   SMP s 2016 NOPAT was 24  higher than reported GAAP net income  The largest adjustment was  7 5 million in  related to the acquisition of General Cable Corporation s wire business  found on of SMP s 2016 10 K 

Figure 1  SMP Profitability Improvement Since 2008

In addition to NOPAT growth  SMP has generated a cumulative  147 million  13  of market cap  in free cash flow    over the past five years  Standard Motor s has also exhibited good stewardship of capital and has earned a positive return on invested capital    in every year of our model  which dates to 1998  SMP currently earns a 13  ROIC  which is in the second quintile of our coverage universe 

Executive Compensation Plan Is Directly Aligned With Creating Shareholder 

Standard Motor s executive compensation plan includes base salary  annual incentives  and long term stock based compensation  70  of annual cash incentives are   EVA   also known as   EVA has been a target metric in Standard Motor s executive compensation plan since 1998  SMP s compensation committee uses EVA because  the principles of an EVA program have a better statistical correlation with the creation of value for stockholders than a cash incentive program based on performance measures  

The focus on EVA helps ensure executives continue to be good stewards of capital and as SMP states   EVA recognizes the productive use of capital assets and  therefore  wise  responsible decision making regarding capital investments   Per Figure 2  SMP s ROIC has improved from 2  in 2008 to 13  TTM  In addition  SMP has grown economic earnings from   13 million in 2008 to  43 million TTM 

Figure 2  Standard Motor s Good Stewardship of Capital



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

We know from Figure 3 below  and   that ROIC is   a fact not lost on SMP s compensation committee  Given that ROIC is the most important driver of EVA  or economic earnings  SMP s use of EVA to measure performance ensures executives  interests are aligned with shareholders  interests 

Improving ROIC Correlated with Creating Shareholder Value

Per Figure 3  ROIC explains 73  of the changes in valuation for the 18 Auto Parts   Equipment peers  Despite SMP s 13  ROIC  above the 10  average of the peer group  the firm s stock trades at a discount to peers as shown by its position below the trend line in Figure 3  If the stock were to trade at parity with its peers  it would be  61 share   25  above the current stock price  Given the firm s rising ROIC  shareholder aligned executive compensation plan  and consistent profit growth  one would think the stock would garner a premium valuation

SMP s Profitability Helps Maintain Market Leading Positions

As a leading manufacturer of replacement parts in the automotive aftermarket  Standard Motor Products faces competition from firms across the globe such as Dorman Products  DORM   ACDelco  Robert Bosch  and Visteon Corp  VC  among others  Per Figure 4  SMP s NOPAT margin ranks near the top of its competition 

Healthy margins have allowed SMP to invest in new product development and internal initiatives such as plant improvements and workforce efficiency measures  SMP is also able to withstand pricing pressures from competition  Lastly  SMP s margins have enabled the company to weather economic downturns  such as the 2008 2009 economic recession  while remaining profitable

Bear Concerns Ignore Used Vehicle Trends 

Standard Motor Products  segments  engine management and temperature control  are tied to the automotive aftermarket  The automotive aftermarket follows trends such as number of vehicles on the road  average age per vehicle  average miles driven per year  and even new car quality  Many SMP bear case arguments overlook these trends in favor of focusing on factors less pertinent to SMP such as new car sales 

In 2016  registrations for light vehicles in the U S  reached a record level of 264 million  an increase of 2 4  year over year  This growth in registration surpassed the 2 1  growth in 2015  More vehicles on the road provides an opportunity for the aftermarket repair industry 

In addition to the sheer number of vehicles rising  the  rose to 11 6 years in 2016  up from 9 6 years in 2002  when IHS Automotive began tracking the data  Alongside a rising average age of cars  consumers are owning vehicles for record lengths of time  Per Figure 5  the average length of ownership of vehicles has consistently risen since 2006  In 2016  the average length of ownership for new vehicles was 79 months  up from 52 in 2006  Similarly  the average length of ownership for used vehicles was 66 months in 2016  up from 38 in 2006 

Figure 5  Vehicle Ownership Length Reaches All Time Highs



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and IHS Automotive

The average miles driven per year is also rising alongside the average age of vehicles and length of ownership  Vehicle miles travelled per year has risen from 230 billion in March 2000 to 265 billion in March 2017  according to the   As average mileage increases  so does the need for repairs and maintenance  Per Figure 6  total maintenance costs per 25 000 miles driven rises significantly as total miles driven increases 

Figure 6  Vehicle Maintenance Costs Rise As Mileage Driven Increases



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and Your Mechanic

The industry trends of an aging auto fleet combined with longer car ownership periods and increased miles driven per year should provide tailwinds for SMP s profit growth going forward  The positive macro trends coupled with internal efficiency and cost savings initiatives weaken the bear case in our view 

To capitalize on these tailwinds  Standard Motor Products  is continuously looking to lower its manufacturing costs and maximize profitability  In recent years  the firm has relocated manufacturing plants  shifted production to higher capacity plants  divested facilities  and increased efforts to source materials at lower costs  These efforts have allowed the company s costs to rise in line with or below its 3 4  long term revenue growth rate  Since 2006  selling  general   administrative costs have grown 3  compounded annually while cost of goods sold rose only 2  compounded annually 

Bears may raise concerns about Standard Motor Products  revenue concentration  In 2016  O Reilly Automotive  ORLY   NAPA Auto Parts  GPC   Advance Auto Parts  AAP   and AutoZone  NYSE AZO  accounted for 20   18   17   and 11  of revenue respectively  Each of these retailers are well recognized names in the automotive aftermarket industry and have grown sales anywhere between 4 11  compounded annually over the past four years  As noted above  the economic trends pushing the automotive aftermarket will also provide tailwinds to automotive parts retailers  as consumers and service shops increasingly need replacement parts  The revenue concentration would be more an issue if it was limited to fewer retailers  but the current diversification among a group of four growing retailers is less concerning 

Lastly  SMP s low valuation also undermines many bear arguments  Despite improving profitability and strong economic trends  SMP s current valuation implies a permanent decline in profits  as we ll show below 

SMP s Valuation Implies Permanent Drop in Profits

Over the past two years  SMP is up 37  while the S P is up 14   However  year to date  SMP has fallen 9  while the S P is up 7   This price decline without a deterioration in business fundamentals results in SMP being undervalued  At its current price of  49 share  SMP has a price to economic book value    ratio of 0 9  This ratio means the market expects Standard Motor Products  NOPAT to permanently decline by 10   This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 28  compounded annually since 2008 and 4  compounded annually since 1998 

Even if SMP were to never again grow profits from current levels  the   or no growth value of the firm is  54 share   a 10  upside from the current valuation 

However  if SMP can maintain TTM NOPAT margins  7   and   the stock is worth  65 share today   a 33  upside  This scenario assumes SMP can grow revenue by consensus estimates in 2017  6   and 2018  3    and 3  each year thereafter  With the average age of cars increasing and consumers owning cars longer  SMP could easily meet or surpass these expectations  Add in the potential yield detailed below  and it s clear why SMP could be a great portfolio addition 

Buy Backs Plus Dividend Could Yield Nearly 3 

In 2016  Standard Motor s repurchased  400 000 of its stock  which exhausted its remaining authorization  SMP repurchased nearly  20 million in 2015 and  10 million in 2014  In February 2017  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  20 million under a new repurchase program  Through April 2017  SMP has repurchased  3 million  Going forward  if SMP were to average the last three years repurchase activity   10 million per year   the firm s existing authorization would last two years  A repurchase of this size is 1  of the current market cap  When combined  Standard Motor Products  1  repurchase yield and 1 6  dividend yield offer investors a total potential yield of nearly 3  

Aging Population of Cars Could Spur Earnings Surprise

As noted above  the average age of vehicles is on the rise and consumers are owning cars longer than ever  More importantly  according to IHS Automotive  the oldest vehicles on the road are the fastest growing component of the total fleet  Vehicles 16 years and older are expected to grow over 30  through 2021  Similarly  more than 20 million vehicles on the road in 2021 will be more than 25 years old  These cars will require maintenance and repairs to ensure their continued usability 

16  year old vehicles aren t the only subset expected to grow either  Vehicles that are 12 years old are expected to grow 10  through 2021  and vehicles new to five years old are expected to grow 16  through 2021  Essentially  across all subsets of the vehicle landscape  the need for and cost of repairs should be expected to rise  per Figure 6 above  

With rising demand  SMP is well positioned to capitalize on the growth of the automotive aftermarket  The firm is moving product line production to maximize plant efficiency and looking at strategic acquisitions  such as its recent purchase of General Cable Corporation s wire business  This acquisition furthers SMP s goal of lower cost material sourcing  With improving margins and revenue growth opportunities  beating both top and bottom line expectations should prove an effective catalyst to send shares higher  SMP beat both top and bottom line expectations from 1Q16 to 3Q16 and the stock rose 26  over the same time 

With low market expectations  SMP could be poised for another beat and subsequent increase in valuation  In the meantime  investors in this stock carry very low valuation risk and are rewarded with a potential 3  total yield given SMP s history of dividends and share repurchases 

Insider Trends and Short Interest Are Minimal 

Over the past 12 months  there have been 47 thousand insider shares purchased and 93 thousand insider shares sold for a net effect of 46 thousand insider shares sold  These sales represent less than 1  of shares outstanding  Additionally  short interest sits at 298 thousand shares  or 1  of shares outstanding

Balance Sheet  we made  314 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  139 million  The largest adjustment was  70 million due to   This adjustment represented 14  of reported net assets  You can see all the adjustments made to SMP s balance sheet  

Valuation  we made  114 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  114 million  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  The largest adjustment was  112 million in   which includes  30 million in   This lease adjustment represents 3  of SMP s market cap  Despite the net decrease in shareholder value  SMP remains undervalued

Commentary
Like two ships passing in the night  yesterday the NASDAQ  including the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ   took back its advantage in the game of relative performance over the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    The S P 500 lost just over a point on the day and at one point finished filling Monday s impressive gap up  The NASDAQ started strong and stayed strong enough to return to the week s high  a 0 8  gain  

The S P 500  SPY  finished reversing its impressive gap up that started the week  At least the 20 day moving average  DMA  held as uptrending support 

The NASDAQ powered its way back to the high of the week and looks poised again to recover its all time high 

Having forgone the opportunity on Monday to lock in profits on my QQQ call options  I jumped at that same chance yesterday  The options expire Friday so I could not afford the risk of another setback  Unfortunately my likely loss on the call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  will exceed those profits  The volatility index  the VIX  lost 1 0  on the day while UVXY lost 2 1  
While none of these moves   SPY  QQQ  or UVXY   are particularly notable by themselves  they stand in contrast to AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  AT40 dropped from 52 8  to 47 1   back to a 2 week low 
Adding to the warning signs were two other favorite indicators  the Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   versus the Japanese yen  JPY  or AUD JPY and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   I just finished applauding AUD JPY as a confirmation of the bullish tone of the market  My favorite forex indicator cracked 200DMA support on Tuesday and the selling continued on Wednesday 

AUD JPY is wavering right at the edge of a breakout with very bullish implications 
I did not see any news to explain Wednesday s sudden high volume 3 3  loss  Perhaps it was a much delayed reaction to May s retail data reported on Tuesday  Until proven innocent  I am interpreting CAT s selling as bearish  I already have one put option in place  but I probably need a lot more soon 

Caterpillar  CAT  suddenly tumbles from a near 3 year high 
Some of the usual suspects were at work contributing to the weakness in AT40   retail  energy  and mid caps  Some auto related stocks and shoe retailers cowered in the center of retail ugliness yesterday 
Carmax  Inc   NYSE KMX  reported strong headline earnings  In response  the stock gapped up and gained over 7  at its high  After that  the stock completely imploded 
In an earlier post I noted I was going to look for a post earnings excuse to get short KMX again  However  based on the open  I thought KMX could rally to a 10  gain or higher  So I failed to pull the trigger until KMX bounced off its low of the day toward 200DMA resistance  Even then  I took half a position and bought a call option as a hedge 

Carmax  KMX  displayed one of the ugliest post earnings gap and crap I can imagine  Its implosion form the high of the day plunged the stock back through its 50 and 200DMAs  The stock barely avoided a loss for the day 
KMX managed to close in the green  but auto parts stocks were not so lucky  For example  Autozone  NYSE AZO  lost 1 9  and closed at a near 2 1 2 year low  The daily chart shows how pesky Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  rumors presaged the current troubles  AMZN is like a phantom looming menacingly in retail s shadows    AZO is down 22  since then 

Autozone  AZO  is down 27  year to date 

Autozone  AZO  gained about 6x post recession  It is now up 4x after spending 2016 forming a rounded top 
Footlocker  NYSE FL  led the way down for shoe retailers as Goldman Sachs released a report claiming that Nike  NYSE NKE  is close to signing a direct distribution deal with Amazon  FL was down around 10  at its lows before buyers stepped up  Given FL s existing troubles  I expect the selling to resume in due course  Note that while FL has lost 39  since mid May  the stock is still on an incredible post recession run after trading in the low single digits at one point 

The change in sentiment on Foot Locker  FL  is very clear as a severe breakdown continues apace 
Last month  Best Buy  NYSE BBY  was providing some anti Amazon hope for retail  After earnings  BBY rocketed up to an all time high  and I noted the irony given how often BBY was supposed to be doomed by competition from AMZN  Yet  BBY failed to maintain the momentum  The post earnings rule to fade BBY at the open is now up 3 9   I think a test of uptrending 50DMA support is coming if not an outright gap fill  Note carefully how volume fell off a cliff over the past three days  a 50DMA test could be a major buying opportunity 

Did Best Buy  BBY  leave its best days behind 
Intel  NASDAQ INTC  is falling behind the big cap tech pack  My last tranche of the  between earnings trade  looks like a complete bust as INTC this week confirmed a 50 200DMA breakdown and even gapped down yesterday  Analysts have come after INTC with downgrades  I do not know what to make of this beating  but I suspect I might try a pre earnings play next month 

Intel  INTC  is down 4 7  year to date and has proven unable to hold 50 200DMA support for long 
The mood is very different in the biotech sector  The iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF  NASDAQ IBB  rocketed 4 1  yesterday on a second day of very high buying volume  IBB is above its price of every single  bash  except Hillary Clinton s first campaign related bash from almost two years ago  IBB finally looks poised to overcome that last hurdle 

This week  the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  broke out from almost 18 months worth of consolidation patterns 
If current rumors are true  IBB should trade above all the recent bashes  Apparently  the drug price plan coming from the Trump administration will fall far short of Trump s campaign and presidential promises  The rumors are apparently coming to a climax this week after a report from Politico titled    last Friday  From the article 

 The administration is not proposing  as Trump did on the campaign trail  that the government negotiate drug prices or allow the importation of cheaper drugs from abroad  At a meeting Friday  top Trump administration officials reportedly made little progress on even on more modest goals that are said to be an executive order on drug prices  which the White House is pushing to release 
 Our industry sources indicate that pharma expects it has successfully shifted the dialogue from the high price of innovation to transparency and other parts of the supply chain   Wells Fargo analyst David Maris wrote in a note to investors Thursday evening   As such  several drug company executives have expressed the belief that Trump s drug price approach will not include drug re importation and Medicare negotiation of drug prices  
The industry s growing confidence comes in part from the presence of key allies in the White House  Joe Grogan  OMB s director of health programs  is working on the executive order  according to multiple sources inside and outside of the government  Grogan spent the last five years as the head of federal affairs for Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD    the drug company that helped ignite the drug pricing debate in 2013  when it set the price of a new hepatitis C treatment at more than  80 000  

Buying IBB in the wake of THAT article would have made for a great Trump Trade

Financials moved north led by gains in bank stocks  Energy shares advanced following rise in expectations of production cuts by major oil producers including Russia  Meanwhile  broader markets pared

48 to 1 ratio   Trump s Budget Plan Boosts Broader marketsMarkets stabilized on Tuesday following the release of Trump s budget plan on Monday night  Lack of updates related to the FBI probe into Mike Flynn s involvement with Russian sources over the weekend helped markets to recover from the losses it suffered due to events at the White House  Instead  Trump s first foreign visit continued to dominate headlines Even as investors digested the full budget plan  they remained doubtful over the likelihood of its approval in Congress  Trump s budget seeks to cut federal spending by  3 6 trillion with a focus on balancing the budget over the next decade through cuts in healthcare and food assistance programs  The budget plan is expected to make changes to key programs such as Medicaid  food stamps and federal student loans through steep cuts in government spending in these areas  Defense and infrastructure are among the few areas where the budget proposes to increase funding However  the budget assumes the Trump administration will lower tax rates for corporate and households  The White House has proposed to slash the corporate rate to 15  and reduce individual rates from seven brackets to three  Since Trump s budget plan came in largely as expected  it had a positive impact on the broader markets The broader Financials Select Sector SPDR  XLF  advanced 0 8   emerging

29589,251104,AZO,Top Stock Reports For Gilead  BP   Dow Chemical ,opinion,"Tuesday June 6  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Gilead  GILD   BP  LON BP   and Dow Chemical  DOW  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see 
Gilead shares have been laggards lately  on persistent fears about drug pricing and other regulatory issues that haven t eased up even after the November election  The stock has lost  25 2  of its value over the last year vs  the  9 6  decline for the Zacks Biotech industry  Gilead s HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens which now represent 42  of total Gilead HIV prescription volume  Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting should also boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017  However  Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread this year in some countries outside the U S   which should impact sales  Additionally  the HCV franchise continues to be undercompetitive and pricing pressure is leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales   You can   
BP share have gained  9 1  over the past 12 months  outperforming the Zacks Oil   Gas International Integrated industry which has lost  0 8  over the same period  as well as rival Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   up  5 1    The Zacks analyst stresses that the petroleum giant s upstream projects are expected to generte significant cash flows starting 2020 and beyond  Moreover  the company s drilling operations are becoming efficient as reflected by the steady decline in non productive time since 2012  However  the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP operated Macondo Prospect continues to affect the company  Although BP has cleared substantial litigation expenses related to the spill  it had to divest some of its best operating properties  The analyst sees the company s dividend to generally safe  but the high yield  currently yielding 6 6   indicates some market nervousness   You can   
Dow Chemical shares have gained  11 1  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry  up  7 5  over the same period   The Zacks analyst likes the planned merger with DuPont  NYSE DD   which is expected to create significant synergies  Dow should also gain from cost synergies associated with Dow Corning Silicones business and its strategic investments in the U S  Gulf Coast and the Middle East  However  Dow s agriculture business remains affected by depressed crop commodity prices  The company also faces pricing headwinds  feedstock cost pressure as well as weak demand in the energy market   You can

29656,251171,AZO,What Retail Apocalypse  These Stores Are Expanding  Not Closing,opinion,"Since the start of 2017  more than 3 200 store closures   and many are from some of the biggest names in the retail industry  Department store giants Macy s   JCPenney   and Sears are all shuttering store locations  while mall staples like The Limited and Bebe have closed down their entire brick and mortar fleet to focus on online sales 
This is just the tip of the iceberg  as retailers  especially those that sell apparel  have been hit hard by years of declining sales and customer traffic due to the rise in online shopping and  of course  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    The e commerce giant has certainly transformed the way consumers think about shopping  and this new mentality has affected business operations at many retailers  especially those based in malls 
There are  however  some corners of the retail industry that Amazon still can t seem to dominate  helping companies operating in these parts expand their store count instead of shrink it 
  a retail consulting firm  discount retailer Dollar General   NYSE DG   has plans to open as many as 1 000 new stores this year  with its fellow dollar discount peer Dollar Tree   NASDAQ DLTR   planning on opening about 650 stores in 2017 
U S  shoppers began shifting towards discount stores during the recession  with most never going back to shopping full price after the economy recovered  Other discount retailers like Ross Stores   NASDAQ ROST    TJX Cos    NYSE TJX    which owns TJ Maxx and HomeGoods  and Burlington Stores   NYSE BURL   have directly benefitted  and are all opening stores in the double digits this year 
German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl are expanding as well  While  for some time now  Lidl  this year up and down the East Coast  Both grocers offer customers a no frills grocery shopping experience  Think the opposition of Whole Foods   in aesthetic and in how much your total bill is 
Even traditional grocers are growing this year  Kroger  NYSE KR   is planning on opening 55 new locations  while Walmart   NYSE WMT   and Sprouts Farmers Market   NASDAQ SFM   have plans for 59 and 32 new stores  respectively  Other big box rivals like Target   NYSE TGT   and Costco   NASDAQ COST   are expanding as well  according to IHL 
Beauty giant Ulta   one of the bright spots in the retail industry  is going to open 100 stores in 2017  with two huge locations opening on Chicago s Michigan Avenue and in New York City s Upper East Side  Ulta s main rival  Sephora  which is owned by luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Mo t Hennessy  is also opening as many as 70 new stores this year 
The beauty industry thrives  in large part  because of its reliance on brick and mortar  There s a specific level of trust with beauty products that you need to experience face to face  if you will  And  if you have ever been in to an Ulta or Sephora  the first thing you likely note is either how busy it is in the store  or how long the line is  Both companies also generate a ton of online business and have great rewards programs  a combination that keeps the shadow of Amazon  
Other retailers expanding this year include automaker parts companies O Reilly Automotive   NASDAQ ORLY   and Autozone   NYSE AZO    Tractor Supply   NYSE TSO    Hobby Lobby  Aerie  the lingerie division of American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO    Dick s Sporting Goods   Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    and Bonobos  which is

29740,251255,AZO,Yext s IPO Shows A Better Tech Market,opinion,"The tech IPO market is recovering as the hype around the Snap Inc  NYSE SNAP  IPO and the success of MuleSoft demonstrate  and other tech companies are preparing to go public soon as well  On Tuesday  Yext released pricing details on its upcoming IPO  announcing that it plans to raise up to  105 million by selling 10 5 million shares at a price range of  8 to  10   reports that Yext will trade under the NYSE under the label  YEXT  
The rising tech market and the low share price makes Yext look like an attractive investment  and Yext offers a useful service by helping businesses manage their digital knowledge  But there are issues with its portended path to profitability which should hold this stock s value back  Yext currently appears to be a decent  though not great investment for those who can get in at its current low share price  but investors should consider balking at a higher price until it can show how it intends to be profitable  Managing Digital Knowledge
Businesses today are in a struggle to manage their online reputation  and that fight is made even harder by numerous third party sites like Google Maps  Yelp Inc  NYSE YELP   or Cortana  Inaccurate information or poor reviews can tank a business s online reputation or sales  but businesses can have a hard time keeping track of these different websites or apps 
That is where Yext comes in  In its   Yext purports to be a  knowledge engine  which  lets businesses manage their digital knowledge in the cloud and sync it to over 100 services   Digital knowledge means information which a business wants to make publicly accessible  such as the menu for a restaurant or what health insurance a physician accepts 
By being a single hub through which a business can manage their  without having to go through each site individually  Yext makes things easier for both businesses and customers who can report and receive accurate information respectively  In addition to the benefits from accurate information  being listed on more third party websites can increase a business s ranking on Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  
This is a useful service  and Yext has been able to build a strong client list including McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   Ben   Jerry s  AutoZone  NYSE AZO   and Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY   The company s revenue has grown from  60 million in the fiscal year ending January 2015 to  124 million in the fiscal year ending January 2017  and it claims to have growth potential both with further businesses in the United States and overseas  Growth and Profitability Problems
But while Yext wants us to believe that it can help practically any business  it appears to be primarily a tool for larger corporations  Yext is not exactly cheap  as its  costs  500 per year  Furthermore  if a company chooses to stop using Yext  Yext will revert all of the listing changes it made back to what they were before Yext  A cash strapped business which only has half a dozen locations is probably not going to be interested in paying  500 per year to fix listings which it could handle itself given time  McDonald s by contrast is a different story 
This places a damper on Yext s growth potential  which is problematic given its lack of profitability  While Yext s revenue may have grown astronomically from 2015 to 2017  its net losses increased from  17 million to  43 million in that same time frame  While there is nothing wrong or unusual about a tech company reporting net losses before going public these days  increasing net losses to that extent are a concern  A Tentative Yes   but only for Some
There are certainly worse companies out there which have a share price that low  and Yext is a growing company which sells a useful service especially for large corporations  And while its potential with small business is probably limited  Yext is showing a good willingness to grow as is shown by its efforts to expand overseas 
But Yext needs to provide a better answer towards the question of how it will become profitable down the line  Yext is following on the coattails of Snap  which has seen its stock struggle since its IPO for similar reasons  But Snap could point to a long history of innovation and willingness to try new things as a reason for why it can turn around  while Yext cannot 
Rising confidence in the tech market as well as Yext s low share price do mean that this company should perform very well out of the gate  and investors who can get in on the ground floor should attempt to do so  However  the vast majority of people who will have to wait until the initial boom is over to pick up Yext stock should remain cautious  Yext still has some time until its formal debut to explain its plans towards profitability  but investors who cannot get in immediately should wait and see before deciding to buy this stock for the long term ",2017-03-31,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yext’s-ipo-shows-a-better-tech-market-200180850,200180850

29752,251267,AZO,Opening Bell  Italian Referendum Fails  Will Euro  Markets Head Lower ,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Though the results of Italy s much awaited constitutional referendum were no surprise   polls actually got this one right   still Matteo Renzi s stinging defeat yesterday puts the Italian financial sector  and perhaps its future in the EU into question  As Renzi promised should the referendum not pass  he announced his intention to resign  which could happen as early as this afternoon in Italy 
Renzi s resignation could immediately trigger an Italian and perhaps even Eurozone banking crisis  As we wrote here on Thursday 

Italy is the eurozone s third largest economy  but the banking industry there is on precarious footing  currently grappling with over  200 billion in non performing debt  from approximately 10 times as many unpaid loans compared to US institutions   So far this year  Italian banks have  their European peers by 40   For Italian bank shares the price of a  no  vote may already be priced in  However there s a risk that as many as eight Italian banks could fail  which could become a contagion for other European banks  Unicredit  MI CRDI   MI CRDI   Italy s largest bank  Spain s Banco Popular  MC POP   Portugal s Caixa Geral de Dep sitos and even Germany s Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   DE DBKGn  may end up seeing their  

The world s oldest bank  as well as Italy s third largest  Banca Monte dei Paschi  MI BMPS   is in the most immediate trouble  having failed the ECB s recent stress test  and is in need of a rescue from somewhere  They have a meeting with JP Morgan and Italian investment bank Mediobanca advisors today regarding how to recapitalize in light of adverse market conditions 
In light of risks coming out of the Eurozone  markets will start this week on shakier footing  Though November was a great month for Wall Street  current event risk from the Eurozone could see US markets move lower this coming week  During November the Dow had a 1 000 point gain  to surpass 19 000 and increased 5 4   the S P 500 gained 3 4   and the NASDAQ was up 2 6   The smallcap Russell 2000 outperformed them all with a November jump of 11   its best month in five years  Each of the four indices reached record highs 
However  after nearly three weeks of solid gains  the stock market finally took a break throughout last week  The Dow edged up 0 1   the S P slipped 1   and the NASDAQ reversed 2 7  
In Asia overnight the Italian referendum outcome took its toll  the Nikkei fell 0 82  to close at 18 274 99  the Shanghai Composite dropped 1 22  to 3 204 35  the Hang Seng dipped 0 33  lower  to 22 490 
In Europe markets opened higher  the FTSE is up 0 46  currently at 6 762  the DAX is up 1 64   currently trading at 10 686 and the Stoxx 50 is up 1 38  to 3 059 
In US pre market trading the S P is up 0 38   the Dow is up 0 42  and the NASDAQ is up 0 46 
The bond sell off continued for most of last week  but has eased up following Friday s NFP report  2 year bond yield is now 1 096   10 year yield is 2 371   30 year yield rose to 3 037  
Forex
Last week provided mostly good news about the US economy  Data highlights included  Tuesday s Q3 GDP reported an increase of 3 2    the best quarterly pace recorded in two years  Friday s NFP release showed 178 000 new jobs created in November  but the headline number turned out to be the unemployment rate which fell to 4 6   the lowest level in nine years  If there was any disappointment with Friday s release it came from the wage growth  which fell 0 1   instead of a 0 2  expected increase 
Last Friday s NFP was the last major employment report prior to the Fed s next meeting which begins on December 13  It is almost certain a rate hike will follow  The approach of an almost certain rate hike has been one of the major catalysts driving the recent surge in the dollar  Barring an economic surprise  Trump s policies after he takes office in January will determine whether the dollar s bullish trajectory continues 
The recent dollar sell off has spelled good news for the Canadian dollar  which gained 0 2  to end last week as oil prices rallied following an actual OPEC deal to cut production  Canadian data last week was also better than expected  with encouraging GDP and job growth numbers  CAD could extend to 1 31 next  although if the USD strengthens  it could fall to 1 35  close to its nine month lows  It s currently at 1 3321 

Fellow commodity currencies  AUD  NZD  and RUB gained last week as well  as did safe haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc  A rising dollar this morning has since erased some of those gains 
The pound and euro both ended the week up  However  both currencies took a tumble today  in response to Italian referendum results  The euro especially fell to a 20 month low before regaining some ground  GBP USD is currently at 1 2698  EUR USD is at 1 0598 and is nearing critical major support level around 1 04 
ECB President Mario Draghi is speaking at 9 AM ET this morning and his comments will help determine what happens next within the Eurozone  The ECB will meet again on Thursday to discuss an extension of its QE program  Due to the voting results in Italy and resultant turmoil  they may also have to discuss buying Italian bonds to quiet unsettled markets 
Commodities
Oil prices took a sizeable leap last week when OPEC members agreed on a deal to limit output by 1 2 million barrels per day  about 2  of global oil production   Crude is currently trading at  52 18  while Brent is at  55 09 
A continuing oil rally could now depend on non OPEC members such as Russia also committing to cut output when OPEC meets next on December 9  Longer term  prices will also depend on the ability of OPEC members to stick to their quotas  despite the obvious incentives to cheat and profit from a few extra barrels produced on the side 
Oil could also receive a boost as the permit to build the Standing Rock section of the  following weeks of protest by Native Americans and environmentalists  The setback may only prove temporary  the US Army Corps of Engineers will look for an alternative route for the pipeline 
Gold ended the week on a slightly higher note  rising 0 82   However  with strength returning to the dollar in today s trading  as well as the belief that a mid month rate hike is imminent  gold will likely head back down again  It s currently trading at  1 166 75
Stocks
As mentioned earlier  Wall Street finished the week down  However  the Financial and Energy Indices showed gains on the week  finishing on positive notes

Within the Energy sector  a number of companies performed well  Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL   RPC  NYSE RES   Transocean  NYSE RIG   EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Sunoco LP  NYSE SUN   and Continental Resources NYSE CLR  all pushed higher by 10 30  since the OPEC production freeze announcement  However  several Big Oil stalwarts  such as Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  saw only small  2 3   gains 
Goldman Sachs analysts see oil prices hovering around  55 through the first half of 2017  which means smaller drillers like EOG Resources  who say they are  after below  50 oil forced severe cost cutting measures in order for them to remain profitable  are put in a strong position to prosper as the price of oil rises  Big Oil companies  like Exxon  Chevron  or Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSb   may see fewer benefits at this price point 
After performing well early last week on the tails of positive Black Friday Cyber Monday sales the Consumer Discretionary Index lagged at the close of the week as a result of broader profit taking  finishing down 2   However  the National Retail Federation expects total holiday season sales to grow by approximately 3 6  this year  to  655 8 billion  If so  the retail sector could see a boost 
The bigger question is whether any e tailer can mount serious competition to Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   which accounted for fully   Shares of brick and mortar retailers Best Buy  NYSE BBY   Target  NYSE TGT   and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  are all up  However  many people expected Wal Mart s investment in online sales to have moved it ahead of Target when in fact  Target s slice of the Cyber Weekend pie eclipsed that of Wal Mart  4 4  to 4 1   Wal Mart s percentage of online revenue  by 1  YoY

Christmas sales may be a given this time of year  the notion that a Santa Rally in December is assured might just be a myth 
Financials received a 0 85  boost to close the week in the black  This may have partly been due to Trump appointing former Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin as the next Secretary of the Treasury  Trump still needs to fill several other Treasury posts  as well as nominate the next head of the SEC  His selections could have an impact on the financial and banking sectors this week as could blow back from the Italian Eurozone banking sectors

Rite Aid  NYSE RAD 
Rite Aid s earnings last quarter were sluggish mainly due to weakness and inefficiencies in its pharmacy business  Nonetheless  Rite Aid s focus on expanding its portfolio of health and wellness services and ongoing efforts to enhance its pharmacy business still bode well  Pending approval from the FTC over approval of the Walgreens Rite Aide merger will likely be a talking point in the company s conference call  The deal was reached earlier this year  but still hasn t been finalized

The market is totally consumed with the Fed question  Will it announce a rate hike at next month s meeting or delay it further  The odds have steadily gone up since minutes of the last Fed minute came out  which indicated that the market was behind the curve in reading the central bank s intentions 
The Fed s next steps are contingent on how the economic picture evolves in the coming days  particularly the next monthly jobs reading that comes out at the end of next week  But even on that count  many suspect that the Fed many not actually need to see a 200K plus jobs tally to get comfortable about the economy  it could be OK with what we saw last month when the jobs report showed only a 160K tally  It is these growing rate hike odds that have been weighing on the market lately  a trend that will likely continue in the coming days

AutoZone reported a 12 6  rise in earnings per share to  10 77 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016  ended May 7  2016  from  9 57 recorded in the year ago quarter  Earnings  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 96 by a wide margin 
Quarterly revenues improved 4  year over year to  2 59 billion in the reported quarter  However  the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 65 billion 
The third quarter of fiscal 2016 marked the 39th consecutive quarter in which AutoZone s earnings per share have grown in double digits  Earnings are expected to rise further  driven by flourishing revenues  increasing store count and regular share buybacks 
AutoZone uses its significant cash flow to open new stores every year  It maintains a low single digit square foot growth rate  The company opened 85 stores in the U S   17 stores in Mexico and 1 store in Brazil  along with 5 Interamerican Motor Corporation   IMC   branches during the first nine months of fiscal 2016  Also  it relocated 4 stores in the U S 
The strong cash flows also help AutoZone to aggressively repurchase shares  In the third quarter  it repurchased 687 000 shares for  533 million 
However  cost headwinds related to opening new distribution centers and increasing the frequency of deliveries to stores are concerns for AutoZone  Currency headwinds also pose a challenge 
Foreign currency headwinds reduced the earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  growth rate by over 1 percentage point in the first quarter  2 percentage points in the second quarter and 1 percentage point in the third quarter of fiscal 2016  The company expects the currency related pressure from the Mexican business to continue as long as the peso stays at elevated levels

29894,251409,AZO,What Will The Q2 Earnings Season Bring ,opinion,"The following is an excerpt from this week s Earnings Trends piece   To access the full article   

	We all know that the corporate earnings picture has been sub par for a while now  with growth in negative the last four quarters and the trend of earnings declines expected to continue in the Q2 earnings season that takes the spotlight in about three weeks  time  Another earnings decline this coming earnings season would be the 5th quarter in a row for the S P 500 index  This reflects not only the drag from the Energy sector and the U S  dollar s strength  but also maturation of the current earnings cycle that got underway in the fall of 2009 
	As bad as this picture looks  one encouraging sign that emerged out of the last earnings season was that estimates for the current period  June quarter  didn t fall as much as had been the pattern in the preceding quarters  What this means is that while estimates for the June quarter fell as companies reported Q1 results  but the magnitude of negative revisions was below other recent periods  The turnaround in oil prices from the February 2016 lows and the fading impact of the dollar strength were big contributors to this favorable development 
	It will be interesting to see if we will notice a replay of this trend in the Q2 earnings season   we will be watching how estimates for the September quarter evolve as companies report their June quarter results in the coming weeks 
	The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for the Q2 earnings season  As you can  the reporting cycle doesn t really ramp up till the week of July 18th 



	Keep in mind  however  that the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already  as companies with fiscal quarters ending in May get counted as part of the June quarter tally  We have had results from three S P 500 members already   Costco  NASDAQ COST      AutoZone  NYSE AZO     and Oracle  NYSE ORCL      We have seven index members  including Adobe    and FedEx  NYSE FDX      coming out with results this week  all of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in May  Estimates for Q2   Beyond
	Total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  5 9  from the same period last year on  0 7  lower revenues  with earnings growth expected to be in the negative for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  The Energy sector continues to be the big drag  but Q2 earnings growth for the index would still be in the negative even on an ex Energy basis   
	The chart below shows Q2 growth expectations contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding three quarters and estimates for the following four periods  Full year 2016 earnings growth expectations have now turned negative  similar to what we saw last year 



	Many see the Q2 earnings season as the inflection point for corporate earnings  with the growth picture starting improve from Q3 onwards and turning positive in the back half of the year  The proof of this narrative will become clear in the coming days as more companies report Q2 results and provide color on the evolving business picture

We all know that the corporate earnings picture has been sub par for a while now  with growth in negative the last four quarters and the trend of earnings declines expected to continue in the Q2 earnings season that takes the spotlight in about three weeks  time  Another earnings decline this coming earnings season would be the 5th quarter in a row for the S P 500 index  This reflects not only the drag from the Energy sector and the U S  dollar s strength  but also maturation of the current earnings cycle that got underway in the fall of 2009 
	As bad as this picture looks  one encouraging sign that emerged out of the last earnings season was that estimates for the current period  June quarter  didn t fall as much as had been the pattern in the preceding quarters  What this means is that while estimates for the June quarter fell as companies reported Q1 results  but the magnitude of negative revisions was below other recent periods  The turnaround in oil prices from the February 2016 lows and the fading impact of the dollar strength were big contributors to this favorable development 
	It will be interesting to see if we will notice a replay of this trend in the Q2 earnings season   we will be watching how estimates for the September quarter evolve as companies report their June quarter results in the coming weeks 
	The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for the Q2 earnings season  As you can  the reporting cycle doesn t really ramp up till the week of July 18th 

Keep in mind  however  that the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already  as companies with fiscal quarters ending in May get counted as part of the June quarter tally  We have had results from three S P 500 members already   Costco  NASDAQ COST      AutoZone  NYSE AZO     and Oracle  NYSE ORCL       We have seven index members  including Adobe    and FedEx  NYSE FDX      coming out with results this week  all of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in May  Estimates for Q2   Beyond
	Total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  5 9  from the same period last year on  0 7  lower revenues  with earnings growth expected to be in the negative for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  The Energy sector continues to be the big drag  but Q2 earnings growth for the index would still be in the negative even on an ex Energy basis 
	Q2 growth expectations contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding three quarters and estimates for the following four periods  Full year 2016 earnings growth expectations have now turned negative  similar to what we saw last year 

Many see the Q2 earnings season as the inflection point for corporate earnings  with the growth picture starting improve from Q3 onwards and turning positive in the back half of the year  The proof of this narrative will become clear in the coming days as more companies report Q2 results and provide color on the evolving business picture

29924,251439,AZO,Next Market Breakout Awaits Fed Decision,opinion,Tuesday  May 24  2016Stocks are modestly up this morning  but lack conviction given the Fed uncertainty  The New Home sales report coming out a little later is the only notable economic reading today on an otherwise light data calendar The market is totally consumed with the Fed question  Will it announce a rate hike at next month s meeting or delay it further  The odds have steadily gone up since minutes of the last Fed minute came out  which indicated that the market was behind the curve in reading the central bank s intentions The Fed s next steps are contingent on how the economic picture evolves in the coming days  particularly the next monthly jobs reading that comes out at the end of next week  But even on that count  many suspect that the Fed many not actually need to see a 200K plus jobs tally to get comfortable about the economy  it could be OK with what we saw last month when the jobs report showed only a 160K tally  It is these growing rate hike odds that have been weighing on the market lately  a trend that will likely continue in the coming days In corporate news  the parade of weak retail sector earnings reports continued this morning with weak results from Best Buy   NYSE BBY   and AutoZone   NYSE AZO    The Best Buy report actually came ahead of estimates  though guidance was on the weak side  while AutoZone blamed weather for its weaker than expected quarterly results  Best Buy shares are taking a hit today  but they have done reasonably well lately and performed better than the S P 500 in the year to date period on the back of a steadily improving operating outlook Sheraz MianDirector of ResearchNote  In addition to this daily pre open article about the market  economy  and the corporate earnings picture  Sheraz Mian also provides detailed earnings analysis in his weekly  and  reports  If you want an email notification each time Sheraz Mian publishes a new article   ,2016-05-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/next-market-breakout-awaits-fed-decision-200131850,200131850
29927,251442,AZO,High ROIC Stocks Outperformed In 2008,opinion,"What do toy company Hasbro  O HAS   retail giant Wal Mart  N WMT   tax preparer H R Block  N HRB   auto parts store AutoZone  N AZO   and biotech companies Gilead  GILD   Amgen  O AMGN   and Celgene  O CELG  all have in common 
They are the only surviving S P 500 stocks to rise 10  or more in 2008  In the midst of a collapsing market and the subsequent damage  these seven stocks made good money for investors 
What other trait do they share  They all earn a consistently high return on invested capital     Six out of these seven companies have earned a double digit ROIC in every year for the past decade  and the one exception  CELG  has managed it in nine out of ten 
Figure 1  S P 500 Stocks That Made Big Money In 2008

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Figure 1 shows that all seven companies earned a high ROIC going into the disastrous year of 2008  CELG struggled to a 5  ROIC in 2008 before quickly rebounding  while all of the other companies continued their strong profitability even in a poor economy 
The success of these stocks can t be credited solely to their industries either  HAS competitor Mattel  O MAT  dropped 16  on the year  AZO competitor Pep Boys Manny Moe   Jack  N PBY  actually did worse than the broader market and fell over 60  in 2008 
Strong In A Bull Market Too
Not only did these stocks thrive during the market crash  they ve done incredibly well in the recovery too  All except HRB and WMT have outperformed the S P 500  and an equal weight bundle of these seven stocks would have returned 233  since the recovery began  35  better than the S P 500 
For those who wonder why we put so much work into adjusting the income statement and balance sheet to get ROIC  here is your answer  Empirical research shows that ROIC  not P E is the most important driver of valuation  Long term  companies that can earn superior returns on capital are the ones that outperform  regardless of the market climate

29928,251443,AZO,2 Stocks To Ride The Auto Part Industry s Wild Surge ,opinion,"This week s chart highlights an industry that s  simply  crushing it 
Over the last 10 years  the auto parts retail industry has produced a return of 560   Compare that to the broader market s respectable  but less inspiring  return of 103  
So what s driving this growth 
The recent drop in oil and gas prices is certainly playing its part  With cheaper gas  people are inclined to drive more   This is also true for air travel  as my fellow researcher Bob Creed  a few weeks back  
And with more driving comes more wear and tear  This is creating greater demand for auto parts and maintenance services 
Drivers are also keeping their cars longer  According to industry research firm IHS Automotive  the average age of lightweight vehicles has risen to 11 5 years 
Naturally  the older the car the more likely it will need repairs 
And unlike other retailers  auto parts stores are hardly affected by the   Most of us still rely on mechanics to repair and maintain our vehicles  That s unlikely to change anytime soon 
Another factor supporting this trend  Driving services like Uber and Lyft 
A growing number of drivers are staying on the roads longer to earn supplemental income  And as I said  more driving means more repair and maintenance needs 
That s why Uber and Lyft offer discount incentives to their drivers  These discounts are available at retailers such as Jiffy Lube  Meineke  Midas Gold Corp   TO MAX   Firestone Ventures Inc   TO FV   Advance Auto Parts Inc  N AAP  and AutoZone  NYSE  N AZO  
In effect  Uber and Lyft are driving traffic to some of the industry s most recognized companies  And if you re an auto parts retailer  this is music to your ears 
Take AutoZone  for example  It has seen consistent year over year sales growth for the past 25 years 
The first quarter of fiscal 2016 saw a 14  rise in earnings per share to  8 29  That s on a 5 6  boost in sales  It s also the 37th consecutive quarter of double digit earnings per share growth 
And the stock price  It s up a solid 21 5  for the year 
Or how about OReilly Automotive Inc  O ORLY   As with its industry peer  annual sales have grown without interruption since the early  90s  Its earnings per share bumped up 28  in the most recent quarter as sales grew 10 8  
So far this year  the company s stock price has surged an even more impressive 33 4  
Both companies have made efforts to increase shareholder value through share buyback programs  O Reilly has repurchased over  5 billion of its shares since 2011  And in 2014 alone  AutoZone repurchased  1 1 billion worth of its shares 
Lastly  both are investing in their commercial sales 
In the past  AutoZone and O Reilly have largely focused on the   emphasizing parts retail over maintenance services  But that s changing as these companies ramp up their  do it for me  commercial sales and seek to open additional stores nationwide 
Either company is worth a closer look by investors  You don t want to miss the chance to ride this uptrend ",2015-12-13,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-stocks-to-ride-the-auto-part-industry’s-wild-surge-375602,375602
29929,251444,AZO,8 Iconic American Companies Hurt By The Strong USD,opinion,"Since July 2014  the U S  dollar  has advanced more than 20 percent against other world currencies  To many  having a strong currency might sound like a good thing  and in many respects it is  The dollar s relative strength is a reflection of the U S  economy  which continues to improve since the financial crisis 
While a strong dollar might be good for national pride  it s been a major headache for multinational American companies  The most cited reason for subpar second quarter earnings  in fact  is the greenback  Financial number cruncher firm FactSet noted in a recent report that the impact of the strong dollar was a recurring theme in many earnings reports  from Nike  NYSE NKE  to Costco  NASDAQ COST  to AutoZone  NYSE AZO  
The reason  A strong currency makes U S  exports and products more expensive to other countries  which might encourage them to switch suppliers  It also means that the value of overseas sales is reduced when it s converted back into dollars 
In the last year  many countries and regions including Europe  Japan and  most recently   have devalued their currencies  making their export prices more attractive to foreign buyers  The Colombian peso is down 23 percent against the dollar  the Turkish lira  20 percent  The Brazilian real has lost close to 30 percent this year 
In the chart below  you can see the huge difference in second quarter earnings and revenue growth between S P 500 companies that conduct less than half of their business within the U S  and those that mostly focus outside the U S 
From materials to information technology to consumer discretionary  no sector is immune  
The only way to avoid the pitfalls of unfavorable foreign exchange rates is to restrict business to the U S   an idea most growth seeking companies wouldn t entertain  Even if business were to remain stateside  revenue could still be hurt by a lack of foreign tourists  since a strong local currency makes travel and shopping more expensive for them 
Luxury jeweler Tiffancy   Co   for one  is well aware of this fact 
Tiffany About a quarter of Tiffany s  NYSE TIF  total sales come from foreign markets  meaning the exchange rate has lately nibbled at earnings  Even though the company reported increased quarterly sales at international stores  profits fell 15 percent  from  124 1 million a year ago to  104 9 million  Tiffany is also seeing a marked decline in tourist shoppers to its flagship Fifth Avenue store this year because the dollar has made it more expensive to visit the U S 
Macy s New York based department store chain Macy s  NYSE M  has also been hit by the strong dollar  resulting in lower overseas profits and fewer tourist visitors  Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet even reported that the company s worst performance  geographically  was in its major tourist markets  To counter flat year over year revenue growth  Macy s will be closing 35 to 40 of its stores in early 2016  saving it some  300 million 
Walmart Macy s isn t the only department store that s felt the negative effects of a stronger greenback  Walmart  NYSE WMT   the Bentonville  Arkansas based retail giant  reported first quarter revenue of  114 billion  down 0 1 percent from the same quarter the previous year  According to the store  global currency fluctuations were responsible for a loss of  3 3 billion in net sales  Another issue affecting revenue right now is Walmart s decision to raise its minimum wage to  9 an hour 
Ford Few companies are as American as Ford  NYSE F   Founded by Henry Ford in 1903  the Michigan based automaker is known for its iconic brands such as the Mustang  Thunderbird and F Series line of pickup trucks  Among the  Big Three  American automakers  which also includes General Motors  NYSE GM  and Chrysler  Ford was the only one not to be bailed out by the U S  government in 2009  But in the first quarter  revenue dropped about  2 billion from the same time a year ago  Seventy percent of that drop  according to the company  was due to the effects of exchange rates 
Yum  Brands  If you haven t heard of Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   you might be more familiar with its ubiquitous fast food franchises KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  In recent years  Yum  has established a strong presence in dozens of foreign markets  including Canada  Japan  Australia and Malaysia countries whose currencies have fallen this year against the dollar  In China  where the company operates 6 400 locations  sales declined by 4 percent year over year in the second quarter because of the strong dollar 
In its earnings report  the company stated that  foreign currency translation remains a strong headwind  and that it expected the exchange rate  to impact full year EPS  earnings per share  by about 5 percentage points  
Johnson   Johnson  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  maker of iconic American brands Band Aid  Tylenol and Neutrogena  as well as many important pharmaceuticals and medical devices  Johnson   Johnson has recently benefited from the acquisition of biopharmaceutical firms Alios and Covagen  But because of wide exposure abroad  the New Jersey based company reported sharply lower sales in the second quarter 
Procter   Gamble Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  is the world s largest consumer products maker  known for its hugely popular billion dollar brands Tide  Pampers  Crest  Folgers and many more  The Cincinnati based company gets nearly two thirds of its revenue from foreign markets and maintains operations in more than 80 countries around the globe  The second quarter of 2015  however  was P G s sixth consecutive fall in quarterly sales  with more than  4 6 billion erased by foreign exchange rates  Like many multinationals  the company has been forced to raise prices in foreign markets to offset the effects of the dollar  which has only led to further declines 
U S  Steel At one time  the United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   known commonly as U S  Steel  was the largest corporation in the world  and the first to be capitalized at more than a billion dollars  Today the Pittsburgh based company is worth just under  2 5 billion and is facing serious headwinds  as the strong dollar has made steel exports from Brazil  Russia and China the world s largest producer much more competitive  As a result  U S  Steel lost money in the first two quarters of 2015 and has had to lay off over 1 700 workers 
These are only a sampling of companies that have been hurt by the strong dollar and unfavorable exchange rates  By no means are they the only ones 
It s important for investors to think long term  Although it might not happen tomorrow  the dollar will eventually decline against other world currencies  helping to give American companies a more competitive edge 
In the meantime  consider the rest of the world on sale  Traveling to Europe  for instance  is now much more affordable for American tourists  Although the strong dollar might have hurt the bottom line of many multinationals  the real winners in all of this are the everyday American consumer

29930,251445,AZO,U S  Remains Best Alternative As Global Growth Concerns Linger,opinion,"The current investment environment is challenging  to say the least  It seems every asset class or area of the world you look at  there are issues  China s industrial sector continues to struggle with the ramifications of a building binge  and these have a massive ripple effect  especially for emerging market economies heavily reliant on commodity exports  One only has to look at a country like Brazil to see how China s cold affects other countries  In what is always referred to as the next great country  it s currency  the Real  has dropped to a 15 year low this week and some economists believe the pain could get worse  Anything in the commodity space  especially the natural resource area like oil and metals  has been repeatedly walloped  This week  huge industrial giant Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  lowered revenue and earnings guidance for the third year in a row  If it happens again in 2016  it will be the first time in 90 years the company s earnings dropped four consecutive years  Lovely  just lovely 
In the United States  given the growth challenges in the rest of the world  many believe the spillover has to eventually wash up on our shores  We learned that revised second quarter GDP came in at 3 9   better than the 3 7 expected number  Consumer spending numbers also came in better than expected  Hooray  right  Wrong  Analysts have been chopping estimates for third quarter GDP down to 1 4  as there is no confidence our country can continue on it s current trajectory if the rest of the world is  shall we say this in the most pleasant way possible  stinking the joint up  Getting better all the time  huh  The Federal Reserve Board s decision last week to take a pass on raising interest rates did not help the matter  either  By backing off  an already skittish investor class became even more convinced the world may seriously end  Tomorrow  If not tomorrow  surely Monday  at the latest  CAT s big blowup did not help on the sentiment front either  and with John Bohner resigning yesterday  now we can add political uncertainty into the mix as well  Not that the big zero  President O  or our well tuned  finely functioning machine in Congress have ever added anything to give us confidence over the last 10 years  No wonder Charlie Munger says investing is not easy  and it is not supposed to be easy  Yogi Berra couldn t have said it any more eloquently  shame to see him pass away this week 
Still  unless you want to be in cash  which has outperformed all asset classes this year  you have to put money somewhere  It is not as if there is no good news from companies who reported earnings this week  In fact  there was all kinds of reason for optimism  Nike  NYSE NKE  blew away numbers  led by futures orders  from  yup  China  General Mills  NYSE GIS  also posted a good number because of cost cutting and easy comparisons  Lennar  NYSE LEN  showed nice strength in the continuing joy which is housing  If you add on a nice number from cruise leader Carnival  LONDON CCL  and car part retailer AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO   you might even think things are not half bad  In the event you got a good meal from a place like Olive Garden  which is owned by Darden Restaurants Inc  NYSE DRI  and had a fine quarter as well  you might even think things could turn out OK  Of course  that is  until you read about Blackberry  TO BB  missing it s estimate  The cherry on top would be the NASDAQ giving up it s gains on Friday as the bio tech index got hammered again  Mrs  Clinton put her two cents in on price gouging in the pharmaceutical industry  and investors said  hey forget about it  Of course  it is interesting shrill Hill did not take up the cause for students being hurt by student loans as her price point for universities  a cool 250k per lecture  ain t exactly a bargain  Don t worry  big  bad Bernie has that one covered Hill 
So  all in all  the investment world remains a place where making decisions about what to own has all kinds of cross currents to consider  As I mentioned earlier  the famed Yankee catcher Yogi Berra died this week  He had all a ton of great quotes and has now become almost a famed philosopher  In this light  his remark   When you get to the fork in the road  take it   seems very much applicable  The key question is who is making the decision and why are they headed that way  Thanks for reading the blog this week

	The Q1 earnings season provided further confirmation of the all around weak earnings picture  While an above average proportion of companies were able to beat consensus expectations  the growth challenge proved widespread and not just a function of the beleaguered Energy sector  Earnings growth remained in negative territory for the 4th quarter in a row  with the trend expected to continue in the current period as well  On the positive side  the dollar drag started fading and the magnitude of negative revisions for the current period turned out to be less severe relatively to other recent quarters 
	Estimates for Q2 have faithfully followed the well trodden path of previous quarters  as the chart below shows 
	As negative as this revisions trend looks  it is nevertheless an improvement over what we had seen in the comparable period in the preceding earnings cycle  The improved commodity price backdrop and the reduced dollar drag are some of the more plausible explanations for this development  But it is also likely that Q2 estimates had already fallen enough at the time when Q1 estimates were coming down and there is simply not that much need for further downward adjustments 
	Whatever the reason for the lower negative revisions trend for Q2 estimates  it is nevertheless a potentially positive development  particularly if sustained over the coming months  We will have to wait till July to get a better read on this development after companies start reporting June quarter results and guide towards Q3 estimates  Current estimates for Q3 are showing essentially flat growth from the year earlier level 
	The chart below shows current quarterly earnings growth expectations for the index in 2016 Q1 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual declines in the preceding three quarters  As you can see  growth is expected to be negative in 2016 Q2 and barely in positive territory in the following quarter 
	Q1 is on track to be the 4th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the index  But as you can see in the chart above  this trend of earnings declines is expected to continue into the second quarter and most likely into the following one as well Retail Sector s Q1 Scorecard
	At this stage in the reporting cycle  we have seen Q1 results from 83 7  of the retailers in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these retailers are up  2 5  from the same period last year on  5 6  higher revenues  with 69 4  beating EPS estimates and 50  beating revenue expectations 
	Positive surprises are more numerous even for the Retail sector  as you can see in the right hand side chart below 
	The growth picture emerging from the left hand side chart doesn t look so bad  with earnings growth in positive territory and revenue gains tracking above historical periods  But a lot of that momentum is a function of non department store results that came out earlier in this cycle  particularly from online vendors like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN      The sector s growth comparisons don t look so good on an ex Amazon basis  as the right hand side chart below does Q1 Earnings Scorecard  As of Friday  May 20th 
	We now have Q1 results from 480 S P 500 members or 96  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these index members are down  6 9  from the same period last year on  1 1  lower revenues  with 70 4  beating EPS estimates and 55 6  beating revenue estimates  The percentage of companies that are able to beat both EPS and revenue estimates is tracking 45 6  at this stage 
	The table below shows the current scorecard for these companies
	As you can see  columns 2   3   the Q1 earnings season has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  while another 4 sectors are past the 90  mark in their reporting tallies  The Retail sector has the most still to come at this stage with only 83 7  reported so far 
	The last column of the above table  titled  price impact   shows the average price impact of the earnings releases  The most positive reaction has been to the Transportation  Utilities  Construction and Consumer Staples sectors while the reaction to the Auto Truck Tire sector results has been the most negative of the major sectors 
	The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of 480 index members in other recent periods 
	As referred to earlier  the two key takeaways from the results thus far are First  the growth challenge is not only very obvious  but also widespread  The Energy sector is no doubt dragging the reported growth pace quite a bit  but the growth comparison still remains unfavorable even if we exclude the reported Energy sector reports from the sample of reported results  The right hand side chart below presents the growth picture on an ex Energy basis Second  positive surprises are more numerous  particularly on the revenues side  The big driver of this is the low levels to which estimates had fallen ahead of the start of this earnings season  But as indicated earlier  the improving dollar is helping matters to some extent as well 
	This incidence of more numerous positive surprises is visible in the  blended  beats comparisons as well   blended beats  refer to companies that beat both revenues as well EPS estimates  At present  45 6  of the 480 S P 500 members that have reported results are beating both EPS and revenue estimates  which is better than what we saw from the same group of companies in the preceding quarter as well as the 4 quarter and 12 quarter averages 
	Even the beleaguered Basic Materials and Industrial Products sectors have beat EPS and revenue estimates more often this time around compared to other recent periods  The proportion of Basic Material sector companies that have beat both EPS and revenue estimates in Q1 is 35 0   which compares to 4 quarter and 12 quarter averages of 10  and 22 1   respectively  The highest blended beat   are for the Construction  Conglomerates  and Aerospace sectors while the lowest is for Oil Energy Tech Sector Results
	Market participants found the Tech sector s Q1 earnings performance to be disappointing  with a number of the bellwethers like Google s parent Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL      Apple  NASDAQ AAPL     and others coming up short of estimates in their results and or guidance 
	Including all of the Tech sector reports that have come out already  we have Q1 results from 96 3  of the sector s total market capitalization in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Tech companies are down  5 4  on  0 8  higher revenues  with 67 3  beating EPS estimates and 56 4  beating revenue estimates  Excluding the Apple drag  total earnings for the rest of the sector would be up  0 8  
	This is weak performance from these Tech companies relative to what we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods  as the charts below show 
	What this shows is that not only growth remains challenged  but fewer are able to beat expectations  In fact  positive revenue surprises are tracking more than 2 percentage points below the 4 quarter average and 7 percentage points below the 12 quarter average  Please note that the sector s weak growth pace is primarily a function of tough comparisons at Apple  Excluding Apple  the sector s Q1 earnings growth would be  0 8  Q1 Estimates As a Whole
	Combining the actual results from the 480 S P 500 members that have reported results with estimates for the still to come 20 members  total Q1 earnings are currently expected to be down  6 6  from the same period last year on  1 1  lower revenues  This will be the 4th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the index 
	Energy is the big drag in Q1  as it has been in other recent periods  with total earnings for the sector expected to be down  107 8  from the same period last year on  31 5  lower revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  earnings growth for the remainder of the index would still be in the negative   down  1 3   In total  8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are on track for negative earnings growth in Q1  including Finance and Technology  the two biggest sectors in the index

29968,251483,AZO,Beware Profiteers Masquerading As Activists,opinion,"Activist investors are supposed to play a critical role in the economy  They identify underperforming managers or conflicts of interest that prevent a company from achieving its potential  A few activist investors genuinely do great things for companies  their employees and investors 
There are  however  many more investors that masquerade as activists for shareholders when they are really just looking to create short term gains for themselves 
The first kind of activist can create significant value for your portfolio  The second kind tends to weaken companies in the long term 
It s no secret we ve been on the opposite side of Bill Ackman s Pershing Square Capital on many recent stock picks  such as Herbalife  NYSE HLF   Mondelez  NASDAQ MDLZ  and  most notably  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
We believe Ackman typifies the activist behaviors that destroy  rather than create  long term shareholder value 
  Serial Acquirers 
Valeant remains one of Ackman s most prominent  and   positions 
Valeant has a  This serial acquisition strategy looks superficially accretive due to the   which allows the acquirer to artificially boost earnings per share  EPS   one of Wall Street s most hallowed metrics 
Certain activist investors love serial acquirers because they can create the illusion of growth by indiscriminately acquiring other companies  The illusion is growth in revenues  EBITDA  or non GAAP metrics that overlook the price paid for the acquiree  which  more often than not  is so high that the real cash flows of the deal are highly negative and dilutive to shareholder value 
Case in point  Valeant s debt has increased from  372 million in 2009 to  30 billion over the last twelve months  TTM   At the same time  its shares outstanding have more than doubled  while its economic earnings  the true cash flows available to shareholders  have declined from  93 million in 2009 to   685 million TTM 
Valeant has finally given up on its serial acquirer strategy  but the massive debt load seriously limits the company s strategic flexibility going forward  and the lack of cash flow from all the deals has it in trouble with its creditors 
Increase In Debt And Share Count For Valeant

Activists such as Ackman love to tout the  platform value  of serial acquirers  They claim these companies can unlock value from the companies they acquire through superior management 
While it s true that some companies have this capability  just look at how Disney has unlocked the value in Pixar  Marvel  and Lucasfilm   these cases are few and far between 
 Playing Both Sides Of the Deal
Another favorite Ackman strategy involves buying up shares in one company while working to help another company acquire that position  We saw this with both Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  and Zoetis  NYSE ZTS   two companies that Ackman bought shares in while working with Valeant on an acquisition 
Beware what you hear about companies where an activist is on both sides of the deal  They may be more focused on getting a quick win to boost their performance  while long term shareholders deserve much more 
Shareholders would be better off if activists just left the company alone  Since 2012  ZTS has grown after tax profit by 20  compounded annually and increased its return on invested capital from 11  to a top quintile 17  
Pushing the company to accept an offer from a firm such as Valeant  with a history of value destruction  is a disservice to current shareholders  not an unlocking of value 
On top of that  these acquisition dramas create unnecessary distractions from the important work of running the business  Allergan s CEO David Pyott told CNBC that fending off Ackman and Valeant was a full time job 
The run up in Allergan s shares netted Ackman  2 2 billion  but one has to believe the company would have been better off with the CEO devoting his time to running the company 
 Financial Engineering
The Valeant Allergan saga is far from the first example of Ackman extracting short term value from a company while hurting it in the long term 
For another case study  look at his 2005 investment in Wendy s  NASDAQ WEN   Ackman convinced the fast food chain to refranchise a number of stores  sell off Tim Horton s its most profitable business and use the proceeds to buy back over  1 billion in stock 
The move delivered short term gains to shareholders  and Ackman booked a nearly 100  return when he sold his shares soon after during a feud with management 
Wendy s never recovered from the loss of Tim Horton s  Its credit rating was cut  making it more difficult to fund investment through debt  and buying back all those shares used up resources that could have helped renovate stores and keep the chain competitive with McDonald s  NYSE MCD   where Ackman tried and failed to push through a similar plan 
Today  Wendy s stock price remains mired below its level from before Ackman s involvement  and the company consistently earns an ROIC near the bottom of its peer group 
By focusing on financial maneuvers such as refranchising  spin offs  and buybacks  Ackman successfully extracted short term value from the company while hurting long term shareholders 
 Bad Corporate Governance From Focus on Non GAAP Earnings
The use of non GAAP metrics is something we have warned about many times  The biggest issue with non GAAP metrics is that management has wide discretion to add income or remove expenses  which means they can easily manipulate the non GAAP metrics 
Unfortunately  activist investors gravitate towards firms that highlight their non GAAP metrics because it becomes easier to hide shareholder destruction in the short term 
Unsurprisingly  Valeant was one of the biggest proponents of non GAAP metrics  The company s executives bonuses were tied to a non GAAP metric they called  cash EPS  that excluded costs related to acquisitions  as well as stock based compensation 
Valeant is far from the only example of lax corporate governance on non GAAP issues  Take for example Jarden Corporation  JAH   a firm Ackman voiced strong support for in May 2015  We put Jarden in the Danger Zone in October 2015 due in part to its use of non GAAP metrics for executive compensation 
As long as the firm pays executives based on  adjusted EPS   which conveniently removes certain restructuring and acquisitions costs  JAH will continue to destroy shareholder value 
Jarden also fits the description of serial acquirer and takeover target when it agreed to a deal with Newell Rubbermaid  NYSE NWL  in December 2015 
 Unlocking Value  Misses Opportunities
Valeant might be in the news more of late  but one of Ackman s most high profile positions might be Herbalife  HLF   about which he released details in a 342 slide presentation in late 2012 
We highlighted the strengths of Herbalife s business in August 2013  and despite continued criticism  the company continues to counter each of Ackman s claims  as well as investigations by the SEC 
Instead of going to  0 share  as Ackman predicted  HLF increased over 144  in 2013 and remains up over 80  since Ackman first announced his position 
We noted the strength of Herbalife s business in our report and the thesis hasn t changed  Over the past decade  Herbalife has grown NOPAT by 15  compounded annually and increased its ROIC from 21  to a top quintile 32  over the same timeframe 
Best of all  Herbalife remains undervalued  At its current price of  55 share  HLF has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 4  This ratio means that the market expects Herbalife to only grow NOPAT by 30  over the remainder of its corporate life 
If Herbalife can grow NOPAT by just 7  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  80 share today   a 37  upside 
Activists Should Play A Positive Role  But They Don t
There is no shortage of targets out for activists that truly want to unlock long term value 
Many companies have misguided executive compensation plans that push management towards acquisitions and other activities that destroy shareholder value  Just look at how misaligned executive compensation plans helped push profitable Men s Wearhouse  NYSE TLRD  into the disastrous acquisition of Jos  A  Bank 
Activists have more opportunity than ever to push back against misaligned executive compensation plans  The Dodd Frank Act in 2010 requires all companies to allow  Say On Pay  votes where shareholders can make their voices heard on executive compensation 
We d love to see activists with the resources to take on big companies make a push to better align executive compensation with long term shareholder value  We have compelling proof in the form of AutoZone  NYSE AZO  that linking executive compensation to ROIC can help companies deliver market beating returns 
Unfortunately  activists seem to be going the opposite direction  Between 2009 2014  fewer activist campaigns targeted issues surrounding executive compensation and corporate governance  Instead  activists radically increased their demands for buybacks  spin offs  acquisitions  and other feats of financial engineering 
Activists also seem to be taking a short term on their investments  84  of all activist investments last less than two years  according to FactSet 
The good news  These types of activists have underperformed this year  Ackman has led the pack downward  Even before Valeant dropped 50  in March  his losses in 2015 and 2016 had already erased any gains he made in 2014 
Maybe this underperformance will push activists away from the financial engineering and towards more substantive changes that truly benefit shareholders 
Until then  don t listen to activist investors claiming they can unlock value unless they articulate a focus on ROIC and long term cash flows  Look past the typical noise and focus on fundamentals 
Find companies that consistently generate profit  earn a quality return on invested capital  and have a stock price where expectations for future cash flows are low

29994,251509,AZO,3 Companies Benefiting From A Strong U S  Dollar,opinion,"Much has been made about how the stronger U S  dollar is hurting corporate profits  And rightfully so 

Approximately 46  of all revenues for the S P 500 come from outside of the United States  A strong dollar makes American goods comparatively more expensive and foreign earnings worth less when translated back to U S  dollars  And  oh  how the dollar has strengthened 



That creates a major headwind for multinational firms which export a large percentage of their goods overseas  And it is a big reason why many companies have issued very tepid 2015 guidance  leading analysts to slash their earnings estimates 



This could lead to what many are calling an earnings recession in the first half of 2015  or two consecutive quarters of negative earnings growth 

Strong Dollar Winners and Losers

Of course  some sectors are more exposed to a stronger dollar than others  Information Technology derives more revenue from outside of the U S  than any other at 57   Energy is not far behind at 55  

However  other sectors are essentially immune from currency fluctuations  Both Utilities and Telecom derive virtually none of their revenue from overseas 

Additionally  small caps  on average  have less overseas exposure than large caps  Just 19  of sales for the small cap Russell 2000 index come from outside of the U S 

However  there are some companies that should actually benefit from a strong U S  dollar 

In particular  companies that derive most of their revenue here in the United States but who have most of their costs overseas in other currencies should benefit as the rising dollar boosts their profit margins 

Think about a company that sells widgets here in the U S  but makes them in Mexico  Their top line is not directly affected by a stronger dollar  but a large portion of their costs  which are paid in pesos  are now cheaper 

Additionally  overseas firms who export to the United States could see an uptick in demand as their goods are now  on sale  relative to their U S  competitors  The German and Japanese automakers are a good example  Of course  Americans investing in these foreign companies would have this benefit offset as the stronger dollar also decreases the value of their investment 

So what are some specific stocks for U S  investors to play the dollar rally 

Here are 3 names 

American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO 

American Eagle Outfitters is an apparel and accessories retailer with 1 056 stores under the American Eagle Outfitters and aerie brands  Over 87  of these stores are located in the United States  so the vast majority of its revenue is denominated in U S  dollars  However  the company substantially purchases all of its merchandise from non American suppliers and manufacturers  and it currently does not hedge its foreign currency risks 

Tile Shop Holdings  NASDAQ TTS 

The Tile Shop sells a wide variety of stone tiles  setting and maintenance materials  and related accessories through its 107 stores in 31 states  All of its revenues come from the U S  However  the company sources its products from approximately 130 vendors from around the globe  with 90  coming from outside of the United States  52  from  36  from Europe  and 2  from South America  

Standard Motor Products  NYSE SMP 

Standard Motor Products manufactures and distributes replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry  The company sell its products primarily to large U S  retail chains like O Reilly Automotive  NAPA Auto Parts  Advance Auto Parts  and AutoZone  NYSE AZO   Nearly 90  of Standard Motor s revenue comes from the United States  However  it manufactures its products around the globe  with facilities in Canada  Poland and Mexico  And it wants to increase its manufacturing footprint in low cost regions 

The Bottom Line

The strong dollar has been a headwind for the overall stock market  However  not all companies are hurt by a rising greenback  And these three companies are well positioned to benefit from it ",2015-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-companies-benefiting-from-a-strong-dollar-246967,246967
30010,251525,AZO,No Replacements Needed  AZO Is A Winner,opinion,"This week s Hot Stock  AutoZone  NYSE AZO   a distributor and retailer of automotive replacement parts and accessories has long been a favorite stock of ours   back in February 2014  and the stock price has increased over 27  since then  This large price increase rightfully begs the question of whether or not AutoZone is still a good investment  With another impressive quarter recently in the books along with quality management partaking in shareholder friendly activities  the answer remains a resounding yes  We feel 2015 could be another great year for AZO  which currently earns our Attractive rating 

The exceptional revenue and profit growth  along with the class leading return on invested capital    that we highlighted in our previous report have only gotten stronger  AutoZone has increased its after tax profit    every single year since 1998  which includes 3  NOPAT growth in 2014  Similarly  AutoZone has maintained a ROIC at or above 20  since 2003 and had a top quintile 24  ROIC in 2014  In its 2Q15 earnings report  AutoZone announced that it had grown revenue by 8  year over year  which allowed the company to grow NOPAT by 4  on a trailing twelve month basis 

Despite AutoZone s impressive history of NOPAT and ROIC growth  along with the great increase in stock price over the last year  AZO remains a great investment opportunity  At its current price of   688 share  AutoZone has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 2  This ratio implies the market expects AutoZone to only grow NOPAT by 20  from current levels over the rest of the company s lifetime  While AutoZone won t grow NOPAT by this much in one year  the company has not failed to grow profits in any of the past 16 years  Long term investment in this company can be extremely profitable  If we give AutoZone credit for only 4  compounded annual NOPAT growth for the next seven years  the stock is worth  795 share today    another 15  upside  Add in the continued share repurchase program that was expanded in March and it s easy to see why AutoZone remains one of our top stocks

30012,251527,AZO,Company Notes Digest 5 29 15,opinion,"Each week I read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of my investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts  
The Macro Outlook 
In the first quarter  US companies benefitted from low expectations  but results were generally just so so
 while  results were admittedly far from robust  they did exceed our expectations Net worldwide sales declined 5  in the first quarter  which was better than the 10  decline we had expected     Jewelry 
 our view  the results were impressive in light of the weak conditions plaguing the global agricultural sector Net sales and revenues were down 18      Ag Equipment 
Still  many companies have a right to be proud of the results they posted in a difficult environment
 crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be about 23  lower than 2012 s record  John Deere expects to be solidly profitable in 2015 Such an achievement says a lot about the progress we ve made establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model      Ag Equipment 
There are signs that foreign currency fluctuations are having real impacts on demand
Weak tourist spending is equivalent to lost exports
 you can almost trace it back to when the euro started its precipitous decline  All of a sudden the tourism really dropped for us      Apparel Accessories 
Weak international bidding for US scrap metal has effects on used car prices
 We believe the cause of this lower ASP or average selling price is due primarily to lower scrap prices and softer international bidding  The lower scrap prices affect many of the lower end vehicles that we sell  The lower scrap price is caused by weakening global demand and a strong U S  dollar  The softer international bidding primarily affects the higher end units that we sell and is primarily caused by a stronger U S  dollar      Salvaged vehicle sales 
For now  many companies have mitigated the impacts of currency with financial hedges  but those hedges will roll off over the next couple of quarters
 we are exposed to transaction risk as our international businesses purchase goods and services in U S  dollars  While we partially hedge purchases through forward contracts  many of our favorable contracts will be expiring in the early part of the fiscal year  resulting in higher cost of goods      Apparel Accessories 
On the plus side  housing markets seem very healthy
High end home builder  Toll Brothers  is seeing pent up demand released around the country
 Pent up demand is releasing in many markets We are encouraged by the demand we re seeing released around different pockets of the country  And hopefully that continues and we will also contribute to margin expansion around the rest of the country in 2016     Homebuilder 
Homebuyers aren t focused on rates right now
 right now buyers don t talk about rates  it s not an issue  they have been sitting at this number for so long  so we don t see it as an issue right now for our business      Homebuilders 
They are also confident that they can resell existing homes
 We don t hear as much about the concern of selling the existing home as we heard few years ago  To Bob stats  the stronger the resale market becomes the higher price of the houses become  the more comfortable people are in moving up and that is evolving      Homebuilders 
Amazingly  energy linked economies aren t exhibiting notable weakness
 Texas which for Toll is primarily Dallas and Houston  continues to perform well      Homebuilder 
 we re tracking Alberta very closely  It s very heightened alert but what we re seeing is very little if any change in the core credit metrics that would say that any  in fact that has not driven any increase in the reserves for those areas on the consumer credit side      Bank 
Some US consumer segments still don t seem healthy though  especially for the middle and lower classes
Used car dealer America s Car Mart saw delinquencies tick higher last quarter
 our accounts over 30 days past due are at 5 8  compared to 4 4  at the end of last fiscal year which tells us we are going to have to really work hard to minimize the effect of these higher delinquencies as we roll into 2016     Used Car Dealer 
Trade down categories did better than trade up categories at Autozone
 our failure categories continued to do well  outpacing both maintenance and discretionary categories  This was a little unique considering we were hoping the lower gas prices at the pump  coupled with the spring season  would lead to accelerating growth      Auto Parts Retailer 
Tiffany s weakest category was entry level silver jewelry
 we continue to experience weakness in silver jewelry sales before  500      Jewelry 
International 
In the old days economic nationalism would have been accomplished through legislation  not currencies   That could always happen again 
 domestic payment schemes through regulation  nationalism  nationalistic chauvinism  I worry about that  because it s not just a domestic schemes  If every country said  you re going have to process everything on soil  everything on soil  Then  one of my biggest advantages is my global technology If I had to change that and make centers in every country  my cost of operation would change      Payment Processing 
Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  holds an annual meeting for employees  parents in China in order to keep them happy with their kids  career decisions
 over the last four years we have done something in China that I don t think has been done before and that is I go to China every year to hold annual meetings of parents and grandparents  You got to see it to believe it  You are laughing  but it is no joke      Coffee House 
Tax avoidance is one of the biggest barriers to electronic payment adoption in India
 And only idiots like me pay taxes there not paying taxes is a bloodsport in India  right  And that s going to be  that s one of the biggest reasons why acceptance in India is poor  acceptance is probably less than a million merchants  there is probably  10 million merchants and  1 million take cards and even they say the take cards  you show up with your card and the first thing will be told is  do you pay cash instead and it s just the whole way it works  right  That s going to take time to change      Payment Processing 
Financials 
Uhaul s management noted that prices are getting a little high for acquisition of self storage properties
 We ve been mentioning over the last couple of years or the last year really that prices on self storage project have been going up  So we have been a little bit more careful on acquisitions of existing storage     Moving Trucks Self Storage 
This is probably about as good as the credit cycle can get
 I think we re at the point where we re seeing kind of at the low end of the cycle of credit losses and I personally would not expect to see material significant downside going forward  on a positive downside      Bank 
Competition for auto loans may be abating
 in terms of the competitive outlook  anecdotally we think we re getting a little bit of relief there  but when you talk to the guys in the field there is still plenty of competition  if anything it s just been a slight marginal improvement and certainly things aren t getting any worse or any more aggressive      Used Car Dealer 
Visa s infrastructure isn t a barrier to entry  It s the analytics that sets them apart
 The things that we re doing   anyone can build the switch  I mean  if we think of what we do for living  in networks or switch  in this day and age  that s not the hardest thing to build  It gets harder if you actually want to have access to 2 5 billion consumers and 35 to 40 million merchants across the world  But that too can be built over a period of time It s the analytics  the fraud scoring  it s all the work that we do to make that transaction valuable because it runs across the network which everyone else has to catch up on      Payment Processor 
National processing schemes in Europe have handed responsibility to Visa and Mastercard because they can t keep up with required investment
 Domestic processing schemes have struggled to spend the money to keep pace with that  So  in the Netherlands some years back  two or three years back  they kind of basically said  you take it over because we can t keep pace with it       Payment Processor 
Consumer 
Costco  NASDAQ COST  said that it s easier to secure organic food inventory because the supply chain is expanding
 the challenges are still out there although they are becoming less formidable because we like everybody else   there is more organic supply and producers doing it  And we are pretty good at getting out there and working with suppliers  both here and around the world to commit more to it  whether it s raising eggs or ground beef processing or produce     Retail 
Social Media followers is now a reportable metric
 In the fourth quarter on a year over year basis Facebook  NASDAQ FB  followers increased 22   Instagram followers increased 99   Twitter  NYSE TWTR  followers increased 46  and Weibo followers increased 120   as consumers around the globe turn to Michael Kors for lifestyle and fashion inspiration      Apparel Accessories 
Visa and Mastercard have better data than anyone when it comes to helping digital advertisers
 We go to merchants and we say  we can do work for you  to help you understand what value you re getting from your digital advertising  And there are plenty of people that will tell you  what happens in terms of how many clicks you get but they re really very few if any who could tell you  whether it results in something actually turning into a sale  we can do that for you      Payment Processor 
Technology 
Michael Kors  watch business is  not healthy  in North America  but it s not clear whether that s due to Apple  NASDAQ AAPL 
 Our watch business is not healthy in North America  Outside of North America it is  And we did see shift in our business to jewelry  So whether that s something that s cyclical  whether that s something that s a trend  whether that s something that s driven around other entries into the category  we are not exactly 100  sure      Apparel Accessories 
It s still early days for large scale companies to run finance software in a pure cloud environment
 It s still relatively early in the days of selling finance large scale to large scale companies running in a pure cloud environment      Enterprise Software 
Healthcare 
Healthcare costs are much lower in foreign countries  which helps SG A spending
 By the way what helps those numbers also has increased foreign expansion  There is a   just on benefits  which is primarily healthcare medical  dental  and vision in a large extent  They are U S  versus other countries  In some countries there is 40 basis points to 60 basis points of delta just on that SG A item because healthcare cost in the U S  are so much higher than everywhere else      Retail 
Materials  Industrials  Energy 
A sign of a floor for gold prices  Tiffany saw strength in gold jewelry
 fashion jewelry was a strong performer in the quarter  The strength in fashion continued to be led by gold jewelry designs      Breakfast establishment 
The agriculture equipment industry is facing its deepest downturn in 25 years
 we re facing  as you know  the deepest downturn in North American large Ag equipment industry in 25 years     Ag Equipment 
If the weather is good this year  2016 will probably be another tough year for ag equipment suppliers
  if you talk to our Chief Economist  he would tell you we re really in kind of a year to year type of mode right now  And as frustrating as it may be for people to hear  it really is about what happens this summer with the current crop that s in the ground  If you re going to assume another year of better than average weather  where yields are above trend yield  then certainly it s going to be a challenging argument to make that 2016 would certainly improve really anywhere around the globe      Ag Equipment Supplier 
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom 
Take your time when making big decisions
 this is a big decision  and we at AutoZone  NYSE AZO  are pretty methodical in how we make decisions  This isn t about next year or year after  this is about the long term and so we want to make sure we get it right  So we re going to take enough time to get it right      Auto Parts Retailer 
The goal isn t necessarily to be the biggest
 I ve told you we don t aspire to be the number one market share the way that you would have to grow the market share additionally in North America would be very promotionally driven and we don t want to do that  And we re comfortable with that      Apparel Accessories 
The quarterback gets too much credit and takes too much of the blame
 I think the quarterback always gets too much credit and perhaps maybe too much blame  But there is such great talent inside the company      Coffee Shop 
There is a propensity to under estimate how much success a great company can achieve
 how many of you would have thought in 1992 when we went public we had 125 stores  we had one quarter of profitability  people could not pronounce the Italian words on the menu  People said what is the grande  what is a venti  what is that  How many people would have thought that from 1992 to today  we were to achieve this kind of recognition and respect in terms of the equity of the brand and the global nature of Starbucks footprint  And I suspect there is not probably many of you      Coffee Shop

30013,251528,AZO,10 Reasons Why Growth Stocks Can Be Appropriate For Retired Investors ,opinion,"Introduction
In recent weeks I received several questions and comments from readers regarding my views on the appropriateness of investing in growth stocks in retirement portfolios   Additionally  and on a related topic  I have also come across numerous discussions  sometimes quite heated  about whether it s best to invest for total return or growth of dividend income   Consequently  I thought it would be interesting to share my views and provide my perspectives on both the appropriateness of growth stocks  and or whether it s best to invest for total return or income growth 
Generally speaking  I do not believe there is a perfectly correct answer to whether growth stocks are appropriate in retirement portfolios or not   Instead  I believe that it depends on many factors that specifically relate to each individual investor s unique situation   More specifically  these include their financial resources  investing goals and objectives  and perhaps most importantly  their tolerance for risk   With this article I will offer 10 reasons or situations where I believe growth stock investing might be appropriate in retirement portfolios under certain circumstances 
In the same vein  I also do not believe there is a perfectly correct answer to whether it s best to invest for total return or income growth   However  here I will add that I do not believe that the two concepts  total return versus income  are mutually exclusive   Under the correct circumstances  prudent and rational investing practices can generate both simultaneously   I do not believe that you have to give up attractive total returns for income  and vice versa   But regardless  I see no reason to argue about it  and believe in affording each investor the freedom and right to follow his or her own personal and or suitable path 
Finally  I am a fervent believer that investors should be knowledgeable and aware of all the investment options at their disposal   In other words  I do not favor a myopic approach nor do I favor being overly zealous about one investing strategy over another   Instead  I believe all investing strategies should be fairly and knowledgeably evaluated so that they can be clearly understood   Once that is accomplished  then rational decisions can be made regarding whether or not a certain strategy is right for you 
10 Conditions or Circumstances When Growth Stocks Might Fit in Your Retirement Portfolios
Before I provide the 10 circumstances where I believe growth stocks might be appropriate in retirement accounts  I feel it s only fair to point out that I have long admired the power  performance and even protection that a great growth stock can offer investors   Consequently  much of what I m about to write is colored by my own biases and perspectives   In this regard  I am only sharing my own views and will let the reader draw their own conclusions   However  not all of what I m about to present is bias   Much of what I will be talking about is based on factual analysis  and as such  I would hope the reader takes that into consideration as they review the following 10 reasons 
 Performance Considerations Opportunity for Significantly Higher Total Returns
There is one undeniable fact about true growth stocks that is nevertheless hotly debated and argued about   In truth and fact  a pure unadulterated growth stock under the strictest definition is capable of dramatically outperforming most blue chip dividend paying stocks   And as I will soon demonstrate  the total return differences are not subtle  they are significant and profound   However  I contend it is also an undeniable fact that the risk differential between true growth stocks and blue chip dividend paying stocks is equally as significant and profound 
In order to illustrate my point  I offer the following performance histories on 3 high profile growth stocks compared to the average company represented by the S P 500 over the past 10 years or so   There are a couple of reasons why I specifically chose the timeframe covered   First of all  each of the example companies and the S P 500 were all fairly valued at the beginning of this time period   Therefore  their performances are all being calculated fairly 
Second  I chose this timeframe because a decade of time is adequate to illustrate a long term performance calculation   Finally  I chose this timeframe because it included the Great Recession  which I hope we would all agree was a very challenging time to be investing in equities 
The following performance calculations are based on a single  10 000 investment in each company at the beginning of the time period   None of these examples pay a dividend  but in spite of that fact  they each produced total returns that were orders of magnitude greater than the S P 500   As an aside  commonly held blue chip dividend growth stocks such as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Coca Cola  Procter   Gamble and General Mills  NYSE GIS  all produced total return performance results that were within the same scope as the S P 500 
I have also included the 12 year historical earnings price and correlated FAST Graph on each example   I have circled the earnings growth rates on each graph to illustrate how a growth company s historical earnings growth rate correlates and relates to the performance it generates for shareholders

As investors  we can never invest in the past  only the future   Therefore  I offer the following  Forecasting Calculators on each of the three examples above to illustrate their potential total return performance over the next couple of years based on consensus analyst estimates   For the reader s additional perspective  I also include the same Forecast Calculators for the blue chip Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  and one for the S P 500 





The bottom line based on reason number 1  is that investors in retirement should at least be aware of the differentials of potential returns that true growth stocks can offer   However  I would caution that due to their higher risk  growth stocks should be utilized judiciously and sparingly   But that is not to say that they should never be included in retirement portfolios 
2  Today s Growth Stock Can Become Tomorrow s Dividend Growth Stock
The second reason or situation when growth stocks might be appropriate in retirement accounts is that they often provide the opportunity to generate future income without being forced to sell off shares   This is a primary argument against growth stock investing that is often presented   Many investors further believe that you would eventually have to liquidate your non dividend paying growth stocks and convert them into income producing stocks when you reach retirement  In truth  this may actually not be necessary  Over time  and it can even be said eventually  the growth rate of a growth stock will slow down  and quite often the company can change from a growth stock to a dividend growth stock  There are a lot of technology stocks where this metamorphosis is occurring today 
Eventually  and as a general rule  the true growth stock will ultimately morph into  first a moderate grower  then typically into a moderate growth and income grower by instituting a dividend  and eventually into the slower growth and dividend income stock 
My point is that an original pure growth strategy started early in your life  could in fact  naturally evolve into an income producing portfolio when you reached the time where you needed to harvest income  retirement    The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  and associated performance results on Apple clearly illustrate this point 
Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL 
First of all  a careful analysis of the earnings and price correlated graph with dividends on Apple shows that its growth rate in recent years has begun to slow  see highlight at bottom of graph    Additionally  we see that Apple instituted a dividend in 2012 that has increased every year since it was initiated   In other words  this once pure unadulterated high growth stock has in recent times morphed into an above average growing dividend growth investment 

The associated performance report with the above graph tells a couple of interesting stories   First and foremost  we see a long term total return performance result that is nothing short of extraordinary   The comparison against the average company as measured by the S P 500 speaks for itself 
However  what might be more interesting is the fact that even though Apple has only been paying a dividend since 2012  this once pure growth stock has generated significantly more cumulative income than the S P 500 on a  10 000 investment since 2004   Apple shareholders earned  16 392 dollars of cumulative dividends versus only  2 547 in the index 

Looking to the future  we see the consensus estimates for future growth are significantly below what we saw in the historical graph above   However  Apple the dividend growth stock is currently fairly valued and consensus expects future earnings growth to exceed 17  per annum   Clearly  adding Apple to a retirement portfolio approximately a decade ago would have produced potentially life changing results  and better yet  the party is far from over   This blue chip AA  rated technology stalwart still possesses the opportunity to generate above average future returns with the added bonus of the opportunity for high future dividend growth 

3   You Already Have All the Current Income You Need
A third reason when it might be appropriate to include growth stocks into a retirement portfolio would be when the retiree s portfolio already generates all the income they need to support themselves and their families   With their future income needs secured  perhaps by a portfolio of blue chip dividend paying stalwarts  it might make sense to add a little growth to the portfolio 
Even though the relative risk may be a lot higher  adding a few growth stocks might be the ticket to fund some future unnecessary luxuries   Perhaps a boat or the sports car you dreamed about owning someday  or maybe traveling to exotic locations   Since your basic needs are already covered by your conservative investments  it might make sense to add a little risk and growth to your retirement portfolio 
4  Time and Inclination
The fourth reason when growth stocks might be appropriate to add to your retirement portfolio is when the investor has the time and inclination to apply the necessary work and effort that owning growth stocks requires   To a great extent  investing in blue chip dividend growth stocks such as Johnson   Johnson are analogous to the theme of the old Ronco commercial   You can  set them and forget them    High quality blue chip dividend paying stalwarts do not require as much scrutiny and due diligence as growth stocks do 
In contrast  high growth stocks are much more research  due diligence and continuous monitoring intensive   High growth is rare  and very difficult to achieve   Consequently  when investing in growth stocks I suggest you be prepared to put in the necessary work and effort to keep up with the company  its industry and the competition   In a free market  competitors won t let a high growth company keep the market to itself   If the investor is not willing to put in that effort  then growth stocks may not be appropriate in their retirement portfolios 
5   Growth Stocks Are Contemporary  Interesting  Exciting and Even Fun
Especially if you meet condition number 3 above  adding some growth stocks to your retirement portfolio can be stimulating and even fun   To paraphrase another popular commercial  growth stocks are not your grandfather s blue chip dividend paying stalwarts   Many of the best growth stocks operate in exciting industries that can be stimulating  interesting  exciting and  yes  even fun to evaluate 
However  the following earnings and price correlated graph on Gopro  Inc illustrates that fun and excitement can also be scary   The short performance history of this growth stock has been extremely strong   On the other hand  its price action has also been a titillating rollercoaster ride   Had you bought this stock on its IPO  you would have come close to doubling your money in approximately 3 months time  only to see the stock price fall to below your original cost basis before rising again to a profitable position   Growth stock investing is not for the timid or weak of heart

6   Growth Can Overcome Valuation Mistakes 
Although I would acknowledge that investing in high growth stocks is undoubtedly riskier than investing in blue chip dividend growth stocks  their rapid growth can effectively mitigate some of the risk   Thanks to the power of compounding  see reason number 8 below  the company that is growing its earnings very fast can bail investors out even if they overpay for the stock at purchase   Of course  this assumes that the company continues growing at above average rates   And more importantly  assumes that the investor stays the course  which admittedly is an aggressive assumption 
The following earnings and price correlated graph on Starbucks represents a case in point   Had you invested in the company at its peak P E ratio of 53 6 on June 30  2006 you would have obviously suffered significant losses over the next 3 full years   However  considering that this original irrational behavior took you into the throes of the Great Recession  and further considering that the company remained profitable you would have made money long term   Above average earnings growth bailed you out in spite of the fact that the current P E ratio of 34 7 is significantly below the P E ratio you paid at original purchase

7   Growth Stocks Are Often Misunderstood
My definition of a growth stock is straightforward and precise  First of all  a growth stock represents the common stock of a company whose business is consistently growing earnings and cash flow at a significantly above average rate  In other words  a growth stock is a company whose earnings are consistently increasing at a minimum rate of change of earnings growth of 15  or better  However  a hyper growth stock is one that I define as growing earnings at a rate of change of 25  or better  Admittedly  although both categories are rare  there are more 15  growers than there are companies growing earnings at 25  or higher  In between these broader gradations of growth are additional growth categories such as a high grower at 20   etc 
The reason I bring this up in reason number 6  is because my experience has taught me that modern finance often holds a very cavalier or vague definition of what a growth stock is   Consequently  those engaged in the growth stock versus dividend growth stock debate will often cite studies indicating that dividend stocks outperform growth stocks   However  when I have personally reviewed and analyzed many of those studies  I usually discovered that the researchers were taking great liberties with the definition of a growth stock 
Consequently  many investors hold a jaundiced view of growth stocks that in my opinion is not fairly applied   In the context of this article  I am only discussing the possibility of adding true growth stocks into retirement portfolios based on the definition of a growth stock provided above 
8   The Power of Compounding
Although my reason number 8 is closely aligned with my reason number 1  I offer it as an additional reason looked at from the perspective of time compression instead of total rate of return generation   Thanks to the power of compounding  investing in growth stocks can in effect compress time   In other words  instead of taking a decade or more to double your money in a blue chip dividend growth stock  you can double your money much quicker in a true growth stock 
To illustrate my point I will turn to the widely recognized Rule of 72   This rule states that you can calculate the number of years it takes to double your money at a given compound return by dividing it into the number 72   I have often utilized the following illustration to illustrate the point I am making about the power of compounding compressing time 
First I will make the assumption that the average person has a working lifespan of 36 years   In modern times this may be a conservative assumption  but as I will soon illustrate it facilitates the math   Next I will assume two different compound rates of return as they apply to the average dividend growth stock  and then to the pure growth stock   For the dividend growth stock I will assume a generous and above  average rate of return of 10  per annum   For the pure growth stock I will assume the appropriately higher rate of return of 20  per annum   The math then looks like this 
With the dividend growth stock  If I divide 10  into 72 I calculate that it will take 7 2 years to double my money  72 10    7 2 years  
With the pure growth stock  if I divide 20  into 72 I calculate it will take 3 6 years to double my money  72 20  3 6 years  
If I apply this math to my assumed average working life of 36 years I get the following results 
If my money doubles every 7 2 years at a 10  rate of return  I will get 5 doubles in 36 years  36 7 2 5  
If my money doubles every 3 6 years at a 20  rate of return  I will get 10 doubles in 36 years  36 3 6 10  
The net effect is that by doubling my average rate of return from 10  to 20  per annum I do not earn two times the money by earning twice the return   Instead  I get double the doubles   Looked at from the perspective of the first  1  dollar  invested the power of compounding  compressing time  becomes vividly clear   Doubling my first  1  dollar  5 times at the 10  return results in the following   1 doubles 5 times to  2   4   8   16  and finally to  32  However  at the 20  return I get 5 additional doubles over the same 36 year timeframe as follows   64   128   256   512   1024 
To put this into perspective  over my assumed 36 year working lifetime I earn 32 times more money by earning 20  than I would have if I earned 10   1024 32 32    Doubling the number of doubles over the same timeframe shows the incredible power of compounding the true growth stocks are capable of offering    
9   Earnings Growth Often Easier to Forecast
One of the advantages of investing in pure growth stocks compared to investing in large multinational blue chip dividend growth stocks is the typical simplicity of their businesses   The typical pure growth stock generally operates in a single industry based on a single idea  especially in the early phases of growth   In contrast  the typical large multinational dividend growth stock often is comprised of many divisions and or multiple brands adding complexity to the analysis 
Consequently  it is often easier to evaluate the growth potential of the simpler business model   Companies such as Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   although I consider the stock significantly overvalued   Priceline  AutoZone  NYSE AZO   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Twitter  NYSE TWTR  are just a few high profile examples that come to mind   I am not suggesting that it is necessarily easy to forecast growth on single business pure growth stocks  I am just suggesting that it may be easier than evaluating larger companies with more complex business structures 
10   Growth Stocks Can Add Diversification
Investing in companies whose businesses are based on new inventions and innovations can add growing industries that never existed before to your portfolio   Consequently  pure growth stocks can add a level of diversification to the retirement portfolio that is not available from more traditional dividend paying blue chips 
Moreover  pure growth stocks are often at the forefront of technologies capable of generating creative destruction or disruptions to established industries   Investing in those companies can provide a hedge of sorts against the businesses of established companies you may already own   What Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  threatens to do to the big box retailer is just one of many examples 
Summary and Conclusions
The purpose of this article was not to suggest that retired investors should absolutely include growth stocks in their retirement portfolios   The true purpose of this article was simply an attempt to open the reader s eyes to what true growth stock investing is really all about  and what it potentially offers 
But more importantly  this article was inspired by several questions and comments on the subject of adding growth stocks in retirement portfolios that I have been recently receiving   The following comment from my most recent article where I expressed my support and sang the laurels about dividend growth investing  is one example and presented in its entirety 
 Chuck  I retired at the end of March  so your articles are a great benefit to me  However  I receive a pension that more than covers the bills until I reach age 62 in four years  at which time the payment will be reduced by 20   I took an early retirement package with a bonus until age 62  
 Under my circumstances  I have been purchasing stocks where I believe there is great current value along with the potential for strong dividend growth  Meaning that there isn t a history of dividend growth per se  Examples would be AAPL and GILD  both growing earnings much faster than the S P 500 as a whole  with relatively short periods of paying dividends  I also have 2  of the portfolio in GOOGL  AAPL  GILD  and GOOGL all look to be good values per F A S T Graphs by the way  and thank you for that service   
Long story short  my wife and I will be supplementing our income with dividends in 4 years  Do you think that growth stocks are appropriate for someone in our situation  Add DIS  SBUX  V  and MA to the above and it totals approximately 20  of the total portfolio 
Thanks for all your work  Keith 
Here s an excerpt from a response I made to another comment on the same article that the above reader accepted as a response to his question 
 For example  I have advised retired investors in the past that needed to get the maximum return possible at reasonable levels of risk  In these cases  I have included select high quality growth stocks such as V  MA  GILD  GOOG  AAPL  CTSH and others  On the other hand  for those retired investors that have accumulated adequate assets that could support their lifestyle based on the dividends generated  I believe that a more conservative blue chip dividend growth stock approach is warranted  
Therefore  in conclusion  I believe that adding growth stocks to retirement portfolios can be appropriate under certain circumstances   With this article I offered a few reasons and situations where that might be the case   On the other hand  based on the generally lower risk profile of high quality blue chip dividend growth stocks  I would not assert that they belong in every retired investor s portfolio   At the end of the day  each individual investor  retired or not  should build portfolios that meet their own unique goals  objectives and risk tolerances   With investing there is no one size fits all   However  awareness of the true nature of all the options available is something that I do support

30048,251563,AZO,Ford  Hitting On All Cylinders,opinion,"Ford s  F       16 share  stock has been stuck in a bit of a rut for the past few years  We believe the stock is poised to go much higher on the strength of industry leading innovation that will continue to drive improving core profitability and growth 
A Strong Rebound In Cash Flows From 2008
Ford s profits  NOPAT  were  7 3 billion in 2013  up 19  from 2012 s  6 2 billion  In addition  Ford s NOPAT has grown over 55  compounded annually since the company s struggles in 2008  This profit growth is proof of the company s strong and sustained rebound from the U S  auto industry s low point during the financial crisis  This growth also comes from the rise in Ford s NOPAT margins to 5   a number that bests rival General Motor s  GM  margins  under 4    Ford s return on invested capital  ROIC  is also a respectable 9   far above its ceiling of 4  during 2001 2009  and topping GM s 8  
In addition to earning positive economic earnings for the past four years  the company s first since 1999  Ford also generated free cash flow of  5 6 billion in 2013 
Booming Sales Worldwide
Ford s top line growth has outperformed the industry every year except 2012 since 2009  U S  sales were up 14  in 2013  4  in 2012  11  in 2011  and 19  in 2010 
GM s sales only rose 11  in 2013  Dodge brand sales also rose 14   and Chrysler brand sales fell 2   Figure 1 shows how Ford is taking market share from competitors  especially within the last year 
Figure 1  Ford Market Share Grows in Key Markets
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
If you think Ford s sales in 2014 are lagging  we recommend a closer look 
First  don t get caught up in the March numbers   on first quarter sales cannot be ignored   March sales turned noticeably higher mid month   said John Felice  Ford vice president of U S  marketing 
Investors shouldn t lose sleep over the company s April sales numbers either  A significant part of the drag on Ford s sales in the U S  is coming from a deliberate reduction in selling cars   a low margin business  as Ford looks to improve its profitability  Ford s April U S  sales dropped 0 7  compared to last year because daily rental fleet sales were reduced by 24   The rentals sales reduction mostly affected Ford s light cars like the Ford Focus  which was down 16  overall  but down only 4  in retail sales  in line with the 2  decline in car sales nationwide   In another instance  Ford Fusion total sales were down just over 1   but retail sales were up 2  
In the end  poor weather and the reduction in rental fleet sales have little affect on the company s competitive position 
Not even an aging model lineup is slowing Ford as its cars still rank among the best  This year s March sales were the company s best in 8 years  and in April  Ford had 5 of the 20 best selling car models in the U S    more than any other manufacturer 
Globally  Ford s 1Q14 sales rose 6  on the back of strong growth in Europe and China 
Much of the company s future growth will come from China where Ford posted 45  year over year sales growth in the first quarter  Ford was late to the party in China relative to General Motors  but the recent strong growth shows that Chinese consumers are highly receptive to the Blue Oval s products  Ford has already begun to build plants in the country to increase its capacity in Asia  India is an important future market as well  and Ford posted 83  sales growth there in April 
In Europe  where Ford has been losing money for many years  the company is also making notable progress despite recent regional instability  The continent s 11  sales growth in the first quarter drove a loss of  194 million  compared to the  462 million loss from 1Q13  Ford says that it expects to turn a profit in Europe by next year 
In the big picture  Ford is the only automaker with three of the top 10 best selling vehicles worldwide  The Focus  No  1   the Fiesta  No  5   and the F series trucks  No  4   If Ford can continue to gain traction in Europe and execute in China and India  the company s already formidable moat will widen 
Unusual Charges Cloud Strong Core Profitability
Two separate one time charges dragged down Ford s most recent quarterly earnings  The company added  400 million to its pile of warranty reserves in anticipation of parts deterioration from the cold weather this past winter  a boon for firms like AutoZone  AZO   and from the soon to be replaced SYNC system  In addition  Ford  like many companies  is still suffering from currency exchange losses in Venezuela  with  186 million lost in 2013 and  400 million lost this quarter 
Excluding these unusual charges  Ford s 1Q14 operating results are an improvement year over year 
Cheap Valuation and New Models Provide Significant Long Term Upside
The company s market leading growth in 2013 did not stop its shares from lagging the competition  While F rose 18  in 2013  shares of Toyota climbed 28   and GM shares were up 40   Ford s stock deserves some catch up 
The company became a leader in automotive innovation with its last model launches  and we expect that trend to continue  Accordingly  we expect the company to continue to take market share and enjoy rising margins and ROIC  which  in turn  will extend the company s excellent history of profit  NOPAT  growth 
Herein lies the opportunity for investors  Ford s current stock price of   16 share gives it a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio means that the market expects Ford s profits to permanently decline by 10   For comparison  GM  at   35 share  is trading at a PEBV ratio of 1 2 
A permanent 10  drop in profits doesn t seem likely  If Ford were to increase NOPAT by just 5  compounded annually for just the next three years  the stock would be worth over  20 share 
We expect Ford s 2014 model launches to further bolster the stock s upside potential  These new cars are innovative and technologically advanced  there are turbocharged EcoBoost engines in many models  and the aluminum bodied F series truck is an industry first and a revolutionary product  The upcoming F 150 weighs 700 pounds less than the current generation 
As long as Ford s strong profit growth and market share gains continue  this stock has a lot of upside 
Buyback Makes For a Good Entry Point
Last week  Ford announced a stock buyback program of about  1 8 billion  This action signals a strong entry point for investors and is a sign that management believes in the future of the company and thinks shares are currently undervalued  Additionally  it should put a floor under the stock in the near future until the new car launches in the second half of the year provide the catalyst for significant upside

The Markets
Stocks ended higher on Friday with the S P 500 Index closing above the physiologically important 1900 level   a level that the market has been bumping up against for the past couple of months  At the time of writing  gains appear to be following through to the new week with S P 500 futures up nearly one third of a percent  Gains over the past week have coincided nicely with the positive tendencies surrounding the Memorial Day long weekend  The TSX Composite advanced 1 38  since last Monday  far surpassing the average gain over the past 24 years of 0 45  during the quiet holiday period  Stocks in Canada have been positive 71  of the time leading up to the US holiday as equity prices drift higher amidst lower volumes  The probability for gains returns to more normal levels as traders return to their desk following the Memorial Monday holiday with the tendency for gains during the week ahead ranging anywhere from 50  to 58   depending on whether you re looking at US or Canadian benchmarks  The week ahead starts with a number of economic events with everything from house prices to consumer confidence providing further indications of the health of the economy  Recent reports have been beating expectations  providing the strength to power equity benchmarks  such as the S P 500 Index  to new all time highs  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index  a gauge of the degree to which economic reports have been missing or beating expectations  has been pointing higher over the past few weeks  presenting a tailwind for equity prices  The Economic Surprise Index had been pointing lower since the year began  leading many analysts to revise estimates lower to reflect the more subdued activity that remained prevalent through the winter months 

The stronger economic data has also fuelled a breakout in the US Dollar Index  which is showing signs of moving above a descending triangle pattern  Typically a bearish pattern  support around 79 appears to be a significant hurdle preventing a downside move  The currency benchmark is presently bumping up against a downward pointing 200 day moving average  a level that has constrained price activity since last September  Seasonal tendencies for the US Dollar Index are negative between now and the end of October 


The direction of the US dollar plays a significant role in the strength of commodity prices valued in the American currency    The CRB commodity Index  has recently started to underperform the equity market as the strong start to the year for commodities shows signs of unwinding  assets may be rotating bank into equity markets  Mid April through to late June is the weakest time of year for the broad commodity market as positive tendencies surrounding industrial demand come to an end  One of the commodities that is particularly weak at this time of year is Silver  which declines close to 7   on average  between mid April and the end of June  June is seasonally the weakest month of the year for the white metal  declining 65  of the time for an average loss of 3 1  The metal has been hovering around support at  19  A stronger US Dollar may be the catalyst to crack the significant level of support  Weakness over the next month or so allows for appealing buying opportunities for the period of seasonal strength for both Gold and Silver  which runs from the end of June through to October

30050,251565,AZO,Q3 Earnings Season In Review  Impressive Growth,opinion,"On Monday  the third quarter earnings season will officially close out  with H R Block  NYSE HRB  as the final S P 500 company to report  The season is ending with impressive earnings growth of 11 7   paired with revenue growth of 4 8   proving that companies are still closely managing costs and using share buybacks to get a pop on the bottom line 
Better than expected quarterly results were well received by investors  with the S P 500 index climbing 5 0  from the time third quarter earnings season began on October 8 to Tuesday s close 

Standout sectors for profit growth include energy  health care and consumer discretionary  Energy results for the third quarter depict a tale of two growth rates  with the sector exhibiting the highest earnings growth rate of all 10 sectors at 14 5   and the lowest sales growth rate of 1 1   This of course is due to the severe drop in oil prices during the quarter  with Brent crude falling 15  from July to October  Such a decline certainly ate into the margins of oil  gas and consumable fuels companies  that industry seeing year over year  YoY  revenue growth that was nearly flat at 0 4  
At the company level    NYSE XOM  typically has the most noticeable impact because it is the second biggest company in the S P 500 by market capitalization after Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Exxon saw profits increase 6  YoY  with revenues falling 4   The fourth quarter is only expected to get worse for oil and gas companies  with both top and bottom line estimates in the red for the industry at  8 3  and  2 4   respectively  The Energy sector as a whole is currently expected to post earnings growth of 1 3  and a revenue decline of 6 7  for the fourth quarter 

Health Care was a winner again this quarter  with profit growth of 13 9   the second highest of all 10 sectors  and the highest revenue growth rate of 12 2   For the second quarter in a row  the sector was driven by the Biotechnology industry  with earnings growth of 45  and revenue growth of 39   Notable company performances includes Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   Biogen Idec  NASDAQ BIIB  and Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN   all posting third quarter profit growth above the 50  mark 
 in particular grew a whopping 254  on the bottom line  and 117  on the top line  Results were bolstered by continued progress of the company s Hep C drug  Slovaldi  which saw sales of  2 8B  In October  the company introduced Harvoni   a single tablet regimen for the treatment of Hepatitis C  expected to follow in the footsteps of Slovaldi s success  Contributors on the Estimize platform anticipate the company will post earnings per share of  2 33 in the fourth quarter in comparison to Wall Street s estimate of  2 21  If the company does come in with  2 33 a share  it would represent YoY growth of 348   while the current revenue consensus of  6 85B would indicate growth of 120   Strong Q4 expectations have the overall health care earnings and revenue growth rates currently seated at 54  and 36   respectively   

Third quarter results for the consumer discretionary sector continued to point to signs of a healthy U S  consumer  Earnings growth settled at 13 6  with only PVH Corp  NYSE PVH  and Dollar General  NYSE DG  left to report from that sector   Strength once again stemmed from the retailers  specifically the internet retailers which were up 25  YoY  with specialty retail and textiles  apparel and luxury goods not far behind  both at 11   Big wins from the likes of   NYSE KORS   L Brands Inc  NYSE LB   Best Buy  NYSE BBY  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  were contrasted by steep losses from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Coach  NYSE COH   Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  
This past weekend  with Black Friday kicking off the holiday shopping season  we got a sneak peek at what s ahead for retailers in the fourth quarter  While the headline number from the National Retail Federation showed an 11  drop in sales  the sense is that the decline is due to a combination of the move towards online shopping and an extended discount period which will distribute sales throughout the month  rather than just having them concentrated on Black Friday weekend  For the fourth quarter  the consumer discretionary sector is expected to show a 13  increase in profits   with internet retailers up 16 8   multi line up 9 8   specialty up 11 8  and textiles  apparel and luxury goods up 12 1  

 
On the flipside  the defensive sectors fared poorly this quarter  with telecommunication services showing low growth of 1 4  and utilities at 2 6    Of the five companies within the telecom sector  only Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  showed YoY profit growth of 15 6   Within utilities  the gas utilities industry was the main culprit of lower earnings  declining 8 3  from the prior year  and revenues falling even further at  12 7   In the fourth quarter telecom is expected to show bottom line growth of 6 0  and top line growth of 3 9   while utilities is estimated to come in with growth of 2 3  and 4 4   respectively 

One interesting stat touted this season was the record high beat rate against the Wall Street consensus  In fact  74  of S P 500 companies were able to surpass their Wall Street estimate  with a lower amount  60   beating on the top line  Is this a sign that U S  companies are doing a lot better than anyone anticipated  Or is this just another example of the  earnings game  in which companies purposely low ball their guidance knowing that it will ultimately be included in sell side estimates 
Estimize findings suggest the latter  and reinforce the fact that this practice of issuing conservative guidance in order to beat and get a pop in the stock price is alive and well  Only 56  of S P 500 companies beat the Estimize consensus  with 53  beating on revenues 

The main concerns from S P 500 companies this quarter were around weakness in Europe and the strengthening dollar  Approximately 20  of reporting companies mentioned either or both as an area they were watching 
With respect to Europe  large multinational companies such as Coca Cola  NYSE KO   General Electric  NYSE GE  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  all admitted that a weaker economy in Europe was having a negative impact  The stronger dollar seemed like a more widespread concern  however  with many companies calculating the impact continued strength would have on fourth quarter sales and profits 
For example  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  expects a Q4 negative impact of  0 05    0 06 and Nike  NYSE NKE  says their revenue growth outlook is one or two points lower on account of the stronger dollar  While that hasn t seemed to subside  the hope is that recent central bank actions in Europe will help that region recover  which would be a welcomed change as nearly 10  of all S P 500 sales come from Europe 
Just as quickly as the third quarter ends  a new quarter begins  AutoZone  NYSE AZO  will be the first S P 500 company to report for the fourth quarter  next Tuesday  December 9  Of course  the unofficial start to the season doesn t come until Alcoa  NYSE AA  reports on January 12  The Estimize consensus is currently calling for Q4 earnings growth of 8 6  and revenue growth of 3 5  with energy being the only sector expecting negative numbers for each  Strength is expected to come from some of the usual suspects  health care at 18 5  and consumer discretionary at 13  ",2014-12-04,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/q3-earnings-season-in-review:-impressive-growth-234608,234608
30085,251600,AZO,Expect Leisure To Lead Growth In Q4  2015,opinion,"The third quarter earnings season for companies in the S P 500 officially comes to an end Monday  with H R Block  NYSE HRB  reporting after the closing bell  Both Estimize and Wall Street are expecting earnings per share  EPS  to come in at   0 42  with revenues of  145M  On Tuesday  AutoZone  NYSE AZO  will be the first company from the S P 500 to report for the fourth quarter  Estimize contributors are expecting the automotive retailer to post EPS of  7 22 vs  the Street s consensus of  7 18  with revenue estimates of  2 2B 
Last week  after the U S  Nonfarm Payrolls number came in at the highest level since 2012  both the Dow Jones Industrial and S P 500 closed at record highs of 17 959 and 2 075  The 2015 EPS Estimize expectation for S P companies is  128 42  with the current P E ratio at 18 0 and not expected to change much  that puts our 2015 target price at 2312  We think retail will lead momentum in the fourth quarter and throughout next year  with multiples for the hotels  restaurants   leisure segment continuing to increase  That industry is expected to grow 15 5  in the fourth quarter  driven in particular by higher employment  growing consumer confidence  lower gasoline prices and subdued inflation 
Some of the leisure segments we expect to do well are casual dining and travel  Restaurants such as Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG   Buffalo Wild Wings  NASDAQ BWLD  and The Cheesecake Factory  NASDAQ CAKE  are anticipating impressive YoY profit growth  The fourth quarter Estimize consensus for Chipotle currently stands at  3 82   0 08 above the Wall Street consensus and implying growth 150  over the year ago quarter  Revenues estimates of  1 08B suggest a YoY increase of 28   Buffalo Wild Wings is also showing a large delta between the Estimize   1 15  and Wall Street consensus   1 06   with earnings growth expected to reach 4 5  in the fourth quarter after six consecutive quarters of double digit increases 

Travel is also estimated to pick up in 2015  The 2015 Global Travel Price Outlook put out by the Global Business Travel Association predicts spending on global travel will increase 8 6  in 2015  on top of an expected uptick of 6 9  in 2014  as economic conditions improve around the world  Carnival Cruises has already benefitted from an upswing in cruise popularity  with all regions of operation reporting stronger demand and higher onboard spending last quarter  particularly in China and Europe  As such  the company raised full year 2014 guidance  now expecting non GAAP EPS in the range of  1 84    1 88  versus previous guidance of  1 60    1 75  The Estimize EPS consensus for the fourth quarter currently stands at  0 19  suggesting a YoY increase of 395   An early look at 2015 shows cumulative advance bookings for the first half of the year are ahead of the prior year and at higher prices 

Another big winner in 2015 will be online travel sites such as Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN  and TripAdvisor  especially as a larger percentage of travel bookings are expected to be made via mobile devices  Priceline is looking for EPS of   10 48 in Q4  versus the much lower Street expectation  10 01  Both of these are well above company issued guidance of  9 75  but Priceline has a history of lowballing guidance and has done so by an average of 10 6  over the last six quarters  The company is expected to benefit more than ever after their OpenTable acquisition this past summer  with online dining reservations increasing in popularity  TripAdvisor is also exhibiting a large Estimize vs  Wall Street delta  with fourth quarter EPS estimates of  0 42 and  0 37  respectively  Earnings per share of  0 42 for the quarter would represent profit growth of 100  YoY ",2014-12-08,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/expect-leisure-to-lead-growth-in-q4,-2015-235033",235033
30086,251601,AZO,5 Stocks To Watch This Week  AZO  KKD  LULU  COST  CIEN,opinion,"Tuesday   AutoZone
Auto parts retailer AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  is set to report Tuesday before the opening bell  Last quarter AutoZone reported an 8  gain in year over year  yoy  earnings per share and a minor drop in total revenue 

Earnings at AutoZone have been growing by a YoY average of 16  each quarter over the past 2 years  In the second quarter of this year that rate of expanson dropped to 8   it s lowest reported value in 24 months 
After a brief tumble leading into last quarter s earnings release date AutoZone stock has picked up steam  climbing 17  since the last report  AutoZone has a history of reporting within a relatively tight range compared to estimates and Tuesday analysts on  are executing AutoZone to get back to it s winning ways by reporting 15  EPS growth 
Tuesday   Krispy Kreme Doughnuts
The huge trend supporting organic and healthy food options at the expensive of fast food joints continued rolling on Monday  McDonald s reported an awful sales figure  disclosing that same store sales sank 4 6  in November  Although secular forces appear to be lined against of Krispy Kreme  NYSE KKD   sales at the glazed doughnut company have been holding up just fine in recent months 
Last quarter Krispy Kreme saw its revenue climb 7   However  results on the bottom line did not shimmer the same way that sales did  Krispy Kreme s EPS dropped by 7  last period  In last quarter s press release CEO Tony Thompson commented that the top line revenue growth was spurred by promotions and increased spending on marketing  Domestic same store sales were up 2 8  and the overall store count rose 3 4  last quarter 
Tuesday analysts on Estimize are looking for Krispy Kreme to improve its margin blues and report a15  EPS increase alongside a 6  hike in total sales 
Wednesday   Lululemon

 Graph above from ChartIQ Visual Earnings 
Since early June 2013 shares of Lululemon  NASDAQ LULU  have been trending lower  Revenue growth has fallen between a moderate range landing between 7  and 37  each quarter within the past 2 years  This quarter Estimize contributors are looking for  427 million in revenue  or slightly more than a 12  yoy gain  That would be just under last quarter s 13  sales boost 
On the bottom line the picture is less pretty  and this is likely one of the factors driving the stock price down  Despite erratic revenue growth  profit gains grinding to a halt as more competitors enter the yoga wear market  Another factor plaguing profitability is that same store sales dropped 5  last period  Operating more stores with fewer sales invariably leads to lower earnings  
Wednesday   Costco
Costco  NASDAQ COST   the second largest retailer in the United States behind only Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  reports 3rd quarter earnings on Wednesday  Costco has been steadily growing on the top and bottom line and the giant s fundamentals jolted higher last quarter with growth coming in well above its average levels 

Costco announces its sales figures monthly on its website  Throughout October and November the wholesaler announced comparable sales growth between 4  and 5   If it weren t for the negative impact of the strong US dollar on international sales and deflating gasoline prices that growth would have come in between 6  and 7   Analysts on Estimize are forecasting CostCo to power through limiting conditions and report a quarter slightly ahead of Wall Street s forecast 
Wednesday   Ciena 
Telecommunications networking equipment company CIENA  NYSE CIEN  is also set for a Wednesday report  Ciena has now strung together 3 consecutive quarters of earnings beats and the Estimize community is looking for a fourth one midweek 

Although Ciena has beaten the Estimize community s 3 times in a row  the stock has still fallen since the start of the year  Year to date shares of Ciena are down 28   In early September Ciena beat earnings expectations for its summer quarter but cut its outlook for the current period  In its revised forecast Ciena warned that Wednesday s report will contain sales between  570 million and  610 million  significantly behind expectations which were in the  630 million range 
Estimize contributors are projecting that Ciena will beat Wall Street s earnings expectations by 2 cents per share and report sales of  594 million  slightly north of management s guidance midpoint ",2014-12-09,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week:-azo,-kkd,-lulu,-cost,-cien-235210",235210

The company tied better than expected results not only to business improvements such as inventory availability  but also to lower gas prices and favorable weather during the quarter  Autozone s report bodes well for retailers  especially those in the automotive space 
Costco   NASDAQ COST  also put up respectable results when they reported yesterday morning  EPS came in at  1 12   0 02 higher than Estimize and  0 03 higher than Wall Street expectations  growing 17   Revenues of  26 87B were a little lighter than the  26 98B that the Estimize community was looking for  but still above Wall Street s  26 83B estimate  An increase in membership fee revenue  which rose to  582M from  549M year over year  helped to offset merchandise costs that rose by nearly 7   Same store sales excluding negative impacts from gasoline price deflation and foreign exchange came in at 7  overall  with both the U S  and international posting 7   Costco should continue to do well in 2015 if it can keep growing membership fees at this pace  although there is no doubt they will receive considerable pressure from competitors such as Target  NYSE TGT  and Sam s Club  a division of Wal Mart  NYSE WMT

30101,251616,AZO,Handicapping The Q4 Earnings Season,opinion,"The following is an excerpt from this week s Earnings Trends Report  to see the full article   
Handicapping the Q4 Earnings Season The December quarter hasn t ended yet  but the Q4 earnings season has gotten underway already  The reason for that is that we count companies with fiscal quarters ending in November as part of our Q4 tally  Using this definition  the AutoZone  NYSE AZO  release on December 9th was the first Q4 earnings report  with the tally thus far at 9 S P 500 members  By the end of this week  we will have seen Q4 results from 15 S P 500 members  That said  the reporting cycle wouldn t get heated up till around the middle of next month  Estimates for Q4 have come down as the quarter has unfolded  with current expectations of  2 2  total earnings growth in the quarter down from  9 6  growth expected in late September  The chart below shows how estimates for the quarter have evolved over the past two and a half months 

Estimates for 14 out of 16 sectors have declined  though revisions for the Energy  Autos  Basic Materials  Industrial Products  and Finance are the most pronounced  The chart below shows the sectors with the major negative estimate revisions 

The revisions trend has been broadly negative across all sectors  with the magnitude of revisions for Q4 the highest we have seen in more than a year  This isn t reflective of a fresh deterioration in the earnings picture  the ongoing global growth worries notwithstanding  Energy has been the biggest drag on Q4 estimates  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimates for Exxon  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips  COP  for the December quarter have fallen by  21 6    29 9  and  44 8  since the quarter started   no doubt the overall Q4 growth rate for the sector has flipped from a positive growth rate of  7  to a decline of  17 6  at present  The sector s growth picture isn t expected to improve anytime soon either  as the chart below of total energy sector quarterly earnings shows 

The outlook for activity levels has been looking up on the home front  with business and consumer confidence expected to push economic growth into above trend levels going forward  But the picture is a lot less reassuring beyond the U S  borders  with recent data from Europe as well as China showing renewed loss of momentum in those regions Looking Ahead to Q4 Earnings Companies with fiscal quarters ending in November have been coming out with quarterly results in recent days  these results will form part of our 2014 Q4 tally  As of this morning  we have such Q4 results from 9 S P 500 members  with the tally reaching 15 by the end of the week  The December quarter earnings season wouldn t be in the spotlight at least through mid January  But by then we will have results from more than two dozen S P 500 members  including a number of industry leaders like FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX   Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL   and Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  already on the books  The table below provides a summary of the companies that have reported results already 

As discussed earlier  estimates for Q4 fell as the quarter unfolded  a trend that has been in place for quite some time  Total earnings in Q4 are expected to be up  2 2  on 0 1  higher revenues and modestly higher margins  The table below provides a summary comparison of what is expected in Q4 with what was actually achieved in Q3 

As you can see  Energy has the lowest and Medical has the highest growth rates of all 16 sectors  The Energy sector did reasonably well last quarter  but expectations for the sector s earnings power have come down substantively in recent days as a result of the oil price drop

30137,251652,AZO,Chart Review  Autozone On The Edge Of A Breakout,opinion,Autozone  AZO  was a banner stock coming out of the 2001 recession  In 2001 alone  AZO logged a 152  gain  Over the next six years  AZO gained another 67   During the financial panic in 2008  AZO plunged but did not even come close to erasing all those hard fought gains  In 2009  the stock barely paused for the historic March  2009 lows  From 2009 to 2011  AZO logged another 133  in gains  In early 2012  this rally stalled out  and the stock steadily dripped lower  While the S P 500 recovered from the May  2012 swoon by the end of that summer  AZO has yet to complete a recovery  That completion may finally be at hand  On Friday  AZO rallied for the second straight day on strong buying volume to close just below the downtrend from its all time high  The stock is now firmly trading above its 50 and 200 day moving averages  DMAs  The charts below show the short term and long term stories I only wish I could say I have been a long time shareholder in AZO  Instead  over the past several months I have adopted a strategy of defying the downtrend by buying call options on dips and selling rips  Last week s rip came in sympathy with standout earnings from competitor O Reilly Automotive Inc   ORLY   ORLY has had a strong secular record similar to AZO s  Clearly  there is money to be made in auto parts If AZO pulls back from this resistance  I would NOT be interested in shorting it  Trying to short stocks like AZO on such strong  long term secular trends is almost like playing Russian Roulette  Instead  I think it makes much more sense to look for the next buying opportunity  A breakout  and follow through  from here would be a definite buy signal  A stop can be placed somewhere below the 200 or 50 DMA Be careful out there Disclosure  no positions,2013-02-11,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-review:-autozone-on-the-edge-of-a-breakout-154715,154715

30218,251733,AZO,Is AutoZone A Little Out Of The Zone  ,opinion,A good growth company is always a nice addition to a portfolio  but you have to watch to make sure you are not paying too much  The old saying is    You make your money on the buy side    Looking at AutoZone  AZO  at a glance  we see that it normally trades  Normal Historical PE   the blue line  at or below its historical operating earnings growth rate  the orange line   However  you can see that it has recently begun to trade modestly above its Normal Historical PE  Therefore  it appears that AutoZone may be trading at a slight premium to its historical valuation Growth stocks are defined as companies with high rates of change of earnings growth of 15  to 20  or better  Growth stocks offer the potential for share prices to rise in lockstep with their profit growth in the long run  Therefore  the PEG ratio formula  price equals growth rate  tends to be the most appropriate formula used to value growth stocks  However  due to the exponential nature of compounding large numbers  PEG ratio forecasts are capped at 40  Because of the higher valuation typically awarded to fast growth  growth stocks offer the potential for greater capital appreciation  On the other hand  they also offer higher risk  First of all  they tend to command much higher than average PE ratios  and second  achieving very high levels of growth is very difficult to sustain  Consequently  forecasting future earnings growth is more important with high growth stocks than any other class of stock  Also  the average growth stock typically ploughs all of its profits back into the company to fund its future growth  instead of paying dividends AutoZone Inc   Large cap Growth at an Attractive Price AutoZone is the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States  Each store carries an extensive product line for cars  sport utility vehicles  vans and light trucks  including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories  and non automotive products  Many stores also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local  regional and national repair garages  dealers  service stations  and public sector accounts  AutoZone also sells the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software through   Additionally  we sell automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories  non automotive products and subscriptions to the ALLDATAdiy product through   and our commercial customers can make purchases through   AutoZone does not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation  Earnings Determine Market Price   The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  AutoZone Inc   Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 1998 Performance Table AutoZone IncThe Two Keys to Long Term PerformanceYears of research and experience have taught us that there are two critically important keys to achieving above average  long term shareholder returns at reasonably controlled levels of risk  The first key is earnings growth  or what we like to call the rate of change of earnings growth  The faster a company can grow its business  i e  earnings   the larger the income stream it can produce with which to reward shareholders  This is because of the power of compounding  which Albert Einstein was alleged to have called  the most powerful force on earth   Ultimately  both capital appreciation and dividend income will be a function of a company s ability to grow its profits The second key is valuation  When a company can be purchased at its intrinsic value based on earnings and cash flow generation  the shareholders  rate of return or long term capital appreciation will inevitably correlate to and or equal its earnings growth rate  Overvaluation will lower that rate of return and conversely  undervaluation will increase it  Consequently  paying strict attention to the valuation you pay to buy a stock is a critical component of both greater return and taking lower risk to achieve it  Because  ironically  when you overpay for even the best business  you simultaneously lower your return potential while increasing your risk of achieving the lower return The associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two keys to long term performance  Notice the impact that valuation  black line above or below orange earnings justified valuation line  had on the following performance results  The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for AutoZone Inc is 1 72 which is historically high  Looking to the Future Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants  1             The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings 2             The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings Forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  AutoZone Inc is clearly an industry leading superior business  which based on the consensus estimates from leading analysts  appears to be capable of growing earnings at an above average rate for the foreseeable future  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  AutoZone Inc represents an opportunity for growth at a reasonable price  The important factor is that AutoZone Inc  with its strong balance sheet and potential for future earnings growth  has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for outsized future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 23 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast AutoZone Inc s long term earnings growth at 15   AutoZone Inc has high long term debt at 159  of capital  AutoZone Inc is currently trading at a P E of 16 9  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  AutoZone Inc s True Worth  valuation would be  709 59 at the end of 2017  which would be a 12 5  annual rate of return from the current price Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows   All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stake holders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any perspective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in AutoZone Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that AutoZone Inc s expected earnings would be 7 6 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary   ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although  with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conducts their own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not AutoZone is a stock with a solid record of above average earnings growth  At its current valuation it still offers above average long term rate of return  although its valuation is a little high historically  Therefore  the prudent investor looking for above average growth might want to include AutoZone on its watch list  We believe it s a good buy at current levels  but it would be an even better buy if the price were to fall even modestly

30219,251734,AZO,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   Consumer Discretionary Sector,opinion,The Consumer Discretionary sector ranks seventh out of the ten sectors as detailed in my sector roadmap  It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 18 ETFs and 21 mutual funds in the Consumer Discretionary sector as of July 12  2012  Figure 1 ranks from best to worst the nine Consumer Discretionary ETFs that meet our liquidity standards and Figure 2 shows the five best and worst rated Consumer Discretionary mutual funds  Not all Consumer Discretionary sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 25 to 373   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Consumer Discretionary sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors should not buy any Consumer Discretionary ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this sector  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  where available    Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 4 ETFs are excluded from Figure 1 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards  Figure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  Best mutual funds exclude

and Rydex Series Funds  Retailing Fund  RYRTX  is my worst rated Consumer Discretionary mutual fund  Both earn my Dangerous rating Figure 3 shows that 124 out of the 473 stocks  38  of the total net assets  held by Consumer Discretionary ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  no Consumer Discretionary ETFs or Mutual Funds get an Attractive or better rating The takeaway  Consumer Discretionary sector mutual fund managers and ETFs are picking the wrong stocks in this sector  Their fees are undeserved  no matter how low Figure 3  Consumer Discretionary Sector Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management    Investors need to tread carefully when considering Consumer Discretionary ETFs and mutual funds  because all of them are rated either Neutral or Dangerous  I recommend investors focus instead on the 124 individual stocks that are rated Very Attractive or Attractive    Autozone  AZO  is one of my favorite stocks held by Consumer Discretionary ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Most Attractive rating  Autozone has grown Revenue and NOPAT every year since  More impressive is AZO s ability to become more profitable and efficient as it grows  Over the last 14 years  AZO has boosted its NOPBT margin  Net Operating Profits before Taxes  from 12  in 1998 to 19 6  in 2011  Simultaneously  AZO has improved its capital efficiency or asset turnover  Their ROIC has steadily climbed from 10 9  in 1998 to 25 0  in 2011  placing them in the 85th percentile for highest ROIC among Consumer Discretionary companies    Growth in operating profits while simultaneously boosting capital efficiency is a recipe for rapid value creation and indicates exceptional capital stewardship  It would be no great feat to increase operating profits by  1 if it required  100 of incremental investment  a meager 1  return on invested capital   It is extraordinarily difficult  however  to grow consistently for over a decade and earn even higher returns on new investments  Autozone has made it look easy    AZO is a great company  but its undervalued stock price makes it a great stock as well  Today s market price of  382 45 assumed AZO will never grow its profits beyond 2011 levels   That is a low expectation for a company that is a value creating machine    MGM Resorts International  MGM  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Consumer Discretionary ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Dangerous rating  Like Autozone  MGM has grown revenue substantially over the last 14 years  Unlike Autozone  however  MGM s growth has been accompanied by a steady decline in profitability  In 1998  MGM was earning an unimpressive 4 5  ROIC  That number has eroded to a big time value destroying 1 8  in 2011  MGM s invested capital has ballooned by 1830  with investments that have generated consistently lower returns  MGM is a great example of a company where growth only accelerates value destruction  Furthermore  in order to justify its current stock price  MGM would need to grow NOPAT 15  compounded annually for the next 10 years  It is hard to imagine where that profitable growth is going to come from when the company s investments in the past have consistently earned low returns  Today s price of  9 75 translates to very high expectations for this Very Dangerous rated stock    373 stocks of the 3000  I cover are classified as Consumer Discretionary stocks  but due to style drift  Consumer Discretionary ETFs and mutual funds hold 473 stocks    Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Consumer Discretionary ETFs and mutual funds    Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst ETFs Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Figure 5  Separating the Best Mutual Funds From the Worst

30239,251754,AZO,Standard Motor Products  Fairly Valued Auto Parts Stock ,opinion,Recently  I ve been playing around with the idea of how to use the  better to identify potential stocks  and one company that came up was Standard Motor Products  SMP   The O Metrix score was 8 which means that it is an A grade stock   based on the following numbers   The numbers used to identify SMP differs slightly from the OSV Stock Valuation and Analysis Spreadsheet which I used to perform the fundamental checks in this analysis  EV EBITDA of 6 37PE of 6 7Projected PE of 10 7Expected long term growth of 12 Dividend yield of 2 04Quick OverviewStandard Motor Products is one alternative way to play the aftermarket car parts industry  The company has a long history in the auto parts industry  There is strong family insider ownership but the language in the annual and quarterly reports reflect shareholder friendly ideas and practices Although management gets paid a bit too much in my opinion  the last 5 years has seen good improvements and the company has been able to post its highest profits during this period However  with the large short term debt coming due and limited growth prospect in a very competitive industry  Standard Motor Products is not the best investment at the current price  Still worth learning about though Business Description Standard Motor Products makes replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry  The parts are mainly divided into two segments  engine management and temperature control  For more information   to see the details of their product segments ManagementThe company was established in 1919 and listed on the public exchange in 1977  Standard Motor Products is run by the Sills family where Lawrence Sills is the third generation Sill  and he is also CEO and Chairman  Two of his brothers are on the board  His son is also the Vice President of the Engine Management Division so the company is not independent  but it is independent where it counts The three brothers are not part of any committees  How much influence they can exert on the committee members is a different matter that I don t have the details to get into confidently Among the three brothers  they own 15  of the company  The CEO owns the least at 3 1  compared to the two directors who own 6  and 5 8  Executive compensation came out to be 0 8  of revenue which is getting up there in terms of well paid management  A small company that gets close to 1  is in my opinion  overpaying their executives whether it be through salary or options The company did well in 2011  but the CFO and COO both earned 100  of their 2010 salary Throughout the year  insiders sold shares between  18    20 while buying on the open market at  13 Market and Business GrowthIn the aftermarket industry  business is competitive  There is a huge variety of products and choices  but Standard Motor Products has done well by building its portfolio of brands Maybe you know or use some of these brands Standard   BWD   Intermotor   GP Sorensen   TechSmartTM  OEM   Four Seasons   Factory Air   EVERCO   ACi   Imperial  and Hayden  and through private labels  such as CARQUEST   O Reilly Import Direct  and Master Pro   NAPA  Echlin   NAPA  Temp Products and NAPA  Belden  What I found interesting to note about their business and growth discussion is that  a lot of the verbiage and strategic focus is set on making sure the company is run efficiently  Well  every company says this  but it shows in the results for Standard Motor Products I won t get into the detailed numbers already  but CROIC since 2008 has been impressive  Before the 2008 crash  SMP was generating a CROIC of 0 2  from 2003 to 2007  Compare that to 19 5  2008 to TTM Standard Motor Products certainly has taken advantage of being a small cap to move its business around to continually squeeze out profitability The aftermarket parts industry is stable but seasonal Regardless of how the economy is doing  people will need parts for their cars  It is one of the reasons why Autozone  AZO  has done so well  and SMP is another way to play the car parts industry Expected Growth via Reverse Valuation To see what the market is expecting  a reverse DCF and a reverse Graham will provide a good indication of the expected growth  Using the following inputs for the reverse DCF 12  discount rate 44m in owner earningsStandard Motor Products has to grow by 7 8  annually to meet the current stock price  I mentioned earlier that the expected long term growth is 12  which would also make SMP worth  23  Using the reverse Graham Formula  the expected EPS growth is 1 6  Strategic Advantage Moat From the end customer point of view  there is no moat when it comes to car parts  It s much too easy to choose any competing product based on price or the package description  However  one thing that Standard Motor Products focuses on is customer service  In the past I ve written about how customer service is an underrated moat and how you should start thinking about it  Well  SMP does just that and since they sell commodity products  they have explicitly made customer service one of their top business strategies  Provide Superior Customer Service  Product Availability and Technical Support  Our goal is to increase sales to existing and new customers by leveraging our skills in rapidly filling orders  maintaining high levels of product availability  providing insightful customer category management  and providing technical support in a cost effective manner  In addition  our category management and technically skilled sales force professionals provide product selection and application support to our customers  The company does this by performing instructional clinics  teaching over 50 000 technicians annually how to diagnose and repair complex systems related to their products and helps the sales people be teachers and trainers  This way  they are creating an environment where the technicians will feel more comfortable and recommend the use of the their products as opposed to some other brand without any service or training  Risks Every company has risks  Here are some of Standard Motor Products   5 largest customers make up 63  of salesCompetitive industryHas in the past reduced prices to remain competitive  Not a good business to compete on price Tight margins will get squeezed further if there happens to be another recessionLots of liability claims and litigation associated with car parts  especially related to abestos which requires a reserve account ranging from  27m to 67m until 2059  Currently has  27 5m of asbestos accrual to date What s it Worth 2011 was a good year for the company  Revenue was up 8  and gross margins was the highest in 10 years at 26 2   But the most impressive part is the turnaround from 2008 onwards  Even before the recession hit  SMP was barely profitable despite having similar revenue numbers Working through the financial statements  I got to the inventory section and noticed a nice trend Here is a more graphical form of the inventory analysis What s it Worth 2011 was a good year for the company

despite having similar revenue numbers Working through the financial statements  I got to the Notice sequentially  that the inventories works in progress has been increasing compared to smaller

lines FCF is plenty so I m confident that SMP will be able to retire it I m looking at owner earnings and SMP hasn t done too well with increasing it consistently  It all over the place  But seeing as how the TTM revenue is similar to the last fiscal year  owner earnings will come out similar if not slightly less Using a conservative owner earnings number of  44m for the DCF valuation along with a

106821,328336,AZO,Why AutoZone Stock May Downshift,news,"AutoZone  NYSE AZO  stock has steadily trended upward over the last two years  The company has benefited from Americans keeping their cars longer and buybacks have helped propel the stock to highs near  1 275 per share in early December 
However  even as the S P 500 has risen to record highs  AutoZone stock has begun to drop  Moreover  both O Reilly Automotive  NASDAQ ORLY  and Advance Auto Parts  NYSE AAP  trade at higher multiples  Although Genuine Parts Company  NYSE GPC  trades at a similar valuation  its shareholders receive a dividend that yields 3  at current prices 
The rising stock price and lower valuation may attract investors  However  conditions within both the market and the company itself indicate that AutoZone stock could experience a dramatic reversal 
The growth of AutoZone stock
At first glance  one might wonder why AutoZone stock appears unattractive today  After all  it increased by 680  during the 2010s  Its archrival O Reilly Automotive registered a return of 1 050  over the same period  Nonetheless  AutoZone became one of the best performing retail stocks of the decade  

Moreover  Americans tend to keep their cars longer than in the past  The average age of a running vehicle in the U S  has reached a record of 11 8 years  That means Americans are choosing to repair older cars more often  likely using parts from a store like AutoZone  rather than buying new  
Furthermore  it operates in a recession resistant business  People need a running vehicle in good times and in bad  and they will spend money to keep them running  A recession could also help AutoZone somewhat as fewer people can afford to replace their cars during harder times 
Why the growth may not continue
However  while a recession may not derail AutoZone stock  some auto industry trends could work against the auto parts retailer  For one  consumers have increasingly turned to electric vehicles  That causes problems for AutoZone and its peers  EVs have markedly fewer moving parts compared to gas powered vehicles   That will mean that vehicles need less periodic maintenance  For AutoZone  that means lower demand for oil filters  fuel pumps  alternators  and the like 
Another trend working against AutoZone is demographics  Those between the ages of 18 and 34 spend more on auto repair and maintenance versus the average American  That bodes well for AutoZone    if this cohort chooses to own cars 
Unfortunately for the auto parts retailer  this generation more often chooses ridesharing or public transportation over car ownership  With fewer of them owning cars  many will not have a reason to set foot in an AutoZone store 
Further  in past years  auto parts sales enjoyed a degree of protection from e commerce  When cars break down  owners want them running as soon as possible  This discourages long wait times for e commerce deliveries  and often  price shopping 
However  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  stoked fear when it quietly entered the industry a few years ago  With the online giant now offering one day delivery with its Prime service  customers can now buy auto parts from Amazon without a long wait  This could cut AutoZone s profits as it adjusts its pricing and e commerce strategy to compete 
AutoZone and its financials
Worse  lower profits could expose significant vulnerabilities in AutoZone stock  At first glance  its P E ratio of just above 17 5 seems reasonable  particularly since analysts forecast average annual earnings increase of 10 95  per year over the next five years 
However  the balance sheet appears more troubling  The stockholders  equity   the value of the company after paying off debts and expenses   stands at around   1 776 billion as of the last quarter    This has remained negative for years as management has prioritized stock buybacks over balance sheet stability over the last several years  During the previous reported quarter  the company repurchased  450 million worth of AutoZone stock and had  1 277 billion remaining under the latest share buyback authorization 
Should industry and demographic trends wipe out profits  it may have to reissue some of these repurchased shares simply to cover expenses    Such an occurrence could hurt AutoZone stock  which trades at just over  1 120 per share as of the time of this writing  This may explain why this stock trades at a discount to most of its peers  Despite a reasonable P E ratio and steady profit increases  AutoZone stock is not as stable as it might appear 
Avoid AutoZone stock
Although AutoZone stock ran smoothly in the 2010s  the competitive landscape and the financial condition of the company indicate points of weakness  Admittedly  if Americans need fewer auto parts in the next few years  this will hurt both AutoZone and its peers  
Competition could also hurt AutoZone stock in another way  Due to aggressive stock buybacks  stockholders  equity has long remained negative  Should the company need to raise cash  its financial condition could lead to massive share issuance  significantly harming AutoZone stock 
AutoZone enjoyed tremendous success in the 2010s  However  with market conditions changing for the worse  investors need to take profits ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnuco,2069179
106822,328337,AZO,The Truth About Market Timing   January 27  2020,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Retail Wholesale stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Abercrombie   Fitch Company  ANF   Aaron s  Inc   AAN   Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc   ARCO   ASOS  LON ASOS  PLS ADR  ASOMY   AutoZone  Inc   NYSE AZO 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense
