15043,236558,VAR,Varian Medical Systems  VAR  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Varian Medical Systems  NYSE VAR  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of cancer treatment systems is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 6  
Revenues are expected to be  760 16 million  up 7 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Varian 
For Varian  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Varian will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Varian would post earnings of  1 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  9 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Varian doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/varian-medical-systems-var-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200440721,200440721

Growth Drivers
Increasing net sales from Oncology Systems and Proton Solutions have been a major growth driver for Varian 

 
Market seems upbeat about the strong and consistent revenue growth at Oncology Systems over the last two quarters  The segment s performance was aided by a year over year increase in global net installed base  Gross orders of oncology system units surged particularly in the Americas  EMEA and APAC regions  The radiation therapy market has been contributing to this segment s growth as well 
In the last two quarters  the Proton Solutions segment of Varian witnessed robust growth on several clinical handovers within the United Kingdom  The FlashForward Consortium and ProBeam 360  both launched near 2018 end  have been building momentum within this segment  Continued investment in sales  marketing and R D within this segment is expected to keep strengthening the company 
Of late  a rising number of orders for the Halcyon radio therapy platform  launched and approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  have been crucial for the company  The platform was granted exclusion from U S  tariffs  which is another major positive 
A few months back  Varian announced the acquisition of Noona  a developer of cloud based technology designed to highlight cancer patient outcomes  Around that time  the Paul Scherrer Institute initiated the use of Varian software solution for advanced proton therapy treatments  Varian also announced that it was selected by Medical Specialist Holdings  MSH  to extend its treatment facilities to seven of its centers in South Africa 
In August 2018  Varian announced the acquisition of humediQ  with the agenda of strengthening its oncology portfolio  It also launched the Bravos brachytherapy afterloader system in order to enhance clinical experience 
We believe all these factors have lifted the stock to a 52 week high

According to the International Diabetes Federation estimates  roughly 425 million people were diagnosed with diabetes globally in 2017  of which around 10  or 42 5 million were detected with type 1  Therefore  the company s decision to go overseas has been aptly timed and is likely to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the niche market

GNC Holdings exited 2018 on a dismal note with both fourth quarter earnings and revenues lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In the reported quarter  revenues dipped 2 6  year over year  This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales associated with the store closures at the end of the respective lease term  which is a component of the company s store portfolio optimization strategy Within same store  the company performed poorly at domestic franchise locations  Revenues from U S    Canada segment dipped 3 7  due to the impact of company owned net store closures  further inducing a  10 million decrease in revenues and negative same store sales of 0 6   which in turn  caused a revenue decline of  1 9 million  GNC Holdings  Inc  Price

   Additionally  domestic franchise revenues fell  5 million on account of soft retail same store sales and lower number of franchise stores  Domestic retail comps were also weak in the quarter under review  Moreover  revenues from manufacturing segment reported a sharp year over year decline  The contraction in gross and operating margins was disappointing too 
On a positive note  GNC Holdings registered a strong performance in both e commerce and International segments  Capitalizing on this uptick  the company s plan is well in place to grow its presence in China  Mexico and South Korea with strategies that will leverage alternative channels of distribution

Haemonetics exited third quarter fiscal 2019 on a promising note  Per the company  benefits from complexity reduction and investments along with strength in market demand and success from early launches helped the company put up an impressive performance  Continued momentum in new business generation and geographical expansion have contributed to the results

teens  However  the company s global sales growth has decelerated due to modest year over year shares decline due to company consistently exercising price discipline and maintaining stability in

the fourth quarter  gross margin expanded 250 basis points  bps  to 76  owing to a more profitable product mix  favorable currency movements and absence of expenses related to the closure of its manufacturing plant in Switzerland in 2018  However  this was partially offset by persistent capacity related expenses SG A expenses rose 5 6  year over year to  288 1 million  thanks to initiatives for increasing TAVR therapy adoption  However  the rise was partially offset by reduced reported expenses globally on strengthening U S  dollar  R D expenditures increased 11 3  year over year to  163

15405,236920,VAR,Varian Medical Systems  VAR  Reports Earnings Next Week  What Awaits ,opinion,"The market expects Varian Medical Systems  NYSE VAR  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of cancer treatment systems is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  717 88 million  up 5 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Varian 
For Varian  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Varian will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Varian would post earnings of  1 19 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 16  delivering a surprise of  2 52  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Varian doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/varian-medical-systems-var-reports-earnings-next-week-what-awaits-200376184,200376184

15451,236966,VAR,Medical Device Industry Outlook   June 2018,opinion,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past  Banking on an aging population  increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases  increasing adoption of artificial intelligence  AI  and big data applications  upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments  this sector appears to be in the pink of health 
Going by KPMG data  the medical device industry s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5  a year to reach nearly  800 billion by 2030 
A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present  raking in more than  180 billion in revenues  Despite several socio political hazards and economic dips  U S  medical device companies have been riding high on R D innovation  increasing consolidation  emerging market expansion and tax cuts 
Undoubtedly  it has been a very profitable investment space of late 
Here are a few major developments 
Abolition of MedTech Tax 
The bipartisan two year suspension of the Medical Device tax  which imposed a 2 3  excise tax on MedTech manufacturers  marks a temporary relief  It will be again put into effect from Jan 1  2020 
The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9 000 America based medical device manufacturers  thus instilling investor optimism 
The ratification of the tax repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector 
M A Uptrend Continues
Apart from the tax relief  the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition  M A  trends in the space  In fact  various reports suggest that M A has been the key catalyst driving the U S  healthcare space of late  Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia  M A activity in the MedTech space surged 50  in 2017  increasing the value of aggregate M A to more than  200 billion 
Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton  Dickinson and Company s  BDX  acquisition of C  R  Bard and Johnson   Johnson s  JNJ  buyout of Actelion 
PBM Health Insurers Consolidation
Lately  health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain 
Buoyed by continued capital inflow  strategic M A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases  moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow  These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space 
In this regard  the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna  CI   which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health  NYSE CVS  Corp s  CVS  announcement to acquire the nation s third largest health insurer  Aetna  NYSE AET   is important 
Digital Revolution and MedTech
Latest trends like robotic surgeries  Big data analytics  bio printing  3D printing  electronic health records  EHR   predictive analytics  real time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U S  MedTech space are gaining prominence 
Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity  Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50  reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50  
This along with a rise in minimally invasive surgeries  higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care  and the shift of the payment system to a value based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late 
Trade War Fears Grip MedTech
The 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors  radar  Healthcare  including medical equipment  is one of the sectors  likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute 
Going by data provided in an article by Christian B  Jones in Mondaq  MedTech firms in the United States currently sell  4 7 billion annually to China  while the nation imports from China a total of  5 billion in medical device  U S  exports of medical devices last year totaled  52 billion  creating a  1 billion worldwide trade surplus  Needless to say  the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade

15452,236967,VAR,MedTech Overcomes Policy Hurdles  Long Term Prospects Bright,opinion,"With the suspension of the controversial 2 3  medical device tax for another two years  the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism  AdvaMed  the medical device industry s lobbying group  which strongly advocated for this relief  noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations  research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities 
According to an article published in Daily News  the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as  3 7 billion during the two year suspension 
The U S  medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation  An aging population  longer expectancy for life  growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long term tailwinds  including mergers   acquisitions  M As  and product innovation  have been contributing to growth of the sector 
M A Boom Continues 
It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M As till now  Meanwhile  according to Mark Bonifacio  President of Bonifacio Consulting Services  private equity and strategic OEM  Original equipment manufacturer  buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies 
He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M As  it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare s medical device tax  Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared  the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M A activity 
This year s biggest M A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space  Boston Scientific  BSX  and Stryker Corporation  NYSE SYK   SYK   The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation 
The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic  NYSE MDT  Covidien and Abbott  ABT  St  Jude Medical in the last couple of years  Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical technology space 
Following the company s  25 billion consolidation with St  Jude Medical in January  Abbott  ABT  recently closed the  5 3 billion acquisition of Alere  With the successful wrap up of this transaction  the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the  7 billion point of care diagnostic space 
Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major  Becton  Dickinson and Co  and medical  surgical  diagnostic  and patient care devices provider C  R  Bard  for  24 billion  After the completion of the deal in January  Becton  Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments   PICCs  peripherally inserted central catheters   midlines and drug delivery ports 
Baxter International  BAX  purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt  NYSE MNK  plc  MNK  
Varian Medical  VAR  also inked a major M A deal  The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia based global life sciences company  Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of  1 28 billion  The investment will strengthen the company s position in interventional oncology therapies  This apart  in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy  the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises  a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan 
Johnson   Johnson s  JNJ  subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May 
This apart  in 2018  Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health  EmCision in Endoscopy  Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart  This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks  operational growth 
Divestments 
Medical device majors continue to offload their non core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments  These divestures have been mandated by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and other international anti trust regulators  This restricts chances of monopoly in the market 
Earlier this month  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  got a  2 7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary  Ethicon  Inc  s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive  If JNJ accepts the proposal  it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders  return 
This apart  according to a MASSDEVICE report  Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd  and another unnamed investor  BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for  100 million  The divestment is related to its acquisition of C R  Bard 
In April  Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC   HSIC  announced its decision to spin off the company s major segment global Animal Health business  We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein s 2018 2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses  According to the company  this transaction will enable it to make the most of the opportunities in the dental space in order to deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention 
Apprehending that China s drug distribution reform may slow down the company s growth in the region  according to a Reuters report   Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  sold off its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for  1 2 billion 
Following the announcement of its two major buyouts  Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics  AMO  to Johnson   Johnson for about  4 33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines 
A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems  Cynosure  sold itself to Hologic  Notably  Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately  1 65 billion 
Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Bright 
A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U S  adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration  Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017  a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate 
Meanwhile  with exploding population  rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues  emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options  Going by a report in The Guardian  International Finance Corp s  IFJ  data shows that developing countries account for 80  of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity 
Per a recent BCG report  the share of emerging markets  which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues  is likely to increase to nearly one third of revenues by 2022  The MedTech market in China  currently the second largest in the world  is projected to grow about 13  annually from 2015 through 2022  India  the fifth largest MedTech market in the world  currently records 17  annual growth  At this pace  India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022 
Given the huge potential in these regions  long back  Johnson   Johnson had set up manufacturing and R D centers in Brazil  China and India  The company s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets 
Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In the recent quarters  sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits  driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America  including Colombia  Mexico  Peru and Argentina 
At Medtronic  MDT   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  businesses in Latin America  the Middle East and Africa  Eastern Europe and China showed sustained strength  growing in double digits  Overall  Medtronic s long term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging 
Boston Scientific s emerging markets  business registered 17  growth in first quarter 2018  reflecting a significant increase from 8  growth in 2013  Business in China was once again remarkable  up 23  year over year

15459,236974,VAR,Trade War May Pull MedTech Down  3 Stocks To Defy The Odds,opinion,There is no sign of respite from the ongoing market uncertainty due to apprehensions of a trade war  On the one hand  Asian stocks have started to revive on improvement in U S North Korea relationship while on the other hand  investors are restraining themselves on possibilities of trade loss due to the proposed China trade restrictions Medical Device Caught in the Trade War StormGoing by data provided in an article by Christian B  Jones in Mondaq  MedTech firms in the United States currently sell  4 7 billion annually to China  while the nation imports from China a total of  5 billionin medical device  U S  exports of medical devices last year totaled  52 billion  creating a  1 billion worldwide trade surplus Needless to say  the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade  MedTech trade group AdvaMed made a more specific comment claiming that the Chinese tariffs account for more than half of all MedTech imports from the region  in a MassDevice article   The trade group stated that   for our industry  the proposed additional tariff of 25  on imports of nearly  3bn of medical technology products is the wrong action at the wrong time  AdvaMed countered United States Trade Representative s  USTR  claim of China s unfair trade practices in medical devices harming U S  exports significantly  The group argued that the U S  trades with China on medical devices on the USTR list are in fact in slight surplus  Accordingly  if the proposed tariffs on diagnostic products and other medical devices made in both the United States and China are not dropped  it may result in trade imbalance Per RBC Capital Markets estimates  if the proposed 25  tariffs get implemented  this could cost the medical device industry up to  1 5 billion each year Going by the latest update  per a Financial Express report  a bipartisan group of 40 lawmakers has urged US Trade Representative  Robert Lighthizer to remove  3 billion worth of medical devices from the list of Chinese products proposed by the Trump administration for additional tariff Investors in Trouble With the risk of a trade war between the two largest economies heightening  investment in medical device stocks is taking a backseat The proposed imposition of additional tariff on Chinese products and China s retaliatory efforts have resulted in widespread share losses so far in the Medical device sector  Bearish emerging market trade outlook has dealt severe blows to the bigwigs  We note that the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations In this regard  we note that stocks like Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT    GE Healthcare   NYSE GE   and others are witnessing considerable weakness since Mar 23  when talks of a U S  China trade war started doing the rounds  We note that Medtronic earlier bought orthopedic devices maker  China Kanghui Holdings and since then has been consistently shipping products to the United States from this operation  If these shipments are now subject to additional tariff  it will definitely hamper the company s China business GE Healthcare has also urged the administration to remove certain parts from the list of Chinese products for additional tariff  Going by a Mass Device report  China produced parts are essential for a number of GE s devices  including ultrasound machines  patient monitors  MRI machines  CT machines and X ray machines  some of which are produced by GE owned facilities in China while others are produced by local Chinese companies 3 MedTech Stocks to Counter the Trade Restriction HazardConcerns about the implementation of the trade tariffs on MedTech products have been weighing on stocks lately  Even though the market has not yet shown any steady plunge  such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward We have shortlisted three MedTech stocks  which  in spite of the tumultuous market conditions  are well poised on strong fundamentals and timely strategic developments  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Growth Score and Zacks Rank We have narrowed down our choices with the help of our new  Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space  You can see  Baxter International Inc    NYSE BAX    Although  the company has a strong presence in overseas markets  it has no such business relation with China  Hence  in spite of considering international diversification as a core component of the company s strategy  the company can very well sidestep the volatility of the U S  China trade war and continue to enjoy the bountiful scope offered by emerging markets  The company  in fact  is benefiting from developing countries  incremental investments in health care systems Baxter has a Growth Score of A and a Zacks Rank  2  The company has an impressive long term expected growth rate of 16 3   higher than the industry s 10 3  Varian Medical Systems Inc    NYSE VAR    In the second quarter of fiscal 2018  Varian Medical s global market share growth was driven by orders based share gains in EMEA  In fact  Varian Medical was awarded a contract for eight TrueBeam systems in Stockholm  Sweden  Further  the company signed an agreement to acquire Australia based  Sirtex  which focused on interventional oncology therapies  This apart  Varian Medical has recently announced the opening of a new facility in Jundia   Brazil  which extends its global manufacturing and training footprint in the region  Although Varian Medical has business in Greater China  the company s huge global base outside the country shields it from severe damage that may occur as a result of the trade restriction Varian Medical has a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank  2 ABIOMED  Inc    NASDAQ ABMD    Just like Baxter  despite having strong international foothold  ABIOMED does not have any

What s Driving the Outperformance

For the current fiscal year  Baxter International is expected to post earnings of  2 89 per share on  11 37 billion in revenues  This represents a 16 53  change in EPS on a 7 65  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 22 per share on  11 89 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 51  and 4 61   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Baxter International may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for BAX  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style

Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Baxter International meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though BAX shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come

Also  net sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 37 billion Segmental AnalysisGlobal Industrial Sales in the segment grew 5  year over year to almost  1 24 billion  The upside was driven by major gains in Water  Food   Beverage and Life Sciences unit Europe  North America and Latin America led the Global Industrial regional growth However  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income in the segment decreased 5  on a year over year basis due to higher delivered product costs and massive investments in the business Ecolab Inc  Price and Consensus    Global InstitutionalSales

income rose 4  year over year Global Energy Sales rose 9  to  847 1 million owing to strong growth in the well stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income remained flat year over year Other Sales declined 11  year over year to  197 4 million  However  sales in this segment witnessed robust growth in North America Notably  the Other segment now has Ecolab s Colloidal Technologies unit  The unit was previously part of the Global Industrial Reportable segment Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales rose 8  year over year  as the Pest Elimination unit within the segment registered solid growth in North America and Europe Margin AnalysisThe company s margins in the quarter under review remained under pressure owing

Despite growth in business  profits in the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing  Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health s operational efficiencies in the upcoming quarters  Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks  Recently  the company closed the divestiture of its Cardinal Health China distribution

15562,237077,VAR,Boston Scientific To Buy NxThera  Strengthens Urology Arm,opinion,Leading its way through the growing market of Urology  Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   has recently entered into an agreement to buy Minnesota based NxThera for a deal value of up to  406 million  Privately held NxThera is the developer and marketer of the Rezum system in the United States and Europe  The transaction is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018  subject to customary closing conditions Financial Terms of the DealThe transaction consists of an upfront payment of  306 million in cash and up to an additional  100 million in potential commercial milestone payments over the next four years  Notably  the company has an existing minority investment in NxThera  expected to result in a net upfront payment of approximately  240 million upon closing and milestone fees of nearly  85 million NxThera  Rezum and BPH  A Strategic Deal for BSX For patients with symptoms arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia  BPH   the Rezum system of NxThera comes as a minimally invasive therapy option  BPH or non cancerous prostate gland enlargement is quite common among aged males  creating an attractive market  While the disease affects 110 million men worldwide  more than 12 million symptomatic men alone in the United States are undergoing treatment for the condition with medications or procedural approaches  Notably  BPH may cause symptoms affecting a patient s qualify of life such as pain and a frequent need to urinate  Among the many positives about the Rezum system of NxThera  we are impressed by its hassle free procedure  which can be performed at a physician s clinic without general anesthesia  thereby reducing the cost of a BPH therapy to the core  Moreover  the treatment applies water vapor to remove excess prostate tissue  alleviating obstructions to urine flow  This further helps mitigating BPH related symptoms and also prevents unwanted side effects that come along with the intake of maintenance medications to control BPH Boston Scientific mentioned about two favorable clinical studies related to the Rezum system  Management stated that  A study published in the March issue of the Journal of Urology demonstrated that over a three year period  patients treated with the Rezum system had clinical progression rates that were five times lower than the reported rates of patients treated with daily  long term medications  Additional clinical data from a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients treated with the Rezum system had a 51  reduction in their symptoms at 24 months post treatment and maintained a 50 percent reduction in BPH symptoms at three years  post treatment  Projected Synergies From the DealPost the deal s closure  the buyout of NxThera is expected to remain immaterial to Boston Scientific s adjusted earnings per share  EPS  through 2020 and be only accretive afterwards  The consolidation is likely to be dilutive or less beneficial on a reported basis due to amortization and transaction and integration costs We reckon that the Boston Scientific s Urology Pelvic Health arm is one of its highest operating margin businesses  Per the company  acquisition of the AMS urology portfolio has burgeoned its urology business size to almost double at a value of  1 billion Significantly  urology represents a  4 billion attractive global market potential with large unmet patient needs and considerable international expansion opportunities  We believe  this NxThera buyout post completion  will enable the company to capitalize on this opportunity Share Price Performance Boston Scientific has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results  Last month  shares of the company

    Revenues by GeographyPer management  U S  revenues grossed  1 21 billion  up 4  year over year Non U S  revenues surged by  1 million from the year ago quarter figure to  161 million  The uptick was mainly driven by strong results in the United Kingdom and Sweden Bookings DetailIn the reported quarter  Cerner s bookings totaled  1 96 billion  down from  2 33 billion in the same quarter last year However  this is the second highest bookings quarter in Cerner s history Per management  Cerner registered bookings from long term contracts  including 6 contracts that were more than  75 million  and multiple transactions Segmental PerformanceLicensed software revenues fell 1 8  to  166 5 million  Per management  the small scale of the EHR replacement market reduces Cerner s opportunity in the traditional software sector  However  the company expects SaaS to continue growing Technology resale revenues came in at  46 1 million  down 42  on a year over year basis  The metric also came below management s expectations Revenues from Subscriptions grossed  87 million  down 24 1  year over year Professional services revenues totaled  466 2 million  up 13 9  from the prior year quarter number  Per management  this upside was mainly driven by Cerner s Works business Revenues at the Managed services unit summed  299 1 million  up 14 1  from the prior year quarter  Per management  the improvement was driven by solid year to date bookings Support and maintenance revenues came in at  276 8 million  up 5 8  year over year Reimbursed travel revenues amounted to  24 1 million  mirroring a 14 5  decline year over year MarginsIn the quarter under review  gross profit summed  1 13 billion  up 4 1  year over year  Gross margin was 82 6   flat on a year over year basis General and administrative expenses rose 7 4  to  98 9 million  Further  Software development expenses increased 11 7  to  181 5 million Adjusted operating margin contracted 180 basis points  bps  to 18 7  during the quarter GuidanceFor the first quarter of 2019  Cerner expects revenues between  1 37 billion and  1 42 billion  The midpoint of this range is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 39 billion  Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be 60 62 cents  The range is significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents  Business bookings are expected in the range of  1 10  1 30 billion  The midpoint of this range reflects a 14  decrease year over year For 2019  revenues are expected between  5 65 billion and  5 85 billion  The midpoint of this range is  5 75 billion  which misses the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 80 billion  Adjusted earnings per share is expected between  2 57 and  2 67  The range is significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 70 Wrapping UpCerner exited the fourth quarter on a mixed note  While earnings met the consensus mark  revenues lagged the same  However  Cerner continues to witness strong contributions from key areas like  Population Health  Revenue Cycle and IT Works  Strong international performance in the quarter is an added positive  Also  gains in Professional and Managed Services units buoy optimism Cerner is likely to benefit from its electronic health record  EHR   electronic patient record  EPR  or electronic medical record  EMR  platforms that provide patient care in both acute inpatient and outpatient settings On the flip side  Cerner s Licensed Software and Subscriptions revenues saw a year over year decline in the quarter under review  In fact  management expects low software bookings to negatively impact total bookings in the first quarter as well  Contraction in operating margins too adds to the woes  Furthermore  high long term debt and competition in the global MedTech space are worrisome Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceSome better ranked MedTech stocks that delivered solid performance in their respective quarters are Varian Medical Systems   NYSE VAR

15583,237098,VAR,Medical Device Industry Outlook   February 2018,opinion,"The Q4 earnings season is approaching its end with more than 80  of the S P 500 companies having released their quarterly earnings  Most of the companies have incurred big one time charges related to the change in tax law this time around  The gap between adjusted operating earnings and reported earnings is in fact the widest in recent years  The MedTech space is also not immune to the trend 
Last year  the MedTech space witnessed a good deal of uncertainty on account of a series of political events  While the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare was not rolled back as was originally expected  the year ended with the tax overhaul  As part of the latest tax reform  corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21  from 35  earlier 
Industry Appears Vulnerable to Change
Many of the economists expect the new tax law to have a negative impact on the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending if certain criteria are not met by a specific date 
The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  apprehends that if it doesn t find any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax cut  automatic cuts worth  136 billion  including  25 billion in Medicare cuts  from mandatory spending in 2018 could be triggered 
Delayed Medical Device Tax  Boon to the Industry
Amid the concerns related to the tax reform  Congress  postponement of the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge relief to industry participants and investors  The original 2018 tax reform bill did not include any mention of this temporary repeal and investors were apprehensive that medical device tax will be reinforced in 2018 
This 2 3  tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment in 2013  Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group  this tax had a significant negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of jobs 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  made a payment of  180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014  Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT   the legacy Covidien and Smith   Nephew  LON SN   SNN  paid  112 million   60 million and  25 million  respectively in 2014 
Medical device giant Stryker Corporation  NYSE SYK  reported net earnings of  1 14 billion and paid approximately  229 million as medical device excise tax in 2015    nearly 16  of Stryker s bottom line income  data from a Med Device Online report   No wonder  this dreadful tax drew severe criticism from both Democrats and Republicans and was delayed by Congress in 2015 for two years 
Regarding the latest two year suspension of the tax  Mark Leahey  President and CEO of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association  MDMA  has stated that   Congress must permanently repeal this disastrous policy in order to fully realize the long term investments in patient care and job creation that are critical to growth   It remains to be seen whether the tax is fully eliminated or resumed after the two year period  For now  the deferral will encourage R D activities in this space

15584,237099,VAR,MedTech s Long Term Prospects Outweigh Near Term Risks,opinion,"In the past few years  the U S  medical device market has undergone substantial transformation  While there are a number of regulatory and financial issues unlikely to be resolved soon  powerful long term tailwinds  including mergers   acquisitions  M As   emerging market expansion  positive demographic trends and product innovation  have been contributing to the continued growth of the sector 
In addition  the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value based model among others 
Let us go through some of the major long term tailwinds for the MedTech sector 
M A Boom Continues 
Going by the last available EvaluateGroup data  the first half of 2017 saw a massive 178  surge in the total value of M A deals within MedTech  Although the next report is yet to be released  the pace of M A activity is said to have been the same in the rest of the year  The trend is likely to continue in 2018 
Following the company s colossal  25 billion consolidation with St  Jude Medical in January  Abbott  ABT  recently closed the  5 3 billion acquisition of Alere  With the successful wrap up of this transaction  the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a lead player in the  7 billion point of care diagnostic space 
Another mega consolidation was that of medical device major Becton  Dickinson and Co   BDX  and medical  surgical  diagnostic and patient care devices provider C  R  Bard  for  24 billion  After the completion of the deal in December 2017  Becton  Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments   PICCs  peripherally inserted central catheters   midlines and drug delivery ports 
Stryker  SYK  is also on an M A spree  The company is going to buy Entellus Medical for  662 million to strengthen its position in the ENT space  The company is also on track to close the  183 million acquisition of VEXIM  which specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions 
Varian Medical  VAR  also inked a major M A deal of late  In January 2018  the company signed an agreement to acquire Australia based global life sciences company  Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of  1 28 billion  The investment will strengthen the company s position in the interventional oncology therapies 
This apart  Boston Scientific s  BSX  major  90 million investment in Santa Rosa  CA based Millipede is expected to boost its position in the growing field of mitral regurgitation  MR   which falls under the company s structural heart business  We note that the company s acquisition of Switzerland based Symetis SA in mid 2017 has already started to strengthen its structural heart business in Europe 
In December 2017  PerkinElmer  NYSE PKI  acquired EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG for approximately  1 3 billion  The acquisition expanded PerkinElmer s reach in the autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets 
Divestments 
Medical device majors continue to offload their non core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments  These divestures have been mandated by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and other international anti trust regulators  This restricts chances of monopoly in the market 
Earlier this month  BD divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for  100 million  The divestment is related to its acquisition of C R  Bard 
Orthopedic implant device maker Exactech recently sold itself off to TPG Capital for  737 million  The alliance with TPG will enable the consolidated company to invest in growth so as to compete with larger competitors in the orthopedic industry 
Apprehending that China s drug distribution reform may slow down the company s growth in the region  according to a Reuters report   Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  completed the sale of its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for  1 2 billion 
In order to focus on a portfolio that delivers on global strategic priorities  Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT  divested part of its PMR  patient monitoring and recovery  division within the MITG  Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  business to Cardinal Health for a deal value of  6 1 billion 
Following the announcement of its two major buyouts  Abbott divested its eyecare business Abbott Medical Optics  AMO  to Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  for about  4 33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines 
A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems  Cynosure  sold itself to Hologic  Notably  Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately  1 65 billion 
Emerging Market Openings
Though the performance of the U S  medical device market has been dull  though it still holds the leading position  with almost one third of the world market share  due to rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty  global growth has been strong  In 2016  the emerging market grew 5   a pace last seen before the financial crisis 
Going by a recent BCG report  the share of emerging markets  which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues  is likely to increase to nearly one third of revenues by 2022  The MedTech market in China  currently the second largest in the world  is projected to grow about 13  annually from 2015 through 2022  India  the fifth largest MedTech market in the world  currently records 17  annual growth  At this pace  India may soon pose stiff competition for Japan and Germany by 2022 
Among other emerging geographical regions  Latin America  even in the face of general economic stagnation  holds enormous potential  Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence  the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare between 2008 and 2014 
Given the huge potential in these regions  a while back  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  had set up manufacturing and R D centers in Brazil  China and India  The company s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets 
Abbott  ABT  continues to lead the emerging market investment trend  with about 50  of sales from this region  In the recent quarters  sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits  driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America  including Colombia  Mexico  Peru and Argentina 
At Medtronic  MDT   in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  businesses in China  Latin America  and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength  growing in double digits  Overall  Medtronic long term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging 
Boston Scientific s  BSX  emerging markets  business registered 13  organic growth in fourth quarter 2017  reflecting a significant increase from 8  growth in 2013  Business in China was once again remarkable  up 19  year over year

15610,237125,VAR,MedTech Industry Outlook   October 2017,opinion,"Third quarter releases are keeping Wall Street on its toes  Even then  uncertainty related to the Trump administration s Obamacare repeal   replacement effort refuses to fully go away  The President s latest executive order has added to the issues facing the industry 
Executive Order  A Blunder 
As per critics  this executive order  which seemingly looks not much different from the basic structure of existing health policy  is actually set to break the entire healthcare system from within  According to them  this order  forsaking the consideration of pre existing health conditions  has been designed to push people to  junk  insurance plans  An article on CNN Money says   It could lure younger  healthier consumers away from Obamacare with cheaper  but skimpier policies  while leaving sicker folks to pay higher premiums on the exchanges  
No wonder voices against this proposition move are getting louder  The American Hospital Association has put forward an extremely bearish view on the executive order related to promoting health care choice and competition  The association is apprehensive that the order will solely allow health insurance plans that cover fewer benefits and give fewer consumer protections 
Also  according to a report published in Business Wire  a set of eighteen different patient groups have released a joint statement  visibly threatening the fact that this executive order may destabilize the insurance market by splitting it into two groups   those who need comprehensive benefits that they are getting under the existing law and those who are currently healthy and can gamble with substandard coverage 
As per the joint statement   This order has the potential to price millions of people with pre existing conditions and serious illnesses out of the individual insurance market and put millions more at risk through the sale of insurance plans that won t cover all the services patients want to stay healthy or the critical care they need when they get sick  
With heavyweight names like the American Cancer Society  the American Heart Association  National Health Council and the American Diabetes Association  this jointly released statement is undoubtedly generating considerable opposition  Even chances that the new legislative change may result in lower taxes and eased regulations for the industry as a whole are not bringing the nation together 
Troubled Times for MedTech  Too
While twists and turns continue to unfold at Capitol Hill  the scenario within the medical device space is getting gloomier  The executive order points to a shrinking customer base  indicating a cut in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices  This may lead to a major supply demand disequilibrium within the medical device space  
This apart  tax related confusion remains a huge burden on the MedTech fraternity  Earlier  this community was quite hopeful of the change in power as Trump s proposed policies always talked about the abolition of the infamous 2 3  medical device sales tax  This measure  commonly addressed as the fund of the Affordable Care Act  has taken a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment in 2013 
A report by FierceMedicalDevices released at that time had revealed that Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  made a payment of  180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014  Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT   the legacy Covidien  and Smith   Nephew  LON SN   SNN  paid  112 million   60 million and  25 million  respectively  during that year 
Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech majors as well as small players  the U S  House and Senate temporarily suspended it  for just two years  in 2015  Now  MedTech players will find themselves facing a similar situation  from the beginning of 2018 itself   if the policy remains intact 
Unfortunately  while the Trump administration has been targeting a complete annulment of many other taxes including the abolishment of the Cadillac tax  40  excise tax on high cost healthcare plans  in the near future  it has not come up with any concrete plan to replace the MedTech tax as of yet

15641,237156,VAR,MedTech Thriving On Consolidation   Expansion  Stocks To Buy,opinion,"It s been more than six months since President Trump s election and the medical device industry  which was earlier hopeful about the change of power in White House  is currently fussing over the inability of Republicans to come up with any healthcare policy  As of now  any reform in this respect seems a far cry  Per the latest New Republic article   The Republican push to repeal and replace Obamacare is currently stalled in the Senate  where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has delayed a vote until after the July 4 recess because his bill doesn t have the necessary GOP support  
Given the current lack of clarity  let s concentrate on some powerful long term tailwinds of the medical device industry like mergers   acquisitions  M A   emerging market expansion  positive demographic trends and new product innovation  These have been driving the sector s impressive performance despite severe socio economic and political instability 
Also worth mentioning are the recent changes in consumer demand and market dynamics  which have led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  This is evident from the growing number of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care  and the shift of the payment system to a value based model among others 
Let s elaborate some of the major long term drivers of the MedTech sector 
Major M As 
The year has started off with two MedTech mammoths joining forces  We are talking about Abbott s colossal  25 billion consolidation with St  Jude Medical in January  The consolidated is currently on track to form a leader in high growth cardiovascular markets  including atrial fibrillation  structural heart and heart failure as well as earn a leading position in the high growth neuromodulation market 
The same month  another big merger took place  that of the acquisition of Israel based Valtech Cardio by Edwards Lifesciences for a total deal value of  690 million  The acquisition allows Edwards Lifesciences to expand its services in the huge heart valve repair and replacement market in the emerging geographical regions 
A  1 billion merger deal was executed in February  through which Teleflex Inc   TFX  acquired Vascular Solutions that develops clinical solutions for minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures  The combination is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of Teleflex s vascular and interventional businesses 
Another path breaking mega consolidation is the one between medical device major Becton  Dickinson and Co   BDX  and medical  surgical  diagnostic  and patient care devices provider C  R  Bard Inc   BCR  for  24 billion  After the completion of the deal in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  Becton  Dickinson promises to create a third business segment   BD Interventional 
This apart  Boston Scientific s acquisition of Switzerland based Symetis SA in May 2017 should fortify its structural heart business in Europe  Also worth mentioning is Integra LifeSciences  plans to acquire the Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  Codman Neurosurgery business for  1 045 billion in cash 
It seems that the  43 billion Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT  Covidien merger and the subsequent reports of how the consolidated company knocked off Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  from its indisputable position as the top firm in the medical devices space  inspired other industry leaders to come forward with mega M A deals 
Divestments 
Medical device majors continue to offload their non core business lines  specifically to focus on the main segments and to divest assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers  These divestures have been mandated by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and other international anti trust regulators  This restricts chances of monopoly in the market 
Let s take a look at some of the significant divestments in recent times 
In order to focus on a portfolio that delivers on global strategic priorities  Medtronic decided to divest part of its PMR  patient monitoring and recovery  division within MITG  Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  business to Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  for a deal value of  6 1 billion 
Following the announcement of its two major buyouts  Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics  AMO  to Johnson   Johnson for about  4 33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines  The AMO product lines have joined JNJ s ACUVUE Brand Contact Lenses business  and the combined organization will operate under the brand name Johnson   Johnson Vision 
A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems  Cynosure  recently sold itself to Hologic  Inc   HOLX   Notably  Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately  1 65 billion 
Wright Medical s  WMGI  recent divestiture of its large joints  hip knee  business to Corin Orthopaedics is an example of the focus that the former puts on its core businesses 
In another development  in its bid to reduce and refine its portfolio and to repay long term debts  Community Health Systems  Inc   CYH  has decided to divest Rockwood Health System and the associated assets to MultiCare Health System 
Emerging Market Openings
According to a report by Visiongain  the global medical devices market will reach  398 billion in 2017 from  321 billion in 2012  This trend will continue to grow stronger through 2023 
The traditional market remains plagued by growing regulatory scrutiny  pricing pressure and no sign of a turnaround in the emerging markets of Latin America and Eastern Europe as per recent data from Euromonitor International  So  it s the Asia Pacific region on which all the bets are being placed this year 
China and India s healthcare service revenues are expected to grow at a massive rate  resulting in a large number of new hospital construction projects and soaring demand for medical and surgical equipment 
Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In recent quarters  sales in key emerging markets climbed in double digits driven by growth in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America  including Colombia  Mexico  Peru and Argentina 
At Medtronic  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  business in China  Latin America and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength  growing by strong double digits  Eastern Europe on the other hand grew high single digits 
Boston Scientific Corp   BSX  achieved 12  organic growth in emerging markets in the first quarter of 2017  driven by 20  growth in China 
Key Picks from the Space
Among the medical product stocks  Bio Rad Laboratories  Inc   BIO   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   looks attractive  Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   ABT   Baxter International Inc  NYSE BAX    BAX  and Phibro Animal Health Corp   PAHC  are also well poised with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

15653,237168,VAR,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Varian Medical Systems  Inogen  Edwards Lifesciences  Orthofix International And INSYS Therapeutics,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   July 07  2017  Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  MedTech  Part 1  including Varian Medical Systems  NYSE VAR   Inc   NYSE         Inogen  Inc   NASDAQ         Edwards Lifesciences Corp   NYSE         Orthofix International N V   NASDAQ        and INSYS Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ        

	Industry  MedTech  Part 1

	Link  

	There is plenty of uncertainty about the final shape of the Trump administration s Obamacare  repeal   replace  effort through Congress  But the overall expectation is that the legislative change will result in lower taxes and regulation for the industry as a whole 

	To that end  the industry is looking forward to an end to the 2 3  medical device tax  Also  there is a big possibility that the Medical Device fraternity will be exempt from the highly unpopular Cadillac tax  40  excise tax on high cost healthcare plans  

	According to MedTech majors  the abolition of these taxes would directly address issues like lack of opportunity for research and development  innovation  pipeline development and increase investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products  This will also help in boosting job creation and improving quality of patient care 

	However  the latest revelation by some moderate senators to  keep some of its taxes   is once again creating quite a stir in the medical device space  Also  the Trump administration has proposed to raise the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  user fee for medical device in 2018  The U S  medical device industry mostly consists of small manufacturers that would be substantially affected by higher FDA fees 

Boon or Bane for the Medical Device Community 

	Overall  there is a mixed sentiment in the medical device community  The medical device trade association AdvaMed is one of the few that is in favor of the replacement policy  According to AdvaMed  the entire MedTech fraternity is looking forward to new policymakers  who will be working on improving the FDA regulatory process  repeal of the medical device tax  and ensuring that the coverage process gives patients access to the latest innovations 

	However  data from CBS discussed above is a dampener  While the White House and Capitol Hill responded to the forecast as  just absurd   they have yet to justify their stance  This apart  a shrinking customer base indicates an impending slash in the demand for expensive medical procedures and devices  Economists worldwide are divided on this proposal  If it materializes  a major supply demand disequilibrium within the medical device niche may be created 

Zacks Industry Rank 

	Within the Zacks Industry classification  Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level         and   

	We rank all the 250 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each  To learn more visit    

	The Zacks Industry Rank is  178  bottom 30  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries  for Medical   Instruments   112  top 44   for Medical   Products   99  top 39   for Medical   Dental Supplies   156  bottom 39   for Medical Info Systems  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 

	Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments  it can be said that the outlook for these aforementioned MedTech subsectors is overall unclear

15669,237184,VAR,MedTech Industry Outlook   July 2017,opinion,"There is plenty of uncertainty about the final shape of the Trump administration s Obamacare  repeal   replace  effort through Congress  But the overall expectation is that the legislative change will result in lower taxes and regulation for the industry as a whole 
To that end  the industry is looking forward to an end to the 2 3  medical device tax  Also  there is a big possibility that the Medical Device fraternity will be exempt from the highly unpopular Cadillac tax  40  excise tax on high cost healthcare plans  
According to MedTech majors  the abolition of these taxes would directly address issues like lack of opportunity for research and development  innovation  pipeline development and increase investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products  This will also help in boosting job creation and improving quality of patient care 
However  the latest revelation by some moderate senators to  keep some of its taxes   is once again creating quite a stir in the medical device space  Also  the Trump administration has proposed to raise the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  user fee for medical device in 2018  The U S  medical device industry mostly consists of small manufacturers that would be substantially affected by higher FDA fees 
Boon or Bane for the Medical Device Community 
Overall  there is a mixed sentiment in the medical device community  The medical device trade association AdvaMed is one of the few that is in favor of the replacement policy  According to AdvaMed  the entire MedTech fraternity is looking forward to new policymakers  who will be working on improving the FDA regulatory process  repeal of the medical device tax  and ensuring that the coverage process gives patients access to the latest innovations 
However  data from CBS discussed above is a dampener  While the White House and Capitol Hill responded to the forecast as  just absurd   they have yet to justify their stance  This apart  a shrinking customer base indicates an impending slash in the demand for expensive medical procedures and devices  Economists worldwide are divided on this proposal  If it materializes  a major supply demand disequilibrium within the medical device niche may be created

Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments  it can be said that the outlook for these aforementioned MedTech subsectors is overall unclear

15672,237187,VAR,Varian Medical Systems  VAR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Varian Medical Systems  NYSE VAR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of cancer treatment systems is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 16 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 9  
Revenues are expected to be  779 01 million  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 88  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Varian 
For Varian  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Varian will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Varian would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 06  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Varian doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/varian-medical-systems-var-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200407682,200407682

the forefront  In fact  CEOs of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   AT T  NYSE T  and IBM  NYSE IBM  have urged congressional leaders through a letter to fast track consumer privacy legislation into law  Not just tech  data breaches have wreaked havoc on other sectors  keeping potential investors at bay Healthcare  A Soft Target  NYSE TGT  for Data BreachThe investment world is growing edgy about putting money into the global healthcare industry that has been a major target for hackers and cybercriminals  thanks to the increasing use of wireless  Internet and network connected devices  portable media and electronic health records   EHR    Resultantly  Health Canada s guidance on premarket requirements for medical device cybersecurity was issued in June  Also  Australia s Therapeutics Goods Administration issued its own medical device cyber security guidance for the industry in July The situation within the U S  medical device industry is no different  In May  12 million patients of lab testing giant  Quest Diagnostics   NYSE DGX   faced a data breach  whose Social Security Numbers and medical information were illegally accessed for eight straight months  Earlier  Anthem   NYSE ANTM   was slapped with a penalty of  16 million after a data breach that hit nearly 79 million people  opines that a healthcare data breach costs a hefty  6 5 million on average  In fact  IBM Security s 2019 data breach cost report states that healthcare organizations continue to bear the highest costs associated with data breaches Intervention NecessaryClearly  such massive breaches require the intervention of the apex governing body  the FDA  Let s take a look at the FDA s recent take on maintaining healthcare data safety The agency has been working on combating cyber risks since 2013 with the creation of a  cybersecurity working group   In 2014  it issued a final guidance addressing premarket expectations related to cybersecurity  However  a rapidly evolving healthcare landscape required an updated approach  Hence  in late 2018  the FDA issued a new premarket guidance for cybersecurity management  A final approval is awaited sometime this year Recently  it stressed on strengthening its protocol for deciding when a medical device cybersecurity vulnerability should trigger a warning from regulators Given this backdrop  major healthcare players have started adopting cybersecurity methods to protect valuable patient data Let s take a look at a few stocks which investors might be interested in given their efforts to significantly enhance the cybersecurity of their

2017  Cerner became the member of the National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center to combat cybersecurity issues  Notably  this has helped the company identify  disrupt and prevent malicious attacks on its healthcare data  In fact  Cerner is able to receive and share threat data across the global health sector  Also  the company s Cybersecurity Risk Assessment program provides a foundation on which organizations can build a customized and effective security regime Over the past year  the stock has rallied 4  against the  s 14 7  fall Investors might also keep an eye on Varian Medical Systems  Inc    NYSE VAR    The California based radiation Oncology giant provides radiotherapy  radiosurgery  proton therapy and brachytherapy solutions for treating cancer A few years back

15711,237226,VAR,Are Banks Safe  Risk Weighting  Regulatory Arbitrage And More,opinion,During the global financial crisis  people in the United States  Ireland  Iceland  and many other countries learned that undercapitalized banks can spell trouble for the whole economy  The Basel II rules that were supposed to prevent widespread bank failures proved inadequate  In response to the crisis  the world s central bankers and bank regulators started work on a new set of rules  Basel III  that they have promised will make us safer Now Basel III has reached the crucial phase of writing the technical rules to implement the agreed principles  Many observers are worried that each round of rule making will provide an opportunity for watering down the regulations until what is left is no more effective than Basel II was  This post looks at one key aspect of the new rules  the regulation of bank capital  as an illustration of the broader difficulties facing the effort to regulate banking risk more effectively Why regulate capital The single most important measure of banking risk is the ratio of capital to assets  Conceptually  calculating such a ratio is a simple enough  You start by adding up a bank s assets  including all of its cash  the loans it has made  securities it owns  its office equipment and its buildings  Next you add up its liabilities  including deposits  interbank borrowing  bonds it has issued  and the rest  You subtract the liabilities from the assets and the difference is capital  which represents the shareholders  stake in the bank The smaller the ratio of capital to assets  the greater the bank s leverage  Increasing leverage concentrates the bank s profits on a smaller base  thereby increasing shareholders  return on equity  At the same time it exposes shareholders to greater risk  The greater the leverage  the smaller the loss of asset value required to reduce capital to zero or below  When the bank s capital hits zero  it becomes insolvent  Normally an insolvent bank would have to cease operation and its shareholders would lose their entire investment In an ideal world  the government would not have to regulate leverage or capital  We could leave the implied tradeoff between risk and return to the discretion of shareholders  In the real world  however  things are not so simple  Several considerations bias banks toward greater leverage and greater risk than may be desirable from the point of view of public policy First  insolvent banks are not  in practice  always forced out of business  nor are their shareholders necessarily wiped out  Yes  that sometimes does happen to small banks  but shareholders of the banks that really count the ones that are too big to fail can expect the government to step in and protect them  at least partially  in case of insolvency  Not only shareholders but also unsecured creditors and other counterparties of banks can expect to be shielded from the consequences of insolvency  Protection from the consequences of failure increases one s appetite for risk  Economists call that the problem of moral hazard Second  even if shareholders did have to worry about being wiped out by insolvency  they are not the ones who make day to day decisions about risks  The real risk takers  from CEOs to individual traders  may be worried less about the long run solvency of the institution than about their own short run bonuses and golden parachutes  They can end up faring much better than shareholders even if their bank fails  Economists call the resulting misalignment of incentives between executives and shareholders the agency problem Finally  neither a bank s officers nor its shareholders may be much concerned about the damage to the economy at large that bank failures can cause  Economists refer to the impact of Wall Street failures on Main Street s innocent bystanders as the problem of contagion  Contagion  like moral hazard  is a bigger worry when there are a few very large banks than where there are many small ones Concerns about moral hazard  agency problems  and contagion provide the motivation to regulate bank capital Which measure of capital In order to regulate bank capital  it first must be measured  The example given above makes that sound easy add up assets  subtract liabilities  and you get capital  In the real world  things are not so straightforward  The closest we come in practice to the simple concept of capital is a measure called tangible common equity or TCE Many economists like the ratio of TCE to tangible assets as a regulatory tool  but banks tend to find it too restrictive  Basel II rules were instead based on a concept of regulatory capital that  in two respects  was both more complex and more lenient toward banks than TCE First  the numerator of the regulatory capital ratio was broader than tangible common equity because it included not just tangible assets like securities  but also intangible assets like goodwill and tax losses carried forward  It also counted certain hybrid capital items  such as preferred stock  along with common stock  Hybrid capital combines some properties of equity capital with some properties of debt  It does not always provide as strong a safeguard against insolvency as pure common equity Second  the denominator of the Basel II regulatory capital ratio consisted of risk weighted assets rather than total assets  The idea behind risk weighting is that the probability of loss on some assets is greater than on others  For example  a mortgage loan secured by real estate might have only half the default risk of an unsecured loan to an industrial corporation  Suppose a bank has  100 million in loans of each type  giving it total assets of  200 million  Under risk weighting  the unsecured corporate loan would be counted at full value  but the mortgage loan would be assigned a weight of 0 5  so that the bank s risk weighted assets would be  100    0 5 X  100     150 million One of the major criticisms of Basel II was that regulatory capital ratios made banks look strong when in fact  they were weak in terms of their ability to withstand adverse market conditions  as measured by TCE  The following chart  based on IMF data  shows that at the time of the global financial crisis in 2008  the gap between regulatory capital and TCE was very wide  especially for banks in the United States  the UK  and the euro area The Basel III negotiations took many of the criticisms of regulatory capital to heart  The new regulations tighten up significantly on the treatment of intangible assets and hybrid capital  so that the numerator of the regulatory capital ratio is now much closer to TCE than it was under Basel II  However  the denominator  risk weighted capital  turns out to pose greater problems A closer look at risk weighted capitalThe concept behind risk weighting is a sound one  but the devil is in the details of how to assign the weights  Over time  the Basel process has tried three approaches The first  used in Basel I  assigned each asset to one of four broad categories  Loans to consumers and nonfinancial corporations had a weight of 1 0  mortgage loans a weight of 0 5  loans to financial institutions in OECD countries a weight of 0 2  and loans to sovereign governments a weight of 0  That approach failed for two reasons  One was that the weights themselves were unrealistic loans to financial institutions and sovereign governments turned out to be far riskier than the Basel I weights implied  Another problem was that banks increased their overall exposure to risk while reducing their risk weighted assets by selectively loading up on relatively risky assets within each category  Gaming the risk weightings in that way has come to be known as regulatory arbitrage The second approach  tried under Basel II  was to base risk weights on the ratings that credit rating agencies assign to various assets  For example  a security with a BBB rating from Standard   Poor s was giving a risk weight of 1 0  one with an A rating had a weight of 0 5  and one with a AAA rating had a weight of 0 2  That approach also failed  As we now know  many of the ratings issued by credit rating agencies on the eve of the financial crisis were unrealistically generous  It appears that the use of ratings for regulatory purposes made matters worse because it created pressures on agencies to purposely overrate certain securities in order to facilitate regulatory arbitrage by banks The third approach  first tried under Basel II and continued under Basel III  was to base risk weighted capital not on the work of credit rating agencies  but on the mathematical models that banks themselves use for their internal risk management  The idea was that instead of assigning risk weights directly  regulators would examine the banks  own risk models and either certify them as accurate or  if not  require changes Controversies over risk weighting under Basel IIIThe regulatory use of banks  internal risk modeling lies at the heart of today s controversies over the measurement of bank capital  The risk models are complex and are subject to a number of conceptual difficulties  For example  most such models make use of a technique called Value at Risk  VaR   which attempts to estimate the size of the bank s loss for a given probability threshold over a given number of normal trading days The reliability of VaR has been criticized on several grounds  For one thing  VaR violates the principle of subadditivity  which means  roughly speaking  that the risk estimates for two assets held together in a portfolio may not be properly predicted by combining separately estimated risks for the two  Furthermore  for regulatory purposes  VaR suffers the more fundamental flaw that it focuses on the probability of losses under normal trading conditions  whereas regulators are more interested in  tail risk   that is  the maximum losses that may occur under the abnormal conditions of a financial crisis A recent report from the Bank of England uses the following terms to expresses concerns about estimates of risk weighted assets based on banks  internal models There is increasing doubt among investors over the robustness of these estimates due to their complexity and opacity  Investors find risk weight calculations particularly difficult to scrutinise and appear to be losing confidence in the accuracy of risk weighted assets  RWAs  as a result The report illustrates the loss of confidence with the following chart Differences in the methods used to assign risk weights affect the ratio of a bank s risk weighted assets to its total assets  that is  its RWA density  The lower a bank s RWA density  the less capital it is required to hold against a portfolio of assets of a given value  As the following chart from an IMF working paper shows  RWA density varies substantially from one region of the world to another and has been trending down over time in all regions Charts like this one and reports that some banks have set explicit targets for reducing RWA density have raised suspicions that banks are using their internal risk modeling to game the regulations in a way that lets them reduce the total capital they are required to hold  Doing so would increase their risk of insolvency  but would also increase their return on equity as long as they remain solvent  and at the same time  could increase the bonuses of bank executives  However  trends and targets for RWA density are not by themselves conclusive Although the lower RWA densities could be evidence of regulatory arbitrage  there are also other possible explanations  Some of the variations can be attributed to differences from one jurisdiction to another in the way Basel regulations are implemented  Also  lower RWA densities by countries and over time could be explained by differences in the composition of bank portfolios One way to isolate the effects of modeling from other differences is to ask banks to run standardized portfolios through their models to see what kind of risk estimates they come up with  The results of such exercises are not encouraging  For example  a report released in February by the Bank for International Settlements found that different banks  assessments of the amount of capital required to support a test portfolio varied by more than two to one  Another such study  cited in the Bank of England report  found variations of as much as seven to one between the most prudent and most aggressive banks  evaluations of a test portfolio of government securities The bottom lineSo what is the bottom line  Will Basel III regulations  when finally implemented  make banks safe enough  Even though the process is not complete  there are increasing reasons to doubt that it will  The very complexity and opacity of model based risk weighting is a big part of the problem  As rule making moves deeper into the technical details  banks will have many opportunities to make regulations more lenient  right up to the last equation in the last subparagraph of the final regulations Can anything be done  Some observers  including Andrew Haldane  Executive Director for Financial Stability at the Bank of England  think that complexity itself is the problem  In a paper presented at the Fed s Jackson Hole conference last summer  he compared tackling complex banking through complex regulation to fighting fire with fire  He sees simple ratios like TCE as both more transparent and more effective as tools of regulation Even Haldane s call for simpler and more forceful regulation of risk taking suffers from the objection that it attempts to force banks  against their will  to behave more prudently  Instead  we should be directly attacking the flaws in the system the problems of moral hazard  agency  and contagion that encourage banks to behave recklessly in the first place  A few such efforts are already underway  For example  regulators in the United States are trying to force banks to write  living wills   The idea is that the wills would reduce contagion effects by making it easier to wind up insolvent banks in an orderly fashion during a future crisis  Another approach  which both the EU and Switzerland are in the process of implementing  is to attack the agency problem by limiting excessive bonuses and other compensation devices that drive a wedge between the interests of bank executives and their shareholders Even those measures may turn out just to be more fingers in the dyke  It may be time to consider tackling the too big to fail problem head on by breaking up the largest banks into smaller institutions  Meanwhile  even the moderate measures incorporated in Basel III are not scheduled for full implementation for another six years yet  Will we manage to go that long without another global crisis ,2013-03-08,Ed

15713,237228,VAR,4 Medical Instrument Stocks To Bet On This Earnings Season,opinion,"With the Q2 earning season heating up  analysts are once again in distress with the sluggish performance so far from 103 S P 500 members  representing 25 8  of the index s total market capitalization  as per the latest  report 
However  with nearly 80  of the medical device majors set to report their performance over the next two weeks  we have some good predictions for investors keen on the space  As per the report  Medical is one of the 7 broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors which are expected to report earnings growth  The sector is expected to deliver 1 7  earnings growth on 7 7  higher revenues in the second quarter 
While global economic uncertainties are continuing to hit the economy hard  leaving the conventional heavyweights like Finance  Tech or oil energy in a position to pull the industry wide average expectation down  the expected so called positive second quarter performance by the broader Medical sector is something investors  would like to cheer about Beaming Medical Instrument Space
Medical instrument  a niche area under the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector holds a lot of promise at this moment  This comes as no surprise  even in the face of severe economic instability  fierce competition  and increasing cost related hazards springing from regulatory complexities  This is because the medical instrument industry continues to remain healthy on successful execution of some top strategic priorities  which include R D and product development  strategic M A and alliances and focus on emerging market expansion 
A recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview claims that this space within medical device is positioned for impressive growth in the near term  At a glance  medical device sales worldwide are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1  to  477 5 billion by 2020 
Factors like the recent exemption of the Medical Device Excise tax for the next two years have come in as a much needed breather for these medical instrument stocks  We believe this exemption  albeit temporary  has infused a positive sentiment in the medical device investment world  as most analysts believe it to be adequate for companies to address pressing issues such as a lack of opportunity for R D  innovation  pipeline development  and to make investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products 
Apart from these catalysts  other remarkable breakthroughs include information technology  utilization of smart devices  cloud connectivity and personalized medicine  The IT revolution has literally reshaped MedTech  not least the medical instrument subsector  Technology has brought hope for millions suffering from debilitating conditions Making the Right Choice
With a wide number of stocks in the medical instrument space that almost always muddle up one s stock picking abilities  the Zacks methodology could offer some respite  One can narrow down the choices by focusing on stocks that have the desirable combination of a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold

15728,237243,VAR,Stocks Aim To Break Out From Summer Trading Channel,opinion,U S  equities continue to shrug off worrisome global economics and the doomsday prognostications  The Dow  S P 500  and Nasdaq are now all above psychological resistance levels of 13 000  1400  and 3 000  respectively  Even Europe and China have seen a sustained bounce in equities  But everyone is wondering  how long can this continue given the dicey global economic situation Right now the large cap S P 500 indicates an earnings yield of over 7   which reflects a historically high risk premium when compared to the 10 year Treasury yield and an average dividend yield of approximately 2 2   This could be shaping up to be a historic buying opportunity So  if Europe can stave off a sovereign debt and banking system catastrophe  we should continue to see capital flow into equities  even if in fits and starts   particularly U S  stocks  In fact  the late July rally led by defensive sectors like Utilities  Consumer Staples  and Healthcare  rather than a fearful flight to safety and a bearish development  actually might be simply an early stage flight to higher income dividend payers Besides the ongoing uncertainty in Europe  lack of jobs growth continues to weigh heavily on investor psyches  The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures unemployment in a variety of ways  and their metrics are designated U1 through U6  U3 is the official unemployment rate that gets widely reported  which is the proportion of the civilian labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment  However  U6 is a bigger picture view that adds in  discouraged workers   who have given up on finding work   plus  marginally attached workers   who are able to work but have not been looking recently   plus part time workers who would prefer to be employed full time U3 is now at 8 3   as we all know  It was around 4  at the beginning of the century  U6 for July came in at 15 0   which is also up trending slightly from April s 14 5   It was around 7  at the start of the century  U6 is probably more reflective of the average American s perception  The highest recent U6 reading was in October 2009 at 17 2  Looking at the SPY chart  it closed Wednesday at 140 49 and has been trading since mid May within a very clear bullish rising channel  It is now dealing with technical resistance from the convergence of the top of the rising channel and the May 1 closing high near 141  Next resistance  if it can continue to climb  is just above at the 52 week high from early April around 142  The 50 day simple moving average has turned up  and price sits comfortably above the 20   50   100   and 200 day SMAs  If it can t break out here through the top of the rising channel  it might cycle back down towards the bottom of the channel for a sixth time The SPY chart looks just about as bullish as it can be given the global economic environment  It just needs more volume The VIX  CBOE Market Volatility Index a k a   fear gauge   has fallen precipitously since last week  closing Wednesday at 15 32  It is well below the important 20 level and seems ready to make a push through 15 to challenge the April lows  No investor fear is displayed here Despite recent market strength  Sabrient subsidiary Gradient Analytics  which produces in depth forensic accounting research  has seen several of its negatively rated stocks fall recently  including Ritchie Bros  RBA   comScore  SCOR   FARO Technologies  FARO   ViaSat  VSAT   Innophos Holdings  IPHS   and Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF   Others that fell during the past month include  Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG   Power Integrations  POWI   International Rectifier  IRF   Mead Johnson Nutrition  MJN   Alere  ALR   Woodward  WWD   Varian Medical Systems  VAR   Cepheid  CPHD   Gentex  GNTX   Wipro  WIT   and Netflix  NFLX   Among the firm s relatively few positively rated stocks  Six Flags Entertainment  SIX   TempurPedic  TPX   KeyCorp  KEY   Dish Network  DISH   Emerson Electric  EMR   and City National  CYN  have performed well  Apparently it really does pay to scrutinize the quality of a company s reported earnings and what the insiders are doing with their options incentives Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Observations  1  Financial  IYF  retains the top spot with an Outlook score of 77  primarily due to ongoing support among analysts  who have not been revising earnings downward to stocks within IYF like they have been to the other economically sensitive sectors  Technology  IYW  holds the second spot with a 74  Stocks within IYW are displaying relatively low forward P Es  strong projected long term growth  and solid return ratios   2  Healthcare  IYH  remains a solid third with an Outlook score of 70  but then we are seeing a 22 point gap down to Consumer Goods  IYK  at 48  Only IYF  IYW  and IYH are scoring above the 50 mid point level  whereas last week six of the ten sectors were scoring 50 or higher  I think this reflects a cautious tone among analysts  particularly given recent market strength and the slow growth economy   3  Telecom  IYZ  stays at the bottom of the Outlook rankings this week with an Outlook score of 17  It retains surprisingly good support from Wall Street and reasonably good growth projections  but stocks within IYZ are held back by the highest forward P E and the worst return ratios  Basic Materials  IYM  continues to be hampered by cuts in Wall Street s earnings estimates   4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 63  Utilities  IDU  is still by far the weakest on strong days  scoring 38  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged   5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  remains the strong investor favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 64  Materials  IYM  has been abandoned  relatively speaking  by investors during market weakness  as reflected by its low Bear score of 40  followed by Energy  IYE  at 42  In other words  Materials stocks have tended to sell off the most when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best   6  Overall  Financial  IYF  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 181  Telecom  IYZ  is the worst at 122  As for Bull Bear combination  Materials  IYM  is the worst at 96  while Telecom  IYZ  and Energy  IYE  tie for the best with 105   These scores represent the view that the Financial and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued  based on our 1 3 month forward look   Top ranked stocks within Financial and Technology sectors include First Merchants Corp  FRME   Texas Capital Bancshares  TCBI   Ellie Mae Inc   ELLI   and Blucora Inc   BCOR

15729,237244,VAR,Ahead Of Thursday s Retail Sales Report,opinion,Will tomorrow s retail sales update for November bring pain or pleasure for the increasingly delicate and high stakes art science of deciding where the business cycle s headed  October s report was somewhat sobering  thanks to a 0 3  drop in consumption    the first since June  Some of the weakness was blamed on Hurricane Sandy  If so  will November s numbers bounce back after a month of relatively clear skies  Yes  according to the consensus forecast  which projects a handsome 0 4  rise  according to Briefing com  Sounds good  but that s a bit high relative to a pair of econometric models I routinely us for additional context when considering where the data s headed Numbers CrunchI crunched the numbers in two ways  using vector autoregression  VAR  and autoregressive integrated moving average  ARIMA  models  both of which also show up in my work with modeling the business cycle and nowcasting U S  GDP  As for today s retail sales projections  I m using R software by way of the  forecast  and  vars  packages  These tools optimize the parameters based on the historical data records and so in some degree the resulting projections represent benchmarks for evaluating forecasts from other sources For the VAR projection of retail sales  I ve chosen four data series to search for interdependent relationships  U S  private sector employment  personal consumption expenditures  disposable personal income  and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index  By contrast  the ARIMA projection uses only the historical data for retail sales as the basis for looking ahead  Here s how the two estimates compare for estimating the monthly change for November retail sales  in nominal dollar terms   0 1   VAR  0 2   ARIMA Averaging the two forecasts gives us a  0 1  estimate  Keep in mind that the confidence intervals for each of these point forecasts is  as usual  wide enough to keep us humble for thinking that the future is clear enough to put a high degree of confidence in one number  The potential for fairly large negative or positive surprises  econometrically speaking  remains substantial Temper Your HopesNonetheless  my take on the these two forecasts is that we should be a bit more cautious in expecting a strong rise in tomorrow s report compared with the consensus outlook  November is likely to show a modest rebound from October  but I m not expecting a large upside surprise ,2012-12-12,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ahead-of-thursday's-retail-sales-report-147275,147275
15731,237246,VAR,Good News And Earnings Propel Stocks As Fear Abates,opinion,Earnings season is in full swing  and on balance  investors are liking what they hear  Tech leaders Google  GOOG  and IBM  IBM  got bought in truckloads after their fine earnings reports  although Apple  AAPL  disappointed after the close on Wednesday  By and large  earnings reports have been positive  including diverse companies like duPont  DD   Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Verizon  VZ   and Intuitive Surgical  ISRG   You ll recall that I mentioned GOOG and ISRG two weeks ago as top picks within Tech and Healthcare  and they both came through with flying colors Besides record corporate earnings and rising revenues and forward guidance  the good news includes fewer jobless claims  surging housing starts  and modest inflation  Combine this with reasonable stock valuations  high levels of corporate cash  bullish technical conditions  including a  Dow Theory  buy signal from both the Dow Industrials and the Dow Jones Transportation Indexes   and still reluctant retail investors  who are starting to be lured back in   Also  the House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday to raise the debt ceiling to whatever borrowing is required until May 19  which not surprisingly gave the market a jolt of confidence Not to be ignored  of course  is the Fed continuing to print QE3 money into a zero interest rate environment  And because the banks are still mostly reluctant to lend it  much of that cheap liquidity continues to find its way into equities The S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 149 37  Bulls made short work of that tough band of resistance between 146 and 148  The 50 day simple moving average is about to cross up bullishly through the 100 day SMA  However  oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic have become extremely overbought as bulls refuse to give up much ground I have drawn a possible line of uptrend support starting from the intraday low that filled and tested the morning gap up on November 19  Thanksgiving week   SPY was only temporarily violated in the final few days of 2012 when the fiscal cliff was still in doubt  but quickly recovered after the deal was done  Perhaps Apple s disappointing quarterly report will give investors a reason to finally allow a pullback to retest support levels  starting with the convergence of the uptrend line and prior resistance turned support at 148  followed by 146  the New Year s gap from 142  and finally the 200 day SMA around 140  However  I really don t expect a correction to fall that far or last very long Notably  the equal weighted S P 500  RSP  is already well above its all time high  as is the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index  Now people are actually talking about a new secular bull market taking shape  rather than just another cyclical move The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 12 46 and remains right near its 52 week low  The mixed message remains that fear is low  or conversely  complacency is high   which has been bullish for stocks  although an overdue bounce perhaps on the heels of the Apple news would send stocks lower I suggested in mid December that it might be worthwhile to buy some February call options on a market index as a lottery ticket for a bullish surge after a budget deal is inked  I took my own advice as the year came near its close and bought calls on the SPY  I sold half after the fiscal cliff was averted  just to get my original investment back  while letting the balance of the position ride  On Wednesday this week  I closed another quarter position ahead of Apple s earnings and given the extremely overbought technicals  but I m holding the remaining quarter position to see if the S P 500 can make it to 1500  and beyond  before expiration Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Healthcare  IYH  again holds the top spot with a score of 76  while Technology  IYW  takes sole possession of second with an Outlook score of 71  IYH shows relatively good support among Wall Street analysts and solid return ratios  while Technology  IYW  shows strong projected growth and a low forward P E  as well as solid return ratios  Notably  Financial  IYF  took a 25 point jump this week to third place  largely due to a big improvement in Wall Street analyst sentiment 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 8  and is again joined in the bottom two this week by Consumer Services  IYC  with an 18  Stocks within IYZ appear overvalued from the standpoint of the forward P E and lack analyst support 3  Overall  this week s rankings are looking a tiny bit more bullish  given the rise in Financials this week and the fact that six of the sectors are scoring above 50  and Industrial is close at 49   However  the high scores for defensive sectors Healthcare and Consumer Goods  combined with the low score for Consumer Services  tempers the bullishness of the Outlook rankings somewhat 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the leader on strong market days  scoring 58  while Consumer Goods  IYK  is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 46  This is only a 12 point range from top to bottom  which indicates high correlation  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Consumer Goods stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  none of the sectors are scoring very high  In fact  none score above 50  Utilities  IDU  is normally the favorite safe haven on weak market days  but it s only scoring 45  which indicates that most everything has been selling off roughly equally during recent market weakness  Amazingly  Basic Materials  IYM   which is normally among the worst on weak days  is scoring the highest at 49  Energy  IYE  is the worst during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 37  but there s still only a 12 point range from top to bottom  Thus  Energy stocks have been selling off the most when the market is pulling back  while Materials stocks have held up the best  relatively speaking 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 168  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 105  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare  IYH   although displaying the best Outlook score  doesn t look very good at all with a total score of only 92  Consumer Goods  IYK  is the lowest at 90  Basic Materials  IYM  has the best score at 103 These scores represent the view that the Healthcare and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Consumer Services sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYH and IYW include Varian Medical Systems  VAR   The Cooper Companies  COO   F5 Networks  FFIV   and VMware  VMW  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods   Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions   Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors   About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias   However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the

15741,237256,VAR,5 Excellent GARP Picks Based On Discounted PEG,opinion,With smart investment being the buzzword in today s investment world  millennials are more inclined toward hybrid investment patterns rather than traditional pure play theories like value or growth The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy as value or growth investing approaches come with their own share of pitfalls  A pure play value investor misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  The same way  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks  In other words  to make a long term investment more effective  the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP  growth at a reasonable price  approach  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  One of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is price earnings growth ratio  PEG   Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates a stock s P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV    North Chicago  IL based AbbVie is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and marketing of treatments for complex and serious ailments  The company has a presence in the rheumatoid arthritis  cancer  psoriasis  Crohn s disease  HIV  hepatitis C virus  HCV

quarter  Our worldwide net installed base of 8 561 units grew 363 units or 4   This continued growth in our installed base drives future recurring revenue from upgrades  software and services  In Africa  we continue to expand access to quality cancer care with the installation of three Halcyon systems at the Centre National d Oncologie in Mauritania  Centre Hospitalier Nganda in Congo and the Lagos Teaching University Hospital in Nigeria On the software front  revenues grew 13  driven by continued adoption of our software solutions to remain focused on investing in innovation around the efficient clinical workflow  systems integration and treatment planning quality to help close the current resource and skills gap around the globe  Orders for HyperArc  our high definition radiotherapy solution for stereotactic radiosurgery brain metastases grew double digits in the quarter  With less than 14  penetration  this continues to be a sizable opportunity across our TrueBeam installed base  Our services revenues grew 22  in the quarter  including the benefit from CTSI in a 14 week quarter  Excluding these benefits services revenue grew 8   CTSI which is integrated into our Oncology Systems business continues to perform in line with our expectations  We re investing in infrastructure for new technology enabled services to drive mature market productivity and accelerate emerging market adoption In our Proton Solutions business  we took one new order in the quarter  Our pipeline in the Proton business remains strong and we continue to gain global market share with customer interest driven by our smaller footprint ProBeam 360 and the preclinical research we are doing with the FlashForward Consortium  As highlighted in our fourth quarter earnings call in October  we were selected by Penn Medicine to install an additional ProBeam 360 System in a single room configuration at the Lancaster General Health Ann B  Barshinger Cancer Institute  The center is expected to treat its first patient in 2021  Subsequent to the end of the quarter  we were selected by China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan to install a ProBeam 360 System in a single room configuration with the ability to add a second gantry  The center will also use our ARIA information management system and Eclipse treatment planning system and is scheduled for completion in 2024  We have 78 proton rooms under contract across 26 sites globally  38 rooms are operational including one room that was handed over to clinical operations this quarter  In November  the South Florida Proton Therapy Institute or SFPTI on the campus of Delray Medical Center treated its first patient on our ProBeam compact single room system  SFPTI is now treating more than 30 patients per day  making it the fastest ramp of patient treatments per gantry in the world Turning our attention to FLASH  preclinical research and product development is progressing per plan and we are encouraged by the results we continue to see from the FlashForward Consortium efforts  As our global ProBeam footprint continues to expand  the FlashForward Consortium now has representation from all geographies enabling future research across different regional populations Second  let s turn to our progress in leveraging artificial intelligence  machine learning and cloud solutions  Since the launch of the artificial intelligence powered Ethos Therapy System in September of 2019  reception and excitement for the platform has been extremely strong  During the quarter  we received three orders for Ethos  Two of the orders were from Australia  including a second order from the Icon Group and one order from Israel  Ethos is CE marked and 510 K  pending in the U S  treatments at our first clinical site at Herlev Hospital  Denmark continue to progress well  While initial focus has been on bladder cancer  the team is preparing to start adaptive therapy for new disease sites in the pelvis  Additionally our second center  Medisch Spectrum 20 in Netherlands went live in December and our third and fourth installations are under way in Australia at the Icon Group Center in Wahroonga and Royal North Shore Hospital respectively  Install time has been about two weeks at the initial sites and we expect the number of installs to increase in the second half Our Adaptive Intelligence Consortium efforts are on track for both clinical and technical publications throughout 2020  We expect to see significant publications on several disease sites  Early evaluation results show that full adaptive sessions are practical in a typical 15 minute treatment time slot  In Europe  in 2019  we launched RapidPlan PT  our individualized machine learning treatment planning software for proton therapy and plan to expand the offering in other regions in the future  Consistent with RapidPlan for conventional radiotherapy  RapidPlan PT reduces the treatment planning time for proton therapy from several hours to approximately 10 minutes without compromising the quality of the plan  This is extraordinary  particularly when you think about the skilled resources gap in proton therapy and creates significant clinical efficiency for our customers Third  let s discuss emerging businesses  geographies and technologies  In November  we established a direct sales and service operation in the Republic of Kenya to better serve the growing cancer population in the country and the East Africa region  Africa continues to be a sizable opportunity for us  given the minimal access to radiation therapy and the estimated 2 1 million new cancer cases diagnosed per year by 2040  Our installed base in Africa has increased approximately 30  over the last two fiscal years We continue to execute and grow our Interventional Solutions business with revenues of  19 million  which are reported under the Other segment  We had solid performance in China and continue to invest in global distribution capacity and our software platform to support this global business  With that  I ll turn it over to Mike  who will discuss our fourth strategic enabler and provide more context on the first quarter financial results J  Michael Bruff    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Dow and hello everyone  Our fourth strategic enabler is improving financial  operational and capital efficiency by maintaining a balanced focus across growth  profitability and liquidity  So let me first start with growth  Companywide revenues were  829 million  up 12  in dollars and 13  in constant currency  Organic revenues grew 8   In Oncology Systems  revenues were  782 million  up 11  in dollars and 12  in constant currency  driven by strong growth in software and services  On a trailing 12 month basis  revenues grew 11  in dollars and 13  in constant currency  Orders were  774 million  up 8  in dollars and 9  in constant currency in both the quarter and the trailing 12 months  Geographic orders mix was 46  in the Americas  31  in EMEA and 23  in APAC  We ended the quarter with  3 1 billion in backlog  up 4  Taking a closer look at our Oncology business results  in the Americas  revenues grew 15  in the geography and in our North America region  orders were  360 million  up 7  on a trailing 12 month basis  orders grew 6  driven by continued market demand for our integrated value based care solutions  In our Europe  Middle East  India and Africa geography  revenues grew 11   Orders were  237 million  up 8  on a trailing 12 month basis  orders grew 11   Asia Pacific revenues grew 5  and orders were  178 million  up 9  led by double digit growth in our China and our Southeast Asia Korea regions partially offset by softness in Japan  On a trailing 12 month basis  orders grew 6  for the Asia Pacific geography  Our Proton Solutions business posted revenues of  28 million  a decline of 28  primarily driven by project mix  Service revenues of  8 million grew 54   During the quarter  we reduced our proton therapy backlog by  19 million  To reflect an Indian customer s decision to cancel the order that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017  no revenue had been recognized on this order Turning to profitability  total company gross margin was  369 million  up 16  and 44 5  of revenues  an increase of 160 basis points  driven by product mix  acquisitions and tariff exclusions  This was partially offset by proton business project mix and the  4 million of updated project costs  Oncology  gross margin of 45 4  of revenues increased 100 basis points  Investing in R D to drive innovation remains core to our long term growth and value creation strategy  We invested  67 million in R D  up 10  which is 8 1  percent of revenue  SG A expenses were  167 million  up 21   which is 20 2  of revenue  Excluding the acquisitions of CTSI  Endocare  Alicon and the Boston Scientific bead portfolio  SG A was up 13   Company operating earnings were  135 million  up 13  which is 16 2  of revenues  up 15 basis points  driven by the gross margin expansion and planned investments to drive future growth  The  4 million updated project costs in the proton business impacted operating earnings in the quarter by 50 basis points  GAAP EPS was  0 96 and non GAAP EPS was  1 16  GAAP and non GAAP tax rates were 21  and diluted share count was 91 7 million shares  This quarter  our GAAP operating earnings and GAAP EPS included an  8 8 million change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of Endocare and Alicon  In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019  GAAP net earnings and GAAP EPS included a  22 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in Augmenix Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity  We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  722 million and  544 million in debt  Certain proceeds from borrowings in the quarter were used to fund U S  operations in the short term  Cash flows from operations were  113 million  down 20  due to investment in working capital to support continued growth  Oncology DSO was flat versus last year at 111 days Other investments in the quarter include  23 million in capex and  46 million used to repurchase shares of our stock  As of the end of the quarter  we had 1 9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization  In summary  we are pleased with the solid operating performance in the first quarter  which delivered double digit growth in both revenues and non GAAP operating earnings  I will now turn it back over to Dow Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mike  Based on the solid operating performance in the first quarter and continued market and product momentum  we re making no changes to the fiscal year 2020 guidance given during the last earnings call  We expect earnings to be weighted toward the back half of the fiscal year as we continue to invest in future growth as considered factors that can influence the business including the strength across the portfolio grow in contribution from software and services  performance variability of the Proton Solutions segment and the mix of mature and emerging markets  Thank you  And now let s go to Q A  operator Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  At this time  we ll be conducting a question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI  Please state your question Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey guys  congrats on a nice quarter here  Thanks for taking my question  Dow  Just on the order front here  really strong  I m just curious  you mentioned China  we ve been hearing a variety of feedback just given Coronavirus  curious how that s going to impact you guys  if at all  And were there any pull forward of China quota of orders in the current Q Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerI ll tell you what  let me    let me start high and then I ll walk down to China  Starting at a high level  you saw the overall 8     9  constant currency growth on the quarter  9  trailing 12 months  the America was 7  on the quarter  trailing constant currency growth is 6   EMEA was still on a constant currency basis  a double digit quarter  11  in the quarter  14  trailing 12 months and APAC was 9  on the quarter  7  trailing 12 months  As it relates to China  I would say we are seeing an uptick in the incremental licenses being released  As you know applications for the remaining Category A licenses ended late December  Category B licenses continue to roll out We    as we said last quarter  we re really kind of starting to see that roll  I think  still  though  the best way to think about this is in the past five years  our revenue CAGR has been 17   if anything  we ve seen that accelerate a little bit  So the market remains very good  We don t guide our China orders  as you know  but funnel looks good and our win rate for public tenders remains high  I think maybe the other thing I d add about China is the strength of our portfolio is very strong and we have three proton orders in China we re executing on in Gary s business  Interventional Solutions  We also have a nice presence in China As it relates to the virus  we re not seeing anything yet  Good news is    our priority is to make sure we re doing everything to protect and support our employees and customers during this time  We haven t seen any impact in either of those situations  At this point  I think from a business perspective  it s too early to call  we re continuing to monitor the impact on our factory and customers surrounding their activity  of course  we re trying to be very responsible local citizen  We ve made a pretty significant contribution to the local Red Cross and like everybody  watching it carefully  Maybe just one other thing I d add on kind of China momentum  the Halcyon product is doing very well in China  we have over 20 orders now  so that s flowing and seeing    it s going to kind of starting to see after all the regulatory wait  starting to see that uptick Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystThat s helpful  Dow  and just maybe one on the margin side  Given the tariff relief  I would have expected growth margins  maybe  perhaps  to come in better  while I understand the comments on the growth investments to support the business  I m just curious on gross margins  If you re seeing anything at all Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerI d say it was    the quarter was right in line with where we were kind of expecting the quarter  I ll turn it over to Mike here and kind of do the walk for you on the    on the margins J  Michael Bruff    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  exactly  Dow  Vijay  thanks for the question  The tariff did have roughly around 70 basis points of impact to our gross margin  That was    that was planned in our guidance based on the events and the exclusions that we got back in Q4  But the real story here on the gross margin expansion is the product and geo mix that s playing into that expansion  We might have had a 160 basis points of expansion at the company level  100 of that was product and geo expansion  So think about the strong software and services growth rates that we had Acquisitions  as we expected  improved the gross margin rates by around 45 bps  And then the unexpected thing that we had in the quarter  which we called out was with the unexpected costs in our proton business  And that impacted around 60 basis points on gross margin perspective  but on the operating margin  it impacted about 50 basis points  But what I d like to say about that is  while it was not expected in the quarter  it was something that the team identified early in the quarter  We got our heads around it  It was isolated to a project and some very specific retrofit costs  It triggered a review of all the other projects that we have in process  And at the end of the day  after that deep dive  the  4 million cost  we believe  is well within our tolerance range on the year  and again I ll just kind of go back to our topline and bottom line growth rates  We are set up in a very good position to achieve our full year commitments Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks guys OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies  Please state your question Anthony Petrone    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  and good afternoon  Also  congrats on the strong orders here  Maybe just to dig a little bit deeper into China  at Analyst Day  Dow  the company announced that there was 40 MOUs covering 70 linacs and so I m just wondering here in the quarter  if there was any activity out of those specific orders  And then a follow up there also would be the distinction between Class A and Class B  it sounds like certainly Class A is moving along  but an update on Class B licenses and where that sits would be helpful as well  And then I ll have one follow up  Thanks Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would say  Anthony on the    as it relates to the China Import Expo meeting  most of those MOUs are long term and tend not to be executed for  call it 9 to 12 months kind of periods  So I would    I would say that none of those are in here at this point  We had a very strong quarter in China  so we continue to like very much what we see  we re seeing strong equipment demand across the portfolio  frankly  I highlighted Halcyon  but we re also seeing very good traction on Edge  on TrueBeam and on VitalBeam and believe that when Ethos comes to market  eventually in that market  we ll also have a strong position there  So the portfolio is well set up  As it kind of relates to each contract and whether it was    whether it was part of that quota or not  what I can tell you is the best way we track it is  it was a strong double digit growth on a tough comp  We were also a strong double digit growth last year and that s probably the best way to to characterize it Anthony Petrone    Jefferies    AnalystFair enough  And the follow up would be just on over to the U S   just any updates from the company s view on the bundle where it sits  It seems like there s just a range of expectations in terms of timing  So maybe with the latest stage in terms of discussions with CMS and where the final rule is in timing there  Thanks Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou know  as you know  given the original time timeline  CMS has clearly been delayed  There were significant comments from customers  from the providers  from the clinical community  from the vendor community  likely led to a delay in issuing the final ruling  There s no definite guidance on timing  I ve seen some of the ranges that are out there  I think that it s going to be some time in 2020 and it s not going to be delayed to 2022 as some time is out there  I think that as we re really thinking about it  clearly  the portfolio we ve been designing to a value based world for many years  So I think the portfolio was well set up for the transition and with the CTSI acquisition  we are particularly excited about having a technology enabled services play as we believe customers will look to more outsourcing of all kinds of activities and we ll be well set up for that growth  So we re seeing both in the quarter  As I mentioned a minute ago  our total Americas trailing 12 is 6  and on the quarter  it was 7   So we re not seeing it impact the order rate at this point in time  not seeing any acceleration of cancellations or anything else that would cause us to worry  And in fact  then when you look at the way the backlog is flowing  the Americas revenue number  as we said in the script was up 15  in the quarter  So we re seeing a nice flow in the geography Anthony Petrone    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  all right  Thanks  again  I ll hop in queue OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS  Please state your question Matt Taylor    UBS    AnalystHi  thank you for taking the question  The first one I wanted to ask about was Ethos and Ethos  timing  Can you give us any update on when you would expect to get approval for that in the U S   And then just on the orders in the quarter  you had three  I think you had really strong orders out of the gate last quarter  Can you talk about what the funnel looks like there and if you think you will see a step up in the coming period Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Sure  Matt  Thank you  We were very pleased with the early orders in Q4  as you know  got out of the gate late in Q4  launched in  basically  September of Q4  Between Q4 and Q1  we ve taken out 20 orders  frankly when we    when we look at the ramp versus Halcyon  kind of right on  So that s    that looks pretty good  The orders are a little lumpy and maybe a little bit of pent up demand or waiting for regulatory approval last quarter  We do not have  as I said in the script  we do not have yet U S  regulatory approval  We expect that 510 K  this quarter and also in the next 30 to 60 days we should have it  Customer feedback remains outstanding and frankly  one of the things that we really like is how it positions across our portfolio and gives us again something in the high end of the product mix from a pricing and margin rate point of view  So  it s still early  We do expect 510 k  approval in this quarter  We do think that this shift to adaptive radiotherapy is on the order of the kind of shifts we saw with IMRT and IGRT  So we re    at this point  I d say we ve seen nothing that discourages us from that and we re bullish about Ethos Matt Taylor    UBS    AnalystThanks  So just a follow up on    I just would love to hear more about how you re positioning in the market  are you kind of putting it up head to head with MRI  are you positioning it differently and what are some of the things that customers are telling you about your adaptive approach versus others Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we re getting very  very positive feedback from our customers  I d say they love the quality of the product  they love the multi modality image integration of the product  I d say right at the top of the list  They love the fact that our workflow is superior to everything else out there  As I mentioned in the script  we haven t seen anything yet that we really can t envision in a 15 minute time slot and that s kind of sacred to our customers and sacred to the patients  It leverages all the Halcyon technology for ease of use  I think it s very well positioned for the APM environment that s coming  has an outstanding ROI with that kind of throughput  So I think it s going to win on that basis  We re seeing a lot of people engage with us on the product  a lot of enthusiasm  Clearly  we got to get through the 510 K  in the U S  before we can market and sell it here  But we are  I think  early out of the gate here  We re very much perceived as the AI leader and with our previous introductions with machine learning in RapidPlan  the other technologies that we have on the software side in the market and now Ethos  I think we re very much perceived as the AI leader in the market Matt Taylor    UBS    AnalystGreat  thank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W Baird   Company  Please state your question Jeff Johnson    Robert W Baird   Company     AnalystThank you  Good afternoon  guys  Can you hear me OK Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Jeff J  Michael Bruff    Chief Financial OfficerHey  Jeff Jeff Johnson    Robert W Baird   Company     AnalystHey  Dow  Hey  Mike  Good to be back  So  question for you  I think the only question I have left here is Tata  I don t know that I heard any update there  Just wondering if you saw any tailwinds here in the first quarter from that relationship and anything you can quantify there  high energy  low energy  anything like that  Thanks Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Sure  You know the Tata deal continues to move along  We ve had 17 books since the signature of the agreement  We had two more this past quarter  So that s going to continue to be lumpy  kind of  I think as you look  last three quarters  it s something like 213  something like that  So it s going to bounce around  But the framework for the agreement is for up to 200 systems  We re thrilled for how it s going  RT utilization rate in India is only 15  to 20   We think that this is a great play and  frankly in the long term  kind of combination of this agreement with the position that we have on CTSI for enabling customers to get in to radiation therapy with the services approach we have  we re very encouraged by what we see in India  I d say most of the products sold there is TrueBeam  Jeff  So it s a good mix of product  I d say it s going  kind of  how we expected  We like what we see Jeff Johnson    Robert W Baird   Company     AnalystYeah  understood  All right  That s all I ve got  Thanks guys OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Marie Thibault with BTIG  Please state your question Marie Thibault    BTIG    AnalystHi  thanks so much for taking the questions  And congrats again on moving orders Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Marie J  Michael Bruff    Chief Financial OfficerHey  Marie Marie Thibault    BTIG    AnalystHey  hi  I wanted to ask a quick one that you called out some softness in orders in Japan  Given that s a really important market  I just wanted to hear a little bit about the dynamics going on there Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I d say it s just a normal oscillations  unfortunately of what we ve seen in Japan in the last two or three years  the overall is down a hair  So it s    the service business has been very strong in Japan  equipment is down a little bit  And overall  Japan is dilutive to our APAC growth rate because China is hitting it out of the park  The rest of Southeast Asia  Korea has been very strong and Japan is dilutive to the growth rate  of course  but we have a very strong service business there  We re starting to see a little software activity  we had tough comps in APAC and in Japan  in particular in the first half last year  So we might see a little bit more of this coming  But we ve got a good team there  service business continues to hum  I d say  kind of  no change in our outlook in China  Southeast Asia  Korea  very strong and working hard to kind of build some recovery in Japan Marie Thibault    BTIG    AnalystYeah  it makes sense  Okay and then my other question  you know  kind of  taking a look at my model  the spending on both R D and SG A  I understand the investments you re making there and I know at the Investor Day back in November  you spoke quite a bit about some of the R D projects that are going on like FLASH  I d love to hear a little bit more about the SG A spend that you did this quarter  and it sounds like the second half  some of that should peel off  so I wanted to hear a little bit about the timing of that as well Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  I think the    let me peel this up and I ll have Mike  kind of  take you through the walk  I think the first big piece is  there is a huge piece of it that s acquisition  So between the CTSI and the Interventional Oncology acquisitions that we made last year  you re looking at  13 million of SG A additive to last year  and then  3 million on the    from the extra week on the quarter  And then the rest is kind of balanced between some infrastructure things we re doing  some ongoing investment in our distribution and marketing  and frankly  the kind of annualization of the build that you saw in the last half of last year  Mike  do you want to put any color on that J  Michael Bruff    Chief Financial OfficerI think that s about right  Dow  We said that ex the investments in the acquisitions themselves that SG A is growing at 13   Our revenue is growing at about that rate on a constant currency basis  And so we ve got  excluding the acquisitions  we re scaling at 100  even with all of these investments that we re making  So again the investment is there to drive the growth  but also to support the growth that we re driving in the business and as we play out the rest of the year  we would expect to continue to drive scale in SG A throughout the year and  as we said in our long range plan  over those five years as well  So early days there  but the majority of this lift is acquisition related Marie Thibault    BTIG    AnalystThanks  Perfect sense  Thanks so much OperatorLadies and gentlemen  there are no further questions at this time  I ll turn it back to management for closing remarks  Thank you Dow R  Wilson    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  operator  I am pleased with the strides we ve made in the first quarter  Our focused execution enabled us to deliver solid oncology orders growth and double digit growth in both revenues and non GAAP operating earnings  Looking forward  we ll continue to invest in our strategic enablers and remain committed to innovating and investing in new technologies to drive for the ultimate victory  a world without fear of cancer  Thanks for joining us today Operator Operator

116135,337650,VAR,These 3 Healthcare Stocks Are Dashing Towards a Brighter Future  Says Analyst,opinion,Out of all the kinds of stocks you might invest in  healthcare stocks have been the second best performing class of stocks over the past 50 years  And yet  in 2019  healthcare stocks lagged market averages  actually underperforming the broader S P 500 by nearly 10 full percentage points Will 2020 be the year healthcare bounces back  and resumes trumping the market Maybe yes  maybe no  Given the durability of healthcare s outperformance   a half century of beating the market   it would appear healthcare has a built in advantage over other kinds of stocks  In search of specific healthcare picks that could outperform in the new year  we ve consulted TipRanks  Stock Screener and come up with a trio of picks that Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar believes will outperform in 2020 Baxter International  BAX Deerfield  Illinois based Baxter International had a pretty good year in 2019  ending the year with its shares up 30   Its numbers would have been even better  however  had Baxter not had to announce  in its Q3 report  that it was starting an internal investigation into its accounting for foreign exchange gains   which revelation subtracted 12 5  from its market cap in a matter of weeks The plus side of this news for new investors  of course  is that Baxter s share price pullback has created  a nice entry point  into the stock  says Kumar Baxter s audit  says Kumar   will be resolved in the very near term  and will not have an operational impact  on the company  which the analyst sees growing its earnings 11  this year  And after the audit is over  Kumar sees Baxter growing its revenues in the 5  to 6  range from 2021 through 2025 at least  with  EPS upside  As a result  Kumar upgrades Baxter stock from  in line   i e   hold   to  outperform  rating alongside a  94 price target  which implies nearly 9  upside from today s prices   To watch Kumar s track record  click here And incidentally  this is the conservative position  Across Wall Street  buy ratings have outweighed hold ratings 3 to 1 over the past month  with no sells   and on average  Street analysts are forecasting a price target of  95 29 per share   11  above current prices   See Baxter stock analysis on TipRanks PerkinElmer  PKI Next up is PerkinElmer  a diagnostics and life sciences company based out of Waltham  Massachusetts  Priced at more than 47 times trailing earnings already  PerkinElmer isn t as much of a favorite on the Street  where most analysts see the stock not rising  but falling 2  or 3  over the next 12 months  consensus target   96 33 per share   Regardless  this one is another of Kumar s favorite picks  winning an outperform rating and a  114 price target that sits 15  above today s prices Why does Kumar like it  We think PKI is massively underappreciated by the Street   comments Kumar  who thinks PerkinElmer is being unfairly punished for announcing a revenue guidance cut last year  even as it grew its operating profit margin by triple digits Placing a bet on President Trump s New Year s Eve announcement of a truce in the China trade war  Kumar sees upside to Chinese sales in 2020  and introducing new products that will create  potential upside to EPS  in the new year  Specifically  Kumar predicts that this year investors will see profits more than double at PerkinElmer  to perhaps  4 74 per share  Growth will then moderate into the 12  range  EPS   5 33  in 2021   still better than average growth on the S P 500 And given that this is the second straight buy rating that PerkinElmer stock has received in the past month  it could be that other analysts are also starting to come around to this point of view   See PerkinElmer stock analysis on TipRanks Varian Medical Systems  VAR Last but not least is Varian Medical Systems  a stock that with one notable exception  RBC Capital  has received nothing but  buy  ratings from Wall Street over the entirety of last year Surprise  surprise  Kumar likes this one as well Upgrading Varian to  outperform  with a  164 price target  nearly  20 above what the stock costs today  and about 10  higher than the Street consensus price target of  148 80   Kumar argues that Varian  which sells both medical devices and software products for cancer treatment  is entering a series of new

116138,337653,VAR,What s Behind Varian Medical Systems  Mixed Q1 Results ,news,"Varian Medical Systems  NYSE VAR  has been on a roll over the last five months  with its shares soaring 36   The medical device maker s solid fiscal 2019 fourth quarter results in October helped keep that roll going 
But that momentum was put to the test when Varian announced its fiscal 2020 first quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday  Here are the highlights from the company s Q1 update 

By the numbers
Varian reported first quarter revenue of  829 million  a 12  year over year increase  It also topped the average analysts  revenue estimate of  826 6 million 
The company announced Q1 net income of  88 2 million  or  0 96 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   That was well below the prior year period net income of  103 2 million  or  1 12 per share 
Varian posted non GAAP adjusted earnings in the first quarter of  106 6 million  or  1 16 per share  That was an improvement from the adjusted earnings of  97 3 million  or  1 06  announced in the same quarter last year  However  it fell short of the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate of  1 19 per share 
Behind the numbers
Over 94  of Varian s total revenue comes from its oncology systems segment  which markets radiation therapy systems  Revenue for the segment jumped 11  year over year in the first quarter to  782 million  The company experienced its strongest order growth in China  Southeast Asia  and South Korea but also had strong order growth in the Europe  Middle East  and Africa region 
Varian s proton solutions segment markets the ProBeam Proton Therapy System  Revenue for this segment in Q1 totaled  28 million  a 28  year over year decline  The company said it received one new system order in its fiscal 2020 first quarter 
In addition  Varian lumps its revenue from its interventional solutions and cardiac radioablation businesses into its  other  segment  The company reported revenue of  19 million in Q1 for its other segment  compared with no revenue for the segment in the prior year period 
Despite posting solid revenue growth  Varian s GAAP earnings slipped from the prior year period due to increased spending  The biggest culprit was a 25  year over year jump in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
Looking ahead
Varian continues to expect that revenue for full year 2020 will be between  3 5 billion and  3 6 billion  The company anticipates non GAAP earnings per share will be between  5 30 and  5 45  
Some healthcare stocks could be negatively affected in the coming months by the coronavirus scare that originated in China  Joshua Levine  CEO of one of Varian s top rivals  Accuray  said in his company s quarterly conference call on Tuesday that the coronavirus threat doesn t impact the long term outlook in China  That should be true for Varian as well  However  it s entirely possible that the company could be affected in the short term ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/povp6,2071543

116173,337688,VAR,Trump tariffs force companies to rework supply chains,news,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh CHICAGO  Reuters    From global manufacturers such as Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  to small tech startups  companies are scrambling to rework supply chains built for an era of stable  open trade policy that is now under threat  As U S  President Donald Trump pushes to upend the status quo of global trade  companies that initially took a wait and see stance are starting to take action to shield their businesses from shifting trade policy   On Monday  U S  motorcycle maker Harley warned of higher costs because of retaliatory EU tariffs  and said it would shift production of bikes destined for the European Union out of the United States to factories it has built in India  Brazil and Thailand  The decision of the Milwaukee  Wisconsin based company  which Trump vowed to make great again when he took office  came less than a week after Mercedes Benz maker  Daimler  AG  DE DAIGn  cut its 2018 profit forecast  citing growing trade tensions  Its German rival BMW  DE BMWG  said it was considering  possible strategic options  in view of the rising trade tensions between China and the United States  Harley is the latest example of how companies are finding themselves in the crosshairs following  tit for tat  retaliations over Trump s bid to rewrite global trade rules as part of his  America First  agenda  Office furniture maker  Steelcase Inc   N SCS  last week reported a 230 basis point fall in the gross margins of its American business in the first quarter due to higher raw materials costs following Trump s metal import tariffs  Although it increased prices earlier this month  the second increase in four months  Steelcase said it expected profit margins to remain under pressure for another quarter or two   A manufacturer can no longer assume that the direction of trade policy is towards freer and freer trade over time   Dustin Burke  a partner at the Boston Consulting Group  told Reuters last month  Analysts at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  estimate that the U S  tariffs along with the retaliatory duties imposed or under consideration by trade partners will affect 1 percent of global trade  But for some companies  that 1 percent covers a much larger share of their supply chain  To view a graphic on U S  s trade with China   click   To view an interactive of U S  trade with China  click   SEARCH FOR RESILIENT OPTIONS It is not clear how Washington s trade dispute with China and other partners will be resolved  and that has many companies still reluctant to take actions that could take years to pay off   If you tell us what the rules are  we ll determine the best way to position the capacity and to go about the investment   said Michael Lamach  chief executive of heating and air conditioning product maker Ingersoll Rand Plc  N IR    What you need is certainty around the rules   The uncertainty has been a bonanza for supply chain consultants  who are helping clients assess potential replacements for Chinese and other non U S  suppliers  Chicago based Peter Guarraia  a partner at Bain   Co  last month covered three continents in just two weeks  After scouting for vendors in India and Thailand  Guarraia flew to Atlanta  Mexico and then to the UK to evaluate supply chains   We are all over the place   he said late last month   A lot of our clients are asking   How do we turn our supply chains from a necessary evil into a competitive weapon    Companies routinely examine supply chains to make them more competitive  but until now very few mapped vulnerability to trade risks beyond their primary suppliers  said Brett Weaver  a partner at KPMG   NO EASY CHOICES Complex and decades old supply chains cannot be shifted to different countries or facilities easily   Some businesses work with contracts anywhere from six to nine months in advance of delivery  while others have multi year contracts with their suppliers  For some manufacturers like those of medical devices  changing suppliers is not possible without regulatory approval  In some cases  companies have no option but to stay put as there are no alternatives to existing suppliers  Take  Varian Medical  Systems Inc  N VAR   which makes cancer fighting radiation therapy systems  The Palo Alto  California based company uses tungsten in one of its components  It imports the metal from China which has the bulk of global tungsten production  The United States does not have any domestic commercial production of primary tungsten  the company said   MADE IN AMERICA  HiberSense  a small startup that sells internet connected home climate control systems  decided early this month to end its reliance on imports of thermostats from China and fast track a plan to manufacture the devices in Pennsylvania    We don t want to be subjected to these ebbs and flows of political environment   Chief Revenue Officer Bob Fields said in an interview   We would much rather be in control of what we are doing   It will take minimum of nine months and at least  200 000 in research and development before the two year old startup can begin production  Until then  Fields says the company will have no option but to pay an additional 25 percent tariff on the shipments of thermostats from China  and hope that its customers would accept the increased costs   
Fields said the tariffs would increase the average retail price of HiberSense systems to above  2 000 per unit from about  1 900 earlier ",2018-06-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-tariffs-force-companies-to-rework-supply-chains-1506564,1506564
