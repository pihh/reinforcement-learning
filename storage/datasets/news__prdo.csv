holiday sales season Notably  consumer spending constitutes around 70  of the U S  GDP while business spending generates nearly 12   Therefore  an overall good consumer confidence reading indicates that the U S  economy  which is currently in its record 11th year of expansion  is likely to maintain the momentum Consumer Confidence Drops But Not DisappointsPer the Conference Board  the index of consumer confidence for the month of November came in at 125 5  lagging the previous month s revised reading of 126 1  reported reading was 125 9  as well as the consensus estimate of 128 1  The index had a free fall in the last four months after it touched 135 8 in July The Present Situation Index  which gauges consumers  views on current market conditions  declined from 173 5 to 166 9  This was mainly due to softening in consumers  assessment of current business and employment conditions  a direct result of the lingering trade conflict with China Meanwhile  on Nov 22  the University of Michigan  which also conducts a similar study on U S  consumer behavior  reported that consumer sentiment for November climbed to 96 8 from 95 5 in the previous month  November s reading was the highest in four months   Per the study  the index of consumer sentiment came in at 95 or higher in 30 of the past 35 months  This marked the greatest level of consumer optimism since the period

for the next six months  outlook for income  business and labor market conditions  increased to 97 9 from 94 5 in October  Notably  the University of Michigan report also revealed that the Expectations Index rose to 87 3 in November from 84 2 in October Similar findings of the two different studies clearly indicate that U S  consumers are expecting a rebound of economic growth in the first quarter of 2020  Per Lynn Franco  director of economic indicators of Conference Board   Overall  confidence levels are still high and should support solid spending during this holiday season

30911,252426,PRDO,Worried About Market Downturn  Buy These Low Leverage Stocks,opinion,In the complex world of investment  understanding the amount of financial leverage a company bears is crucial  Notably  leverage refers to a well known business strategy in corporate finance  which involves usage of borrowed capital by companies to ensure smooth run of operations and expansion of the same  In simple words  it is the amount of debt a firm uses to invest in its business operations Now  one may ask why a company chooses debt when the option of equity financing exists  The answer is simple  Debt is a much cheaper form of financing than equity  Moreover  payments on debt are tax deductible  So  the majority of companies resort to debt financing Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  Particularly  the fact that debt carries the burden of interest payments makes it dearer  Nevertheless  it is next to impossible to find a company that is free of debt  So  one should look for stocks that bear considerably low rate of debt  This is because exorbitant debt financing might even cause a corporation to become bankrupt in times of economic downturns Therefore  to protect one s portfolio from notable losses  the real challenge for an investor is to ascertain if an organization s debt level is sustainable  Historically  several leverage ratios are developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common of those ratios Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company Investors must be on the lookout for stocks that exhibited solid earnings growth in the last couple of quarters  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level does not seem to be a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen lululemon athletica   NASDAQ LULU    It is a yoga inspired athletic apparel company that designs  manufactures and distributes athletic apparel and accessories   The company

30912,252427,PRDO,Scoop Up Big Gains With 6 Stocks Enjoying Rising Cash Flows,opinion,Making profits is undoubtedly a company s primary goal  but having a healthy cash flow is imperative to its existence  development and success  And why not  Even a company generating profits succumbs to failure and faces bankruptcy while meeting obligations if it has a dearth of cash flow  However  one can efficiently tide over any market mayhem if it has the cash to shield it In fact  a healthy cash position indicates that profits are being efficiently channelized to the company s reserves  This offers flexibility to make decisions  chase potential investments and fuel its growth engine  It is indeed a true indicator of a company s financial health and a measure of resiliency To find this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the

30915,252430,PRDO,Bull Market To Stay In 2020  5 Solid Buys,opinion,2019 was a banner year for U S  stocks  defying skeptics who expected the bull market to be upended by trade war threats and global economic slowdown  As measured by the S P 500 index  stocks rallied almost 30  last year  Most importantly  can the market keep surging this year as well Needless to say  stocks do face an array of obstacles in a new year  Thanks to the winning run  the market currently seems to be overvalued  trading at around 19 times earnings  and thus may not have much room to run The United States  for most part of next year  will face political uncertainty  eventually leading to gyrations in the stock market  This is because fears of unknown candidates and what their policies would mean for business could somehow lead to a significant decline in stocks But it has been seen that once investors figure out who is in control and what to expect  business houses follow suit  And no astute investor will mix politics with long term investment strategies  as it leads to losses By the way  investors still have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the stock market this year  President Trump has announced a possible  phase one  partial deal with China  And if the negotiations go well at the beginning of 2020  business confidence will improve  driving capital expenditure and in turn stocks  America s ailing manufacturing sector could also recover from an uptick in business spending  which took a hit last year due to the trade war And as consumer outlays remain healthy  led by record low unemployment rate  investors should expect the economy to continue to expand this year  Per the Commerce Department  consumer outlays increased 0 4  in November  its strongest gain since July  Government data showed that there were significant purchases of automobiles and trucks in November  while spending on healthcare was pretty high  All these indicate that households have enough spending capabilities to keep the economy expanding at a steady pace in the near term The current low interest environment should make the cost of borrowing manageable  helping companies invest and grow  This in turn should help the economy gain momentum  What s more  the Fed is expected to keep its monetary policy on hold after trimming rates three consecutive times last year to stimulate the economy  Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that there is no immediate need to increase the federal fund s rate unless there is a constant upward movement in inflation Last but not the least  Wall Street s positive sentiment remains supported by progress in international trade matters  After all  the House of Representatives saw both the Democrats and Republicans united in passing an updated version of the 25 year old NAFTA that many economists believe will eventually prove favorable for the U S  economy 5 Top Ranked Growth Stocks to Buy NowGiven the bullish trends  it will be prudent to

stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Brookfield Business Partners L P    NYSE BBU    Career Education Corp    BE CECO    Enphase Energy  Inc    NASDAQ ENPH    Foundation Building Materials  Inc    NYSE FBM   and Lithia Motors  Inc    NYSE LAD   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Bull Market to Stay in 2020  5 Solid Buys2019 was a banner year for U S  stocks  defying skeptics who expected the bull market to be upended by trade war threats and global economic slowdown  As measured by the S P 500 index  stocks rallied almost 30  last year  Most importantly  can the market keep surging this year as well Needless to say  stocks do face an array of obstacles in a new year  Thanks to the winning run  the market currently seems to be overvalued  trading at around 19 times earnings  and thus may not have much room to run The United States  for most part of next year  will face political uncertainty  eventually leading to gyrations in the stock market  This is because fears of unknown candidates and what their policies would mean for business could somehow lead to a significant decline in stocks But it has been seen that once investors figure out who is in control and what to expect  business houses follow suit  And no astute investor will mix politics with long term investment strategies  as it leads to losses By the way  investors still have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the stock market this year  President Trump has announced a possible  phase one  partial deal with China  And if the negotiations go well at the beginning of 2020  business confidence will improve  driving capital expenditure and in turn stocks  America s ailing manufacturing sector could also recover from an uptick in business spending  which took a hit last year due to the trade war And as consumer outlays remain healthy  led by record low unemployment rate  investors should expect the economy to continue to expand this year  Per the Commerce Department  consumer outlays increased 0 4  in November  its strongest gain since July  Government data showed that there were significant purchases of automobiles and trucks in November  while spending on healthcare was pretty high  All these indicate that households have enough spending capabilities to keep the economy expanding at a steady pace in the near term The current low interest environment should make the cost of borrowing manageable  helping companies invest and grow  This in turn should help the economy gain momentum  What s more  the Fed is expected to keep its monetary policy on hold after trimming rates three consecutive times last year to stimulate the economy  Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that there is no immediate need to increase the federal fund s rate unless there is a constant upward movement in inflation Last but not the least  Wall Street s positive sentiment remains supported by progress in international trade matters  After all  the House of Representatives saw both the Democrats and Republicans united in passing an updated version of the 25 year old NAFTA that many economists believe will eventually prove favorable for the U S  economy 5 Top Ranked Growth Stocks to Buy NowGiven the bullish trends  it will be prudent to invest in stocks that have the potential to climb this year  We have thus used the to narrow down on stocks

30957,252472,PRDO,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Career Education  First American Financial  The Allstate Corporation  Guess  And CNX Midstream Partners,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 4  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Career Education Corporation   NASDAQ CECO    First American Financial Corporation   NYSE FAF    The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL    Guess   Inc    NYSE GES   and CNX Midstream Partners LP   NYSE CNXM   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  5 of the Best Stocks to Own in NovemberThe bull market  which came into being in 2009  is widely expected to stay in November and beyond  The optimism largely stems from the buoyant broader markets this year through October  which signals at positive returns for the remaining two months as well And why not  Whenever the Dow is up at least 15  in a calendar year through October  the blue chip index has given an average return of 5 55  over the next two month period  Similarly  whenever the S P 500 has gained a minimum 20  through October  the broader index returned 6 21  on average for the rest of the year  Lest we forget  the Dow and S P 500 have already gained 15 4  and 21 2   respectively  so far this year And let s admit November is supposed to be the best time of the year for the stock market  While the stock market  historically  gained in the November through May Day period  or the so called  winter  months  they tend to remain more or less flat during the  summer  months  May October  For instance  since 1950  the Dow has registered an average gain of 7 5  during the November April period  while the blue chip index yielded a meager 0 3  in the May October period  Results have  in fact  shown that the strategy of buying in November and selling in May has been successful 80  of the time when employed within a time span of five years  and more than 90  in a 10 year time frame By the way the Fed recently trimmed the benchmark interest rate for the third straight meeting  which bodes well for Wall Street  The Fed s rate setting committee trimmed benchmark interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a target range of 1 5  to 1 75  in October Rates were trimmed in order to help the U S  economy bear with the protracted trade war without slipping into a recession  After all  parts of the economy  especially manufacturing  have been affected as the global economy slowed down on trade war concerns  Business investments were also affected by the U S  China moves to raise tariffs on each other s goods  The Fed also acknowledged the weakness in business investments and exports Nonetheless  the S P 500 in particular tends to extend gains in the six and 12 month period following three consecutive interest rate cuts of a quarter percentage point each  according to data from LPL Financial  The S P 500 had climbed 10  in the six months and 20  in the 12 months following a trio of rate cuts of 25 basis points each in the years 1975  1996 and 1998 Some skeptics may still say that Chinese officials have recently expressed doubt over reaching a comprehensive trade deal with the United States  something that doesn t bode well for global economic growth  But  investors have chosen to ignore trade related issues and have instead focused on the encouraging Chinese manufacturing data  On the domestic front  consumers have given enough indication of their willingness to spend  After all  consumer outlays increased for the seventh straight month in a row in September  per the Commerce Department 5 Top Stocks to Buy for NovemberFrom historical trends to upbeat China s manufacturing data to fairly elevated consumer sentiment  things are certainly looking up for the stock market this November  We have  thus  selected five such stocks that are fundamentally sound enough to post gains in the near term and make the most of the expected uptrend in November These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a  of A

30958,252473,PRDO,Trade Optimism Powers Wall Street To Record High  5 Winners,opinion,Both the United States and China have recently agreed on phase one of the trade deal  Such fresh optimism over trade helped major benchmarks hit record highs on Nov 4  Thus  investors might be interested in stocks that are set to make the most of the bullish scenario U S  China Trade ResolutionBoth U S  and Chinese officials are looking to cut a few tariffs to finalize the partial trade deal  The countries have agreed to settle the trade dispute  which has affected billions of dollars of trade  squeezed corporate profit margins and impeded global economic growth Manufacturing has especially been affected while business investments have also taken a hit  The Fed has also acknowledged weakness in business investments and exports According to Myron Brilliant  executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce   the two sides are nonetheless really close to a deal but it will come down to the presidents to make the final call   U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  in the meantime  said that the world s largest economies are making   good progress  on the U S  China trade front The so called phase one agreement would entail China s purchase of  40  50 billion of U S  agricultural commodities  It will also discourage China from devaluing its currency and protect intellectual property rights If the phase one deal is successful  President Trump won t impose new tariffs on Dec 15 as planned and officials would roll back some of the existing tariffs  The Financial Times  by the way  has reported that the Trump administration was considering trimming tariffs on nearly  11 billion Chinese goods imposed on Sep 1 Lest we forget  retailers and apparel producers had expressed disapproval of such tariffs some time back  What s more  many economists criticized the tariffs imposed on Sep 1 as they directly affect the price of imported consumer products Rolling back of such tariffs could easily improve the rapport between both the sides  eventually leading them to pursue a phase two or phase three deal Stocks at Record HighsHopes of at least a partial U S  China trade deal helped the stock market scale higher  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 114 75 points  or 0 4   to 27462 11 on Nov 4  notching its first record since July The S P 500 index gained 11 36 points  or 0 4   to end at 3 078 27  while the Nasdaq rose 46 80 points  or 0 6   to close at 8 432 20  Both the major bourses finished at record highs for the second consecutive session All three primary indexes  in fact  hit an all time intraday high  The last time the indexes closed at record highs on the same day was Jul 15  per Dow Jones Market Data  But why

30961,252476,PRDO,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Manulife  Gibraltar  Omnicell  SolarEdge And Career Education,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 25  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Manulife Financial   NYSE MFC    Gibraltar Industries   NASDAQ ROCK    Omnicell   NASDAQ OMCL    SolarEdge Technologies   NASDAQ SEDG   and Career Education Corp    NASDAQ CECO   Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks to Keep Your Portfolio SafeLeverage is a well known business strategy to use borrowed funds for financing the purchase of inventory  equipment and other company assets  These funds can also be utilized to repay the company s prior debt  Companies can obtain such funds either using debt or equity Historically  debt financing has been preferred over equity  This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it incurs fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a company s partial owner but also gets entitled to a direct claim to its future profits Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  Particularly  one should keep in mind that debt financing is a feasible option as long as the companies succeed in generating a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate  Exorbitant debt financing might even cause a corporation s bankruptcy in a worst case scenario A high degree of financial leverage means heavy interest payments  which affect a company s bottom line Therefore  to protect one s portfolio from notable losses  the real challenge for an investor is to ascertain if an organization s debt level is sustainable A debt free entity is rare to find  Historically  several leverage ratios are developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company With the Q3 reporting cycle over for majority of sectors  an investor must be looking for solid growth stocks  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth  without considering their debt level  might not be a wise move  As uncertainty can hit the global equity market any time  it is reasonable to expect that investors will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth For the

months in a row  However  looking carefully inside the report gives us some surprising positive facts  Despite the dip in consumer confidence  overall reading is fairly good to support a strong holiday sales season Notably  consumer spending constitutes around 70  of the U S  GDP while business spending generates nearly 12   Therefore  an overall good consumer confidence reading indicates that the U S  economy  which is currently in its record 11th year of expansion  is likely to maintain the momentum Consumer Confidence Drops But Not DisappointsPer the Conference Board  the index of consumer confidence for the month of November came in at 125 5  lagging the previous month s revised reading of 126 1  reported reading was 125 9  as well as the consensus estimate of 128 1  The index had a free fall in the last four months after it touched 135 8 in July The Present Situation Index  which gauges consumers  views on current market conditions  declined from 173 5 to 166 9  This was mainly due to softening in consumers  assessment of current business and employment conditions  a direct result of the lingering trade conflict with China Meanwhile  on Nov 22  the University of Michigan  which also conducts a similar study on U S  consumer behavior  reported that consumer sentiment for November climbed to 96 8 from 95 5 in the previous month  November s reading was the highest in four months   Per the study  the index of consumer sentiment came in at 95 or higher in 30 of the past 35 months  This marked the greatest level of consumer optimism since the period between January 1998 and December 2000 A Ray of Hope in Consumer Confidence DataAccording to Conference Board report  the Expectations Index of November  which is a measure of consumers  short term  for the next six months  outlook for income  business and labor market conditions  increased to 97 9 from 94 5 in October  Notably  the University of Michigan report also revealed that the Expectations Index rose to 87 3 in November from 84 2 in October Similar findings of the two different studies clearly indicate that U S  consumers are expecting a rebound of economic growth in the first quarter of 2020  Per Lynn Franco  director of economic indicators of Conference Board   Overall  confidence levels are still high and should support solid spending during this holiday season  Meanwhile  U S  retailers are gearing up for the holiday season  starting late November and stretching until early January   According to the National Retail Federation  NRF   holiday retail sales

31012,252527,PRDO,Look Beyond Profit  Bet On 4 Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows,opinion,We are in the heart of the current reporting cycle  and crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear a good option to investors  However  looking beyond profits and evaluating a company s cash position can be far more rewarding  This is because  even though profit is a company s goal  cash is its lifeblood for existence and a measure of resiliency In fact  a dearth of cash flow can compel even a profit making company to face bankruptcy while meeting its obligations  However  a healthy cash position indicates that profits are being efficiently channelized to the company s reserves  which not only shield it from market mayhem but also offer flexibility to make decisions  chase potential investments and run its growth engine To find this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5 year average cash flow per common share  This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time In addition to this

31037,252552,PRDO,5 Of The Best Stocks To Own In November,opinion,The bull market  which came into being in 2009  is widely expected to stay in November and beyond  The optimism largely stems from the buoyant broader markets this year through October  which signals at positive returns for the remaining two months as well And why not  Whenever the Dow is up at least 15  in a calendar year through October  the blue chip index has given an average return of 5 55  over the next two month period  Similarly  whenever the S P 500 has gained a minimum 20  through October  the broader index returned 6 21  on average for the rest of the year  Lest we forget  the Dow and S P 500 have already gained 15 4  and 21 2   respectively  so far this year And let s admit November is supposed to be the best time of the year for the stock market  While the stock market  historically  gained in the November through May Day period  or the so called  winter  months  they tend to remain more or less flat during the  summer  months  May October  For instance  since 1950  the Dow has registered an average gain of 7 5  during the November April period  while the blue chip index yielded a meager 0 3  in the May October period  Results have  in fact  shown that the strategy of buying in November and selling in May has been successful 80  of the time when employed within a time span of five years  and more than 90  in a 10 year time frame By the way the Fed recently trimmed the benchmark interest rate for the third straight meeting  which bodes well for Wall Street  The Fed s rate setting committee trimmed benchmark interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a target range of 1 5  to 1 75  in October Rates were trimmed in order to help the U S  economy bear with the protracted trade war without slipping into a recession  After all  parts of the economy  especially manufacturing  have been affected as the global economy slowed down on trade war concerns  Business investments were also affected by the U S  China moves to raise tariffs on each other s goods  The Fed also acknowledged the weakness in business investments and exports Nonetheless  the S P 500 in particular tends to extend gains in the six and 12 month period following three consecutive interest rate cuts of a quarter percentage point each  according to data from LPL Financial  The S P 500 had climbed 10  in the six months and 20  in the 12 months following a trio of rate cuts of 25 basis points each in the years 1975  1996 and 1998 Some skeptics may still say that Chinese officials have recently expressed doubt over reaching a comprehensive trade deal with the United States  something that doesn t bode well for global economic growth  But  investors have chosen to ignore trade related issues and have

The Conference Board s consumer confidence index declined to 121 5 in June  a 21 month low  That s also way below the 131 1 that analysts polled by Reuters were looking for and the 131 3 posted in May 
Senior director Lynn Franco said that  Although the Index remains at a high level  continued uncertainty could result in further volatility in the Index and  at some point  could even begin to diminish consumers  confidence in the expansion  
From the release   Consumers  appraisal of current day conditions declined in June  Those claiming business conditions are  good  decreased from 38 4 percent to 36 7 percent  however  those saying business conditions are  bad  also decreased  from 11 7 percent to 10 9 percent  Consumers  assessment of the labor market was also somewhat less upbeat  Those saying jobs are  plentiful  decreased from 45 3 percent to 44 0 percent  while those claiming jobs are  hard to get  rose from 11 8 percent to 16 4 percent

31189,252704,PRDO,Career Education  CECO  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Career Education   NASDAQ CECO    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11 6  over the past month  CECO hit a new 52 week high of  14 84 in the previous session  Career Education has gained 22 3  since the start of the year compared to the 2 3  move for the Consumer Discretionary sector and the 21 3  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 2  2018  Career Education reported EPS of  0 25 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 22 
For the current fiscal year  Career Education is expected to post earnings of  0 95 per share on  587 2 million in revenues  This represents a 206 45  change in EPS on a  1 55  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 16 per share on  613 8 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 22 11  and 4 53   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Career Education may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CECO  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Career Education has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 15 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 28 5X versus its peer group s average of 19 2X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Career Education Corporation Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Career Education currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Career Education meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though CECO shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come

Valuation Metrics
Career Education may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CECO  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Career Education has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 17 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 32X versus its peer group s average of 19 8X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Career Education currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Career Education fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though CECO shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come
