Stocks to Keep an Eye Out ForWith the majority of companies yet to report their numbers this reporting cycle  investors would like to add stocks with the potential to surpass earnings expectations  This is because it is a well known fact that an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation However  the million dollar question is how to pick the potential winners  The task becomes even more difficult when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance  With a plethora of stocks flooding the market at any point of time  an investor may end up making a wrong choice while designing one s portfolio in the absence of proper know how Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact returns  thereby ruining the very objective of investing one s hard earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market  In a bid to avoid such a scenario  investors usually rely on guidance from proper sources Broker Advice   The Way ForwardIn the field of investing  brokers are deemed to be experts with thorough knowledge  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Winning PointerSince brokers indulge in meticulous research  the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise  The direction of the estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters  it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason logic behind their improving the recommendation on a particular stock  Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Revenues Performance Not to be IgnoredAccording to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   Therefore  one must take top line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy  We have included in our screen the price sales ratio which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric For the rest of this Screen of

article are Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS    Delta Air Lines Inc    NYSE DAL    Microsoft Corp    NASDAQ MSFT    Core Mark Holding Company Inc    NASDAQ CORE   and Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   Great Dividend Growth Stocks for Higher ReturnsGiven the decline in yields and the prospect of lower interest rates  investors are in search of returns  This has raised the appeal for dividend investing  While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio  with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields Further  dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income when returns from the equity market are at risk Dividend Growth  A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

22915,244430,CORE,Is Core Mark Holding  CORE  A Good Value Investor Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Core Mark Holding Company  Inc    NASDAQ CORE   stock into thisequation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Core Mark Holding Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 75  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 89  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Core Mark Holding Company s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 26 63 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks Business Services Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 34  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Core Mark Holding Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 19  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Core Mark Holding Company s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Core Mark Holding Company has a P S ratio of about 0 07  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 44 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for thisstock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Core Mark Holding Company currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Core Mark Holding Company a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Core Mark Holding Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and Momentum Score of B  This gives CORE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at the best  The current year has seen three upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to no downward revision  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen one upward revision compared to two downward revisions in the same time period The current year consensus estimate increased 1 9  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate fell 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Core Mark Holding Company  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCore Mark Holding Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all

market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend

23021,244536,CORE,5 Top Ranked Momentum Stocks Driven By Driehaus Strategy,opinion,Investors who have the tendency to take a high level of risks can choose momentum stocks as an investment option  In this context  we have focused on Driehaus strategy which has used the  buy high and sell higher  principle to select the best momentum stocks  The success of this particular investment approach eventually helped Richard Herman Driehaus get a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  gains registered by the S P 500  Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the

23025,244540,CORE,5 Dividend Growth Stocks Poised For Outperformance,opinion,"The Fed s shift to a patient approach on interest rates after lifting off rates for three years has brought back the lure for dividend investing this year  While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  honing in on stocks having a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio  with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields Further  dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income when returns from the equity market are at risk Dividend Growth  A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks

23092,244607,CORE,Avis  CAR  Tops Q3 Earnings   Sales  Tweaks View  Stock Up,opinion,Recovering from the back to back earnings misses in the last two quarters  Avis Budget Group Inc    NASDAQ CAR   came out with record third quarter 2016 results  wherein both earnings and sales grew year over year  alongside topping estimates Results were mainly backed by strong pricing in the Americas region coupled with the company s profit boosting efforts  These also helped Avis to generate its highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin to date  The robust results were enough to drive investor sentiment  as reflected by a 1 2  rise in the stock price in the after market trading session Q3 HighlightsThe car rental company s adjusted earnings came in at  2 47 per share  which surged 25  year over year and came in significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 34  On a GAAP basis  the company s earnings rose 29  to  2 28 per share AVIS BUDGET GRP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Further  the company reported record net revenue of  2 656 million in the quarter  which advanced 3 1  year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 622 million  The solid top line was mainly driven by a 4  rise in rental days at the International region and a 2  improvement in pricing in the Americas region Adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 9  to  469 million  fuelled by enhanced overall rental volumes and better pricing in Americas  somewhat offset by higher per unit fleet expenses  The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 17 7  Segment PerformanceAmericas reported 3  year over year revenue growth to  1 821 million  backed by a 2  increase in pricing and rental days each  somewhat offset by a 2  hike in per unit fleet costs  Consequently  adjusted EBITDA jumped 10  to  306 million in the quarter   The International segment s revenues advanced 4  year over year to  835 million  thanks to a 4  rise in volumes  partly negated by a 2  drop in pricing and a 2  rise in per unit fleet costs  Adjusted EBITDA for the segment rose 7  to  179 million on the back of greater rental volumes  reduced marketing costs and favorable currency movements  partly offset by unfavorable pricing FinancialsAvis ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  985 million  and total corporate debt of  3 866 million  As of Sep 30  2016  the company s shareholders  equity was  474 million  During the first three quarters  the company generated  2 101 million as cash flow from operating activities During the quarter  Avis repurchased nearly 3 1 million shares worth  110 million  including which it bought roughly 9 5 million shares for  290 million as of Sep 30  2016  Management continues to expect to generate free cash flow worth  450  500 million in 2016  while it now anticipates making share buybacks of  370  400 million  compared with the previous plan of  300  400 million Other DevelopmentsAvis inked a deal to acquire France Cars  in Sep 2016  A privately held car rental company  France Cars makes nearly  60 million in vehicle rental revenues on an annual basis  Notably  the buyout of this France based company will add roughly 8 000 cars  vans and light trucks to Avis  existing fleet  thus helping it expand in the French region  The company anticipates this buyout to conclude by the end of this year GuidanceManagement remains impressed with the company s third quarter results and expects the positive pricing in the Americas to continue  However  owing to weaker than anticipated demand in the Americas and Europe  the company is on track to right size its existing fleet  Consequently  management adjusted its 2016 outlook  where it tweaked its overall revenue  adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA forecast Avis now anticipates 2016 sales to grow 3  to  8 75 billion  including adverse currency impact of around  40 million  Earlier  the company projected revenues for 2016 to grow in a range of 3  5  to  8 75  8 9 billion  with a negative currency impact of nearly  50 million The company s Americas segment rental days are now estimated to grow 2   compared with 2  3  projected earlier   while pricing is expected to remain flat with no currency impact  Further  the company now expects international revenue to increase 6   compared with 5  8  growth guided earlier  The updated International revenue outlook includes a 1  adverse impact from foreign currency  versus 2  projected earlier Per unit fleet costs for the total company are now anticipated to be around  285 million per month  compared to a range of  285  290 million expected earlier  Per unit fleet costs in the Americas for 2016 are now estimated to jump 5  to  312 million per month  compared with the previous guidance of a 5  6  increase to  313  316 million  For the International segment  per unit fleet costs are now envisioned to drop 0 9  to  227 million per month  compared with the previous projection of a 1  3  decline to roughly  223  227 million  The updated International fleet cost guidance also includes unfavorable currency impact of 1  Adjusted EBITDA is now projected to come on the lower end of its previously guided band of  850  900 million  This still includes a  20 million negative impact from foreign exchange movements Interest expense pertaining to corporate debt is expected to be nearly  205 million  The company s non vehicle depreciation and amortization costs guidance  excluding the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions  is pegged at about  195 million  The company s effective tax rate in 2016 is estimated to be 39   while diluted shares outstanding are projected to lie in a band of 93 94 million Based on the abovementioned expectations  the company expects its adjusted earnings per share to be  2 93  which is close to the lower end of its previously announced range of  2 90  3 30 expected earlier  Further  earnings are expected to bear

  NASDAQ MGI        Acacia Research Corp   Nasdaq    NASDAQ ACTG        Fang Holdings Ltd   NYSE    NYSE SFUN       and Core Mark Holding Company  Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ CORE       Industry  Business Services  Part 3Link   Despite the positives in the Business Services  we cannot ignore the headwinds limiting the positives mentioned in                   Discussed below are some inherent challenges faced by the Business Services sector Continuous Spending on Research and Development  Importantly  consulting service providers need to stay abreast with the latest technologies through continuous spending on research and development  The performance of these providers can be hampered if they do not acclimatize to or adopt new services to cope with the latest developments Maintaining Skilled Workforce Involves High Costs  Since skilled workers are always in demand  there is a possibility of a high turnover rate in the sector  The training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs  in turn affecting margins  This space needs to have a more skilled workforce to take advantage of technology that develops at a rapid pace Competition  Maintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers  As discussed earlier  the main business of one company can be a business service for another  So target customers for both may at times be the same Therefore  a business service provider needs to be adequately equipped to win over customers  While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures  relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services Regulatory Hurdles  By virtue of having operations across the globe  service providers face regulatory hurdles and compliance related issues  The Western Union Company  NYSE       expects compliance costs to be at the higher end of 3 5   4  in 2017 MoneyGram International Inc   Nasdaq       is being probed by a federal grand jury in relation to its consumer anti fraud and anti money laundering programs from 2003 to early 2009  The company is also involved in many other government investigations and litigations  Any adverse results might lead to potential liability against damages  which could put pressure on margins and cash flows Taking into consideration an unfavorable Zacks Rank  we prefer to avoid Acacia Research Corp   Nasdaq        Fang Holdings Ltd   NYSE       and Core Mark Holding Company  Inc   Nasdaq       carrying a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  You can see  To ConcludeThe dearth of skilled labor in the business services sector can affect its prospects  Non availability of quality workforce at a reasonable rate might increase overall operational costs In addition  the highly fragmented nature of the industry makes it difficult for such companies to set a distinct trend or predict a concrete future for it 4 Stocks to Watch

beat on the top line   The earnings data was mostly positive where they saw year over year gains in Net sales  7 9   Non cigarette sales  18 8   cigarette sales  3 6   Candy sales  50   and Food category  15 4    The company also saw gross profits improve by  11 7   and operating expenses fell by 11 4    But on January 5th  the company preannounced Q4 earnings data  and lowered expectations for FY 18   Management stated that fourth quarter EBITDA would be  41 million  down from the  56 million expected in November   The decline is attributed to cigarette carton sale slow down  cost overruns  and weak retail sales   Another factor in the decreased guidance was the loss of both Kroger  NYSE KR   and Circle K customers  a loss of about 1 700 stores    To make matters worse  management also lowered FY 18 EBITDA guidance below the consensus estimate of  176 million to  162 million  a  14 million decline   This decreased guidance could become worse as the company is factoring in both the retail and cigarette segments to move back to a breakeven point   So this guidance could be viewed as high  with a potential of falling even further during the year Additional

23263,244778,CORE,Top 5 Stocks Boasting Great Price Momentum,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  it s time to explore another  time tested winning strategy  to simply bet on the frontrunner stocks that are getting ahead of others Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does the momentum strategy work There is a simple reason to this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason why momentum works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will come back to their original prices  On the other hand  most investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the herd and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral issues open up a huge opportunity for momentum players to make profits  Basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Obviously  the Momentum Anomaly strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play  Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  and we have devised a strategy that will help investors to get in on these trades and make handsome gains We have created a screen that will help you to take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullbackin price  which could help you get in at bargain prices Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price  52 Weeks    Top  300  This item selects the top 300 stocks with the best

factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers  It indicates when the timing is the best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of
