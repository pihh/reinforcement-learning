7545,229060,EFX,Explainer  What do you do after a data breach ,news," Reuters    A hacker has stolen the personal information of over 100 million people from  Capital One  Financial Corp  N COF   the company said this week  in the latest high profile breach of sensitive consumer data  Security experts say data breaches will continue to happen as cyber criminals and state backed hackers target the protected information held by companies and government agencies  Such attacks leave consumers vulnerable to fraud and identity theft  Here are some steps you can take to assess the severity of the breach and better secure yourself   WHAT WAS COMPROMISED   Breaches often cover a wide range of data  Information which is already publicly available  such as your name or email address  is seen as less of a concern   Other details  however  can be extremely sensitive and need to remain private  For example  full credit card numbers  which could be used to make fraudulent purchases in your name  or passwords for your online accounts  Even if stolen  the data may still be protected by encryption  Hacks by foreign governments are also usually seen as less dangerous for general consumers compared to data thefts by financially motivated criminal gangs because most spy agencies do not sell or trade such information   Much of the information stolen from Capital One was already public  including names and addresses of over 100 million people in the United States and Canada  But the breach also included 140 000 Social Security numbers which could be used to steal people s identities  To assess the severity of the breach  try and determine what information was compromised and in what format it was stolen  AM I AFFECTED  Try to establish if your data is likely to have been compromised in the breach  Are you a customer of the affected company  Do you know what data they hold on you  Does the breach only concern data collected in a specific time period  Answering those questions will allow you to judge the level of risk  but remember some organizations may hold your data without you being aware  Those include credit reporting companies such as  Equifax Inc   N EFX   which suffered a breach in 2017 that affected 147 million people  Breached companies are usually obliged to notify the people who are impacted  but this does not always happen immediately  Affected companies will typically post guidance for consumers on their own websites about data breaches   Under the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   companies have to inform victims of severe data breaches  without undue delay   They must then describe in  clear and plain language  the nature of the breach  the likely consequences and what measures being taken to deal with it  IS THIS A SCAM  If you think you data was compromised  be on high alert for scams and fraud   Watch your bank account balances and payment card statements carefully  especially if you believe your financial information has been compromised  If you spot any unusual activity  contact your bank or card provider immediately and inform the appropriate law enforcement agency  Be aware of so called  phishing  websites purporting to offer information about the breach  or even compensation  but actually set up by criminals to try and trick you into revealing more personal details or making a payment to the wrong account   Fraudsters may also contact you directly  by phone or email  and could now be armed with large amounts of detailed personal information which will make them harder to spot  If you re unsure about someone s identity  find the affected company s contact information and contact them independently

7577,229092,EFX,Moody s  Israel s Team8 to create cyber risk standard for businesses,news,"By Tova Cohen and Ari Rabinovitch
TEL AVIV  Reuters    Ratings agency Moody s Corp  N MCO  and Israeli cyber group Team8 launched on Thursday a joint venture to assess how vulnerable businesses are to cyber attacks and create what they hope will become a global benchmark 
Cyber attacks are in focus after a virus from Ukraine spread around the globe in 2017  crippling thousands of computers  disrupting ports from Los Angeles to Mumbai and even halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia 
Similar to the way that banks can check their stability with a stress test  Moody s and Team8 are developing a framework to measure companies  defenses and preparedness for such attacks in comparison to other businesses and over time 
The service will be a tool for companies engaging in mergers and acquisitions or when purchasing cyber insurance policies  said Derek Vadala  chief executive of the joint venture who most recently served as head of Moody s cyber risk group 
The venture did not disclose financial details 
 Companies doing business with each other are spending more and more resources on understanding what is the risk associated with doing business with third parties and fourth parties   Team8 CEO Nadav Zafrir told Reuters on the sidelines of a Tel Aviv University cyber conference 
 We believe that not only is that already slowing down the economy  but that we are going to see this slant continuing to deteriorate   Zafrir  an ex commander of Israel s elite 8200 military intelligence unit  added 
The cyber health of companies has in the past had an impact on credit ratings as well  In March  Standard   Poor s downgraded Atlanta based credit bureau Equifax  N EFX  reflecting the possible fallout from a 2017 data breach  Moody s in May revised its outlook of Equifax citing the breach 
Moody s said the new cyber rating product was not related to its credit ratings service 
The new company will be based in New York and in Israel and will initially have a dozen employees  but is expected to grow to hundreds in coming years 
A creator of cyber defense startups  Team8 is backed financially by Moody s and other major companies like Microsoft  O MSFT   Airbus  PA AIR  and Qualcomm  O QCOM  
Companies are well aware of growing cyber threats  and total spending on information security products and services is expected to reach  124 billion in 2019  according to a report from advisory company Gartner which estimated spending surpassing  114 billion in 2018 
A coordinated global cyber attack  spread through malicious email  could cause economic damages of between  85 billion and  193 billion  one hypothetical scenario developed as a stress test for risk management showed 
In this scenario  claims paid by the insurance sector are estimated at  10 billion  27 billion  the report produced by insurance market Lloyd s of London and Aon  NYSE AON  said 

Vadala said the company was building its model and expected to have beta customers in a year  The idea is to engage thousands of companies so the index becomes the global standard  he said ",2019-06-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/moodys-israels-team8-to-create-cyber-risk-index-for-businesses-1908879,1908879

7624,229139,EFX,Trump administration working on consumer data privacy policy,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration is working to develop consumer data privacy policies  and the Commerce Department is meeting with big companies like  Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc as it looks to eventually seeing the policies enshrined in legislation  two officials said on Friday 
Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue  fueled by massive breaches that have compromised personal information of millions of U S  internet and social media users  spurring Congressional hearings 
California  the most populous U S  state  and the European Union have both adopted data protection rules 
David Redl  a senior U S  Commerce Department official who oversees the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  said in a speech on Friday to the Internet Governance Forum USA in Washington that the administration recently  began holding stakeholder meetings to identify common ground and formulate core  high level principles on data privacy  
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the administration  through the White House National Economic Council   aims to craft a consumer privacy protection policy that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity      We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution consistent with our overarching policy  
Facebook  the world s largest social media network  said earlier this year that the personal information of about 70 million U S  users was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  U S  lawmakers have also demanded answers from Facebook about the data it shared with four Chinese companies  Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  said in 2017 that all 3 billion of its accounts were hacked in a 2013 data theft  while other large data breaches have been reported in recent years by  Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX    Target  Corp  NYSE TGT  and  Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD  
Redl said a government survey showed that three quarters of American households using the internet have  significant concerns  about privacy and security risks 
A person briefed on the matter confirmed that the more than 20 meetings held have included major internet companies like Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet Inc  along with internet providers like AT T Inc  NYSE T  and Comcast Corp and trade associations  The Washington Post reported details of the meetings on Friday 
Redl said the administration plans to publish  high level principles  and seek public comment as it seeks to develop a nationwide data privacy plan 
Comcast  Facebook and Google declined comment  AT T said it backs  federal legislation that establishes strong consumer privacy protections that apply to all companies operating on the internet  
Jose Castaneda  spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council  which represents major tech companies  praised the Commerce Department efforts   The United States has an opportunity to create a new  best in class privacy paradigm for the digital economy as well as avoid the creation of a patchwork of laws that would impede innovation   he said 
In May  European privacy regulations went into effect forcing companies to be more attentive to how they handle customer data 
The European Union General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  replaces the bloc s patchwork of rules dating back to 1995 and heralds an era where breaking privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros   23 5 million   whichever is higher  as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros 
In June  California Governor Jerry Brown signed data privacy legislation aimed at giving consumers more control over how companies collect and manage their personal information  but the rules are not as stringent as the GDPR 
Under the law  large companies  such as those with data on more than 50 000 people  would be required starting in 2020 to let consumers view the data they have collected on them  request deletion of data  and opt out of having the data sold to third parties

7663,229178,EFX,Facebook s Zuckerberg faces Senate hearing but little hope for action,news,"By Dustin Volz WASHINGTON  Reuters    Facebook  O FB  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg s No  1 mission during his appearance before U S  lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday will be to defend against calls to regulate internet based companies  The prospect of new laws that restrict Facebook and other internet companies  however  is extremely unlikely not only because of a lack of political will and the effective lobbying of technology companies but because few lawmakers want to grapple with the sheer complexity of the technical issues involved  Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees   He is confronting combined outrage over how Russia used Facebook to spread divisive political propaganda during the 2016 U S  presidential election and how Facebook seemed unaware that a political consultancy  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested personal data of about 87 million Facebook users  most of them Americans  Senator Bill Nelson  the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee  said on Monday that while he believed new regulation was needed in the face of Facebook s twin scandals  he did not expect anything substantive to happen   He attributed that in part to the format for Tuesday s joint hearing before the Senate s Commerce and Judiciary committees that will give Zuckerberg an advantage  saying it would favor spectacle over thoughtful dialogue    How in the world can you have 44 senators do a hearing that has a lot of substance when each senator only has four minutes   Nelson asked reporters on Monday   Senator Dianne Feinstein  the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee  told reporters after speaking with 33 year old Zuckerberg  that he  was a very nice young man  who  obviously knows what he s doing and has a very pleasant personality   PRIVACY ADVOCATES OUTNUMBERED  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders declined to say on Monday if new regulations were needed   I don t have a specific policy announcement on that front  but I think we re all looking forward to that testimony   Republicans are generally against more corporate regulation and they are not persuaded that tech companies need more of it    I don t want to hurt Facebook  I don t want to regulate them half to death   said Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana  a member of the Judiciary Committee  But we have a problem  Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it    Companies that have been victimized by computer hacks have been accused by lawmakers of failing to take adequate security measures to protect their customers  personal information   Senior executives from a host of companies including  Target  Corp  N TGT   Alphabet s Google  O GOOGL   United Airlines  UALCO UL  and Equifax  N EFX   have testified before Congress on a variety of issues including network security and walked away with little more than a scolding and a temporary dip in stock price  Powerful lobbying forces assemble against any effort to convert public and political outrage into regulation  privacy advocates have said  Facebook spent  1 35 million on lobbying in 2011 and six years later spent  11 5 million  according to data maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics   People have this idea that we are going to pass omnibus privacy legislation and it is going to be a silver bullet   said Alvaro Bedoya  a former congressional aide who worked on privacy issues for former Senator Al Franken   The reality is lobbyists outnumber consumer privacy advocates in Washington 20 to 1 or 30 to 1    Instead of major regulatory changes  lawmakers in Congress have offered narrowly focused legislation   The Honest Ads Act  for instance  aims to address concerns about foreign nationals covertly purchasing ads on social media to influence American politics  It would require political ads on the internet to reveal who paid for them  much the same as ads on television and radio  It legislation has been stalled since its introduction last October  although Facebook endorsed it on Friday  Congress did pass legislation last month that chipped away at the 1996 Communications Decency Act  which for decades has guarded internet based companies from liability for what users post on their platforms  The legislation  which is expected to be signed into law this week by U S  President Donald Trump  was aimed at penalizing operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking  Internet companies have expressed worry that it could be the first step toward dismantling decades of a hands off regulatory approach by Washington  Technology industry officials said they also expected Zuckerberg s testimony to be long on political point scoring and short on legislative ideas   They don t understand ad targeting and they will probably ask him a bunch of unrelated questions that play to their respective political bases   said one technology industry source  who spoke on condition on anonymity because his company had not authorized him to speak on the matter for the record

7665,229180,EFX,West Virginia sues Equifax over data breach,news," Reuters    West Virginia sued  Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX  on Thursday for failing to safeguard consumer information of hundreds of thousands of state residents and for delaying alerting the public to a breach that exposed the personal data of about 148 million people  the state s attorney general said 
The attorney general  Patrick Morrisey  said he filed the lawsuit in Boone County Circuit Court  It was the second lawsuit filed by a state attorney general since Equifax disclosed the breach in September 
 Equifax s failure to secure consumers  personal information constitutes a shocking betrayal of public trust and an egregious violation of West Virginia consumer protection and data privacy laws   Morrisey said in a statement 
Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Equifax also faces class action lawsuits and investigations by the U S  Federal Trade Commission and various state attorneys general over the data breach 
A judge in Massachusetts earlier this month rejected Equifax s motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by that state s attorney general  Maura Healey 
The West Virginia lawsuit accused Equifax of taking no action to secure its online dispute portal despite prior warnings of vulnerability within its framework and of failing to recognize that hackers had penetrated its system from May 2017 to July 2017 

Morrisey s office said the breach exposed the data of more than 730 000 West Virginian residents  The lawsuit seeks  150 000 for each security breach and  5 000 for each violation of the state s Consumer Credit and Protection Act ",2018-04-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/west-virginia-sues-equifax-over-data-breach-1392706,1392706

7667,229182,EFX,U S  regulator fines Altaba  35 million over 2014 Yahoo email hack,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch and Dustin Volz
WASHINGTON SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    U S  regulators fined Altaba Inc  the company formerly known as Yahoo  Inc  NASDAQ AABA    35 million on Tuesday to settle charges that kept its massive 2014 cyber security breach a secret from investors for more than two years 
The Securities and Exchange Commission s case marks the first time it has gone after a company for failing to disclose a cyber security breach 
Altaba agreed to settle without admitting or denying any wrongdoing  A company spokesman declined to comment 
Yahoo s information security team learned just days after the December 2014 breach that Russian hackers had stolen the company s  crown jewels   including email addresses  encrypted passwords and security questions  the SEC said in a statement 
Despite becoming aware of the breach and reporting it to Yahoo s senior management and legal department  the company failed to properly investigate and did not disclose it to the public until more than two years later  when it was in the process of being acquired by Verizon Communication Inc  the regulator said 
Steven Peikin  co director the SEC s enforcement division  said cyber breaches were a priority for the agency and hoped companies facing similar issues would take note 
 The message in this case and the package of remedies here I think is a pretty strong one and I hope will be viewed as a significant penalty by other issuers   he told reporters on a call 
 We are not seeking to second guess good faith disclosure decisions  or be unsympathetic to the perils that companies face from these kinds of intrusions   he said  but Yahoo s material misstatements  omissions and lack of controls fell substantially short of expectations 
The U S  Justice Department announced charges last year against four men  including two officers in Russia s Federal Security Service  for their roles in the theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts 
One of them  Karim Baratov  a Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan  pleaded guilty late last year to charges related to helping Russian intelligence agents break into email accounts as part of a massive 2014 breach 
Baratov was expected to be sentenced on Tuesday for his role in the Yahoo hack 
During its investigation into the 2014 breach  Yahoo uncovered a separate 2013 breach that compromised all 3 billion of its accounts  by far the largest known breach of consumer information 
Cyber breach disclosures have drawn intense scrutiny after credit reporting agency  Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX  announced last year that personal information on nearly 150 million Americans had been compromised 
The SEC has filed charges against a former Equifax executive for alleged insider trading on the information 
In February  the regulator published new guidance on how and when firms should disclose cyber security risks and breaches 
The investigation into Yahoo is continuing and the SEC has yet to make a decision about the role or culpability of individuals  the SEC said 
In a Tweet on Tuesday  Democratic U S  Senator Mark Warner applauded the SEC action 
 Holding the company accountable is important  and I hope others will learn you can t sweep this kind of thing under the rug  ",2018-04-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/us-regulator-fines-altaba-35-million-over-2014-yahoo-email-hack-1411409,1411409

WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer watchdogs expressed concern on Friday that a lawyer who represented credit reporting companies over a massive data breach at Equifax  NYSE EFX  is being considered to head the Federal Trade Commission s Bureau of Consumer Protection 
The FTC s five commissioners are voting on the appointment of Andrew Smith  a process that takes several days  according to two people familiar with the matter  The FTC declined comment 
Bloomberg had previously reported that Smith  a partner at the law firm Covington   Burling LLP  was under serious consideration for the job 
Smith worked for the Consumer Data Industry Association  which represents credit reporting companies  He testified before Congress in October on their behalf in an attempt to blunt lawmakers  ire about the Equifax breach 
 It s problematic that he s going to have this job  The optics look really bad   said Chi Chi Wu  an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who worked with Smith on a American Bar Association group that focused on financial services 
 The Equifax investigation is one of the biggest consumer protection matters that the FTC is dealing with   she said 
Smith is expected to recuse himself from any Equifax probe  according to a third person familiar with the situation 
Ed Mierzwinski of U S  Public Interest Research Group also called Smith s potential appointment  problematic  
 He did his job well for Covington on behalf of CDIA  And they have avoided a lot of necessary oversight from the Congress   he said   The credit bureaus are very well served by their outside attorneys  
The FTC has opened an investigation into Equifax  which said in September that hackers stole personal data it had collected on some 143 million Americans  It is one of three credit reporting companies 
The agency does not investigate breaches but pursues companies that are sloppy in handling consumer data 
In congressional testimony in October  Smith spoke on behalf of the CDIA  of which Equifax is a member  and termed the hack an  unprecedented breach  
Credit bureaus like Equifax  TransUnion and Experian collect and store personal information on millions of consumers  Banks and other lenders rely on the information to track how consumers spend money and manage debt  then use it to decide what interest rates to charge for loans

WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said he wants to know how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is handling a probe into a hack of credit bureau  Equifax Inc   N EFX  after a report that the agency s chief has pulled back from investigating the matter 
Equifax disclosed in September that hackers had stolen personal data it had collected on some 143 million Americans 
On Monday  Reuters reported that the acting chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  CFPB   Mick Mulvaney  had put the brakes on the agency s Equifax investigation 
 I haven t spoken to Director Mulvaney about it but I will   Mnuchin told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee   It is something I am going to discuss with him  
On Tuesday  the CFPB said it was examining the Equifax breach but declined to give details 
 Acting Director Mulvaney takes data security issues very seriously   CFPB spokesman John Czwartacki said in a statement   The CFPB is working with our partners across government on Equifax s data breach  
Reuters  citing people familiar with the matter  reported on Monday that while the CFPB has an open investigation into Equifax  Mulvaney has reined in the work begun by his predecessor  Richard Cordray 
Mulvaney has not ordered subpoenas against Equifax or sought sworn testimony from executives  routine steps in a full scale probe  the sources said  They said the CFPB has shelved plans for on the ground tests of how Equifax protects data  an idea backed by Cordray 
The CFPB also recently rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency when they offered to help with on site exams of credit bureaus  the sources said 
Republican President Donald Trump s administration has sought to curb the power of the CFPB  which was created under his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama to protect consumers from financial industry abuses  The agency has been criticized fiercely by the industry

7729,229244,EFX,Social Security online accounts  safe from identity theft ,news,By Mark Miller CHICAGO  Reuters    More than 34 million Americans now conduct business with the Social Security Administration  SSA  online   and with that shift comes an increased risk of identity theft   For many  a MySSA account now is the only way to obtain an estimate of future benefits  since the agency no longer regularly mails annual benefit statements  MySSA also offers the convenience of handling routine paperwork online  and the ability to update the address on file for your account or start or change direct deposit of benefits  The SSA receives more than half of all retirement and disability benefit applications via the internet  according to a report last year by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO   That is up from negligible numbers a decade ago   The shift is part of a broader technology modernization drive at the SSA  but it also is an attempt to cope with rising demand for its services during a time of relentless cuts to its administrative budget by Congress  The SSA s operating budget has been cut 11 percent from 2010 to 2017 in inflation adjusted terms  At the same time  the demand for the SSA services from the public has been hitting record highs as the baby boom generation ages into retirement  But in an age of hacking and identity theft  moving Social Security online also increases risk   and it is difficult to imagine a hacking target more attractive than the SSA   The agency houses sensitive data on nearly every American   living and dead   including medical and financial records  The risks include not only theft of sensitive identity data  but also actual benefits  Nearly all Social Security benefits now are paid electronically  and thieves can redirect electronic payments to their own accounts  How significant is the risk of identity theft and fraud related to MySSA accounts  The Social Security Administration  SSA  says it does not track data on the prevalence of identity theft  but last fall it advised the public in a blog post that the best way to avoid problems is to create an account to  take away the risk of someone else trying to create one in your name  even if they obtain your Social Security number   The worry is that cyber thieves could claim accounts and file for benefits   If you don t plant your flag someone might do it for you   said Brian Krebs  a cyberspace security researcher and writer  STRONGER PROTECTIONS An SSA representative said the agency s anti fraud efforts have made the problem  very rare   And SSA has been strengthening security on its website  Starting last June  it beefed up the authentication methods required to create or access a MySSA account  including the addition of security codes sent by text or email  The SSA also performs anti fraud data analytics against MySSA transactions to identify suspicious activity and take action   In a 2016 audit of agency technology  the SSA s Office of the Inspector General  OIG  reported problems with unauthorized changes to mailing addresses and direct deposit bank information beginning in 2013  after the agency enhanced MySSA to permit people to change this information online   An OIG investigation conducted with the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation led to the conviction in 2014 of a Miami man for creating more than 900 fraudulent MySSA accounts  and redirecting roughly  700 000 in benefit payments to bank accounts he controlled  In 2015  the SSA identified more than 30 000 suspicious MySSA registrations  according to the OIG  The OIG   which maintains a hotline for consumer complaints related to Social Security   also says it received more than 58 000 allegations of fraud related to MySSA accounts from February 2013 to February 2016  Those figures are small in the context of overall MySSA activity   but it will not seem small if it happens to you  And this level of hacking is worrisome in an era of increased cybertheft  Concerns have intensified in the wake of last year s  Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX  hack  which exposed the Social Security numbers  birth dates and addresses of millions of Americans  But the problems pre date Equifax  In 2014  a data breach involving a subsidiary of Experian Plc  LON EXPN  exposed the Social Security numbers of some 200 million people to potential criminal activity     If you have not set up your MySSA account  it is a good idea to do so   especially if you are eligible for benefits or will be soon   Check to make sure that your personal information   such as date of birth and mailing address   are correct  For current beneficiaries  if you notice that a monthly payment has not arrived  you should notify the SSA immediately via the agency s toll free line  1 800 772 1213  or at your local field office  In most cases  the SSA will make you whole if the theft is reported quickly  Another option is to use the SSA s  Block Electronic Access  feature   especially if you have had to deal with a security breach  This blocks any automatic telephone or online access to your Social Security record   including by you  You can

7747,229262,EFX,U S  states gird for fight as Trump targets consumer finance watchdog,news,By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    Pennsylvania s Attorney General is leading the charge among his Democratic peers preparing to shore up protections for borrowers and savers while President Donald Trump follows through on a pledge to defang a powerful consumer finance watchdog  Since he was sworn in January  Democrat Josh Shapiro has built up his own consumer finance unit in preparation for when Republican Trump s officials take over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  CFPB   The unit is staffed with more than a dozen people and led by a former senior CFPB attorney  Shapiro and this team have already filed cases against Navient  O NAVI   a student loan servicer  which is accused of deceiving borrowers in order to drive up profits  and are leading a 48 state investigation into hacking at Equifax  N EFX   a consumer credit bureau   We re demonstrating a capacity to handle these big  complex consumer financial protection cases   Shapiro told Reuters  adding that attorneys general from both parties have asked about how they can  mimic our efforts   Navient has said it operates within federal laws and rules on student loans  and has contested similar charges brought by the CFPB in court  An Equifax spokesperson said the company cannot comment on pending litigation   but we remain focused on helping our customers  as well as their employees and consumers  to navigate this situation   Shapiro expects his case load will grow  particularly now that Trump has installed his budget director and fierce CFPB critic  Mick Mulvaney  as temporary chief of the agency  The press office at the Office of Management and Budget  which is currently handling public relations for CFPB  said it was too early to comment on Democratic attorneys  plans   However  of course we will carry out what we are statutorily obliged to enforce   spokesman John Czwartacki said  Created in the wake of the 2007 2009 financial crisis to crack down on predatory financial practices  the CFBP has long been criticized by Republicans  including Trump  who say it is far too powerful and burdens lenders with red tape   POWERFUL WEAPON Shapiro is part of a group of Democratic attorneys general from powerful and large states such as California and New York who disagree with Trump s call for financial deregulation   Since Trump s inauguration in January  those top law enforcement officials have sued the administration at least 25 times over its crackdown on immigration and dismantling of regulations across a range of areas from energy to education   When it comes to financial consumer protection state attorneys general wield an additional potentially powerful weapon  A little known provision of the 2010 Dodd Frank law  which created the CFPB  gives them the authority to enforce the agency s rules and its broad ban on  unfair  deceptive and abusive  practices beyond state lines  States have rarely used those provisions while Richard Cordray  appointed by President Barack Obama and known for aggressively pursuing financial firms  was in charge of the watchdog  But with his departure last week  Mulvaney freezing new rulemakings and hiring and a permanent successor expected to loosen the watchdog s regulation and enforcement  top attorneys in states such as Pennsylvania and California say they are preparing to get more active   If we have to do this with just states that makes it more difficult but that doesn t make it impossible   said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra  a Democrat  One difficulty for states wanting to pursue federal enforcement cases and go after financial firms across state lines  is that  by law  they must notify the CFPB  said Ori Lev  consumer financial services partner at law firm Mayer Brown  If they proceed without the CFPB  blessing or if the agency changes its mind about a case  then the agency could challenge them in federal court  and they would most likely have to defer to the CFPB  said C  Boyden Gray  a founding partner of Boyden Gray   Associates  who works with the conservative Federalist Society on tracking regulation  Still  attorneys general have jurisdiction to sue institutions operating in their states under state consumer protection laws and they could join forces to pursue cases nationally  Attorneys general contacted by Reuters and the Democratic Attorneys General Association  representing 22 officials  or nearly half the top state attorneys in the country  said they were prepared to take on more cases  Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said his office s consumer finance division now had 27 attorneys  compared with 11 four years ago    Consequently  we are well positioned to use all the tools available to us to protect Washingtonians if a new leader of the CFPB does not share director Cordray s vigor for protecting consumers   the Democrat said   Before the consumer watchdog was created  states often took the lead in cases involving consumer lenders  As Ohio s attorney general  Cordray  for example  led the investigation of financial firms which precipitated the financial crisis  winning more than  2 billion in settlements for the state and its pension funds  Consumer advocacy groups have generally applauded the work of both the CFPB and the states on consumer protections  but some Republican attorneys general have sided with Trump on the need to rein in the federal watchdog   In a Nov  27 letter to Trump  Republican attorneys from West Virginia  Texas  Alabama  Arkansas and Oklahoma said Mulvaney would help curb  the CFPB s practice of overreaching regulation that harms the interests of consumers and small financial institutions   Anticipating more state activity  Maria Earley  partner at the law firm Reed Smith  has been advising clients facing CFPB charges against stalling in hopes the watchdog will become more lenient under Trump   You may want to litigate to run out the clock  but you re going to have six  seven  eight states who will start looking into you   Earley said  adding she has settled three CFPB cases for clients since Trump took office  Reuters could not independently verify this number  Michelle Rogers  a partner with Buckley Sandler  said Wall Street may end up with increased regulatory complexity rather than relief as the state attorneys step in   They are more nimble than a big federal agency  They have their own staff  and their own agenda  and they can send out a subpoena on a whim on a broader set of issues   she said   This story corrects 18th paragraph to attribute idea to C  Boyden Gray  instead of Ori Lev

7754,229269,EFX,The Senate is quietly about to pass the biggest rollback of Wall Street regulations since the financial crisis,news,The Senate appears set this week to pass the Economic Growth  Regulatory Relief  and Consumer Protection Act  The legislation  more commonly known as the Crapo bill  includes a rollback of many banking regulations  While it is designed to ease the burden on small community banks  it would also benefit larger regional banks and credit reporting agencies  A major overhaul of the US financial system s regulatory structure is set to pass the Senate this week in a move that could relax some of the most stringent post financial crisis regulations for dozens of banks  Supporters of the legislation   officially known as the Economic Growth  Regulatory Relief  and Consumer Protection Act but more commonly referred to as the Crapo bill after its author  the Senate banking committee chair  Mike Crapo   say it will free up regional banks from burdensome regulations and give consumers easier access to credit  Opponents  such as Sen  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  say the bill  and possibly set the industry up for another devastating crisis  Despite pushback from Warren and other Democrats  the bill appears to be in great shape to pass the Senate    particularly those running for reelection this year in states President Donald Trump won in 2016  have jumped on board  The  SIFI  change The bill s most consequential provision would come from an increase in the threshold for a financial institution to be designated a Systemically Important Financial Institution  The move has long been favored by Republicans in Congress  the Trump administration    and some Democrats  Banks with the SIFI designation must  and oversight because their failure is seen as a danger to the economy  For instance  SIFI institutions must  that lay out how a bank would sell off assets in the event of a bankruptcy without disturbing the broader financial system  The increased threshold  to  250 billion in assets from  50 billion  would affect several large regional banks  including BB T  NYSE BBT   Fifth Third Bank  and SunTrust  which would no longer be subject to the more stringent SIFI rules  The number of SIFI institutions  from 38  Lawmakers who favor the bill say that the SIFI designation was never meant to apply to regional banks and that the regulation has made it difficult for them to operate and for consumers to access credit  Opponents of the bill  however  note that some institutions that helped precipitate the financial crisis had a smaller asset pile than  250 billion  Warren pointed to Countrywide  a mortgage lender that helped contribute to the crisis while holding about  210 billion in assets   If this bill passes  the next Countrywide will be regulated as if it were some tiny  little community bank      That s staggeringly dangerous for the American economy   Other changes In addition to the SIFI adjustment  the Crapo bill includes several proposed tweaks for smaller banks and other financial institutions  Most of those changes are designed to ease regulation and allow businesses to engage in different types of lending and investing  Here s a rundown of some of the other major provisions  The bill would  Increase the threshold for banks to undergo the annual stress test from the Federal Reserve  to  250 billion from  10 billion  Banks with assets of  100 billion to  250 billion would have to wait 18 months for an exemption and could still be tested periodically  If an institution fails these stress tests  which judge the systemic risk from the bank in the event of a severe downturn in asset values  the bank could be subject to additional regulations  Exempt banks with less than  10 billion in assets from the so called Volcker rule  The rule  named after the former Fed chair Paul Volcker  prohibits depository institutions from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in certain hedge funds and private equity firms   cutting down on the type of risky investments a bank can make  Include carveouts for smaller community banks with less than a certain amount in assets  relaxing rules on what types of real estate loans the banks can make and how much capital they need on hand  Force credit reporting agencies like Equifax  NYSE EFX  and TransUnion to give consumers free credit freezes  but also shield the agencies from certain class action lawsuits and allow the firms to offer credit checks for mortgage applications  Crapo released some minor last minute adjustments to more closely adhere to the House s conservative approach to deregulation  said Jaret Seiberg  a financial services analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group  Moving it closer to the House s goals  he said  was an attempt to ease the bill s passage   To us  this suggests that Senate GOP leaders want the House to simply approve the Senate bill as written rather than adopt changes that would require a conference   Seiberg wrote in a note to clients on Monday   A conference could push enactment of the bill to fall and even put enactment at risk as it is hard to see the Senate accepting any other changes   While the timing of a vote on the bill is uncertain  the Senate must first go through a series of proposed amendments  A vote to prevent a filibuster passed easily Monday  Isaac Boltansky  a policy analyst at the research firm Compass Point  said that indicated the full bill should get through the Senate this week   Notably  the contingent of moderate Democrats supporting the bill held through this vote  which signals that passage remains likely   Boltansky wrote on Tuesday   Although lawmakers are still lacking a time agreement to consider amendments  all

7788,229303,EFX,Justice Department weighs changes to Obama era financial task force,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Justice Department is weighing whether a financial enforcement task force created during the Obama administration in the wake of the housing crisis is still relevant  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Wednesday 
The department s scrutiny of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force is part of a broader review by a new working group  which Rosenstein said will be offering up suggestions  on promoting individual accountability and corporate cooperation  
 We are also reviewing the mandate of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to evaluate whether it continues to meet current needs   Rosenstein said in a speech to the U S  Chamber of Commerce  without giving specific reasons for the review 
The financial task force was launched in November 2009 by former Attorney General Eric Holder  former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Schapiro and other top government officials 
The group was tasked with unearthing fraud following the 2007 2009 financial crisis  including fraud related to toxic mortgage securities that were sold to investors and soured as homeowners defaulted on their mortgages 
The Justice Department was heavily criticized during the Obama administration for its lackluster record on bringing criminal cases against big banks and their executives following the crisis 
The five year statute of limitations to bring criminal charges has long since lapsed  However  the department in recent years has brought a number of high profile civil cases against big banks using the Financial Institutions Reform  Recovery and Enforcement Act  which has a 10 year statute of limitations 
The task force was credited by the department in helping bring a number of those crisis era cases  as well as other cases unrelated to the crisis  such as criminal charges against a former Valeant executive in connection with an alleged kickback scheme 
Rosenstein has previously said the department is reviewing its corporate prosecution policy outlined under the so called Yates Memo  penned by his predecessor Sally Yates during the Obama administration 
That memo emphasized holding individuals accountable and called on companies to cooperate by providing the department details about people who may have been involved in wrongdoing 
Rosenstein did not announce any changes on Wednesday  though he said the department will carefully weigh whether companies cooperate and if their compliance programs are  applied faithfully  
Without mentioning any company by name  he warned about the risks of delaying in disclosing cyber attacks  saying it  may prevent other innocent parties from taking steps to protect themselves

7800,229315,EFX,In class action policy war  data backs big business  Frankel,news,By Alison Frankel NEW YORK  Reuters     The opinions expressed here are those of the author  a columnist for Reuters   One of the critical junctures in the U S  Senate s late night dismantling of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule shielding consumers  right to band together to sue financial institutions was  according to The New York Times  an Oct  23 Treasury Department report that used the CFPB s own data to criticize the bureau s rule  EPIC REPORT  In 2015  after a three year study  the CFPB issued an epic report contrasting consumers  recovery in class actions with their results in individual arbitration against banks and credit card companies   The bureau considered its study unequivocal proof that class actions against financial institutions deliver vastly more money to vastly more people than arbitration  With the study as its justification  the CFPB issued a rule in July 2017 that prohibited the institutions it regulates from imposing mandatory arbitration on their customers  The Treasury Department pulled different numbers from the CFPB study to conclude that class actions deliver a lot of money to plaintiffs  lawyers but little benefit to aggrieved consumers   Only 13 percent of the cases result in classwide recovery  Treasury said  and few affected consumers   on average  just 4 percent   bother to claim their share  That s not surprising  Treasury said  since the CFPB data show the average claim from class settlements to be about  32   Plaintiffs  lawyers  meanwhile  collect an average of more than  1 million per case   Based on the bureau s own data  it is far more likely that the rule will generate massive economic costs   borne by businesses and consumers alike   that dwarf the speculative benefits of the bureau s theorized increase in compliance   Treasury said  Nothing in the Treasury report is news to class action lawyers  whether they sue corporations or defend them  Low claims rates and high transaction costs are always the first resort for class action critics  But the outcome of the Senate vote shows the power of those data points  BUT CONSUMERS DON T USE ARBITRATION Class action proponents  meanwhile  don t have equally provocative numbers to counter critics  data   There s plenty of data to prove arbitration does not compensate consumers victimized by systemic corporate misconduct  For the most part  as the CFPB study proved  consumers don t bother to bring individual arbitration claims against financial institutions  Millions of consumers were members in class actions against financial institutions during the time period covered in the CFPB study  By contrast  the CFPB found  fewer than 500 a year filed individual claims   and most of them lost their cases   In a forthcoming law review article on the impact of mandatory arbitration provisions in employment litigation  New York University law professor Cynthia Estlund crunched the available data to conclude that 98 percent of employees covered by mandatory arbitration do not bother to assert claims   Business groups continue to tout arbitration as a fast  low cost vehicle for redress  Maybe  but consumers aren t using it  WHY PROPONENTS LACK EQUIVALENT DATA But there are two big reasons why class action proponents don t have data to show the benefits of group litigation outweigh the costs  One is a matter of procedure  The other involves the very purpose of class actions  First  there s no way to prove how many consumers  by percentage or in the aggregate  receive compensation from class actions because no one has collected that information  Once federal judges grant final approval of class actions and legal fees  the cases usually fall out of sight  Settlement administrators typically send out notices and process claims without anyone asking for a final accounting of how much money has been sent to class members  Occasionally a judge will demand information about claims rates and disbursements  but those are exceptions  The CFPB made a determined effort to analyze the numbers and could only come up with data in 105 cases   It found an average claims rate of 21 percent and a median rate of 8 percent   FILLING THE DATA VACUUM The U S  House of Representatives passed a bill earlier this year that called for class action lawyers to submit an accounting of payouts in every case to the Federal Judicial Center and the Administrative Office of the U S  Courts  The Judicial Center would then be required to annually compile data on claims rates  total payments to class members  average and median recoveries  and  of course  payments to class counsel  The bill  which also contains a defendants  wish list of fetters on class actions  is stalled in the Senate and considered unlikely to become law  but even class action proponents otherwise skeptical of the House s ideas have said they re intrigued by the data collection proposal  New York University s Center on Civil Justice is hoping to fill the class action data vacuum  according to law professor Samuel Issacharoff  He told me Wednesday that the center wants to amass  close out  reports to judges who have overseen class actions  Issacharoff  who frequently works with class action lawyers on high stakes appeals  said he s convinced the data will show the cases deliver measurable benefits to class members  especially as technology provides new tools to identify and notify class members  Issacharoff pointed out that in some cases  like the e books antitrust class action against Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   tech has already eliminated the whole cumbersome claims process   The claims rate stuff is dramatically different than it used to be   Issacharoff said  Better accounting of class action payouts  in other words  could prove  or disprove   the efficacy of class actions as a vehicle for delivering compensation to supposedly harmed consumers  There are  however  no numbers to measure the other big benefit class action advocates believe they provide  deterring corporate wrongdoing  CLASS ACTIONS AS DETERRENCE Class actions were created merely as a procedural way to aggregate individual claims that might otherwise not be feasible  But as Vanderbilt law professor Brian Fitzpatrick has written  the cases have taken on the additional public interest mantle of holding corporations accountable to their victims  Fitzpatrick argues  in fact  that policing corporate conduct has become the primary purpose of class actions  Punishing and deterring corporate wrongdoing was the rallying cry for class action proponents trying to convince the Senate to keep the CFPB rule in place   Public interest groups such as Public Justice and Public Citizen said mandatory arbitration allows companies such as  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  and Equifax  NYSE EFX  to evade responsibility for allegedly taking advantage of their customers  As Reuters reported Wednesday  both Equifax and Wells Fargo have said they will allow customers to pursue class actions   And other corporations  by this theory  will be emboldened to rip off consumers if they know they won t face class actions  The CFPB built that assumption into its rule barring mandatory arbitration clauses  But as the Oct  23 Treasury Department report said   The bureau has identified no evidence indicating that firms that do not use arbitration clauses treat their customers better or have higher levels of compliance with the law   The CFPB  in other words  couldn t measure the deterrent effect of class actions  Vanderbilt prof Fitzpatrick surveyed the class action literature and came up with a few studies that support the deterrence theory  but even he hasn t attempted to quantify it  DEEPER STATISTICS NEEDED  If you can t put a number on a primary justification for class actions   and your opponents  meanwhile  can shout about fat lawyers  fees and low claims rates   you re inevitably going to be at a disadvantage in policy fights  I ve spent nearly my whole career thinking about class actions  I ve always started from the assumption that little guys deserve a right to work together to fight big guys  The data on mandatory arbitration certainly proves little guys are reluctant to bring their own cases  But at the moment  the data on class actions makes it all too easy for critics to argue their benefits for little guys are outweighed by the costs to big guys  Someday  I hope  we ll have deeper stats and can make more informed judgments about class actions   assuming actions like the Senate s dismantling of the CFPB rule don t wipe them out before we get there

7808,229323,EFX,How to cope with old medical debt,news,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK  Reuters    My kids got a great report from the dentist at their last checkup  From the receptionist  Not so much 
When I went to make an appointment for their next cleaning in six months  she shocked me by saying I owed nearly  3 000 in charges dating back to 2014 
 We have a payment plan   she said  trying to be helpful 
I needed information instead  and immediately concluded that plunking down my credit card was the wrong way to go 
Old medical bills plague many Americans  harming their credit scores and holding them hostage to collection agencies  They make up more than half of all collections items noted on credit reports  said Chi Chi Wu  an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center 
When confronted with a doubtful bill  there are ways to prevent it from putting a dent in your finances  Here are initial steps to take 
  Check the bill
Contact the insurance company first to make sure the charges are legit  Ask for a supervisor to escalate your case 
If that fails  ask your employer s human resources department to step in  If that is not an option  search for independent medical billing advocates near you or nationwide services like CoPatient com  Some charge flat fees  but most work on contingency for a percentage of the amount they save you 
Sunni Patterson  co founder of Medical Bill   Claim Resolution  an nationwide advocacy company based in Illinois  said it sometimes works best when one of her advocates is on a three way call with the patient and the insurance company 
  Keep negotiating
In my case  the dentist had no record of being paid for a slew of cavity fillings in 2014  As is pretty standard  I had signed an agreement that I was legally responsible for those bills 
When I tried to negotiate with the dentist s office  it would not budge on the balance due 
But I kept calling back to talk to billing to keep the dialogue going 
 Providers are a bit more sensitive to not losing you as a customer and maintaining their reputations   said Wu 
And they can negotiate if they want to  said Adria Gross  chief executive of MedWise Insurance Advocacy  based in Monroe  New York  She has negotiated medical bills down from  1 million  One bill of  257 000 ended up being only  7 000 by the end 
What works best is evidence  I spent a couple of hours on the phone with Aetna  NYSE AET   and they found receipts that showed the dentist had cashed checks for a large part of the balance  Negotiating leverage achieved 
  Check your credit report
Often a debt collector will not call or send notices  You only find out about old debt because you are buying a car or house  It is called  debt parking   or  more politely   passive collecting  
One way to combat this  Check your credit report every year  which is free     said Greg McBride  chief financial analyst for Bankrate com 
The stakes can be high   even a paid collection stays on your credit report for up to seven years  although it will have a diminished effect on your credit score over time 
A new law prevents medical debt from landing on your credit report for 180 days  giving you time to sort it out  New credit score models do not even count medical collections  said McBride  but they are not yet in wide use 
  Negotiate some more
To dispute an old bill in collection  pursue multiple avenues at once  said Gerri Detweiler  education director for Nav com 
First file a dispute with the three main credit bureaus   TransUnion  Equifax  NYSE EFX  and Experian  Next  go to the collections agent  If you can work out a payment  ask the agent to recall the notice  and get this in writing  before you pay so that it is wiped from your credit history 
 Technically  their agreements say no pay for removal deals  but it is worth making part of the conversation   said Detweiler 
Finally  go to the government to lodge a complaint   either your state s attorney general or insurance commissioner  or to the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau    
MedWise s Gross had a client who used the strategy of getting a member of Congress involved  The client faced a hospital bill of  50 000  of which only  50 was initially covered by insurance  The approach drew attention and the bill was ultimately reduced to nothing ",2018-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/how-to-cope-with-old-medical-debt-1522612,1522612

The disclosure was swiftly met with criticism because of the delay in alerting the public to the hack  as well as problems with the website Equifax set up for people to check whether their details were at risk 
The hack is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and has prompted promises for inquiries in both the Senate and House of Representatives 
Equifax officials are also reportedly being investigated by the US Justice Department after selling stock before the company revealed a data breach that exposed the personal information of millions of Americans

Earlier on Tuesday  Chicago Fed president Charles Evans said that he broadly agrees with his colleagues who believe rates should rise gradually  but he thought it would be a  misstep  to act again before there was more evidence of inflation recovering

7877,229392,EFX,Exclusive  U S  Homeland Security found SEC had  critical  cyber weaknesses in January,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Department of Homeland Security detected five  critical  cyber security weaknesses on the Securities and Exchange Commission s computers as of January 23  2017  according to a confidential weekly report reviewed by Reuters  The report s findings raise fresh questions about a 2016 cyber breach into the U S  market regulator s corporate filing system known as  EDGAR   SEC Chairman Jay Clayton disclosed late Wednesday that the agency learned in August 2017 that hackers may have exploited the 2016 incident for illegal insider trading  The January DHS report  which shows its weekly findings after scanning computers for cyber weaknesses across most of the federal civilian government agencies  revealed that the SEC at the time had the fourth most  critical  vulnerabilities  It was not clear if the vulnerabilities detected by DHS are directly related to the cyber breach disclosed by the SEC  But it shows that even after the SEC says it patched  promptly  the software vulnerability after the 2016 hack  critical vulnerabilities still plagued the regulator s systems  The hack  two weeks after credit reporting company Equifax  N EFX  said hackers had stolen data on more than 143 million U S  customers  has sent shockwaves through the U S  financial sector  An SEC spokesman did not have any comment on the report s findings   It is unclear if any of those critical vulnerabilities  detected after a scan of 114 SEC computers and devices  still pose a threat   During the Obama administration  such scans were done on a weekly basis   I absolutely think any critical vulnerability like that should be acted on immediately   said Tony Scott  the former federal chief information officer during the Obama administration who now runs his own cybersecurity consulting firm   This is what was at the root of the Equifax hack  There was a critical vulnerability that went unpatched for some long period of time  And if you re a hacker  you are going to     try to see if you can exploit it in some fashion or another  So there is a race against the clock   For the past several years  the Department of Homeland Security has been producing a report known as the  Federal Cyber Exposure Scorecard   It provides a weekly snapshot to more than 80 civilian government agencies about potential outstanding cyber weaknesses and how long they have persisted without being patched  A directive by Homeland Security requires agencies to address critical vulnerabilities within 30 days  though sometimes that deadline can be difficult to meet if it might disrupt a government system  The January snapshot shows improvements have been made across the government since May 2015  when there were a total of 363 critical vulnerabilities on devices across all of the civilian agencies  according to the report  As of January 23  by contrast  there were a total of 40 critical vulnerabilities across the agencies reviewed by DHS and another 280 weaknesses categorized as  active high   which is the second more severe category   The top four agencies with the most  critical  vulnerabilities as of January 23 included the Environmental Protection Agency  the Department of Health and Human Services  the General Services Administration and the SEC  However  more vulnerabilities do not necessarily mean one agency is worse than another because things depend on how many computers or devices known as  hosts  were scanned and what kinds of information could potentially be exposed  
 All it takes is one   Scott said   You can have one host and one vulnerability and your risk might be 10 times as high as someone who has 10 hosts and ten vulnerabilities  ",2017-09-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-us-homeland-security-found-sec-had-critical-cyber-weaknesses-in-january-531508,531508

7883,229398,EFX,Stocks   Dow Returns to Positive for the Year After 400 Point Rally,news,"Investing com   The Dow returned to positive territory for the year Thursday  recouping losses from a rout the prior day  led by surge in tech as bargain hunting investors piled into beaten up stocks on the back of reassuring earnings 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1 63   The S P 500 rose 1 86   while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2 95   Strong gains for the Dow and Nasdaq saw both indexes escape correction territory  defined as a 10  decline from the most recent peak 
The major averages were rescued from correction territory as investors viewed the rout from a day earlier as a buying opportunity  with tech attracting the bulk of investor dollars following bullish earnings from Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Twitter  NYSE TWTR  
Microsoft posted earnings and revenue Wednesday after the close that handily beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines  sending its shares soaring nearly 6   Twitter rallied more than 15  after comfortably exceeding consensus revenue and earnings estimates 
Elsewhere on the earnings front  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  swung to a surprise third quarter profit  though some on Wall Street put the brakes on optimism  questioning whether this is  as good as it gets  for the electric automaker 
Tesla s exposure to China tariffs on imported components and its offering of lower priced vehicles would likely compress margins in the fourth quarter  Goldman Sachs said   We question if this is not as good as it gets  for Tesla  from a near term upside surprise for shares  
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   however  tempered optimism on earnings after it guided fourth quarter revenues below consensus estimates  Its shares slumped about 15  
Still  chipmakers managed a decent showing for the day  led by a rally in Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA  and Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU   The SPDR S P Semiconductor  NYSE XSD  gained more than 2   clawing back some losses from a day earlier  when the sector suffered its worst slump since Nov  2018 
Energy also contributed to the rebound in the broader average as oil prices continued to pare early week losses on renewed hopes that OPEC will cut supplies before the year is out 
The spring loaded rebound on Wall Street comes as analysts asserted the recent selloff was overdone as the outlook for earnings and U S  economic growth remained favourable 
 The nearly 10  decline in U S  stocks over the last month appears excessive relative to the risks   said Mark Haefele  Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management 
Market participants will get a first look at the pace of U S  economic growth on Friday  with the released of preliminary third quarter GDP data 
In corporate news   Take Two Interactive  Software  NASDAQ TTWO  rose nearly 9  ahead of the release of its popular Western shoot em up  Red Dead Redemption II   due Friday  expected to be a big hit among gamers  Analysts didn t hold back in their remarks about the importance of the game to Take Two s growth

problematic and we ve got to be serious about how we protect that information as a regulator   Huizenga said   The SEC disclosure came two weeks after credit reporting company  Equifax Inc   N EFX  said a breach had exposed sensitive personal of data up to 143 million U S  customers  This followed last year s cyber attack on SWIFT  the global bank messaging system  It is particularly embarrassing for the SEC and its new boss Clayton  who has made tackling cyber crime one of the top enforcement issues   The chairman obviously recognizes the irony of the SEC potentially serving as the unwitting tipper in an insider trading scheme   said John Reed Stark  president of a cyber consulting firm and a former SEC staff member  The SEC has said it was investigating the source of the hack but did not say exactly when it happened or what sort of non public data was retrieved  The agency said the attackers had exploited a weakness in a part of the EDGAR system and it had  promptly  fixed it  Most reports filed with the SEC  generally don t contain super sensitive information   and any insider trading would have taken place soon after company filings were made but before they were released to the public  said Gary LaBranche  president of National Investor Relations Institute   People are shocked and disappointed   LaBranche said  Members of the institute  who work with 1 600 publicly traded companies  will be examining their trading reports for any unusual activity that could be tied to disclosures  he said   U S  President Donald Trump s administration has prioritized protection of federal agency networks after breaches during the Obama administration  including at the Office of Personnel Management  Internal Revenue Service and State Department   Trump in May signed an executive order requiring agencies to use a specific framework to assess and manage cyber risk  and prepare a report within 90 days about how they implement it  The SEC did not respond when asked about that review or whether it triggered the disclosure  But Clayton said in his Wednesday statement that he began reviewing the agency s cyber risk in May   SEC Commissioners did not learn of the breach until recently  In a statement  Republican SEC Commissioner Mike Piwowar  who for part of 2017 also served as acting chairman  said he was  recently informed for the first time that an intrusion occurred in 2016   Erica Elliott Richardson  a spokeswoman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  the top U S  derivatives regulator  said in an emailed statement the agency constantly reviewed and updated its cybersecurity protections to guard against the growing threat of a breach    Our agency has successfully thwarted hundreds of attempted breaches   she added   The Canadian Securities Administrators  an umbrella group representing Canada s provincial securities regulators  said on Thursday it would conduct an additional security review   CYBER SLEUTHS NEEDED Clayton will be grilled on the incident and its aftermath at a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday   Banking Committee member Senator Mark Warner said in a statement he intended to ask about SEC thresholds for requiring companies to disclose breaches  and flagged the connection between the SEC s disclosure and its market oversight role    Government and businesses need to step up their efforts to protect our most sensitive personal and commercial information   Warner said  Securities industry rules require companies disclose cyber breaches to investors and the SEC has investigated firms over whether they should have reported incidents sooner   There is an element of   Do as we say  not as we do  to this   said Matt Rossi  a former counsel in the SEC s enforcement division  The lack of details from the SEC about the breach will likely raise questions about what other EDGAR data may have been exposed  such as information related to ongoing financial investigations and sensitive personal information  Rossi said   Former SEC Chair Mary Jo White  in office when the hack occurred  told Reuters in 2016 that cyber security posed the biggest risk to the U S  financial system  The U S  Department of Homeland Security had detected five  critical  cyber security weaknesses on the SEC s computers as of Jan  23  according to a confidential weekly report reviewed by Reuters on Thursday  And in July  months after the breach was detected  a congressional watchdog warned that the SEC was  at unnecessary risk of compromise  because of deficiencies in its information systems  The SEC shut down a specialized unit on cyber crimes as part of a 2010 reorganization

7902,229417,EFX,Equifax under pressure from banks to shape up,news,"By David Henry and Dan Freed NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  consumer credit reporting bureau  Equifax Inc   N EFX  risks losing support from banks unless it can show its database on millions of borrowers is secure from another cyber attack  Banks are critical to Equifax s operations as they give the company information on consumer debts and payments which it compiles into credit reports sold to other creditors  including mortgage and credit card lenders  landlords and hospitals    If we don t feel that they can do the job  then we will obviously look at whether we want to continue to do business with them   said an executive at a large bank who declined to be quoted by name  But a withdrawal of support for Equifax by banks would come at the cost of further reliance on the other two major collectors of U S  consumer credit and employment histories  Experian plc  L EXPN  and  TransUnion   N TRU   U S  financial industry practice usually involves collecting credit scores from all three credit agencies before bundling loans made on homes  autos and credit cards and selling the securities in debt markets  Government backed mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  for example  check with the three credit reporting agencies  The difficulty of ending such a practice could shelter Equifax from a sudden revolt by banks   Given the level of interdependence between lenders and these data providers  they have a vested interest in there being more than two and would like Equifax to still exist   said James Thomas  an analyst of corporate credit at Standard   Poor s   If there s only two players  then they have less ability to play them against one another  in negotiating prices for credit reports  Thomas said  Rick Smith  CEO of  TriCo Bancshares   O TCBK   a Chico  California based lender with  4 5 billion in assets  said it would be difficult to stop using Equifax   The reality is we re dependent upon them  as most lenders are   But the willingness of lenders to support Equifax is being tested by the way the agency has managed the fall out from its disclosure on Sept  7 that hackers had obtained access to information on 143 million people   Most of the major financial institutions learned about it through the media   the banker said   And  their responsiveness to customers has been slow and unclear as well  We would go down to two  bureaus  if we ultimately get to the point where we think that is necessary   Equifax said in a statement that it was supporting any customers who may have been impacted by the hack   We value our banking customers and have been in close communication with them   PRIVILEGED POSITION IN JEOPARDY Until the breach was acknowledged  investors in Equifax were confident that the company s business model involved selling products that lenders need and that newcomers cannot duplicate  The welter of financial information that the credit bureaus hold  including the borrowing practices of millions of consumers  would be difficult for anyone else to gather  Most countries have no more than one or two firms that have collected consumer credit information nationally   To even come close to replicating them  you would need to go to pretty much every major lender in the credit ecosystem and convince them to include you in their data provisioning   Thomas said  Because of the hacking banks may now be even more reluctant now to share their customer information with a newcomer to the industry  Thomas added  The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission s admission this week that it was also hacked last year and the information possibly used for insider trading shows how widespread cyber breaches have become   But the scope of the Equifax breach has made the company s privileged position appear vulnerable  Not only is there the risk of widespread losses to fraud  but lenders also risk a slowdown in the pace of account openings and credit card approvals as they take longer to check a person s identity  Equifax has lost  5 8 billion of stock market value since Sept  7  one third of what its shares were worth before the breach was disclosed  Brian Gudmundson  a lawyer at Zimmerman Reed in Minneapolis  said he is preparing for a possible suit on behalf of thousands of lenders against Equifax   There are going to be costs that we re not even imagining right now   said Gudmundson  who represented lenders in a  39 million settlement with  Target  Corp  NYSE TGT  in 2015 over a cyber breach of its credit card system   The very biggest banks  however  tend to work out legal claims on their own  Gudmundson said   So far  bankers say  they have not noticed an increase in fraudulent activity that would suggest the data exposed at Equifax is being used  Nor is it clear whether Equifax fell short of industry standards for protecting against cyber attacks which banks are quick to say could happen to any company

7904,229419,EFX,Democrats Gaining Ground in Midterms Won t Be Bad News for Banks,news," Bloomberg     With Democrats likely to take control of the U S  House in midterm elections  analysts expect some near term pressure on bank stocks but say it won t be all bad news 
Representative Maxine Waters  D Calif   at the helm of the Financial Services Committee might seek to return attention to  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  s misdeeds  Some also expect fresh calls to break up the biggest banks  Even so  most market watchers anticipate President Donald Trump s efforts to ease bank rules will continue  as his regulators are firmly in place 
That s good for banks  which have outperformed the broader market since Trump s 2016 election victory  It may not be enough to boost their stocks  as easier rules  tax cuts and fiscal spending may already be priced in  Still  Veda Partners  Henrietta Treyz said the very passing of the election itself will eliminate uncertainty and could help shares rise 
Republicans are forecast to retain control of the Senate  Cowen s Jaret Seiberg wrote that gridlock in Congress would mean bank regulators continue  to advance proposals to moderate the existing regime   That s why Cowen is still  overall positive  on the sector from a policy perspective  especially for regional banks  The risk for big banks  Seiberg said   remains tied to populist anger  
Capital Alpha s Ian Katz is skeptical a Democratic House could change much  as long as the Senate stays Republican  Waters at the Financial Services Committee could ask for hearings on Wells Fargo   Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX   and  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  AG s financial ties to President Trump  but  the House alone won t be able to follow through  
Katz added that a close look at the House races shows a large percentage of the 2019 freshman class may be centrists    not   let s blow up the place  Socialists  
Compass Point s Isaac Boltansky expects  a legislative logjam  with a divided Congress  along with  a forceful oversight agenda in the House  a steady pace of confirmations in the Senate  and a slow lurch from deadline to deadline on Capitol Hill  
Whichever way the House goes  Boltansky sees little chance for overhauling the mortgage finance system  though there may be a chance for administrative change at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
The Trump administration  has already engaged the regulatory gears   with Trump appointees controlling nine of 10 key agencies  Height Capital Markets  Ed Groshans said in an email  A Democratic majority House might create  headline risks  for large institutions like JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   Capital One and U S  Bancorp due to hearings  but any House passed legislation would likely die in a Republican Senate 
If Republicans retain control of the House and Senate  Groshans said large financial institutions would benefit from perceptions Republicans are more sympathetic to big banks  On the flip side  a  Blue Wave  would trigger investor fears Democrats are less sympathetic  But  there s little real policy risk for the sector even under a Democratic sweep  he said 
If Republicans hold the House  the most significant consequence may be further presidential criticism of the Federal Reserve  Redburn s Melissa Kidd and Clemmie Elwes wrote in a note  They think that could push the Fed to opt for more tightening  forcing banks to struggle to optimize the benefits of higher rates while curbing the impact on credit and deposit costs ",2018-10-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/democrats-gaining-ground-in-midterms-wont-be-bad-news-for-banks-1665493,1665493

7907,229422,EFX,Prison time  hefty fines for data privacy violations  draft U S  Senate bill,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A senior Democratic U S  senator on Thursday unveiled draft legislation that would allow hefty fines and as much as 20 year prison terms for executives who violate privacy and cybersecurity standards 
Senator Ron Wyden released a draft of legislation that would grant the Federal Trade Commission authority to write privacy regulations  The measure would also allow maximum fines of 4 percent of revenue   matching European rules adopted earlier this year 
 It s time for some sunshine on this shadowy network of information sharing   Wyden said in a statement   My bill creates radical transparency for consumers  gives them new tools to control their information and backs it up with tough rules  
Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue since massive breaches compromised the personal information of millions of U S  internet and social media users  as well as breaches involving large retailers and credit reporting agency  Equifax Inc   N EFX  
Wyden would also create a national  Do Not Track  system to stop companies from tracking internet users by sharing or selling data and targeting advertisements based on their personal information  The bill would also subject senior executives at companies with privacy violations to fines of  5 million or more 
 Facebook Inc   O FB   the world s largest social media network  said earlier this year that the personal information of about 70 million U S  users was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  It said last month that cyber attackers stole data from 29 million Facebook accounts using an automated program that moved from one friend to the next

7952,229467,EFX,Some U S  banks already comply with new class action  arbitration rule,news,"By Lisa Lambert
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Senator Elizabeth Warren  who opposes efforts to dismantle a new rule allowing customers to sue financial companies in class actions  released letters on Tuesday from U S  bank CEOs in which they declined to defend lobbying against the measure and several said they already comply with it 
Warren asked the bank CEOs if they believed the rule should be reversed 
 Despite the claims of their paid lobbyists  not a single one of the 16 CEOs I wrote was willing to defend efforts to gut the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau s  pro consumer arbitration rule   she said in a statement 
The letters to liberal Warren showed Capital One   Bank of America  NYSE BAC   Ally Financial  T D  Bank and HSBC North America rarely use mandatory arbitration clauses  where customer must give up the right to sue and agree to take possible future disputes to closed door mediation as a condition of opening accounts 
 American Express   NYSE AXP   Citi  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   PNC and SunTrust give new customers the opportunity to opt out of the clauses within a limited timeframe  the letters show 
The rule  finalized by the CFPB in July  does not end arbitration  Instead  it says customers cannot be forced to only use arbitration in settling disputes  The practice has spread like wildfire across industries following the Supreme Court 2011 s decision that the clauses are legal 
The banking industry says the rule  effective next year  will drive up costs with time consuming class actions  It also says arbitration is more effective in delivering restitution to individuals  A CFPB study found customers receive higher awards through arbitration than lawsuits on average but noted fewer arbitration cases lead to awards 
Saying the rule only benefits trial attorneys  Republicans in the House of Representatives swiftly voted to kill it  The Senate  where Democrats and some conservatives say the rule restores customers  constitutional rights to due process  has been slower to act  Under the Congressional Review Act  both chambers must approve a repeal resolution to kill the rule 
Democrats also say arbitrations are rigged against customers because they are handled out of the public eye and arbitrators are often paid by companies 
Mandatory arbitration clauses have grabbed the spotlight over the last year  after they blocked customers from suing  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co in the phony account scandal   Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX  included arbitration clauses when it offered credit monitoring to victims of its recent hack  but then removed them under public pressure ",2017-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/some-us-banks-already-comply-with-new-class-action-arbitration-rule-528138,528138

7992,229507,EFX,Equifax  First the hacking  then the lawsuits,news,"By Jonathan Stempel  Reuters    Seven hours is all it took for  Equifax Inc   N EFX  to be hit with two lawsuits over a hacking that may have compromised personal information for 143 million American consumers  It could take years for the credit reporting company to end the legal fallout from the unprecedented breach   Damages to the class are limited only to the imagination of thieves   John Yanchunis  a lawyer at Morgan   Morgan who filed one of the lawsuits  in Atlanta federal court  said in an interview on Friday   This could be the gift that keeps on giving for years   The lawsuits were filed on behalf of consumers accusing Equifax of negligence  or willful misconduct  in failing to properly safeguard Social Security and driver s license numbers  birth dates  addresses and sometimes credit card data  More lawsuits are expected on behalf of shareholders  They could claim that Equifax s stock price was inflated because the company  executives and directors defrauded them about Equifax s ability to protect data  and should not have waited until Sept  7 to disclose a hacking uncovered on July 29  Some lawsuits could also target sales by three Equifax executives of nearly  1 8 million of stock within a few days of the breach s discovery  Equifax has said they did not know about the breach when making their sales  which were not prearranged  Law firm Hagens Berman said on Friday it was investigating the share sales  as well as unusual option trading activity   Equifax options drew an unusually large trade on August 21  when 2 500 put options betting on Equifax shares dipping below  135 by September 15  traded for a total price of about  181 000  On paper  these puts were worth about  2 73 million in late afternoon trading on Friday  according to Thomson Reuters data  Buying of put options conveys the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future and indicates a bearish bias  while selling puts would imply a bullish outlook  While the size of the trade was far in excess of the stock s average daily trading volume of less than 50 contracts a day  it was not immediately clear whether the trader bought or sold these options    We re focused on what appears to be suspiciously timed insider selling within two trading days after the Company says it discovered the breach  the option activity and why management took so long to inform investors of the breach   said Hagens Berman partner Reed Kathrein in a statement  Congress  and regulators like the attorneys general of New York and Illinois  are also probing the breach  Equifax handles data on more than 820 million consumers and 91 million businesses worldwide   There s a panoply of things Equifax will face   said Timothy Pestotnik  a San Diego lawyer who works on class actions and was involved in litigation against Toyota over unintended vehicle acceleration   It will require a lot of lawyers   Equifax did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Its stock price fell as much as 17 8 percent on Friday  wiping out more than  3 billion of market value  AVALANCHE Many private lawsuits raising similar claims against Equifax will likely be merged by a federal judicial panel into so called multidistrict litigation before a single judge  Such litigation reduces the potential for conflicting rulings and unnecessary legal costs  and is often conducted in a court near a defendant s headquarters  or which has familiarity with similar lawsuits   Those factors make the federal court in Atlanta a possible home for Equifax litigation  Equifax is based in that city  and the court handled nationwide litigation over a 2014 breach at Atlanta based  Home Depot  Inc  N HD  affecting more than 50 million cardholders  Plaintiffs might also prefer Atlanta because  unlike in some courts  they would not need to show thieves actually used their stolen data  The initial theft should be enough to confer legal standing   There will be an avalanche of consumer cases   said Yanchunis  who also leads litigation in California against Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  over hackings affecting more than 1 billion users  though involving less sensitive data    It s a better than educated guess the cases will be centralized in Atlanta   Pestotnik said Equifax can also aid its own cause

7993,229508,EFX,Criticism of Equifax data breach response mounts  shares tumble,news,"By Dustin Volz and David Shepardson  Reuters     Equifax Inc   N EFX  faced a storm of criticism on Friday over a hack that may have compromised personal data for some 143 million Americans  with consumers clamoring for answers and cyber security experts questioning the response to the massive breach  Lawmakers and regulators joined the chorus  scrutinizing the company s follow up as it encouraged potential victims to sign up for free credit monitoring services  Equifax shares tumbled as much as 18 percent  the biggest one day drop in 16 years  as complaints mounted that the company s online and phone support systems were either broken or insufficient   The hack  among the largest ever recorded  was especially alarming due to the richness of the information exposed  which included names  birthdays  addresses and Social Security and driver s license numbers  cyber researchers said    Another day  another dumpster fire in cyber security   said Ryan Kalember  senior vice president of cyber security firm Proofpoint  The breach was  especially troubling  because companies that have suffered data breaches typically offer free credit monitoring services from firms like Equifax  which has now itself suffered a huge cyber attack  he added  Bigger hacks  such as those disclosed by Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  last year  did not put as much sensitive information at risk  Responding to criticism  Equifax apologized in a corporate statement Friday evening for any inconvenience caused by its support website or call center   It said the site was now functioning properly and that it had tripled the size of its call center team to more than 2 000 agents  with more to be added  Moody s Investors Service said on Friday that the breach would impede Equifax s growth over the next three to four quarters and hurt its reputation as a custodian of consumer data   The company would incur significant costs to remediate the breach  potential litigation and regulatory action  and higher cyber insurance premiums  Moody s said  But it said that Equifax s rating and stable outlook were not affected  Credit monitoring services such as Equifax collect vast amounts of financial information from consumers without their knowledge  working with banks and other lenders  for example  to track the creditworthiness of individuals  At least five state attorneys general  including those of New York and Illinois  said they were formally investigating the breach  nL2N1LP19R  Two proposed class action lawsuits  one filed in Portland  Oregon  and one in Atlanta  alleged that Equifax had been negligent in protecting consumer data   nL2N1LP14B  Atlanta based Equifax disclosed the breach on Thursday and said the company had discovered it on July 29  It said hackers accessed accounts between mid May and July  and some British and Canadian residents were also affected  nL4N1LO5FJ  The company has not said specifically how attackers were able to break in or why it did not disclose the breach sooner  Robert W  Baird   Co analyst Jeffrey Meuler wrote to clients that the hackers used a flaw in open source Struts software  distributed by the nonprofit Apache  NYSE APA  Software Foundation  Meuler in the note did not provide the source of the information  and he did not respond to requests for comment  Equifax did not respond to questions seeking comment  Struts is widely used in major companies  and an Apache spokeswoman said it appeared that Equifax had not applied the patches for flaws that have been discovered this year  In March  Apache warned of one flaw  and attack code soon circulated  with hackers exploiting taking advantage soon after that  researchers said  The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it is tracking the data breach  A U S  intelligence official told Reuters it was too soon to know if the attack was strictly criminal in nature or if it had the backing of a foreign government  WAIVED LEGAL RIGHTS  Equifax drew scrutiny for terms of service that accompanied a free credit monitoring offering to all U S  consumers worried about the data breach that it promoted on its support website   Agreeing to the terms appeared to forfeit some rights to sue individually or join a class action suit  but Equifax said on its website that the arbitration clause applied only to the credit monitoring offer and not to any damages caused by the recently discovered data breach  The U S  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  however  still had concerns with the terms associated with the free credit monitoring offer  It is  troubling that Equifax is forcing people to waive legal rights in order to receive fraud monitoring after the company s breach put their personal information at risk   a CFPB spokesman said in a statement   Some cyber security experts criticized Equifax for setting up a support website under a different domain than the company s main website  mirroring a tactic that can be used to fraudulently collect data   CALLS FOR HEARINGS The U S  House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee both announced plans to hold hearings examining the breach  Representative Ted Lieu asked Equifax why it waited so long to disclose the breach and has asked the House Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing with the three major credit reporting agencies to explain how they will prevent future attacks  Within the past two years  Equifax has had W 2 federal wage tax data stolen from its website and a subsidiary  Larger rival Experian Plc  L EXPN  reported a data breach two years ago involving some 15 million people  The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Finance Committee wrote to Equifax with a series of questions about its required safeguards and asked that committee staffers be briefed by Sept  15   Senator Richard Blumenthal pointed to Equifax s previous incidents and said it had  no excuse  for not strengthening cyber security  and called on the U S  Federal Trade Commission to investigate  Equifax shares closed down 13 7 percent at  123 23 after

In addition  Hurricane Irma will undoubtedly add to the turmoil  The historic storm  one the strongest in the last 100 years  claimed at least 14 lives as it hurtled through the Caribbean islands  while hundreds line up for water and fuel in Florida  ahead of landfall this weekend 
Though the National Hurricane Center downgraded the storm to category 4 from category 5 it continues to describe Irma as  extremely dangerous  
Investors in stocks were also cautious over speculation that North Korea s next display of defiance could come in the form of yet another missile launch as early this Saturday  to coincide with the country s founding day 
In company news   Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX   a provider of consumer credit scores  said on Thursday that personal details of as many as 143 million U S  consumers were accessed by hackers between mid May and July  in what could be one of the largest data breaches in the U S  Shares tumbled 16  in pre market trade Friday 
Meanwhile  oil prices were mixed on Friday  with U S  crude futures sliding lower and Brent prices moving higher after data on Thursday showed a rise in U S  stockpiles last week and as markets prepared for potential supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Irma 
West Texas Intermediate oil was still on track for weekly gains of more than 3   while the London barrel saw some support Friday from news that Saudi Arabia will cut crude oil allocations to its customers worldwide in October by 350 000 barrels per day 
U S  crude futures traded down 0 29  to  48 95 by 6 57AM ET  10 57GMT   while Brent oil gained 0 50  to  54 76 
Investors also looked ahead to the latest gauge on U S  shale production 
Baker Hughes will release its most recent weekly rig count data later on Friday 
Elsewhere  European bourses showed mixed trade as global caution and a stronger euro put the brakes on risk sentiment in the region  At 6 58AM ET  10 58GMT   the European benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 dropped 0 15   Germany s DAX inched up 0 03   while London s FTSE 100 fell 0 48

8004,229519,EFX,Facebook s Crypto Plan Draws Fresh Outrage From Maxine Waters,news," Bloomberg      Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   is taking a beating for a second straight day over its controversial cryptocurrency plans with House Financial Chairwoman Maxine Waters arguing the proposal poses vast privacy and national security risks 
Speaking at a Wednesday hearing  Waters compared Facebook to  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  and  Equifax Inc   NYSE EFX    two scandal ridden companies that have harmed consumers  She said the hearing would focus  in part  on proposed legislation that would prohibit tech titans from getting into virtual tokens 
If the plan comes to fruition  Facebook and its partners will  wield immense power that could disrupt  governments and central banks  Waters  a California Democrat  said in her prepared remarks 
Waters has been one of Facebook s most vocal critics since the company unveiled its token proposal last month  She s repeatedly urged Facebook to halt its efforts to launch the global virtual coin  known as Libra  until policy makers can fully assess the effort 
She s far from alone in scrutinizing the company  President Donald Trump has bashed Facebook over Libra and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said July 15 that he s very concerned that Libra could threaten national security  considering that other cryptocurrencies have been embraced by terrorists and nations under U S  sanctions 
A parade of senators criticized Facebook at a Tuesday Senate Banking Committee hearing  saying the company can t be trusted to handle consumers  financial transactions after past scandals involving data privacy and allowing Russian bots to influence the 2016 presidential election 
Facebook has been stressing in public and private meetings on Capitol Hill that it s just one of dozens of companies involved in the effort 
Facebook s David Marcus  appearing at Wednesday s hearing  pledged to address policy makers  concerns over the project and said the coin isn t meant to compete with countries  national currencies or interfere with central banks  monetary policy decisions  Marcus  the top Facebook executive working on Libra  said the coin won t launch until regulators are comfortable with the company s proposal ",2019-07-17,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/facebooks-crypto-plan-draws-fresh-outrage-from-maxine-waters-1926210,1926210

Experian  Equifax and Transunion agreed on Monday to increase protections for consumers facing credit report errors and to enact procedures which could improve the accuracy of the credit reports  The credit rating agencies  CRAs  maintain consumer credit information on approximately 200 million customers nationwide 
 Credit reports touch every part of our lives   Schneiderman said   They affect whether we can obtain a credit card  take out a college loan  rent an apartment  or buy a car   and sometimes even whether we can get jobs  
 The nation s largest reporting agencies have a responsibility to investigate and correct errors on consumers  credit reports  This agreement will reform the entire industry and provide vital protections for millions of consumers across the country  
The agreement also seeks to improve the dispute resolution process  institute reforms on the ratings process for medical debt collection and provide additional free annual credit reports to consumers  As part of the settlement  the CRAs agreed to establish a 180 day waiting period before medical debt is calculated into a consumer s credit rating  The waiting period provides an ample amount of time for a consumer to dispute outstanding medical charges  Schneiderman said

110135,331650,EFX,Wiping out the nation s student loan debt could have unintended financial consequences for borrowers,news,"Democratic presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren say their student debt cancellation plans will help young Americans and their families finally get a fresh start after being buried in debt for so long   Research has suggested that cancelled debts can be a major boost for borrowers and the economy overall  When 10 000 borrowers had their private student loans canceled  their income increased on average by  4 000 over three years  a 2019 working paper found  

                  Wiping out the nation s  1 5 trillion in student debt could have other repercussions  including lower credit scores and higher tax bills 
                  







Debt cancellation also gave them a better shot at moving or starting new jobs  that same study discovered  Another 2018 estimate said debt cancellation would inject an average of  108 billion into the economy every year for 10 years after the mass cancellation  But wiping out up to  1 6 trillion in student debt could have other financial repercussions for individual borrowers  experts say  Among them  Some borrowers could see their credit scores go down temporarily and their tax bills go up the year the debt is canceled  That s because credit bureaus may have one less payment source to evaluate a borrower s creditworthiness   Current Internal Revenue Service rules say when a borrower s student loans are canceled  the amount of the loan can be added to their taxable income  but there are exceptions to those rules  The IRS recently said that some borrowers who had their loans canceled because they attended certain schools that defrauded them don t have to report the amount of their cancelled loan on their income return   But the IRS and Treasury Department have not issued guidelines on what would happen if all student loans were wiped away through the Department of Education on the instructions of the president  The Department of Education and Treasury Department did not respond to request for comment from MarketWatch  An IRS spokesman said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the legislative proposals from Sanders and Warren  Both the Warren and Sanders campaigns say they will work to ensure that debt cancellation doesn t result in larger tax obligations for borrowers  The student debt cancellation legislation that Sanders co authored includes a provision stipulating that the amount of a borrower s eligible federal student loans forgiven by the bill would not be included in their gross income for tax purposes  The Sanders plan would wipe away all student debt and have no income caps  His plan includes private student loan debt   Comparatively  Warren has said she will cancel  640 billion in federal student loan debt overall if she is elected  Borrowers making up to  100 000 a year would be eligible to have  50 000 in debt wiped away  People making between  150 000 and  250 000 a year would be eligible only for partial debt relief  Here are some of the ways student loan forgiveness could affect borrowers  finances  Student debt cancellation would raise tax bills under existing rules A cancelled loan means people no longer have to pay a lender  but current IRS rules say borrowers   with certain exceptions for scammed students  permanently disabled veterans and public sector workers   still have to pay the tax authority before they can get out from under a student loan  Take a hypothetical borrower who owes almost  18 000   That s the median student loan balance for all borrowers  according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   Suppose that same borrower made  63 179 a year  which the U S  Census said was the 2018 median household income   If the loan was canceled  the IRS   under current rules   would count that  18 000 as income  bringing the borrower s total taxable income to  81 000 a year   Both Warren and Sanders have said they would work to change these rules to ensure that borrowers wouldn t see their tax bills go up    Read more  Where the 2020 candidates stand on student debt and college affordability  Depending on what other money the person earned that year  the canceled loan amount could bump them into a higher tax bracket and trigger a bigger tax bill  said Barbara Weltman  an attorney and author of  J K  Lasser s Your Income Tax 2020    If that hypothetical single person earned just  2 201 more  they would be pushed from the 22  income tax bracket into the 24  tax bracket  What s more  a hypothetical married couple that makes a median income and has the median student loan balance would potentially jump from a 12  federal tax rate to a 22  federal tax rate  Like forgiven loans  the same current rules apply to lottery winnings  unemployment benefits  interest on checking and savings accounts  and even certain types of legal settlements  Weltman said    Don t miss  Harvey Weinstein s accusers will likely have to pay a hefty tax bill on any settlements  Getting taxed under a higher tax bracket could also make someone ineligible for certain tax breaks  Weltman added  including the earned income tax credit   which supplements the income of working lower income taxpayers   and the IRA deduction for those taxpayers who also contribute to a retirement plan at work  A married couple filing jointly with three kids can t have more than  56 844 in adjusted annual gross income to claim the earned income tax credit  People who have more than  104 000 a year in modified adjusted gross income can t get the full IRA contribution deduction  

                   The IRS does not have authority to say  Poof  it s gone

 There are all sorts of ramifications   Weltman said  Congress would have to pass laws amending the tax code before borrowers could avoid reporting the canceled debt as income  she added   The IRS does not have authority to say  Poof  it s gone    A  Wayne Johnson  a Republican former U S  Education Department official who is running for U S  Senator in Georgia  and is also calling for the cancellation of  925 billion in student debt  said Warren and Sanders would have to get any tax law changes through Congress   and persuade Republicans   to change rules for borrowers   They could not  he said  do it by executive action  Even if federal laws are amended  state tax authorities might still consider the forgiven loans as taxable income  Johnson said  For his own cancellation efforts  he said he would  aggressively talk to the states     to try and have them see the wisdom of not charging tax consequences   Even if tax law did not change and student debt was wiped out  Robert Kelchen  a Seton Hall University professor focused on the finance of higher education  said any tax headaches are  still a small price to pay  compared to finally be free of student debt    You re effectively settling your student loan debt  paying pennies on the dollar   he said 

                  Complete debt cancellation could be a  windfall to many wealthy borrowers  
                  







Kelchen supports limited loan cancellation  but has misgivings about wholesale cancellation  Complete debt cancellation could be a  windfall to many wealthy borrowers   Kelchen said  The taxpayer  rich or poor  would effectively pick up the bill  He has big questions on whether well off students should benefit from cancellation  but also logistical ones  like whether the IRS has the capacity to handle an influx of borrowers who suddenly have no student loan debts  but a large tax bill waiting for them   Many of those borrowers may have to pay their tax bills in installments  which could create additional administrative burdens for the IRS  he said  Borrowers with higher debt balances tended to have graduate degrees  Loan debt is  still a burden  for these borrowers  but Kelchen said  they are better off than many Americans   Kelchen said Warren s  100 000 annual income cap for full debt relief of up to  50 000 takes that into account    Also see  Resigning Trump administration official says student loan system is  fundamentally broken    here are some possible solutions   It s an issue of who s ultimately paying for this and how much the federal government and federal taxpayers are willing to spend   he said   Instead of applying loan relief to wealthier students  Kelchen said that money could increase funding for Pell grants  which are needs based grants for low income student that do not need to be repaid  He said the money could also be used to defray housing costs and child care costs for students with children   Student parents comprise approximately 20  of all college students   Borrowers could see their credit scores drop if their student loans are cancelled As one of the first loans many people take out  student loans are very influential in building people s credit scores and profiles  Student loans influence a person s credit score in myriad ways  For instance  making on time payments toward student debt is viewed favorably by credit bureaus  said Ethan Dornhelm  vice president of scores and predictive analytics at FICO

Getting rid of debt is usually viewed favorably in constructing credit reports and FICO scores  But there are a number of ways that removing a debt obligation can hurt a person s credit score   The impact will depend on the specifics of a given consumer s student loans as well as their overall credit profile   Dornhelm added  The age of the oldest credit line is another major factor in calculating a credit score and  for many borrowers  their first loan is their student loan  No longer having a student loan would reduce their  credit mix   which could also be viewed unfavorably for credit scoring purposes  Having a lower credit score can have significant consequences on people s financial lives  It can change what types of loans and credit cards a person can qualify for  It also typically leads to a borrower having a higher interest rate    A recent study from Lendingtree found that the average American with a  fair  credit score  in the range between 580 and 669  pays up to  41 416 more in interest over the life of a mortgage loan versus someone with a  very good  score  between 740 and 799    Read more  One argument for canceling student debt  Student loan borrowers may be far poorer than most economists believe  In some circumstances  student loan borrowers could suddenly find themselves  unscorable  if their student debt is erased  said Francis Creighton  president and CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association  a trade group that represents the major credit reporting agencies Experian

 among other companies  That would happen if someone s only form of debt was their student loan  Already millions of Americans are considered  credit invisible   meaning they don t have any or enough credit history with one of the three major credit reporting companies to get a score  A 2015 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that some 26 million Americans were in this camp  People who are  credit invisible  often have a more difficult time getting loans such as mortgages because it is more difficult for lenders to assess their ability to repay without their credit history

Having such a loan removed from their credit profile would almost certainly cause their score to increase  It is not clear  however  whether the borrower s history of defaulting on the loan prior to its cancellation would remain on their profile  Whatever the impact  credit scores are designed to change over time  so the effect would likely diminish in the years following the cancellation    More recent information is more relevant than older information   Creighton said   Let s say you do something and it impacts your score by 100 points right away  after a year it might only impact your score by 50 points   Long term benefits could outweigh short term costs Most experts said the benefits of having a student loan wiped out outweighed any short term financial consequences  The study of 10 000 borrowers whose incomes went up after their loans were canceled also showed that their credit scores increased after the debt was wiped away  This largely occurred because the borrowers studied were in default on their private student loans before they were forgiven as the result of a clerical error  said Marco Di Maggio  one of the study s co authors and a professor at Harvard Business School   Overall  we find a significant improvement of the borrowers  financial condition after the forgiveness  as they are able to reduce their indebtedness  are less likely to default on other loans  and find better jobs   Di Maggio said   Accepting or rejecting these proposals based on just the potential changes on credit score misses the big picture  as it assumes that the borrowers without the burden of the student debt would behave in the same way  which is not reasonable    Also read  This government loan forgiveness program has rejected 99  of borrowers so far  A group of Brandeis University researchers who support Warren s proposal have said that  the greater ability to save and build assets entailed by a lower debt load would generate additional wealth and would be significant in the lives of debtors   including by increasing credit scores  As cancelling debt frees up income  that money can go toward other debt obligations  Any possibility of lower credit scores is  a nominal cost to pay   said Cody Hounanian  program director of Student Debt Crisis  an advocacy group for borrowers that supports some form of debt cancellation but has not endorsed any particular plan   For borrowers that are maybe going to pay more on other bills because their credit score hasn t been improved by repayment  shedding the student debt burden will create many more financially positive opportunities for them   he said 

More from MarketWatch   A billionaire s pledge to pay off these Morehouse students  debt will affect more than their finances   The  morally suspect  way the government collects student loans during tax season   12 years after starting college  white men have paid off 44  of their student loans  while black women owe 13  more

Victims of the 2017 cyberattack on the credit bureau are eligible for either free credit monitoring  money instead of monitoring  or compensation for expenses and losses 

Wednesday was the deadline for anyone affected by the massive Equifax data breach to file a claim seeking compensation   but those expecting the maximum  125 payout may be disappointed  Victims of the 2017 cyberattack on the credit bureau are eligible for either free credit monitoring  money instead of monitoring  or compensation for expenses and losses  More than 15 million of the 147 million people affected by the breach have put in claims for some sort of redress in the resulting  700 million class action settlement  according to legal papers filed last month  Now the deadline is closing for all other class members to file a claim with the settlement administrator    Though the initial claims period is closing  a second claims period runs through January 2024  That s for claims on alleged harms from the breach that spring up after the first claims period closes    The settlement  unveiled in July  essentially gave consumers two choices  They could take up to 10 years of free credit monitoring  The first four years would be with Equifax and two other credit bureaus  Experian

                                         The next six years would be with Equifax  Victims of the breach who didn t want the credit monitoring could receive a cash payment instead  

                  The settlement offered two choices  Opt for up to 10 years of free credit monitoring or receive a payment instead  
                  







The maximum payout was  125  but regulators and plaintiffs  lawyers have cautioned applicants that they wouldn t get anywhere near that amount because there was just a  31 million pot of money for those payouts   In addition  victims could also seek reimbursement for damages   like fallout from unauthorized charges   and payment for the time they spent addressing the breach s consequences  That could include the time spent freezing credit reports  The company has denied wrongdoing in the settlement and its CEO  Mark Begor  has previously said the company hasn t found instances of stolen data being sold on the dark web  though some regulators say otherwise  Northern District of Georgia Judge Thomas Thrash Jr  approved the settlement earlier this month   We are pleased that the Court approved the settlement  which provides significant benefits for consumers whose information was impacted in the 2017 breach   an Equifax spokesman said   Ahead of court approval  class action lawyers representing consumers said as of Dec  1  there had been 3 3 million claims for credit monitoring from Equifax

                  Credit monitoring was a better deal  plaintiffs  lawyers contended  because the maximum of 10 years credit monitoring had a retail price of  1 920  
                  







Credit monitoring was a better deal  they contended  because the maximum of 10 years credit monitoring had a retail price of  1 920    Every class member submitting a valid  out of pocket loss claim is expected to be completely reimbursed for losses fairly traceable to the breach   plaintiffs  lawyers said  The court papers from last month said class members have filed 1 8 million claims to be compensated for time spent addressing the breach   Participation rates  objections  This settlement has achieved historic results  with an overwhelmingly positive response from the class   plaintiffs lawyers wrote  noting a 10  participation rate   The settlement administrator  JND Legal Administration  has received 130 million visits on its website  court papers show   That rate in the massive Equifax case hovers just above typical participation rates in consumer class action cases   There was a 9  median claims rate on consumer class action cases  according to an FTC study on the issue in September   The same FTC study said whenever class participants submitted claims  86  were approved

Here s what you need to know about the different types of credit scores out there  There isn t one  FICO  score The phrase  FICO score  can be applied to a wide range of different scores produced by the company  Every few years  FICO produces a new version of its credit score   FICO 8 was released in 2009  while FICO 9 came out in 2014   but lenders can choose to use an older version  FICO 8 is the most commonly used model today  Rossman said  Lenders tend to opt for older versions of the FICO score in part because these scores form the foundation of their underwriting process   I would imagine that a lot of lenders would be reluctant to be the first one in the pool with a significant change because there is a lot of risk   said Matt Schulz  chief industry analyst at LendingTree

Here s what you need to know about the different types of credit scores out there  There isn t one  FICO  score The phrase  FICO score  can be applied to a wide range of different scores produced by the company  Every few years  FICO produces a new version of its credit score   FICO 8 was released in 2009  while FICO 9 came out in 2014   but lenders can choose to use an older version  FICO 8 is the most commonly used model today  Rossman said  Lenders tend to opt for older versions of the FICO score in part because these scores form the foundation of their underwriting process   I would imagine that a lot of lenders would be reluctant to be the first one in the pool with a significant change because there is a lot of risk   said Matt Schulz  chief industry analyst at LendingTree

                  FICO Score 10 will weigh personal loans more heavily  penalizing borrowers who consolidate debt with personal loans and then choose to rack up more debt 
                  







As for FICO Score 10 and 10 T  there are a couple of key changes being made  The scores will weigh personal loans more heavily  the Wall Street Journal reported  in order to penalize borrowers who consolidate debt with personal loans and then go on to rack up more debt  And the FICO Score 10 T will incorporate  trended data  for the past 24 months for every borrower  to show the historical trajectory of their credit behavior  This change will reward people who have been working to pay off their debts  but could cause people s scores to drop if they ve amassed more debt in that time   These changes don t affect older FICO models  Shellenberger said   Some lenders use alternative scores  The FICO Score XD incorporates additional data to indicate a borrower s creditworthiness  such as landline  mobile and cable payments and property data  The three credit bureaus have also released the VantageScore as a competitor to FICO  which uses the same underlying data  but a different formula to produce its scores   Read more  Mortgage rates fall to the lowest level in three months   but this is a double edged sword for home buyers   Your FICO score will vary from version to version While the underlying criteria roughly remains the same from version to version  the changes can result in wildly different scores for the same person  Rossman researched his FICO score under the 4  8 and 9 models based on data provided by his mortgage lender and credit card companies  Among those three models  his score varied by 37 points   If you were straddling different categories   between fair and good   that could have a very big impact on how much you pay for a loan   Rossman said  As a result  consumers should be aware that when their credit card company or bank tells them what their credit score is  that may not be the same score that a mortgage lender would use   Don t miss  Chase hikes annual fee for its Sapphire Reserve card to  550   a  100 increase  How to improve your credit across scoring models People applying for loans shouldn t get too hung up on which scoring system their lender is going to use  Rossman said   A consumer can drive themselves crazy considering all of this   he said  The same beneficial credit behaviors will buoy a borrower s score regardless of what model is used  experts say   Good credit is still about three things  paying your bills on time every time  keeping your balances as low as possible and not applying for too much credit too often   Schulz said 

                   Good credit is still about three things  paying your bills on time every time  keeping your balances as low as possible and not applying for too much credit too often

For those who want to improve their credit  there are steps you can take beyond these basic recommendations    Reduce your credit utilization ratio  This measure of how much credit you ve used versus how much credit lenders are willing to give you  particularly with credit cards  is a key component of credit scores  Keeping this low isn t a matter of just paying your total monthly bill if you re the type of person who maxes out their credit cards every month  Instead  consider making payments multiple times each month   Just simply paying in full isn t enough   Rossman said    Correct any errors on your credit report  One in five Americans have had an error on their credit report  Rossman said  Errors can crop up for any reason  In some cases  people have had errors on their report because a lender or credit bureau confused them for another customer with the same name  Getting these resolved quickly is important  Experts suggest contacting both the lender and credit bureaus to resolve this  or contacting the authorities if fraud is suspected    Sign up for Experian Boost  The credit bureau offers a free service  called Experian Boost  which allows consumers to opt in to providing their cell phone and utility payments history  That data is used in newer FICO scores  and most people see their scores go up  On average  people who signed up for Boost have seen their scores increase by more than 10 points since the service rolled out   Also see  Wiping out the nation s student loan debt could have unintended financial consequences for borrowers     Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this story

110225,331740,EFX,FLT Or EFX  Which Financial Services Firm Is Better Placed ,opinion,The financial services industry has transformed significantly in the recent years  considering the notable changes in transaction techniques  With digitalization taking center stage  technology is playing a major role  Digitalization of banking and payment services has made it easier for people to conduct transactions With the market adapting a quantitative approach to save time  reduce operating expenses and increase work efficiency  companies in this industry should benefit  The Zacks  industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  81  which places it in the top 32  of more than 250 Zacks industries and indicates solid near term growth prospects Given this backdrop  it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Financial Transaction Services stocks   FLEETCOR Technologies   NYSE FLT   and Equifax   NYSE EFX    Both the stocks are part of the broader Zacks sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors   While market capitalization of FLEETCOR Technologies is  25 60 billion  the same for Equifax is  17 26 billion As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight  You can see  Price PerformanceFLEETCOR clearly scores over Equifax in terms of price performance  So far this year  shares of FLEETCOR have gained 62 1  compared with 54 9  rise of Equifax  The  and Zacks S P 500 composite registered growth of 41 5  and 14 3   respectively  in the same time frame Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth and stock price gains often serves as indication of a company s strong prospects FLEETCOR s third quarter 2019 earnings are projected to grow 13 4  year over year compared

earnings are expected to register 15 1  growth compared with 7 9  for Equifax   Further  FLEETCOR has a long term expected EPS  three to five years  growth rate of 15 6  while the same for Equifax is 8 7  Thus  FLEETCOR has an edge over Equifax in terms of quarterly and yearly earnings growth projection Earnings Surprise HistoryEarnings surprise history helps investors to get an idea of the company s performance in the previous quarters FLEETCOR and Equifax have an impressive earnings surprise history  FLEETCOR s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters  Equifax s earnings outpaced the consensus mark in three of the past four quarters However  Equifax delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise of 1 9  compared with 1 8  for FLEETCOR Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock Based on third quarter 2019  and full year 2019 and 2020 earnings estimate revisions in the past 90 days  FLEETCOR is better placed than Equifax   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter 2019 earnings has increased 0 3  for FLEETCOR versus a decrease

better than a higher one The trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E   TTM  multiple for FLEETCORand Equifax is 29 and 26 8  respectively  while that of the Zacks S P 500 composite is 17 8 Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the benchmark index  Equifax has a lower P E   TTM value than FLEETCOR Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that FLEETCOR scores over Equifax in terms of price performance  earnings estimate revisions  and quarterly and yearly earnings growth projection  Equifax has an edge over FLEETCOR in terms of earnings surprise history Although a faster share price rally on a year to date basis has led to a rich valuation for both stocks compared with the benchmark index  Equifax is cheaper than FLEETCOR Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the

110227,331742,EFX,Facebook Libra Can Help Grow Adoption But Privacy Concerns Remain,opinion,"Since 2017  cryptocurrency has experienced both the crazy highs and the crazy lows with fortunes being made and lost overnight   That volatility is one of the main reasons why cryptocurrency has been relatively slow to gain mass adoption   Another concern that much of the public and regulators have regarding crypto relates to security and privacy rights   Although cryptocurrency is still at the very beginning of its technology life cycle  something big will need to come along to push adoption forward   That  something big  could come in the form of Facebook s  NASDAQ FB  recently announced Libra currency 

Institutional Money Helping to Grow Cryptocurrency
Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009  cryptocurrency has come a long way   Although the majority of people aren t using cryptocurrencies  there have certainly heard of it   And that s incredible given that that wasn t the case just a few years ago   In fact  cryptocurrency is growing so fast that institutional money is now entering the space 

Some of the largest institutions to enter the crypto space include 

       DRW Trading   A multi asset proprietary trading firm in Chicago

       Hodium   A cryptoasset investment firm based out of London

       Grayscale Investments   A digital assets fund with  2 5B AUM

These three organizations are just a small sample of the institutions entering the space   In fact  crypto traders are currently looking forward to the launch of what will be the pre eminent bitcoin futures trading platform called Bakkt   The platform will launch on September 23 and analysts think it could lead to significant gains in Bitcoin price over the coming months 

Even with all of the above  more is still needed for mass adoption to occur   There are still many people around the world who have never used cryptocurrency and have no idea idea how to begin   And that s where Facebook s Libra currency will come into play 

Libra Currency Will Increase Global Reach
Facebook s Libra will allow consumers to purchase products or transfer money with extremely low fees   Consumers will supposedly be able to pseudonymously buy or sell their Libra for products on the web or at brick and mortar locations such as supermarkets   Transactions will be processed by using third party wallet apps such as Facebook s Calibra wallet   The currency is expected to go live during the first half of 2020 

One of the most exciting aspects of this new currency is the global reach of Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and its various apps like WhatsApp   Based off Facebook s May statistics  the social media platform has 2 38 billion monthly active users    WhatsApp also boats an impressive user base 

When cryptocurrency first began  the dream for many was that Bitcoin  or another option  could serve as a universal currency option for many around the world   The global banking industry makes a lot of money from remittances fees and exchange rate markups   Currently  only a few financial providers move money abroad on the blockchain   Imagine if all the major providers did that so as to reduce fees for consumers around the world   That would result in tremendous savings that could then be spent on other services products to stimulate growth 

Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Libra has the potential to get the ball rolling   But the question is at what cost 

Regulatory Bodies Have Privacy Concerns
While cryptocurrency will have a big impact on the future business landscape  early adopters will have to deal with the many risks that exist today   As it relates to Facebook  NASDAQ FB   the primary concerns revolve around hacking and data breaches   

During the last few years  data protection has emerged as a vitally important issue for both the public and regulatory bodies   This is especially true in the USA where quite a few hacks and data breaches have been publicized resulting in the government s involvement   A few of those incidents include 

       September 2017   Equifax  NYSE EFX  data breach that affected 148 million users

       November 2018   Starwood data theft that affected 500  million users

Facebook  NASDAQ FB  has its own share of missteps as well   The most well known incident involved Russian operatives using targeted ads on the popular social media platform in order to affect the U S  election results   Then  there was the incident involving Cambridge Analytica   Because of large GOP investments  the firm was able to harvest private information from more than 87 million Facebook users   With this information at the firm s disposal  their employees were able to develop techniques to work on President Trump s 2016 Presidential campaign 

One would think that those incidents would be enough of a kick to the butt for Facebook  NASDAQ FB  to wake up and fix the issues   But that hasn t been the case   In September 2018  Facebook announced that an attack on its computer network exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users   Hackers were apparently able to exploit a feature in Facebook s code to gain access to user accounts

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate

Revenues are expected to be  873 17 million  up 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Equifax 
For Equifax  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Equifax will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Equifax would post earnings of  1 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 40  delivering a surprise of  2 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

110320,331835,EFX,Analysts Estimate Equifax  EFX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Equifax  NYSE EFX  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit reporting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 8  
Revenues are expected to be  848 79 million  down 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Equifax 
For Equifax  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Equifax will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Equifax would post earnings of  1 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  4 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Equifax doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-equifax-efx-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200407780,200407780
110321,331836,EFX,Consumer Loans Industry Outlook  Near Term Prospects Bright,opinion,"The Zacks  industry consists of firms that provide mortgages  refinancing  home equity lines of credit  credit cards  auto loans  student loans and personal loans  among others  Business prospects of these companies are sensitive to the nation s overall economic health In addition to offering the above mentioned services that help generate interest income   a major part of their revenues  many of these consumer loan providers are involved in businesses like commercial lending  insurance  loan servicing and asset recovery for generating fee revenues Here are the three major themes in the industry Higher interest rates have been benefiting consumer loan providers  as interest income constitutes the majority of their revenues  Moreover  upbeat consumer confidence  improving economy and higher disposable income should keep driving the demand for products and services provided by these companies  Despite the Fed s dovish stance related to future rate hikes  net interest margin and net interest income will likely continue to improve for these companies  With the nation s big credit reporting agencies   Equifax  NYSE EFX   EFX   Experian and TransUnion  TRU   removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since last year  credit scores of some consumers have moved higher  This has increased the number of consumers for the industry participants  Further  easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet the increased demand for loans  Growth in lending to subprime borrowers has led to increase in revenues for consumer loan providers  However  this has also resulted in higher provision for credit losses  Further  increase in delinquency rates for credit card and auto loan is a major concern for these companies  
Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Consumer Loans Industry is a 19 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  17  which places it at the top 7  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued outperformance in the near term  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of solid earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised upward by 19  Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Underperforms Sector and S P 500The Zacks Consumer Loans industry has underperformed both the Zacks S P 500 composite and its own sector over the past two years While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 8 1  over this period  the Zacks S P 500 composite and the Zacks Finance sector have rallied 23 3  and 9   respectively Two Year Price Performance
Industry s ValuationOn the basis of price to tangible book ratio  P TBV   which is commonly used for valuing consumer loan providers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next  the industry currently trades at 1 32X  This compares to the highest level of 1 66X and median of 1 31X over the past five years This compares with the S P 500 s trailing 12 month P TBV of 11 38X  as the chart below shows Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
As finance stocks typically have a lower P TBV ratio  comparing consumer loan providers with the S P 500 may not make sense to many investors  But a comparison of the group s P TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount  The Zacks Finance sector s trailing 12 month P TBV of 3 84X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry s ratio  as the chart below shows Price to Tangible Book Ratio  TTM 
Bottom LineConsumer loan stocks will likely continue benefiting from relatively higher interest rates  favorable operating environment and improving economy  Also  digitization of operations  efforts to diversify revenue sources  restructuring and solid asset quality  despite easing lending standards  will support profitability One should particularly consider betting on the consumer loan stocks that depict an upbeat earnings outlook We are presenting two stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and three with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that investors may consider betting on You can see  EZCORP  Inc   EZPW   The stock of this Austin  TX based company has rallied 23 8   over the past two years  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised 1 1  upward over the past 30 days  The stock currently sports Zacks Rank  1 Price and Consensus  EZPW

Equifax  Inc  Revenue  TTM 
   Acquisitions are a key growth catalyst for Equifax  The company is continuously acquiring and investing in companies on a global scale to supplement the core business  strengthen market share and increase geographic presence 
The recent buyout of DataX has added alternative credit and payment data  analytics and identity solutions for underbanked consumers to Equifax core credit database  This enables Equifax to expand borrowing options for the underbanked population in installment loan  rent to own and lease to own markets 
Other benefits from DataX include credit reporting  ID verification  bank account verification and custom risk services  JLR Inc   acquired by Equifax Canada in December 2018  is likely to strengthen its foothold in the Canadian mortgage industry

Equifax joined forces with Oplogic  a provider of CRM solutions for automotive dealerships  to enable auto dealers detect fraud 
Final Words
The cyber breach has heavily tarnished the brand image  reputation and credibility of Equifax  The company is bearing the brunt of higher costs as it has increased spending on technology post the incident  However  we believe that synergies from acquisitions along with continued general consumer credit activity  product innovation  initiatives to boost enterprise growth and efficient business executions will fuel growth in the long run

110357,331872,EFX,What Impacts Your Credit Score The Most,opinion,People take out loans to fulfill various financial goals  like buying a vehicle or a house  higher education  or even a personal loan to repay previous debts Low to middle income families are most likely to take out a loan compared to high income families  Northwestern Mutual s 2018 Planning   Progress Study recently found that 68  of the total American population falls in the middle income category But what decides how much loan you are eligible for  or whether at all your loan application will be accepted by the lender  Here s where the importance of a credit score comes in  Simply put  the borrower s credit score measures the lender s risk  and their ability to repay Ticket to BorrowingCompanies like Fair Isaac Corporation   NYSE FICO    a leading personal credit score provider and VantageScore   a joint venture of three leading credit reporting bureaus  Equifax   NYSE EFX    Experian   OTC EXPGY   and TransUnion   NYSE TRU     provide information to organizations to help them manage the risks associated with extending credit to their customers and preventing fraud Among them  the most widely used credit score model used by banks and other financial institutions is the FICO score  The generic FICO credit score is between 300 and 850  wherein 300 620 counts as bad  620 649 as poor  650 699 as fair  700 749 as good  and 750 and above as excellent Factors That Influence Your Credit ScoreThere are various aspects based on which the total credit score is given  And if any one of those aspects threatens to bring down your score  one can focus on improving performance in the other factors to bring it back up  Now  let us delve deeper into the factors that form a credit score Payment History gets the maximum weightage of 35  in a credit score  Whether you have previously paid your bills on time  how much have you stretched on a late payment  how much time has elapsed from the last time you missed a payment  and whether any of your accounts has been escalated to collection agencies decide most of your credit score  The lesser all the above instances are  the better your score is Credit Utilization  or the ratio of debt to available credit  decides 30  of your ultimate score  The other loans or mortgages that you have and the percentage of total available credit that you have used collectively constitute this factor  Again  the lesser  the better Credit Age contains 15  of the total weight of a credit score  Preference is given to those who have ably managed previous credit accounts over longer periods of time  Leaving old accounts open can lead to an improved score Of the score  10  is allotted to Credit Diversity  which takes into account the number of credit accounts held by the potential borrower  Carrying different types of credit   auto loans  mortgage  student loans  and credit card  reflects your ability to manage your accounts efficiently The final 10  weight is carried by the number of recent hard inquiries that you had  Many in a short time period set off alarm bells for lenders  However  the more loans approved  the better your credit score SOS for Low ScorersEmergencies can crop up anytime  In case you want to apply for a loan but are concerned about a low credit score  focus on significantly improving the two most crucial factors   payment history and credit utilization  However  give at least six months for your corrections to reflect on your score Make consistent  on time payments and you will be on track for a better credit score  A single instance of a late payment can snatch 60 to 110 points  It is also advisable to avoid opening any credit account in the 12 months before applying for an important loan Also  as we already know now  the lower your utilization rate  the better your score  Thus  avoiding using too much of your credit card balance will reflect positively on the score card  It is recommended to aim to pull down the utilization rate below 30  EpilogueYour credit score is very important to get loans at the best interest rates  but stressing over each and every factor affecting your score is not the best course of action  Paying your bills on time  using credit cards responsibly  and avoiding unnecessary loan applications will do a great job of keeping your score high A Simple Way to Build WealthNo matter

110396,331911,EFX,Equifax Case And Other Cyber Attacks  How Stock Prices Are Effected,opinion,"Equifax  NYSE EFX  is the poster child for data breach negligence  The company suffered from hackers exploiting a known and previously reported security vulnerability in their open source Apache Struts framework  As the story continues to unfold  it seems that the thieves got away with every piece of valuable information in their data vault  and instead of turning out the proverbial light  they took that too  In the last six months since the breach was reported  Equifax s stock suffered an initial steep drop  but has been regaining its footing  Today its shares are down approximately 12  from prior to the reported breach  It appears that Equifax share price is weathering this storm quite well 
To Date   Cyber Attacks Have a Had a Limited Imact on Share Price
In fact  the effect of cyber attacks on share prices is arguably not very damaging  In July of 2017   showed a detailed analysis of stock prices for 24 public companies that lost more than one million records due to a cyber attack  Immediately following the breach  their shares on average suffered a decrease of 0 43   This rate was approximately equal to their average daily volatility 
In the long run  share prices recovered  but at an impaired rate  The analysis showed a 45 6  increase in share price during the three year period prior to a company s data breach  In the three years after  the company only enjoyed a 14 8  growth  Daily volatility remained consistent  as it was approximately the same for both periods 
Clearly  investors remained somewhat skeptical about managements  ability to implement better security practices  reduce the effects of brand damage  retain customers  mitigate lawsuits and recoup lost opportunity costs  Regardless  most cyber attacks and successful data breaches may have had a rather small impact on share price due to the low costs associated with fines and lawsuits 
Open Source is Everywhere
More than 90  of the software in use today contains open source code  Open source pervades operating systems  network platforms and applications  This trend will only continue to grow because  by leveraging open source  developers can lower assembly costs and quickly add innovations  Without it  almost every gadget  cloud platform  banking network and phone system would shut down 
Whether software code is proprietary or open source  it harbors security vulnerabilities  Because of its transparency  open source code tends be better engineered than a comparable piece of proprietary code  And thanks to its flexibility  open source code is extensively used  This means that a security vulnerability in a piece of open source code is likely to exist across a multitude of applications and platforms  Consequently  open source software vulnerabilities become a  low hanging fruit  for hackers to target and attack 
Known Security Vulnerabilities are Prevalent 
The number of reported  in open source code   the same kind of vulnerability that hackers used to exploit Equifax   is increasing  In 2017  the number of known security vulnerabilities in open source code nearly tripled that of 2016  from 6 447 to 14 712  Based on the reported number of security vulnerabilities in the first two and a half months of 2018  it appears that we will once again set a record this year  Consequently  we can expect to see many more corporate casualties from cyber attacks directed at known security vulnerabilities 
E U  Driving Large Fines for Data Security Breaches
The E U  has enacted data protection   breach fines that  on their own  will negatively and materially impact a company s financial results  and likely their share price  On May 25th  the E U  will legislate its landmark General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  that was approved in 2016  Not only will the GDPR affect any organization located or doing business in the E U   it will also impact organizations processing data of EU individuals  regardless of their own geographic location  Multinationals will have to adjust their practices in order to comply with the new  and more stringent  data privacy and protection policies from the E U 
So what is the GDPR 
According to the official GDPR   it is a law to  protect all E U  citizens from privacy and data breaches in an increasingly data driven world   Its reach is broad   it will apply to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU  regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not   And  the penalties are non trivial   organizations in breach of GDPR can be fined up to 4  of annual global turnover or  20 Million  whichever is greater   
A Practical Examinination of the Effects of GDPR
Had the GDPR been in place at the time of the Equifax breach  the fines would have been significant  Based on estimated Equifax 2017 income  which has been delayed in reporting  4  of its approximately  3 billion in revenues is  120 million  The days of sweeping security vulnerabilities under the rug in the E U  are over 
Open source software development and use are irreversible trends in today s businesses  And given the undeniable importance of the E U market  organizations must adapt to comply with the GDPR  It is prudent for software development and IT teams to investigate and reevaluate  in depth  the ramifications of GDPR  their client data and privacy procedures  the short term risk mitigation potently offered by cyber security insurances and their plans and practices for finding and responding to open source security vulnerabilities 
Investors should examine  in great detail  corporations  reported plans for complying with the new GDPR rules  Additionally  given the increased risk  shareholders should reevaluate and discount the share price of companies that have a track record of data breaches  Going forward  cyber attacks and data breaches will have a much larger impact on share price ",2018-05-09,Tae Jin Kang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cyber-attacks-effect-on-stock-prices-and-the-looming-impact-from-the-eus-gdpr-200314682,200314682

110403,331918,EFX,3 Security Stocks In The Spotlight With Fresh Cyber Attacks,opinion,The cyber security industry has been putting up an impressive show on the bourse  of late  with the slew of cyber attacks  over the past few months  playing the supporting role  Cisco s   NASDAQ CSCO   latest report hints at another attack hovering over Ukraine  once again  which might cause a complete blackout in the country Per the findings of Talos   a cyber intelligence unit of Cisco   hackers have infected more than 500 000 routers and storage devices across 54 nations  It is feared that this sophisticated malware  VPNFilter  has infected the devices of Linksys  MikroTik  Netgear   NASDAQ NTGR    TP Link and QNAP The sensitivity of this cyber attack can be understood with the fact that the malware codes discovered in the infected devices were similar to the ones used earlier to attack Ukraine   In 2015 and 2016  cybercriminals had wrongfully accessed and paralyzed the country s power utility networks  causing nationwide blackouts and factory shutdowns  Therefore  Cisco is suspecting another similar blackout  this time too  ahead of Ukraine s Constitution Day on June 28 While the jitters sent across the globe by Cisco s latest report had yet not dissipated  another massive cybercrime report hit headlines on May 28  This Monday  two of the largest Canadian banks reported fraudsters gaining access to the personal and financial information of almost 90K of their customers Fresh Boost for Security StocksNevertheless  cyberattacks do not spell bad news for all companies  Particularly  cyber security stocks have been on a roll since the second half of 2017  thanks to the plaguing attacks which created havoc across the globe last year Some of the most notable ones included the two back to back ransomware attacks   WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June   followed by the massive data breach at Equifax   NYSE EFX   in September  In addition to these  the data theft and ransom paid by Uber disclosed in November further fueled the bullish momentum of the stocks in this space In 2018  so far  the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF  HACK  has returned 19   outperforming the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLK  and S P 500 s gains of 9 3  and 0 4   respectively  The Cyber Security ETF has gained 4 3  in a month s time  Computer and Technology

providers  We believe this would further drive the share prices of cyber security stocks Investors Should Bank on This OpportunityThough billions of dollars and data are lost due to cyber crime  there is a positive side to it  Cyber security companies stand to gain from data breaches as the chances of security related purchases shoot up Furthermore  with rapid technological advancement  organizations are increasingly adopting the Bring Your Own Device  BYOD  policy to enhance employee productivity  with anytime anywhere access  This trend  in turn  calls for stricter data security measures We believe the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises  as well as governments to increase spending on cyber security software  Per the latest report by Gartner  global enterprise security spending will reach  96 3 billion in 2018   marking 8  growth from the 2017 expected level of  89 billion Another market research firm  Markets and Markets  in its July 2017 report  stated that worldwide cyber security spending will likely reach  231 94 billion by 2022 Here  we focus on three stocks that are anticipated to benefit from this elevated spending FireEye Inc    NASDAQ FEYE   is a specialized provider of a security platform against cyber attacks to enterprises and governments  The company s consistent efforts toward bringing in new and advanced products have been attracting a wide range of customers  Notably  FireEye s Essentials product  which is a lower cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform  targets smaller and mid market companies  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings  a lower cost intelligent threat detection solution  targets large enterprises  as well as mid market businesses  You can see   FireEye  Inc  Price and Consensus    Furthermore  the company s move of shifting its business model to subscription based cloud services from selling software is praiseworthy  Though shifting the business model to subscription based services will generate lower revenues initially  but the same will stabilize the top line over the long run  as organizations usually renew subscriptions with the existing products or even with higher versions  Moreover  subscription based services generate higher gross margins Palo Alto Networks  Inc    NYSE PANW   enables firms  service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform  The company has been growing rapidly on the back of its innovative next generation security platforms  Its security platforms have innovative traffic classification engine that helps it identify network traffic by application  user and content  Palo Alto s security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple  stand alone security appliances  and software products  This reduces the total cost of ownership  thereby giving the organization a competitive edge Also  we believe its strategic acquisitions with the likes of LightCyber  Morta Security and Cyvera will continue to bolster revenues  These acquisitions helped this Zacks  3 Ranked company expand the functionality of its enterprise security platform  in turn  bringing in more customers  Palo Alto Networks  Inc  Price and Consensus    Additionally  Palo Alto has made strategic partnerships with the likes of VMware and Aruba Networks to expedite growth  These strategic partnerships bring in customers for Palo Alto  thus boosting its top line Proofpoint Inc    NASDAQ PFPT   is a leading security as a service provider that focuses on cloud based solutions for threat protection  compliance  archiving   governance  and secure communications  As more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud  demand for better cyber security measures has been on the rise  which is driving Proofpoint s revenues  Over the past few quarters  the company has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber security suites from enterprises transitioning to cloud  particularly to Office 365 Additionally  Proofpoint has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth  These buyouts have not only expanded the company s product portfolio  but also its customer and revenue base  We believe this Zacks Rank  3 company will continue with its strategy of growing through acquisitions  which will be conducive to top line growth  Proofpoint  Inc  Price and Consensus    Bottom LineConsidering the above discussed factors  it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cyber security players are likely to witness stellar growth in the near term  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265

110417,331932,EFX,U S  Bancorp s  USB  Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues Up,opinion,"U S  Bancorp s   NYSE USB   first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  The figure came ahead of the prior year quarter earnings of 82 cents The company s top line benefitted from rise in net interest income on the back of easing margin pressure and higher fee income  Further  elevated average loans and deposit balances were tailwinds  However  escalating expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues remained major drags After considering impacts of notable items  net income was  1 68 billion  up 13 7  year over year  Revenues  Loans   Deposits Rise  Costs IncreaseU S  Bancorp s net revenues came in at around  5 5 billion in the quarter  up 3 4  year over year  The increase in net interest income and non interest income contributed to higher revenues  However  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 53 billion U S  Bancorp s tax equivalent net interest income totaled  3 2 billion in the quarter  up 5 5  from the prior year quarter  The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates  partially offset by deposit and funding mix Average earning assets climbed 3 1  year over year  supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities  along with elevated average other earning assets  Furthermore  net interest margin of 3 13  was up 7 basis points  bps  year over year  driven by higher interest rates  Higher funding costs  loan mix and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins U S  Bancorp s non interest income increased slightly on a year over year basis to  2 3 billion  The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues  trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges  partially offset by lower mortgage banking and commercial products revenues Provision for credit losses decreased 1 2  year over year to  341 million in the reported quarter U S  Bancorp s average total loans climbed 2 3  year over year to  279 4 billion  The growth was backed by a rise in commercial loans  residential mortgages  credit card lending  total other retail and retail leasing  These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate Average total deposits were up 1 9  from the prior year quarter to  334 6 billion  The rise was due to growth in interest bearing deposits  partly offset by lower non interest bearing deposits Non interest expenses rose 5  year over year to  3 1 billion  primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expenses  technology investment and seasonal marketing and development expenses  partially offset by lower professional services and other expenses  Credit Quality  A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U S  Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter  Net charge offs came in at  341 million  up nearly 1 8  year over year  On a year over year basis  the company experienced deterioration  mainly in net charge offs in the credit card segment  Also  total allowance for credit losses was  4 4 billion  up 1 2  However  non performing assets came in at  1 2 billion  down 19 5  year over year  Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review  U S  Bancorp maintained a decent capital position  Beginning Jan 1  2018  the regulatory capital requirements fully reflected implementation of Basel III The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 10 4   down 6 bps from the prior year quarter  Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9  as of Mar 31  2018  compared with 9 5  in the year ago quarter All regulatory ratios of U S  Bancorp continued to be in excess of well capitalized requirements  In addition  based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach  the Tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11 5  as of Mar 31  2018  compared with 11 8  as of Mar 31  2017 The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7 7  as of Mar 31  2018  compared with 7 6  in prior year quarter U S  Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share  which increased to  26 54 as of Mar 31  2018  from  25 05 recorded at the end of the year earlier quarter  Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company s capital strength during the first quarter  U S  Bancorp returned 68  of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks ConclusionU S  Bancorp posted a decent quarter  Elevated revenues on the back of increased lending activities and higher interest rates was a positive factor  Further  improving economy and lower taxes are likely to continue supporting its financials  Moreover  its efforts to enhance digital offerings and expand treasury management and payment services capabilities bode well for the long term Nevertheless  weakness in the credit card portfolio adversely affected its asset quality  Additionally  there are concerns related to the impact of legal issues and the company s global exposure  Also  escalating expenses remain a headwind

Both revenues and earnings are estimated to rise year over year  with a likely earnings beat in the cards Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results  let s take a look at how the company performed in the last reported quarter     This Birmingham  AL based company s fourth quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and compared favorably with the prior year quarter s earnings as well  Easing margin pressure and higher revenues were the positive factors  Moreover  credit quality recorded significant improvement  However  lower loans and deposits balance were the undermining factors  In addition  expenses escalated Notably  post earnings  an appreciation in the company s share price were recorded  For the three month period ended Mar 31  2018  the stock gained around 7 5  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 31 cents over the last 60 days  reflecting a year over year improvement of nearly 34 8   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  1 44 billion indicates around 5  growth from the prior year quarter In addition  Regions is expected to record marginal rise  on a sequential basis  in average interest earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is  109 5 billion Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history  as evident from the chart below  Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions  stock  This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the first quarter  Notably  our quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat this time  Here s why Our proven model indicates that chances of Regions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it

with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is currently pegged at  1 21  Zacks Rank  The combination of Regions  Zacks Rank  3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsLoan Growth  Per the Fed s latest   loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the quarter to be reported  Particularly  weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial  C I   consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent In addition  management s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2018 will likely be reflected in this quarter  The bank projects average loans to be up in low single digits on a year over year basis  excluding the impact of the third party indirect vehicle portfolio Modest Rise in Net Interest Income  NII   Given the effect of rise in interest rates  Regions is expected to have recorded an increase in NII  Notably  management s projections of the 2018 NII and other financing income to rise in the range of 3 5  are likely to show impact in the first quarter Non Interest Income Might Escalate  The persistent decline in non interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years  Moreover  seasonally lower fee income might be experienced during the quarter  Nevertheless  adjusted non interest income is estimated to improve 3 6  in 2018 Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to decline 23 7  sequentially to  42 7 million  while commercial credit fee income is projected to increase slightly to  18 3 million Expenses Might Rise Slightly  Regions  efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter  Notably  the company is on track for a  400 million expense reduction by 2019  While investing in revenue generating areas  the company intends to keep expenses stable  Notably  in the first quarter  seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected Stocks That Warrant a

110424,331939,EFX,Headwinds That Might Dent Airline Industry Momentum,opinion,The fact that the  declined 2 5  in the first quarter of the year highlights the fact the sector is not bereft of headwinds  despite positives such as increasing financial prosperity and the new tax law Let s take a look at the factors responsible for the disappointing price performance Weather Related Disruptions Rule Stocks in the airline space have been hit repeatedly by inclement weather this year  Weather related disruptions cripple airline operations  leading to multiple flights being cancelled  Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January  successive nor easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations  In fact  the month of March has  seen more than 10 000 flights being called off due to successive nor easters  Notably  this was the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations  The increase in the number of flight cancellations resulted in significant revenue loss for airline operators and this is likely to dent the top line performance of carriers in the first quarter  According to the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U S  Department of Transportation  the number of cancellations increased during January 2018  In fact  the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 3  from 2  and 1 2  in January and December 2017  respectively  Public Relations Fiascoes Carriers such as United Continental Holdings  Inc   UAL  and Southwest Airlines Co   LUV  have been hurt by issues pertaining to animals on their flights  In February  an unfortunate child related incident occurred on a Southwest Airlines flight  Phoenix to Portland  when a dog bit the girl on the plane  Southwest started reviewing its policy pertaining to onboard service animals  even before the occurrence of incident The dog fiasco at one of the flights of United Airlines   United Continental s subsidiary   earned the carrier rebuke from all corners  In fact  the incident which resulted in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights on Mar 12  2018  did not go unnoticed by lawmakers in the United States According to a   U S  senators John Kennedy and Catherine Cortez Masto have introduced a legislation aimed at preventing airlines from putting live animals in overhead bins  The senators have also proposed the imposition of fines on violations of the animal friendly measure  This apart  the transportation of a Kansas bound German shepherd to Japan also dented its market reputation with respect to its pet handling policy  Markedly  these two mishaps were the reasons behind United Airlines  decision to suspend its pet cargo travel service  Even in 2017  United Airlines had the dubious distinction of the highest number of animal deaths on its flights The mishandling of animals has caused carriers like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   Inc   DAL  to change their policy on animals on their flights  Markedly  from Mar 1  2018 the concerned passengers on Delta flights would need to furnish documents underlining passengers  need for carrying the animal on the flight  Also  the person has to provide proof related to its training and vaccinations within 48 hours before the flight Delta carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  High Costs Likely to Hurt Bottom Line in Q1Crude oil prices are on their way back up after falling sharply from  100 a barrel in 2014  to a low of  30 in 2016  Currently  oil prices are hovering around the  66 a barrel mark  Mounting tensions related to Syria contributed to the upsurge  As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies  the rise in oil prices naturally pushed up operating expenses  in turn  hurting the bottom line of carriers  With fuel costs moving northward  bottom line growth of carriers is likely to be limited in the first quarter Apart from high fuel costs  expenses on the labor front have also been increasing over the past few quarters due to the various labor deals inked by carriers  High labor costs are likely to dent the bottom line growth of most carriers in the first quarter  Other Headwinds Plaguing Airlines The long standing pay related dispute between European low cost carrier  Ryanair Holdings plc  RYAAY   and its pilots shows no signs of ending  According to a   the European Employee Representative Council   formed in 2016 by pilots of the Irish carrier   demanded the resignation of Ryanair CEO Michael O Leary The unofficial pan European body was of the opinion that O Leary had failed to tackle the issue effectively  resulting in many pilots quitting the company  Ryanair has  however  dismissed this demand Moreover  Southwest s bleak view unveiled late last month  with respect to operating revenue per available seat miles  RASM   for first quarter also dented stocks in the space  The Dallas based carrier attributed the downbeat forecast to pricing pressure and lower than expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays Furthermore  the U S  Department of Transportation s  DOT  tentative decision to grant permission to five U S  based leading carriers to operate new scheduled flights to Havana has led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot  In fact  in a bid to attract customers  U S  carriers may face a price war  To match the low fares of carriers like JetBlue Airways Corp   JBLU  and Southwest  legacy carriers namely Delta and American Airlines Group  AAL  might follow suit which is likely to trigger a price war  Only time will tell whether the fears turn into reality  once the flights take effect following the finalization of this tentative decision  Moreover  the safety related allegations leveled against Allegiant Travel Company  ALGT  by CBS   60 Minutes  also raise concerns  The allegations are being investigated Investors will also closely watch first quarter results of the sector participants to find out whether capacity related woes  which have been hurting airlines for quite some time  show up

110456,331971,EFX,3 Airline Stocks Set To Beat Q1 Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"Shares of United   NYSE UAL   surged nearly 5  on Wednesday  one day after the airline giant posted strong first quarter earnings results  Meanwhile  fellow U S  airline companies also saw their stock prices climb  which might signal that investors are confident about the whole industry as first quarter earnings season really starts to take off 
United posted adjusted first quarter earnings of  0 50 per share  topping our Zacks Consensus Estimates of  0 49 per share  This bottom line beat helped lift United stock  which had sunk more than 13  over the last 12 weeks 
Investors who follow Zacks might have noticed that we pointed out that analysts bumped up their estimates for UAL directly ahead of earnings  Therefore  Zacks noted that United was likely to surpass Q1 earnings estimates  which can lead to an immediate surge in a company s stock price 
With that said  investors might want to look ahead to see if other airlines are expected to beat earnings estimates soon  We can utilize our  normally reserved for Zacks Premium customers in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Let s check out three airline stocks that are set to report their financial results over the next week to see if an earnings beat might be in store 
1      Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA  
Shares of Hawaiian Holdings had climbed over 7  in the last month  prior to Wednesday s 2 7  surge  However  Hawaiian s stock price is still down more than 19  over the last year  Looking ahead  the company is projected to see its quarterly revenues climb by 6 2  to hit  652 42 million  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Meanwhile  Hawaiian s Q1 earnings are expected to fall 21 2  to hit  0 82 per share  
This projected year over year decline does not necessarily mean that investors will be disappointed  as earnings beats are often more important  especially in the near term  Hawaiian is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an Earnings ESP of 1 27   The company s Most Accurate Estimate the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment calls for earnings of  0 83 per share  which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate  Therefore  investors can reasonably expect Hawaiian to post a Q1 earnings beat when it reports its first quarter financial results after market close on Tuesday  April 24 
2        Alaska Air   NYSE ALK  
Similar to Hawaiian  the last year has been rough for Alaska Air  with its stock price down nearly 25   Alaska Air stock has tried to recover over the last month and its stock price popped 1 5  on Wednesday  Furthermore  the struggling airline company is projected to see its Q1 revenues climb by 4 5  to hit  1 83 billion 
Investors might be less pleased to note that Alaska Air s earnings are expected to plummet 95  from the year ago period to  0 05 per share  With that said  Alaska Air is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and rocks an Earnings ESP of 51 53   with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 3 cents above our current consensus estimate  This means that Alaska Air  despite its projected earnings decline  is a stock that could top earnings estimates when it reports before the opening bell on Monday  April 23 
3        JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU  
Shares of JetBlue popped on Wednesday morning as the company inches closer to the release of its first quarter earnings report on April 24  Prior to this surge  JBLU stock had been down more than 11  over the last month  But JetBlue has earned five upward earnings estimate revisions within the last seven days  and the company s revenues are expected to climb by nearly 10  to reach  1 76 billion

110481,331996,EFX,Want To Buy Marijuana Stocks  Check Out These 3 Charts,opinion,"A strong start to Q1 earnings season and optimism that the U S  and China will avoid a full blown trade war has helped stocks rebound from early April volatility over the past week and a half  renewing investor confidence around the world 
Fresh bullishness over the past few trading periods has inspired positive trading in several key global markets  But interestingly enough  a number of optimistic headlines in the budding marijuana industry has led to an even stronger recovery in this popular investing area 
Canadian marijuana stocks witnessed a massive selloff at the beginning of the month after industry bellwether Canopy Growth Corp    OTC TWMJF   failed to defend its 50 day moving average  These trendy companies are followed by active traders with formulaic strategies  so technical events like this can cause plenty of movement 
But investors who take this market seriously understand that there are a variety of diverse options to focus on  With this in mind  let s take a closer look at how a few popular stocks with exposure to the marijuana industry have performed over the past few weeks 
Cronos Group Inc     NASDAQ CRON   
Cronos Group became the first pure play medical marijuana company to list on an American exchange when it debuted on the Nasdaq in late February  The firm invests in companies that are licensed to produce and sell medical grade pot  Here s how the stock has performed over the past two weeks 
CRON has clearly been on fire lately  and that might be because the stock is finally starting to see legitimate  bullish analyst coverage  In fact  about a week ago  Cronos shares received their first upgrade since the company debuted on the Nasdaq  with Toronto based investment bank GMP Securities raising the stock from hold to buy 
Innovative Industrial Properties  Inc     NYSE IIPR   
Innovative Industrial Properties is a REIT focused on the acquisition  ownership and management of specialized industrial properties for medical use cannabis facilities 
IIPR has also generated some solid momentum over the past two weeks  Investors are likely excited about the company s recent acquisition of an 89 000 square foot facility in Pennsylvania  which was announced last week  The deal included a new tenant relationship with Vireo Health  a cultivation and medical dispensary business 
GW Pharmaceuticals PLC    NASDAQ GWPH   
GW Pharmaceuticals is a U K  based biopharmaceutical company that is developing cannabinoid treatments  The firm sticks out from the above stocks because its stock behaves much more like a traditional research biotech than a weed focused REIT or investment fund 
GWPH has started to pick up pace as investors gear up for the FDA to approve its cannabis based anti seizure drug  Epidiolex  The regulatory body is meeting this week to discuss the benefits and risks of the treatment  and if that conversation goes well  it will consider approving the drug on June 27

110484,331999,EFX,4 MedTech Stocks To Keep In Good Books This Earnings Season,opinion,"Only a handful of S P 500 players have released their numbers so far this earnings season  We expect the first quarter to see strong revenues as reflected by the solid upward trend in estimate revisions Meanwhile  three back to back events in the quarter have rattled the global economy  The first was the U S  China trade war chaos  then came the tech backlash stemming from Facebook s  FB  data fiasco  and finally  the chemical attack in Syria paving ways for fresh troubles between America and Russia Furthermore  apprehensions related to further rate hikes by the Fed continue to do the rounds Is Medical Device a Safe Haven It is said that the stock market runs on sentiments and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others  Going against this notion  the Medical Device sector within the broader Medical universe has proven to be a refuge for investors  Shrugging off the ongoing tensions  the sector has returned 2  year to date  significantly higher than the S P 500 s return of 1 1  This is because  Medical Device companies have been riding high on R D innovation  increasing consolidation  focus on emerging market and tax abolition In fact  our latest  gives an encouraging picture with the broader  space expected to register year over year earnings growth of 7 8  on revenue growth of 6 3  So  it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical Device companies are placed ahead of the reporting cycle and what are the major factors shaping up the releases Growth DriversGoing by a CISION report  the United States is the largest Medical Device market in the world  raking in more than  180 billion in revenues  It has been a very profitable investment space of late Considering the ageing population  changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence  AI    big data applications  upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments  the Medical Device sector appears to be in pink of health  Here are the latest headlines from the space Taxes Abolished A bipartisan two year suspension of a  Medical Device  tax  which imposed a 2 3  excise tax on MedTech manufacturers  has been a temporary relief  It will be again put into effect on Jan 1  2020 The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9 000 America based Medical Device manufacturers  instilling investor optimism in them The ratification of the tax repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector Digital Revolution Takes MedTech by StormThe latest trend of robotic surgeries  Big data analytics  bio printing  3D printing  electronic health records  EHR   predictive analytics  real time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U S  MedTech space have been gaining prominence Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity  Evidently  companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50  reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50  This along with a rise in minimally invasive surgeries  higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care  and the shift of the payment system to a value based model have been driving profits of Medical Device companies of late Buyout RushLately  health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain Buoyed by continued capital inflow  strategic M A policies by key Medical Device players have expanded customer base  moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow  This has also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space In this regard  the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts  ESRX  by Cigna  NYSE CI   which follows just three months of drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp s  NYSE CVS  announcement of plans to acquire the nation s third largest health insurer Aetna  NYSE AET   is important  Becton  Dickinson and Company s  BDX  takeover of C  R  Bard is also worth a mention Zacks Methodology to the RescueGiven the existence of a number of players in the Medical Device industry  finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings banking on the above factors might quite an intimidating task Our proprietary Zacks methodology  however  makes it fairly simple for you One can narrow down choices by focusing specifically on the  medical instruments  and  medical product  stocks  specialized chunks under the Medical Device subcategory   that sport the desirable combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement  It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  Going by this criterion  we hereby present four stocks that are poised to beat estimates this quarter Our PicksEdwards Lifesciences Corporation  NYSE EW      Headquartered in Irvine  CA  Edwards Lifesciences deals in products and technologies aimed at treating advanced cardiovascular diseases  especially structural heart disease in critically ill patients The company s strong pipeline of products and solid performance delivered in the TAVR market bolster our confidence in the stock  Although Edwards Lifesciences  higher operating expenses might have made investors apprehensive  it is a respite as the funds were used for adopting advanced initiatives to drive overall sales Edwards Lifesciences will report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 24  after the market closes We believe the company is set to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  1 36  Hologic  Inc      Headquartered in Bedford  MA  Hologic develops  manufactures  and supplies diagnostics  medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women  The company is focused on mammography systems for breast examination and osteoporosis assessment The company will release results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on May 2  after the market closes   Hologic s Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 94  raise possibilities of a beat this quarter Meanwhile  you can see  
Stryker Corporation  NYSE SYK      Headquartered in Kalamazoo  MI  Stryker is one of the world s largest Medical Device companies operating in the orthopedic market Mako is Stryker s robotic arm Assisted surgery platform which provides a predictable surgical experience when performing joint replacement surgery Recently  Stryker launched the robotic arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with the Mako System  Notably  this is the first and only robotic technology which can be used for total knee  hip and partial knee replacement procedures  Notably  Mako Total Knee utilizes both Stryker s robotic platform and Triathlon Total Knee System  guided through CT based 3D modeling of bone anatomy  The system also allows for intra operative planning and assists in bone resectioning procedures Stryker will report first quarter of 2018 results on Apr 26  after market close   We believe Stryker is poised to trump the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has the encouraging combination of a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  0 16  Teleflex Incorporated     Headquartered in Wayne  PA  Teleflex develops  manufactures  and supplies single use medical devices for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications worldwide The company s strong focus on High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy  HFNCT  is likely to lend it a competitive edge in the niche space Solid growth in the preloaded anti microbial and anti thrombogenic VPS PICCs platform is likely to strengthen the vascular platform  In the surgical segment  new products like EFx and Ae05 fortify the company s foothold  Finally  the company s flagship LMA unique product strengthens its Anasthesia product line The company is expected to report first quarter 2018 results on May 3 We expect an earnings beat for this stock which has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 71  Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this year  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away ",2018-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-medtech-stocks-to-keep-in-good-books-this-earnings-season-200306674,200306674

110490,332005,EFX,Should ESG Investors Avoid Facebook  FB  Stock On Data Privacy Woes ,opinion,"Facebook   NASDAQ FB   has faced significant backlash from both general users and the investing community since the details of the Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged  with shares dropping as much as 18  in the weeks after the story was first reported  The stock has rebounded a bit since then  but the social media company is now facing an uphill battle as it looks to win back public trust 
Heightened scrutiny of data privacy policies clearly presents a number of headwinds for Facebook s stock  In what some investors might consider the worst case scenario  a full blown rejection of the company s business model could see advertisers and users flee from the platform  while regulatory pressure might result in new laws or fines 
In the meantime  Facebook will likely be forced to spend more cash on security and content vetting  which could hurt its bottom line 
The investors that might be most concerned about Facebook right now are those that focus on environmental  social  and governance  ESG  investing  ESG investing is growing in popularity  especially among young people  and today more so than ever before companies are feeling the pressure from shareholders who want their portfolios to coincide with positive outcomes in the world around them 
Up until recently  Facebook might have been considered a darling in the ESG world  but the handling of personal information and the nature of personal privacy on the internet are inherently ethical questions  and it makes sense that the company s latest data woes might be frowned upon by ESG investors 
Still  it can be tough to measure a company based on its ESG outcomes  One firm attempting to ease this process is Sustainalytics  a leading provider of ESG ratings and research 
Looking at the Sustainalytics grades for Facebook via   we can see that the social media company has earned an overall ESG score of 52 out of 100 making it an  Average Performer  in their system  Facebook s strongest ESG score is Social  60 out of 100   while its weakest category is Governance  39   according to Sustainalytics 
Perhaps even more interesting is that Facebook has earned a Controversy Level of 3  which is enough to count as a  Significant Controversy Level   Yahoo Finance says that the Sustainalytics Controversy Level is a one to five scale used to identify those faced with  incidents and events that may negatively impact stakeholders  the environment or the company s operations  
It is reasonable to conclude that Facebook s Governance score and Controversy Level have both suffered from the firm s ongoing data privacy scandal  What s worse  this is not the only concerning ratings trend that Facebook investors need to be aware of 
Within the past 60 days  Facebook has witnessed five downward revisions to its full year EPS estimates  outnumbering the two positive revisions it has seen over that time  This negative revision activity has dragged the Zacks Consensus Estimate about 8 cents lower  Still  the stock is clinging to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  at the moment 
Analysts are now expecting Facebook to report earnings growth of 15  on 36  higher revenues in 2018  Despite caution inducing ESG scores and troubling estimate revisions  the internet company remains a viable option for investors focused solely on top  and bottom line expansion and currently holds an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system

110493,332008,EFX,Roche Hemophilia Drug Gets Breakthrough Therapy Designation ,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG s   OTC RHHBY   member Genentech announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to its hemophilia drug  Hemlibra  emicizumab kxwh   The designation was granted to Hemlibra for treatment of people with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors 
The designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions and provide patients access to these as soon as possible 
This designation is based on data from the phase III HAVEN 3 study in people 12 years or older with hemophilia A without inhibitors  In the study  Hemlibra prophylaxis dosed subcutaneously every week or every two weeks showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in treated bleeds compared to no prophylaxis  The study met its primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints with Hemlibra significantly reducing bleeding 
Roche s stock has lost 11 6  over a year compared with  s gain of 8 9  

We note that the FDA approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to event or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in November 2017  Hemlibra was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in September 2015 
In January 2018  the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use   CHMP   adopted a positive opinion for Hemlibra  emicizumab  for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients suffering from hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors  The CHMP has recommended the drug for use in all age groups  The Marketing Authorisation Application is being reviewed under accelerated assessment 
A potential approval will further boost Roche s hematology portfolio which includes approved drugs like MabThera Rituxan  Gazyva Gazyvaro  Tecentriq and Venclexta 
We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    Both companies are jointly commercializing the drug in the United States  AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States 
Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin  MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars 
Novartis   NYSE NVS   has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan  MabThera in Europe  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer  colorectal cancer  glioblastoma  renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer Roche Holding AG Price

at PlayEquity Residential has been making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier to entry core markets  The company s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in six core coastal metropolitan areas   Boston  New York  Washington D C   Southern California  including Los Angeles  Orange County and San Diego   San Francisco and Seattle Moreover  the home ownership cost in most markets of Equity Residential is significantly higher than the national average  Considering the current macroeconomic environment  such a trend is expected to continue  which in turn  would drive demand for rented apartments Further  corporate profits are up  and corporate tax cuts are encouraging companies to deploy capital and increase wages  As such  consumer confidence is high  driven by job growth and rising wages  promising solid prospects for Equity Residential  In addition  favorable demographics  lifestyle transformation and creation of new households amid improving economy will further accelerate demand for the company s properties Amid these  Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share of 74 78 cents for first quarter 2018

is pegged at  631 3 million  reflecting expected growth of 4 5  year over year However  the latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP     states that the national apartment market moderated in first quarter 2018  with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down  Nevertheless  the first quarter marks a slow leasing period  thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand Going by statistics  the annual rent growth shrunk to 2 3  in Q1  This marked moderation from the 2 6 2 9  growth rate experienced throughout 2017  Occupancy level of 94 5  this March edged down from the prior year tally of 95   with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy  Nevertheless  the overall occupancy level is still healthy Moreover  there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company s markets  This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to be reported quarter  In addition  there is high concession activity amid elevated supply  which remains a concern Furthermore  the company s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days Here is what our quantitative model predicts Equity Residential has

110662,332177,EFX,Higher Rates  Fee Revenues To Aid SunTrust  STI  Q1 Earnings,opinion,SunTrust Banks  Inc    NYSE STI   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 20  before the opening bell  Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year Last quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results benefited from improvement in revenues  stable adjusted expenses and lower provisions  However  a decline in loan and deposit balances was the undermining factor SunTrust has an impressive earnings surprise history  Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched in one  over the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 3 1  SunTrust Banks  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    However  the company s activities in the first quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates upward  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 11 remained unchanged over the last seveb days  Nevertheless  the figure represents a year over year improvement of 27 6  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  2 27 billion for the to be reported quarter reflects an improvement of 2 8  from the prior year quarter However  the company s price performance has not been very impressive  Its shares have lost 3 8  in the past three months compared with the  s decline of 8 9  Will the price performance improve post first quarter earnings release  Let s check which factors are expected to impact SunTrust s Q1 earnings Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income  NII  to Improve  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings assets of  184 6 billion for the first quarter reflects an improvement of nearly 1  year over year  Moreover  the quarter witnessed a modest improvement in lending  particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial  to which the company has a high degree of exposure  Thus  given the loan growth and rising interest rates  NII is expected to improve in the quarter Also  management expects first quarter net interest margin to be up 0 2 basis points  bps  Relatively Stable Non Interest Income  While overall mortgage servicing fees remained decent in the first quarter  production volumes slowed down  Thus  mortgage production income is expected to remain weak  Moreover  with the refinance boom nearing its end  this segment is not going to be much of a help and hence  SunTrust s overall mortgage revenues are not expected to witness much improvement Coming to investment banking activities  strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow on offerings  thereby having a positive impact on the related fees  However  the trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt issuance may reverse to some extent in the to be reported quarter  as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates  involvement in these activities  Thus  investment banking income is expected to remain muted in the quarter Nevertheless  given the significantly high volatility experienced in the first quarter  particularly in the months of February and March  trading activities remained strong  This is expected to boost trading income for the company Expenses to Decline Slightly  Driven by branch consolidation efforts  SunTrust s expenses have been declining for the past few years  While the company expects core personnel expenses to increase approximately  75 million in the quarter due to the seasonal increase in 401 k  and FICA expenses  overall costs are expected to remain low Now  let s check what our quantitative model predicts Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model  chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to be reported quarter are low  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to be confident of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is  0 27  Zacks Rank  SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  While this increases the

110663,332178,EFX,Are Hibbett s  HIBB  Margins Likely To Recover Anytime Soon ,opinion,"Hibbett Sports Inc    NASDAQ HIBB   is going strong  when it comes to price performance  with the stock gaining 11 4  in the past month against the  s decline of 4 4   The company s positive earnings trend  improved e commerce penetration and loyalty program  as well as stringent inventory management aided this outperformance  However  the company s soft margin trend is a key concern  which keeps our rating for the stock at Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Promotion   Markdowns Impact MarginsHibbett Sports is witnessing strained margins for quite a while now  This is clear from the reduction in gross and operating margins in the past few quarters  Notably  gross and operating margins contracted 153 basis points  bps  and 180 bps  respectively  in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  The decline in gross margin was due to increased promotions and markdowns undertaken to improve inventory along with higher e commerce penetration  Additionally  higher SG A expenses due to additional operating expenses associated with the 53rd week and increased marketing expenses related to the e commerce business took a toll on the operating margin Notably  this was the sixth straight quarter of negative gross and operating margins  Gross margin declined 337 bps  440 bps  160 bps  180 bps and 70 bps  respectively  in the preceding five quarters  Meanwhile  the company recorded operating margin decline of 480 bps  330 bps  350 bps and 330 bps  respectively  in the third and first quarter of fiscal 2018 along with the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017  Further  it reported an operating loss of  5 2 million in second quarter fiscal 2018 

Higher SG A Expenses to Hurt Operating MarginsGoing into fiscal 2019  Hibbett seems to have put in place constraints related to gross margins  It expects gross margin to increase about 70 100 bps  mainly due to rise in realized product margins because of a better inventory position However  SG A expense is expected to increase 6 8  due to higher operational and marketing costs related to e commerce business  investments in employees and omni channel initiatives as well as higher compensation costs linked with more normalized incentive payments  This is likely to have a bearing on the company s operating margin and profitability for the year Consequently  the company envisions earnings for fiscal 2019 to be  1 65  1 95 per share compared with  1 71 earned in fiscal 2018 Estimates Roll DownThe company s overall soft outlook for fiscal 2019 led to a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the last 30 days  Estimates for the first quarter and fiscal 2019 have declined by 3 cents and 6 cents  respectively  to  1 13 per share and  1 87 per share  Moreover  estimates for fiscal 2020 have dipped 1 cent to  2 08 per share Hibbett Sports  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks Witnessing Margin PressuresNotably  Hibbett is not the only retailer plagued with margin constraints  We see many retailers grappling with lower margin graphs due to higher costs related to strategic initiatives along with increased operating expenses One of Hibbett s closest peers DICK S Sporting Goods Inc    NYSE DKS   is witnessing margin pressures due to shrinking sales and increased promotions among others  Going forward  it expects greater product innovation from its key partners and further expansion of its private brands business to lower margin pressures than previously anticipated  However  the company still expects margins to remain negative Abercrombie   Fitch Company   NYSE ANF   has been witnessing strained margins due to soft traffic at stores as well as a highly promotional environment  Additionally  its ongoing strategic initiatives to improve profitability have been weighing on the margins  The company s gross margin is likely to remain under pressure in first quarter fiscal 2018  It also carries a Zacks Rank  3 Further  Ross Stores Inc    NASDAQ ROST   projects soft operating margin for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 due to soft merchandise margin and the impact of competitive wage along with benefit related investments All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this year  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away ",2018-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-hibbetts-hibb-margins-likely-to-recover-anytime-soon-200306529,200306529
110664,332179,EFX,4 Stocks To Snap Up On March Tick Up In Housing Starts,opinion,Housing starts and building permits made a comeback in March  after the respective drop of 7  and 5 7  in February 2017  However  homebuilder sentiment slid by a point for April from the previous month Per the latest jointly released report from the U S  Census Bureau and the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  housing starts increased 1 9  to 1 32 million units  seasonally adjusted annual rate  in March from the prior month  The figure also improved 10 3  on a year over year basis Moreover  residential building permits  an indicator of construction activity  increased 2 5  in March to an annualized rate of 1 35 million units from February Multifamily Starts   Permits SurgeThe uptick in housing starts has been driven by a 16 1  spike in multifamily starts  The volatile trend in multifamily starts is well reflected in the 28  decline in February after a solid 23 7  rise in January  Also  multifamily permits rose 22 9  from the preceding month According to a study by FreddieMac  multifamily performance was mostly strong through 2017  FreddieMac expects the trend to continue through 2018 as completions peak and supply increases slightly faster than demand  Vacancy rates are expected to continue to scale higher at the national level and in most metropolitan areas but the majority will remain below the historical averages  Rents will continue to grow on a healthy labor market and lifestyle preferences  creating demand for multifamily units Availability   Affordability Hurt Single Family UnitsSingle family units  which are generally of higher importance and are indicative of a strengthening economy  have dropped in count  The 3 7  decline in housing starts was largely led by a shortage in housing lots   marking the steepest decline in seven years  The drop in supply is leading to higher home prices  giving rise to affordability issues Single family home permits dropped 5 5  from the prior month  indicating a slowdown in single family home construction activity Housing Industry s StanceBuilders are concerned about elevated material costs due to the newly imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel and limited land availability that are marring margins  Apart from this  there are concerns related to a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  These factors are restricting homebuilders from responding to rising demand  pushing confidence down by a point to 69 in April The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI  includes builder perceptions of current single family home sales  sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers  The downside was a result of lower sales expectations  which dropped one point to 77  Traffic of prospective buyers were steady at 51  while the component gauging current sales conditions dropped two points to 75 However  these factors haven t had a marked impact on the industry s performance  which has been maintaining a leading position for quite some time  The  has rallied 17 4  in the past year  comparing favorably with 15 9  growth of the broader market  S P 500   Moreover  a good industry rank  top 42  of more than 250 industries  instills investor confidence in this industry Solid economic growth and job market make us reasonably confident about the industry s performance  The economy experienced job additions at an average pace of 202 000 per month during the first quarter  This was significantly faster than the average gains registered over the last two years  Moreover  builders  confidence level reading of 50 or above is considered strong enough  The modest decline in single family starts in March is still in line with our solid builder confidence readings and is largely attributable to lingering winter weather that is causing production delays in certain areas of the country   believes NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz  Also  he is optimistic about the gradual strengthening of the housing market in the coming months  given the ongoing job creation  wage increases and rising household formations Choosing the Right StocksInvestors can bank on construction stocks  which are making the most of the positive housing momentum despite the adversities  We have chosen companies with the

110700,332215,EFX,Industrial Machinery Stock Outlook   April 2018,opinion,"Accelerating growth of the global economy  from 3 2  in 2016 to 3 7  in 2017  had been a propeller for many countries  both advanced and emerging  including the United States  Over the two years  2016 2017   the country s major stock indexes   S P 500  Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq   have surged 30 8   41 9  and 37 9   respectively  Its Gross Domestic Product  GDP  expanded roughly 1 5  in 2016 and 2 3  in 2017 
The International Monetary Fund s  IMF  growth projections are also encouraging  In its January 2018 report  the IMF predicted that the global output will expand 3 9  in both 2018 and 2019  The U S  economy is projected to grow 2 7  in 2018 and 2 5  in 2019  These estimates reflect an improvement of 0 4  for 2018 and 0 6  for 2019 from its earlier growth forecasts 
Our in house projections indicate roughly 18  growth in earnings and a 5 6  increase in revenues for the S P 500 companies in 2018  The earnings projection compares favorably with a growth rate of 9 7  recorded in 2017 
We believe that advancement in the global economy and a strengthening domestic market will prove beneficial for demand of industrial machinery  Technological advancement in agriculture and mining industries will require upgraded farming and mining machineries  while growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations will raise need for highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment  Further  the need for better infrastructure and residential and non residential spaces will raise the demand for heavy construction machinery 
Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below 
Industrial Machinery by Nation
The United States  Many factors are currently working in favor of industrial machinery companies here  Encouraging job data  with an unemployment rate of 4 1  in February versus 4 7  in the year ago month  infrastructural improvement plans of the government and strengthening housing markets are some tailwinds 
Some other key economic indicators are pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  The country s industrial production grew 4 4  year over year in February  This marked the highest increase on a year over year basis since March 2011  Mining sector expanded 9 7   utilities 10 5  and manufacturing 2 5  
Also  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery in January 2018 grew 11 4  year over year while the ISM Purchasing Managers  Index or manufacturing index for February expanded 1 7 percentage points from the previous month  The improvement in the ISM Purchasing Managers  Index suggests expanding economic activities in the manufacturing sector   the key highlights being healthier business conditions  favorable export orders and production  solid backlog and employment growth 
Also  the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 lowered taxes for many corporations  enabling them to invest the free resources in growth projects  However  the government s tariff imposition on import of steel and aluminum jolted the market somewhat  with fears of possible increase in competitive threats from international players  hike in production costs and retaliatory measures by affected nations 
Japan  The country s economy is still struggling with internal issues  including an aging population and a huge public debt However  strengthening exports driven by a rise in automobile shipments  improvements in domestic demand induced by healthy growth in private investments and improving employment and wage rates will be beneficial  The country s GDP grew 1 5  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while registering a 0 5  rise over the previous quarter 
According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months increased 8 2  in January 2018  However  this is predicted to decline 1 5  in the first quarter of 2018 while total machinery orders are predicted to fall 6 9  
The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 50 basis points  bps  to 1 2  for 2018 and by 10 bps to 0 9  for 2019 
China  China s GDP grew 6 8  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while it expanded 6 9  in 2017  higher than the government s target of 6 5   Healthy export demand  flexible property market and rising manufacturing activities were the prime growth drivers 
The country s industrial production improved 7 2  year over year in both January and February 2018  Electricity  gas and water production as well as manufacturing sectors flourished while the mining recovered during the period 
For 2018  the government of China anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   We believe that robust investment for the development of infrastructure and transportation will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery  Also  the country s efforts to lower its debt burden will be advantageous  However  the possibilities of a trade war with the United States  triggered by its imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium  might be a concerning factor for the both the countries  trade relations 
The IMF projects economy of China to grow 6 6  in 2018 and 6 4  in 2019  up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates 
India  The country s major economic decisions   including demonetization and goods and services tax   along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth  Also  favorable domestic job market  low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans  infrastructure investments  healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination 
The country s industrial production grew 7 5  year over year in January 2018 versus a 7 1  gain recorded in December  Manufacturing output expanded 8 7   electricity production jumped 7 6  while mere 0 1  growth was registered in mining 
According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 4  in 2018 and 7 8  in 2019 
Brazil  The country is grappling with uncertainties on the political front that has over time adversely affected the country s growth opportunities  General elections are due this October with high probability of abandoned initiatives to reform the country s pension system becoming a major topic of discussion  Moreover  inadequate infrastructure and a still high unemployment rate of 12 6   in three months ended February 2018  are other major hurdles 
Partially negating these  growth in export demand  strengthening spending in the housing markets and rise in consumer confidence are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy  Also  falling inflation has prompted the country s Central Bank to ease interest rates  Notably  the interest rate has been lowered 25 bps in March 2018  this being its 10th consecutive rate cut since 2017  The country s GDP in 2017 grew 1  after 3 5  decline in both 2015 and 2016 and is predicted to grow 3  in 2018 
In addition  the country s industrial production has been encouraging  with year over year growth of 5 7  recorded for January 2018  This compares favorably with 4 5  growth in December 2017 and 4 7  in November 2017 
The IMF expects the country s output to grow 1 9  in 2018  reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast  Also  growth projections for 2019 have been increased 10 bps to 2 1  
Eurozone  The region  amidst all the political uncertainties  is showing improvements in export demand and labor markets  The region s GDP improved 2 7  year over year in fourth quarter 2017 while advanced 2 3  in 2017  Industrial production improved 2 7  year over year in January 2018 
The unemployment rate was 8 6  in January 2018  down from 9 6  in the year ago month but stable compared with December 
The IMF raised output growth estimates by 30 bps both for 2018 and 2019 to 2 2  and 2   respectively

Here are the key points      Total Q1 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  16  from the same period last year on  7 4  higher revenues  the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in 7 years       Earnings growth is expected to be in double digit territory from the year earlier level for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  including the Technology and Finance sectors  Only two sectors  Autos   Conglomerates  are expected to show earnings declines in Q1      Energy sector earnings are expected to be up  60 2  from the same period last year on  15 6  higher revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total S P 500 earnings growth drops from  16  to  14 6         The earnings season wouldn t be in the spotlight till the big banks come out with results in a couple of weeks  but the reporting cycle has actually begun as 22 S P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in February have reported results already      Earnings estimates for Q1 and the following quarters have improved in a notable way  with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors going up      In percentage terms  estimates have gone up the most for the Basic Materials  Energy  Construction and Industrial Products sectors  In absolute terms  the positive revisions to the Finance and Technology sectors account for more than half of all estimate upgrades since the quarter got underway      This positive revisions trend is the most dramatic change on the earnings scene in recent years and will be closely watched whether the trend will continue in the coming days as the Q1 earnings season unfolds      For the S P 600 index  total Q1 earnings are expected to be up  14 1  from the same period last year on  10  higher revenues  This would follow  14 8  earnings growth on  7 7  revenue growth in the preceding quarter      For full year 2018  total earnings for the S P 500 index are track to be up  17 9  on  5 3  higher revenues  with full year 2019 earnings and revenues for the index expected to be up  9 4  and  4 1   respectively      The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2018 P E of 17X and index close  as of April 4rd   is  153 80  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  168 30 for 2019  P E of 15 5X   The multiples for 2018 and 2019 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year    The most profound change on the earnings scene lately is the unusually positive revisions trend for Q1 and following quarters  The chart below shows how 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved since mid December 2017 This is a sight that we haven t seen in a very long time  definitely not in the last 6 years 

The most important factor driving this positive revisions trend is the tax cuts  The rise in oil prices and the impact of uptrend bond yields on banks  profitability are some of the other factors Estimates have gone up across the board for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with the highest percentage positive revisions for the Basic Materials  Energy  Construction  and Industrials  In absolute terms  the positive revisions to the Finance and Technology sectors account for more than half of all aggregate positive revision since mid December 2017  For example  JPMorgan s    Q1 EPS estimate of  2 27 has gone up  13 5  over the past three months Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q4 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods 

It will be interesting to see if expectations for the following quarters will continue the positive revisions trend we witnessed ahead of the Q1 earnings season or we will go back to negative revisions trend that has been the recurring theme over the last many years

before the market opens  Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to improve year over year Before we discuss the factors that could influence the results  let s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions  People s United reported a positive earnings surprise of 11 1  in fourth quarter 2017  Further  elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds  However  escalating expenses was the undermining factor Notably  People s United delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the four trailing quarters

during the quarter to be reported  Particularly  weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial  C I   consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent In addition  management s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2018 will likely be reflected in this quarter  Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 4 6   while deposits are projected to be up 3 5  Modest Rise in Net Interest Income  NII   Given the influence of rise in interest rates  People s United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII  Notably  management s projections of 2018 NII s growth in the range of 10 12  is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well  This is based on the expectation of net interest margin  NIM  in the range of 3 05 3 15   on assumption of a 25 basis point rate hike during the year Fee Income to Escalate  On strong retail banking  fee income might escalate for the bank  Additionally  the company projects non interest income to rise in the range of 3 5  in 2018  the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the first quarter Increase in Expenses  Despite undertaking a number of expense saving initiatives  People s United s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level  Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs  escalating expense levels are likely to curb bottom line expansion Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider  as according to

110799,332314,EFX,An Early Preview Of United s  UAL  Earnings Outlook,opinion,"United   NYSE UAL   saw its stock price sink nearly 4  on Monday  However  the airline giant s decline coincided with a nearly market wide downturn  which is better than a fundamental related dip as we inch closer toward the release of United s first quarter 2018 financial results 
Before today s drop  shares of United had been up nearly 3  in the last four weeks  Yet  over the last year  shares of United are down more than 6  as it fails to impress investors 
United also faces increased competition domestically and internationally  On top of that  the market s recent bearish turn has many investors searching for stability  This means that investors might be on the lookout for stocks that boast strong outlooks ahead of Q1 earnings season 
With that said  let s take a closer look at some of United s current estimates to understand if investors should consider buying the stock ahead of its upcoming Q1 earnings report 
Latest Outlook and Valuation
United has earned seven earnings estimate revisions  with 100  agreement to the upside  all within the last 30 days  These revisions raised United s consensus earnings estimate by 18 cents  Despite this more positive outlook  our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for United s Q1 earnings to sink by 30  from the year ago period to hit  0 28 per share 
Investors should be pleased to note that United s revenues are expected to climb by 6 6  to reach  8 97 billion 
Heading into its soon to be reported quarter  UAL is trading with a Forward P E of 8 5  This marks a substantial discount compared to the  Transportation   Airline  industry  which is currently trading at an average of 10 6x forward earnings    
Latest Results 
The company has already reported some of its passenger metrics for the first two months of the first quarter  United s January revenue passenger miles rose 1 8   while its available seat miles jumped 3 3  
United s recently reported February results looked better on a year over year basis  as revenue passenger miles jumped 5 7  and available seat miles climbed 3 8  
Price Performance and Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of United s Q1 report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices United Continental Holdings  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   We can see that United boasts a strong earnings surprise history over the last few years  yet a strong bottom line result has not always led to immediate positive momentum for the stock 
Bottom Line
Past performance is not always an indicator of future success  but we know that United has posted solid bottom line beats for some time now  Investors should also note that these earnings beats have done little to help United s stock price  especially over the last year 
On the positive side  some United analysts have upped their earnings estimates over the last month  and the stock is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

110811,332326,EFX,5 Juicy Dividend Stocks To Ride Out A Dicey April,opinion,April has time and again proved to be favorable for stocks  But this time around  April has arrived during midterm election  which usually spells a rough phase for stocks Earnings related volatility could spike further in April  Unabated trade tensions  possibilities of two or more rate hikes by the Fed this year  high profile departures in the Trump administration and the real impact of the tax overhaul policy are laying the base for a tumultuous earnings season  Long dormant volatility  by the way  made a comeback last month With the month expected to be rough  investing in sound dividend paying stocks seems judicious  Such stocks provide steady income and cushion one s portfolio against market risks Midterm Election Years Spell TroubleThe Stock Trader s Almanac noted that April has traditionally been a strong month for stocks  going back to World War II  The Dow Jones  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gained an average of 1 9   1 5  and 1 4   respectively But  such a rise wouldn t be enough to drive the indices back to record territory  The Dow is already 9 4  below its all time record high  the S P 500 is off 8 1  and the Nasdaq is down 7 5   Lest we forget  all the major bourses have already seen the second straight monthly drop and the second steepest monthly fall for the tech laden Nasdaq since January 2016 A bigger concern  in fact  is that April comes during a mid term election year  In such years  historically  the second quarter is weak for the broader market  as is the third quarter  In the second quarter  the market typically gains 1 8  since World War II but loses 2 2  during such years  The third quarter also isn t much better than the second in election years Volatility Likely to Stay Another concern for market pundits is earnings related volatility  Markets are gearing up for first quarter earnings results this month  Investors seek clarity on the impact of protectionist trade policies and higher interest rates  After all  these factors will play a pivotal role in determining first quarter earnings results According to The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc   NYSE GS     the options market is pricing in earnings volatility mostly in April week 4   The technology sector  in particular  will be more susceptible to erratic movements  Goldman noted that

22 68  above its long term average of 20  The VIX reflects traders  collective anticipation for volatility in the upcoming 30 day period Factors Intensifying InstabilityTrade related fears increased after Trump imposed duties on foreign aluminum and steel  and levied tariffs on China products  Beijing retaliated by targeting 128 U S  products with an import value of  3 billion  A full blown trade should unnerve investors as it might deal a heavy blow to economies and hurt corporate profits Amid all these  the Fed has hiked rates by a quarter percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020  This hasn t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U S  stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies  After all  rate hikes will raise borrowing costs  eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U S  economy April Could be Cruel  Buy 5 Top Dividend

110839,332354,EFX,Anatomy Of Success  Delek US Holdings  DK ,opinion,"Identifying which stocks are best positioned to see big returns is no doubt a daunting task  but if you utilize a tool like the Zacks Rank  it becomes much easier  and much more profitable 
Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  title have a long history of outperforming the markets over a one to three month time period  only 5  of the Zacks Rank universe receives this unique grade  Not only does this ranking system help identify the most elite stocks  but it also helps you hold a particular company while it continues to gain in value beyond that three month investment horizon 
The example blow illustrates how investors could have used this methodology to discover a company that was on the verge of seeing accelerated price appreciation  And by following the Zacks Rank  they could have stayed in the stock while it beat and raised estimates for three out of the last four quarters 
Delek US Holdings  DK 
Delek is a diversified energy business that is focused on petroleum refining  marketing  and supply of refined products  as well as the retail marketing of fuel and general merchandise  Founded in 2001  Delek has one of the largest exposure to the Permian Basin of any independent refiner and anticipates annual synergies between  85 million to  105 million in 2018 
Going into its first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings report  DK was a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Delek surged past both top and bottom line estimates  with earnings surpsring by almost 150   Improved results were primarily driven by an increase in its refining segment thanks to a multitude of factors  For the quarter  refining segment contribution margin was  64 4 million  compared to  23 5 million in the year ago quarter   Overall  the company saw improved drilling activity and crude oil production in the Permian Basin  which positively affected its operations 
This strong performance helped DK earn a  1  Strong Buy  on the Zacks Rank on May 19  and the stock was able to keep this streak alive for many weeks afterwards  At the closing bell that day  shares of Delek closed at  25 36 
On December 15  DK was added to the Strong Buy list a few weeks after the company reported its third quarter results  After stumbling a bit in Q2  earnings bounced back and beat estimates  Delek closed the Alon USA transaction in July  which helped create a Permian focused diversified downstream energy company  the company also captured annualized  53 million of synergies related to the transaction  About eight months after the company first became a  1  Strong Buy   DK increased almost 30  to  32 54 per share 
The oil player remained at the top of the Zacks Rank until well into January and was added to the Strong Buy list again towards the end of the month  At the closing bell on January 26  shares of Delek closed at  36 22  over 42  since its first became a Strong Buy 
The company s fourth quarter was another strong one  and earnings and revenues both beat estimates  This quarter was primarily driven by its refining segment again  and contribution margin here was  185 8 million  compared to contribution margin of  13 2 million in the prior year period   Additionally  Delek s logistics segment contribution margin improved to  32 7 million during the quarter  It also announced a 33  increase to it regular quarterly dividend to  0 20 per share  As a result  DK was made a  1  Strong Buy  once again on March 2 
Right now  DK is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   and is trading around  40 a share  up nearly 60  from when it was first made a Strong Buy Stock 
This table shows the price performance of DK  in red   as well as the 12 month forward looking EPS estimate  in green  from the time the stock first earned a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   During this stretch  DK never moved lower than a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

By utilizing the Zacks Rank  investors are able to easily identify elite stocks that are best positioned to beat the market on a consistent basis  and how to hold those top stocks as they continue to grow 
Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio 
Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others

110841,332356,EFX,5 Best Performing Buy Ranked Oil Stocks Of The First Quarter,opinion,"Posting its third quarterly gain in a row  oil prices ended March 2017 up nearly 8  year to date  The commodity got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures climbing 7 1  in January  Though the benchmark tumbled 4 8  in February in the wake of a broad stock market selloff  it staged a rebound in March  with the contract up 5 6  for the month 
The first quarter of the year saw U S  oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 despite record high domestic production  Crude was supported by a variety of catalysts  including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies 
What s encouraging is that the quarterly price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into 2018 following the futures contracts  back to back yearly increases  To be precise  the commodity rose about 7 5  in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at  64 94 per barrel 
Reasons for Oil s Quarterly Surge
Red Hot Demand  The major factor fueling higher oil prices is the fast growing demand for the commodity  which continues to tighten the market 
Recently  the International Energy Agency  IEA  upwardly revised its crude demand estimates  The energy consultative body  in its closely watched monthly oil market report  said that global demand is likely to grow by 1 5 million barrels a day this year to average 99 3 million barrels a day  This projection is 90 000 barrels a day above the previous estimate 
On the other hand  supply from OPEC   which still accounts for roughly 40  of the world s crude   is expected to remain weak throughout 2018  The cartel s strong adherence with the production cut pact has meant that worldwide supplies  currently at around 97 million barrels a day  are lower than demand  This has rebalanced the oil market to a large extent  reflecting positively on prices 
Also  years of low price environment have forced operators to trim their capital expenditures considerably that means a relatively narrow pipeline of new projects 
OPEC Supply Cuts  One of the significant reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared nearly 17  in the previous quarter revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output cut deal beyond March  True to predictions  the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018  The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut 
Sharp Inventory Drawdowns  The U S  Energy Department s inventory releases have shown multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles  another pointer to a tightening oil market  Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 51 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year  The gradual fall   stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports   has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 429 9 million barrels  current crude supplies are 20  below the year ago period 
Middle East Tensions  Venezuela and the Fed  Oil prices were also supported by growing concerns over tensions between major crude producers Iran and Saudi Arabia  There is widespread speculation that Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman s ongoing state visit to Washington is aimed at ramping up pressure to reimpose sanctions on Iran  As it is  the removal of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state raises questions over the future of the Iran nuclear deal 
There are indications that the  more hawkish  Mike Pompeo might lead America s exit from the Iran pact if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12  This has injected uncertainty into the oil market by threatening the flow of the Gulf country s swelling crude exports 
Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters  With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse  oil output has dwindled by almost 50  since 2005  Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day  much lower that its pledge per the OPEC led supply cuts 
Finally  oil prices were also supported by the Federal Reserve s decision to raise interest rates  As widely expected  the U S  central bank opted to hike the benchmark lending rate a quarter point to between 1 5  and 1 75   This led to dollar weakness that made the greenback priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency 
How to Identify the Outperformers 
The strong quarterly rally does not necessarily indicate that all energy scrips would be wise picks  Moreover  with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns  While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  this is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy 
In particular  we have shortlisted five companies that have outperformed oil prices over the past 12 weeks and have a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see

110862,332377,EFX,Las Vegas Sands  Revenue Diversification Helps  Debt Hurts,opinion,"Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   is known for continual investment in new capital projects in Macao and Las Vegas  Also  solid expansion strategies of the company are encouraging  However  stiff competition and greater dependence on debt financing remain concerns 
The company s scale and diversity of gaming and non gaming services  across Macao and Singapore operations primarily drove better than expected results in fourth quarter 2017 
Notably  shares of Las Vegas Sands have gained 25 8  in the past year  outperforming its  s growth of 21 9   An upward estimate revision of 0 6  for earnings in the current year  over the last 60 days  also reflects analysts  optimism 
Given the ongoing recovery of gaming revenues in Macao and continued improvement in the Las Vegas business  the stock is expected to perform well in the quarters ahead 
Continued Expansion   Revenue Diversification Efforts Bode Well
Low unemployment levels  a slight uptick in consumer discretionary spending and the growth of tourism industry have been favorable for Las Vegas Sands  In order to rake in profits  the company is continuously expanding through planned investments in new capital projects 
Moreover  Las Vegas Sands is consistently trying to diversify its revenue sources  The company remains focused on a convention based Integrated Resort business model that helps in generating the most diversified set of cash flows and profit from non gaming segments  Also  in collaboration with Madison Square  NYSE SQ  Garden  Live Nation Entertainment   NYSE LYV   and Oak View Group  Las Vegas Sands plans to create a large scale music and entertainment venue in Las Vegas  for concerts and events 
We believe that this continued expansion and focus on non gaming segment will continue to attract greater number of customers  and help the company generate more sales  Also  due to the diversification in revenue stream  EBITDA margins have been improving consistently as non gaming segments carry higher margins  On a consolidated basis  adjusted property EBITDA was up 19 7  year over year to  1 34 billion in the fourth quarter on robust operating momentum in Macao operations 
Stiff Competition   Debt Burden are Headwinds
Growth in the tourism industry and increased demand have made Las Vegas and Macao markets highly competitive  Excess supply in these markets might reduce Las Vegas Sands  market share and thereby hurt its revenues  The company is constantly facing peer pressure from several Chinese casino operators  and other U S  based companies including Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   and MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   
Meanwhile  Las Vegas Sands  heavy reliance on debt financing remains a concern  As of Dec 31  2017  unrestricted cash balance was  2 4 billion  up from  2 billion as of Sep 30  2017  However  total debt outstanding  including the current portion and net of deferred financing costs  along with original issue discount  was as high as  9 64 billion and increased  0 02 billion sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2017 
Owing to higher debt burden  the company may fail to finance its upcoming projects  Moreover  any downturn in the macroeconomic and credit market conditions would make it difficult for the company to pay or refinance its debt  going ahead

The company projects savings of  400 million in 2018 and more than  1 5 billion over the four year period from 2018 to 2021  This will be achieved  courtesy of management s focus on enriching productivity at manufacturing facilities  optimizing design and raw material expenses as well as attaining distribution efficiencies Further  the company s adherence toward maximizing savings and inducing operating efficiencies is evident from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program  In fact  the program is considered as one of the largest restructuring initiatives undertaken by the company  It primarily focuses on enhancing underlying profitability for better competition and provides greater flexibility to undertake growth oriented investments 
Delving deeper  we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly Clark s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures  Notably  management expects cost savings of  50  70 million from this program in 2018

110866,332381,EFX,Top Stock Reports For United Technologies  Medtronic   Gilead,opinion,"Monday  April 2  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including United Technologies  UTX   Medtronic  NYSE MDT  and Gilead  GILD   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
United Technologies  shares have gained  6 9  in the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has lost  12 8  over the same period  United Technologies serves various end markets  which allows it to remain profitable even during tough economic times  The company has offered a bullish guidance for 2018 on healthy demand trends and is likely to deliver sustainable earnings growth in future with Rockwell merger  
United Technologies remains focused on four key priorities  flawless execution  innovation  structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation to fuel its growth engine  However  macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s bottom line growth  A disruption in deliveries from suppliers  capacity constraints  production disruptions  price changes  or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules  thereby increasing its operating costs 
 You can   
Shares of Medtronic have underperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry in the last three months  losing  4 4  vs  a  0 4  decline  However  Medtronic exited the fiscal third quarter on a solid note  All the major business groups contributed to solid top line growth at CER  highlighting sustainability across groups and regions  in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets  
Also  gradually stabilizing CRHF market buoys optimism  The Zacks analyst is encouraged by the company s healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies  The receipt of FDA approval for the Riptide Aspiration System under the Neurovascular unit within the RTG business buoys optimism  
The company is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses  However  escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on the bottom line  The company s reiteration of 2018 guidance despite the projection of favorable foreign currency translation dampens investors  confidence 
 You can   
Gilead s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biotech industry in the last twelve months  increasing  12 3  vs  a decline of  5 1   Gilead s HIV franchise continues to gain traction  courtesy of the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens in the United States and EU  The TAF based regimens now represent 62  of total HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy in 2016  
The Zacks analyst thinks the approval of Gilead s latest triple HIV therapy  Biktarvy  will likely provide an impetus to the stock as Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR T therapy  However  the HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition  Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid 2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further  The company s guidance for 2018 also lacks luster

110890,332405,EFX,Are Cryptocurrency Woes Dragging AMD And Nvidia Shares Lower ,opinion,"Amid another brutal morning of trading for the newly volatile tech sector  investors are focusing on the latest slump in shares of AMD   NASDAQ AMD   and Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   after reports suggested that a decline in cryptocurrency mining demand could be negatively impacting the GPU market 
According to Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst Joseph Moore  falling Ethereum prices are starting to suck the life out of GPU demand  The popular digital coin dipped to nearly  370 last week after peaking at about  1 300 earlier this year 
The entire cryptocurrency market has suffered from profit taking and increased regulatory pressure over the past few months  but volatility in Ethereum could be having a unique effect on GPU makers like AMD and Nvidia  The mining community for this coin  which remains the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of total market capitalization  continues to rely on these high powered processors while miners of other digital assets and tokens have moved to more expensive  purpose built machines 
And with prices at their current levels  the economics of mining Ethereum are starting to make less sense given the overhead costs associated with running these rigs including device maintenance and electricity 
Moore and Morgan Stanley see the lack of incentive to mine having an effect on the prices of GPUs  The top crypto mining cards from AMD and Nvidia were once difficult to get one s hands on  but now prices are starting to slump  According to Morgan Stanley  the cost of AMD s Radeon 580 is down from  530 to  399 on Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   and the price of Nvidia s GeForce 1060 6GB is down from  500 to  399 
Moore did mention that the impact of sluggish cryptocurrency demand is likely to have a bigger impact on AMD s business  The company recently said its revenue exposure to the crypto market was in the mid single digits last year  and Morgan Stanley s latest note estimates that this exposure climbed to about 10  in the fourth quarter 
Meanwhile  Moore said that Nvidia s products witness lower hash rates and should therefore cause the company to have significantly lower exposure to the mining industry  Nvidia s management has also been hesitant to consider cryptocurrencies a driving force behind its growth 
 While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify  we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter  That said  our main focus remains on our core gaming market  as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile   said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress in the company s latest earnings conference call 
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang doubled down on this sentiment  adding that his management team s outlook models crypto  approximately flat  
Nevertheless  shares of Nvidia were down as much as 4  in morning trading Monday following Morgan Stanley s note  AMD shares were down just over 3  in early hours

110922,332437,EFX,Can Walmart Fortify Position Against Amazon With Humana Deal ,opinion,Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT   has clearly emerged as the biggest contender  when it comes to taking new initiatives to strengthen its foothold against Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    From speedy deliveries to payment systems  from selling grocery to offering meal kits online  both players have been in a raging competition for quite some time Taking it further  Walmart s plans to extend ties with Humana   NYSE HUM   to enhance healthcare offerings  seems another bullet shot by the former in its war against the e commerce king  Sources recently revealed that Walmart is in talks to enhance relation with Humana  which offers health insurance plans and other benefits for Medicare  individual or group insurance   While both Walmart and Humana have remained silent over the issue  reports suggest that the deal between two giants could also be a merger or acquisition   where Walmart would scoop up the healthcare biggie  If the buyout of Humana  which currently has a market cap of about  37 1 billion  materializes  it will serve as Walmart s biggest acquisition till date Amazon Threat Responsible for This Move Well  a move like this had to surface  given Amazon having its eyes on the healthcare space  Incidentally  there has been too much buzz about this e commerce giant planning to foray the healthcare industry  especially since it announced plans to curtail health expenses and enhance care to U S  workers  by teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  and J P  Morgan  In another move  Amazon was also looking for ways to enter the pharmacy space  evident from its plans to hire workers to figure out a strategy for the same   Apart from the supposed Walmart Humana deal  there have been many other transactions in the healthcare space  largely stemming from fears instilled by Amazon that shook the grocery industry with its major buyout of Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM  last year  CVS Health s potential buyout of Aetna   NYSE AET    Cigna Corp  NYSE CI  s plans to buy Express Scripts and Rite Aid s   NYSE RAD   merger with Albertson s are some examples in this regard    What the Walmart Humana Deal Could Lead toComing back to Walmart  the supermarket giant has been expanding in healthcare for a while now  The company operates pharmacies in most of its stores and Sam Club locations  while it also has in store clinics in Georgia  South Carolina and Texas   per media sources  Humana  on the other hand also has its own pharmacy benefits division  apart from about 200 standalone clinics for its Medicare members While both the companies already share a Medicare drug plan aimed at lowering consumers  drug costs  an extended alliance or buyout of Humana is likely to help Walmart emerge stronger in the field of providing primary care  Enhanced connections with Humana is likely to help Walmart leverage Humana s patients and steer them to its stores  Further  combining retail and healthcare arms would help the companies undertake greater wellness endeavors and health plans for customers  like offering incentives for healthy food options To this end  Walmart has already been working with Humana s wellness rewards plan for more than four years now  which offers discounts on healthy food choices to customers who take an online health valuation  Such efforts not only help Walmart increase sale of its products like  Great For You  and  Go360   but it also helps the retailer promote healthier lifestyle and reduce health care expenses That said  we believe that the aforementioned Walmart Humana merger or buyout  if materialized  is likely to be a win win for both entities  especially for Walmart by strengthening its customer base and augmenting top line  This  in turn will solidify the big box retailer s position in the Amazonian retail world  Notably  Walmart s continued efforts to battle Amazon s growing dominance has helped its shares rally 26 8  in a year  surpassing the  s rise of 21 2   We believe that with strength across both stores and e commerce  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is likely to witness further growth  You can see  Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this year  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away ,2018-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-walmart-fortify-position-against-amazon-with-humana-deal-200302430,200302430
110923,332438,EFX,Should Value Investors Standard Motor  SMP  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Standard Motor Products  Inc    NYSE SMP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Standard Motor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Standard Motor s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Standard Motor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Standard Motor has a P S ratio of about 1  This is considerably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Standard Motor currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes SMP a good choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P B ratio for the company is 2 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 3 5  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 1  which is better than the industry average of 14 4  Clearly  SMP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Standard Motor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives SMP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The next quarter has seen two upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to no downward  while the full year estimate has also seen one upward and none downward revisions in the same time frame As a result  the next quarter consensus estimate increased 6 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 2 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Standard Motor Products  Inc  Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineStandard Motor s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  with a decent industry rank  top 39  out of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  2 the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Standard Motor Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX

110926,332441,EFX,RBS  Stake Sale To Result In Loss Of Billions For Taxpayer,opinion,"In a report published recently by Office of Budget Responsibility  plans to sell British government s stake in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC  LON RBS    NYSE RBS   worth  3 billion in each of the five financial years beginning 2018 19  were disclosed 
During the financial crisis  RBS had received about  45 5 billion from the government based on its share price that was nearly 500 pence at the time  However  the shares have now declined to about 250 pence 
The government is likely to incur a loss from this sale  as shares of RBS are currently trading at half the price that was paid for its bailout 
Also  the forecast comes amid speculations of an ideal time to return about 70  of the state owned bank to private hands 
In an investor conference held in March 2018  investors at RBS had put forth wishes to put behind the impending settlement with the U S  Department of Justice over deceptive mortgage marketing strategies  before beginning with plans to re privatize the bank  RBS expects the settlement to make a significant dent in its financials 
Further  Oliver Holbourn  the chief executive officer at UK Financial Investments   UKFI   has resigned from his post  UKFI is responsible for handling sale of the government s stake in RBS  Though there is not much clarity whether the CEO s exit would delay the process  Chairman of UKFI  James Leigh Pemberton  stated that the selling might happen after the mortgage mis selling probe has been resolved   
Pemberton also reflected that unfavorable market conditions might affect the timetable  He said   A long period of muted risk sentiment and a lack of demand on the part of investors to increase their exposure to equity markets could have an impact on the deliverability of this sale  
Though the bank reported annual profit for the first time in a decade  Royal Bank of Scotland might incur loss in 2018 due to the pending legal settlement  Nevertheless  it remains committed to improve its performance  Also  the bank continues to make investments in technology in order to cope with changing customer preference 
Shares of Royal Bank of Scotland have gained 22 9  over the past year  outperforming 11 5  growth recorded by the

110931,332446,EFX,HSBC To Settle LIBOR Manipulation Lawsuit For  100 Million,opinion,"HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA  plc   NYSE C   has agreed to settle an antitrust case that accuses it of plotting with some other banks and manipulating the LIBOR benchmark interest rate 
The bank is required to pay about  100 million despite denying any wrongdoings  While the preliminary settlement documents were filed in the U S  District Court in Manhattan  court approval for the same is still awaited 
The lawsuit was filed in 2011 by investors including the city of Baltimore and Yale University in New Haven  CT  accusing 16 banks of conspiring to manipulate LIBOR 
LIBOR or the London Interbank Offered Rate  an important benchmark set by the British Bankers  Association  is used by the financial institutions across the globe to set the interest rates for lending purposes on several transactions 
HSBC has been alleged of conspiring with other banks in 2007 and reporting artificially low borrowing costs to ramp up earnings and appear financially healthy 
Lower borrowing costs resulted in lower LIBOR  This adversely impacted individuals and institutions that invested in the bond market  pension funds  mutual funds  money market funds  bank loan funds and several derivative products whose rates are tied to LIBOR 
Rigging of the benchmark interest rates has resulted in billions of dollars of regulatory fines against the banks worldwide  Over the years  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  and other banks such as Citigroup   NYSE C    Barclays   NYSE C   and Deutsche Bank   NYSE DB   have made settlements with the U S  financial regulators over such manipulations 
HSBC took the step toward settlement in order to steer clear of extra costs of litigation  Also  it continues to benefit from extensive global network and solid asset growth  Further  cost saving initiatives remain impressive  However  dismal European economic growth and weak loan demand are expected to lead to muted revenue growth in the near term

110950,332465,EFX,How Lennar s  LEN  Margins Are Shaping Up For Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 4  before market open  Lennar has been exhibiting solid top line performances and the trend is expected to continue in the soon to be reported quarter as well  thanks to the strong demand for homes  favorable job market and impressive economic conditions Let s take a look at how the company s margin is shaping up for this earnings season Gross Margin  Unlike an impressive revenue performance  Lennar and a number of renowned homebuilders have been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins  On the one hand  labor shortages are leading to higher wages and on the other  land prices are inflating due to limited availability Lennar s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points or bps year over year in the fourth quarter as well as fiscal 2017  primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home  This trend is unlikely to change in the to be reported quarter Meanwhile  in February 2018  Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc  in a  9 3 billion deal  including debt   which is expected to put Lennar among one of the country s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U S  markets Now  as part of the CalAtlantic acquisition  the company needs to evaluate the assets and liabilities acquired and record them at fair value on the acquisition date  These adjustments will include  but not be limited to  adjustments to inventory  investments in unconsolidated entities  other assets  goodwill and debt  The company had earlier warned that some of these adjustments will impact its gross margins going forward  There will be a more significant impact to gross margins from the acquisition date through the early part of fiscal third quarter  as a result of the backlog writeup that is required for homes that have already been sold Lennar Corporation Gross Margin  TTM     SG A Expenses  Meanwhile  Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG A line from operating leverage and investments in technology  As a percentage of revenues from home sales  SG A expenses contracted to 9 2  in the fiscal 2017 from 9 4  in the year ago period  due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries  Notably  in the last reported quarter  SG A expenses came in at 8 4   marking the lowest fourth quarter in the company s history  The trend is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter as well Operating Margin  Lennar anticipates full year operating margins to match the fiscal 2017 level of 12 9   Seasonality will impact operating margin in the upcoming quarters  with the first quarter being the lowest  However  with the increase in volumes throughout the year  operating margin is expected to show improvement  Overall  Lennar expects operating margin to be fairly consistent with the prior year in each quarter of fiscal 2018 Meanwhile  the synergies of CalAtlantic combination will lower direct construction costs  reduce cycle times  leverage SG A and increase sales base  all of which are expected to boost profitability and internal rate of return on invested capital Overall  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is expected to witness lower gross margin in the fiscal first quarter  owing to higher construction costs  Nonetheless  Lennar s diligent efforts to improve its operating efficiency via digital marketing strategies  dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds  thereby driving growth for this homebuilder Overall Earnings   Revenue ExpectationsOverall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents for first quarter earnings reflects 39  growth from the prior year period s profit of 59 cents per share  Also  the consensus mark for revenues of  2 65 billion represents a 13 5  increase on a year over year basis  Read More    Lennar s shares have gained 6 5  in the last six months  outperforming 1 8  growth of its   That said  earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter and fiscal 2018 have been trending upward  increasing 2 5  each for both the periods in the last 60 days  This reflects analysts  confidence in the company s future earnings  Key PicksA few better ranked stocks in the

110959,332474,EFX,Is Oshkosh  OSK  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Oshkosh Corporation   NYSE OSK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Oshkosh has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Oshkosh s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Oshkosh has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Oshkosh stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Oshkosh has a P S ratio of about 0 8  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Oshkosh currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Oshkosh a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Oshkosh is just 0 8  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  OSK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Oshkosh might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives OSK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the next year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as both the current year and next year consensus estimates have risen by 0 2  in the past two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Oshkosh Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite this bullish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineOshkosh is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 22  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks rank  3  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this

110988,332503,EFX,Should Value Investors Pick Meritor  MTOR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Meritor  Inc    NYSE MTOR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Meritor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Meritor s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Meritor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 6  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Meritor stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Meritor has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Meritor currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Meritor a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 4  which is better than the industry average of 8 2  Clearly  MTOR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Meritor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A This gives MTOR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 4 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone up by 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Meritor  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMeritor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 22  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of

111017,332532,EFX,Should Value Investors Pick Lear Corporation  LEA  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lear Corporation   NYSE LEA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lear Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Lear Corporation s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 11 1  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lear Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lear Corporation s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lear Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  Lear Corporation is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lear Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LEA a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 8  which is slightly better than the industry average of 8 2  Clearly  LEA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Lear Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives LEA a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has nudged up 1 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen about 3 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lear Corporation Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term   Bottom LineLear Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  top 22  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers

111037,332552,EFX,Deutsche Bank Shares Slip As CFO Projects Lower Revenues,opinion,"At an investors  conference in London  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  s   NYSE DB   chief financial officer  James von Moltke  left impressions that the corporate and investment bank s first quarter 2018 segmental revenues might decline about  450 million from the year ago quarter  thanks to foreign exchange headwinds and higher funding costs 
Shares of Deutsche Bank dropped to the lowest since November 2016 on Mar 21  as Moltke s comment came less than a week after the bank published its annual report  which included optimistic outlook for full year trading revenues 
Moltke reflected that euro s gain against the dollar is expected to reduce Deutsche Bank s securities unit revenues by nearly  300 million as about 40  of the unit s revenue base is either dollar denominated or linked to it 
Further   150 million impact is expected on account of higher internal funding costs  Allocation of refinancing costs is at the discretion of Deutsche Bank  which chooses to distribute the group s funding costs to the investment banking unit 
On the same day  Deutsche Bank trimmed the price target range for its planned IPO of its asset management segment   DWS Group   to  32  33 per share  down from the previous band of  30  36  The bank will be able to raise about  1 6 billion in place of its original target of  2 billion  by floating shares at this valuation range 
The bank  disclosed earlier that it will not achieve its target of reducing total adjusted costs to  22 billion in 2018  due to delay in sale of some business units 
Though Deutsche Bank is adhering to measures to revive the business  it continues to witness several headwinds and continues to be under close scrutiny of investors  Also  litigation issues related to past misconducts and legal costs might deter the bottom line growth  Further  the bank s margins continue to remain under pressure owing to low interest rates in the domestic economy 
Shares of Deutsche Bank have lost 12 5  over the past year  compared with the  s rally of 13 4  

The stock carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

Further  Rite Aid s shares have declined by a significant 26 3  in the past month  wider than the  s decline of 6 2   This suggests a negative sentiment for the stock  ahead of fourth quarter earnings release

That said  let s find out more about the growth drivers for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Strategic Initiatives    A Key Growth DriverBoston Beer looks well poised to drive long term growth through the execution of the aforementioned three point growth plan  Firstly  this plan prioritizes the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands via packaging  innovation  promotion and brand communication initiatives  The company is encouraged by the recently launched new media campaigns for the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  It remains optimistic about other innovative product launches like Sam  76  Samuel Adams New England IPA and Angry Orchard Rose  It also targets to retain momentum for the Twisted Tea brand and to gain leadership for Truly Spiked   Sparkling brand in the hard sparkling water category Secondly  the company has accelerated its focus on cost savings and efficiency projects with these savings directed for further brand development  This aided gross margin improvement in fourth quarter 2017  Based on current opportunities  it continues to anticipate improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019 Finally  the plan emphasizes long term innovation and maximizing the shareholder value  Boston Beer remains optimistic about the craft beer and cider categories in the future Gross Margin Growth to Boost Bottom LineBoston Beer is making strides to address industry challenges through improved cost structure and re investing these savings for brand development  This has been significantly contributing toward an improving gross margin  In 2017  its cost savings and efficiency projects delivered above the targeted ranges  providing increased flexibility to invest in brands and positioning it well for 2018 Gross margin improved 330 basis points  bps  in the fourth quarter driven by better pricing  product and package mix as well as cost savings gains from the company owned breweries  For 2018  it expects gross margins between 52  and 54   which are likely to increase over the course of the year  driven by continued progress on cost saving initiatives  This  along with lower operating expenses  should aid the bottom line Depletion Trends Show ImprovementDepletions continued to be soft in both the fourth quarter and full year 2017  reflecting a decline of 10  and 7   respectively  Depletion volumes were impacted by the loss of a week s depletions and persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  partly mitigated by growth in Twisted Tea and Truly Spiked   Sparkling brands  Though still negative  the company s quarterly depletion trends have been improving since the first quarter of 2017 Additionally  we are encouraged by a strong start in 2018  Notably  depletions for the year to date period through the six week period ended Feb 10  2018  are estimated to have grown nearly 6  from the comparable year ago period  For 2018  depletions and shipments are likely to range from flat to up 6  Lower Earnings   Sales Remain a DeterrentThough the company s long term prospects look good  it reported lower than expected results in fourth quarter 2017 with the top and bottom lines missing estimates  This marked a sales lag after two consecutive beats  Further  sales declined year over year  owing to a fall in shipment volumes and lower depletions  Volume declines in the quarter resulted from continued challenges at the Samuel Adams brand as well as the fall in the cider category and the Angry Orchard brand The Boston Beer Company  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    
While the company anticipates depletions and shipments in the range of flat to up 6   there remains some uncertainty in the volume outlook for 2018  which is expected to be more sensitive to innovations than previous years  Moreover  industry wide challenges related to general softening of the craft beer and hard cider categories  increased entry of start up brewers  and the rising number of options to drinkers is likely to hurt the top  and bottom line results Do Beverages Alcohol Stocks Grab Your Attention  Check TheseSome better ranked stocks in the same industry are Diageo  LON DGE  plc   NYSE DEO    Campri Group   OTC DVDCY   and Heineken NV   OTC HEINY   Diageo has a long term earnings growth rate of 7 4  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Campri Group carries a Zacks Rank  2  The stock has a long term EPS growth rate of 7 5  Heineken  also a Zacks Rank  2 stock  has a long term earnings growth rate of 8 4  Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away ",2018-03-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-boston-beer-sam-rallies-despite-a-dismal-q4-200299969,200299969

111164,332679,EFX,Downside Risks In Banks Could Shift Investors  Focus,opinion,"The benefits of a rising rate environment  tax overhaul and an expected ease in regulation have helped U S  banks gain significantly over the past six months  but there are some downside risks that could shift investors  focus from the industry 
Primarily  the muted earnings growth that the industry has been witnessing for the last few quarters could raise investors  concerns and tarnish the optimism over the benefits from policy changes and reforms 
Also  investors  enthusiasm may wane if the actual benefits don t meet investors  expectations or take too long to come 
While there is no indication of disruption in the interest rates moving higher  the yield curve is yet to reach a state where a continued steepening can be predicted  In fact  many forecasters expect the term spread   the difference between long term and short term interest rates  to shrink  This could spell trouble for banks 
While rolling back tough post financial crisis banking regulations is expected to benefit small and mid size lenders  the benefits may fail to meet investors  expectations 
Moreover  softer regulations might benefit banks  earning mostly from domestic operations  However  larger banks with significant international exposure might lose out on competitiveness due to ever increasing international regulatory standards  Further  meeting international standards will restrict them from generating domestic revenues 
Though it is too early to make any negative assessment of the likely regulatory overhaul  easier lending standards and lesser regulatory restrictions could increase credit costs for banks  similar to what the industry witnessed just before the recession 
Moreover  there are a number of fundamental challenges that might hold banks back from growing steadily 
Expense reduction was the key measure that helped banks stay afloat for long  But it may not be a major support going forward  as banks have already cut the majority of unnecessary expenses 
Banks  proactive actions to move beyond defensive steps like cost containment were also effective in supporting their bottom line over the last few quarters  However  these are not enough to make the growth path steady  as emerging issues like cybercrime and unconventional competition  from fintech and other technology firms  are piling up  For example  if big companies like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   AMZN  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   GOOGL  enter the banking space  existing banks could lose significant market share 
While results for the last few quarters show respite from high legal costs  higher spending on cyber security  technology  analytics and alternative business opportunities will keep costing a pretty penny 
In an earlier piece     we provided arguments in favor of investing in the U S  banking space  But here we would like to discuss some points that substantiate the opposite case 
Quality of Earnings Has Weakened
Banks have been delivering better than expected earnings for quite some time now  but the positive surprises have mostly been backed by conservative estimates  Promising low and then impressing the market with an earnings beat has been the tactic 
While year over year comparisons remained positive over the last several quarters  the industry witnessed decelerating earnings growth rates 
Strengthening Non Interest Revenues Requires Higher Overhead 
Banks  strategies to generate more revenues from non interest sources are working well  but the sources are not yet dependable 
On the other hand  grabbing any opportunity to generate higher non interest revenues amid improving employment and wage scenario requires higher overhead 
Banks Will Be Better Off With Higher Rates  But It s Not All Good
In order to survive in the prolonged low interest rate environment  banks reduced their dependence on rate sensitive revenues and focused more on alternative revenue sources  So  rising rates may not immediately benefit banks as much as they did in the pre crisis period 
Banks will not have to compete for deposits and pay higher rates for some time  as the lack of low risk investment opportunities in a low rate environment helped them attract huge deposits  However  the excess deposits will dry up after some time and competition for deposits will intensify as a consequence of the Fed s balance sheet unwinding  If this happens  the current practice of capping the cost of funding by keeping the rates on deposits almost unchanged won t help margin expansion 
Further  credit quality  an important performance indicator for banks  may not improve with rising interest rates if there is lesser regulatory supervision  The prolonged low interest rate environment has already forced banks to ease underwriting standards  which  in turn  has increased the odds of higher credit costs 
Absorbing Future Losses Could Be Difficult
In the United States  accounting rules allow banks to record a small part of their derivatives and not show most mortgage linked bonds  So there might be risky assets off their books  As a result  capital buffers that U S  banks have been forced to maintain so far might not be enough to fight risks of a default  Likely lesser restriction on capital in the future would make dealing with a default even more difficult 
Stocks to Stay Away from
Despite the expected benefits from the reforms and rising interest rates  there are a number of reasons to worry about the industry s performance in the near to medium term  So it would be prudent to get rid of or stay away from some weak bank stocks for now  Stocks carrying a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  or  4  Sell  are particularly expected to underperform 
Here are a few stocks that you should stay away from 
County Bancorp  Inc   ICBK   This Zacks Rank  5 stock has gained just 1 5  over the past six months versus the S P 500 s gain of 10 8   The stock s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 4 9  downward over the last 60 days 
Howard Bancorp  Inc   HBMD   A 6 7  downward revision in earnings estimates for the current year over the last 60 days precipitated a Zacks Rank  5 for this stock  The stock has lost nearly 5  in the past six months 
Franklin Financial Network  Inc   FSB   This Zacks Rank  5 stock has lost 0 4  over the past six months  The stock s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised nearly 3  downward over the last 60 days 
Fidelity Southern Corporation  LION   More than 12  downward revision in earnings estimates for the current year over the last 60 days precipitated a Zacks Rank  5 for this stock  The stock has gained 8 3  in the past six months

111165,332680,EFX,Why Adobe  ADBE  Stock Keeps Climbing ,opinion,"Shares of Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE   jumped nearly 4  through early afternoon trading Tuesday to hit yet another new all time high as investors continue to ride the software firm s post Q1 earnings wave 
Latest Results
Adobe  which makes editing programs such as Photoshop and Premiere  posted record first quarter revenues of  2 08 billion last week  This figure also marked 24  growth from the year ago period  Furthermore  Adobe s adjusted earnings of  1 55 per share topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The company did not provide updated guidance for the rest of the year  but it previously announced that it expects to post full year revenues of  8 73 billion  Adobe also noted that it expects the new Republican tax law will have a positive impact on its business 
 The new Tax Act is lowering Adobe s effective tax rates  driving a significant increase in our earnings per share targets   CFO Mark Garrett said in a statement   With ready access to our offshore cash  we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities to grow our business and we are actively expanding our campuses in the Bay Area and Utah to accommodate the growth of our employee base  
Looking Ahead 
It seems clear that Adobe s most recent quarter pleased investors  but this positivity won t last forever unless there are growth metrics that support the company s new price tag  Based on a quick look at the latest top and bottom line projections  Adobe does indeed look ready to continue its expansion 
Adobe s Q2 revenues are projected to surge 21 3  to reach  2 15 billion  while the firm s full year sales are expected to climb at a similar rate to hit  8 78 billion  It also looks like Adobe s new lower effective tax rate is in fact set to boost earnings right away 
The company is projected to see its quarterly earnings skyrocket 50   while its fiscal 2018 EPS figure is expected soar by 45 9  to reach 6 29 per share 
Adobe has also recently earned a large number of estimate revisions for its current quarter  next quarter  and the current year  with 100  agreement to the upside  Investors should note that Adobe has matched or topped earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters  including a 9  average surprise in the trailing four periods 
This stretch of beats mostly likely means that Adobe does everything in its power to post the best earnings to please its shareholders  Looking ahead  the company might have an even easier time doing so if its effective tax rate stays down 
Bottom Line 
Adobe made it clear that it plans to spend money to expand  and the firm recently highlighted the growth of one of its newer segments  Document Cloud  But Adobe s bread and butter creative suite is a high margin business that allows it to return money to investors  Adobe is also currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports a  B  grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system

stretch of relative health and recovery  In the U S   that recovery is best exemplified by the strength of the jobs market  and investors can benefit from this strength by targeting companies like Manpower Group  a global staffing powerhouse Manpower is a world leader in innovative workforce solutions  serving both large and small organizations across all industries and sectors  The company is the third largest staffing firm in the world  Manpower employs millions of people every year  throughout dozens of countries The company s latest earnings report was strong  but its stock failed to generate momentum thanks to a market wide selloff  Now MAN sits at an attractive level for value investors  and an even better earnings outlook lifted by improved analyst sentiment makes this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  a great option right now Latest Earnings ReportManpower most recently reported earnings on Feb  2  Adjusted profits for the quarter were  2 12 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 05  Quarterly revenues came in at  5 64 billion  up from  4 96 billion in the prior year period and ahead of our  5 55 billion consensus estimate Meanwhile  operating profit for the reported quarter was  238 7 million compared with  212 million in the year ago quarter  The increase in operating profit  despite rise in operating expenses  is due to significant top line growth Manpower exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of  689 million compared with  598 5 million in the previous year  Long term debt was  478 1 million compared with  785 6 million in 2016  The company also provided strong guidance in its latest report  Shifting consumer habits and a plethora of new delivery options have left the restaurant industry in flux  with traditional delivery powerhouses like some fast food pizza chains struggling to compete  One such company is Papa John s Papa John s operates   franchises pizza delivery and carry out restaurants  The company is the world s third largest pizza delivery brand  Papa John s has about 5 199 restaurants  including 743 company owned and 4 456 franchised restaurants in 50 states  and 44 countries and territories After another lackluster earnings report  analysts have soured on PZZA  The company has witnessed a number of negative earnings estimate revisions  earning the stock a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Additional headwinds should continue to cause volatility  making this restaurant pick one to stay away from for now Latest Earnings ReportIn the most recent quarter  Papa John s reported adjusted earnings of  0 65 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 68 and declining about 6  from the year ago period  Domestic company owned comps fell 4 7  during the quarter  while comps at North American

the fourth quarter  total costs and expenses amounted to  429 3 million  up 7 8  from the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  operating margin decreased 390 basis points to reach 7 8  Additional content Why Adobe  ADBE  Stock Keeps ClimbingShares of Adobe Systems jumped nearly 4  through early afternoon trading Tuesday to hit yet another new all time high as investors continue to ride the software firm s post Q1 earnings wave Latest ResultsAdobe  which makes editing programs such as Photoshop and Premiere  posted record first quarter revenues of  2 08 billion last week  This figure also marked 24  growth from the year ago period  Furthermore  Adobe s adjusted earnings of  1 55 per share topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate The company did not provide updated guidance for the rest of the year  but it previously announced that it expects to post full year revenues of  8 73 billion  Adobe also noted that it expects the new Republican tax law will have a positive impact on its business  The new Tax Act is lowering Adobe s effective tax rates  driving a significant increase in our earnings per share targets   CFO Mark Garrett said in a statement   With ready access to our offshore cash  we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities to grow our business and we are actively expanding our campuses in the Bay Area and Utah to accommodate the growth of our employee base  Looking AheadIt seems clear that Adobe s most recent quarter pleased investors  but this positivity won t last forever unless there are growth metrics that support the company s new price tag  Based on a quick look at the latest top and bottom line projections  Adobe does indeed look ready to continue its expansion Adobe s Q2 revenues are projected to surge 21 3  to reach  2 15 billion  while the firm s full year sales are expected to climb at a similar rate to hit  8 78 billion  It also looks like Adobe s new lower effective tax rate is in fact set to boost earnings right away The company is projected to see its quarterly earnings skyrocket 50   while its fiscal 2018 EPS figure is expected soar by 45 9  to reach 6 29 per share Adobe has also recently earned a large number of estimate revisions for its current quarter  next quarter  and the current year  with 100  agreement to the upside  Investors should note that Adobe has matched or topped earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters  including a 9  average surprise in the trailing four periods This stretch of beats mostly likely means that Adobe does everything in its power to post the best earnings to please its shareholders  Looking ahead  the company might have an even easier time doing so if its effective tax rate stays down Bottom LineAdobe made it clear that it plans to spend money to expand  and the firm recently highlighted the growth of one of its newer segments  Document Cloud  But Adobe s bread and butter creative suite is a high margin business that allows it to return money to investors

111194,332709,EFX,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Twitter  Facebook  Snap And Paycom Software,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 16  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Twitter   NYSE TWTR    Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Snap   NYSE SNAP   and Paycom Software Inc    NYSE PAYC   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Twitter Enhances Features  Facebook   Snap Should Take NoteTwitterhas been the best performing social media stock in the past year  returning an astounding 143 5   In comparison  Facebook shares have returned 31 8   while Snapchat parent Snap has lost 14 1  Twitter s scintillating performance can be attributed to its initiatives that diversify it from being a mere micro blogging site to a social media provider  The recently announced  camera first feature   as reported by CNBC  is a well timed step in that direction Twitter is also working on algorithmically curated timelines on big news events and placing them on top of users  timelines We believe that both Snap and Facebook should take note of these initiatives as the struggle for supremacy in the social media market heats up Addition of Engaging FeaturesTwitter has been experimenting a lot in the last few months by bringing attractive features in its attempt to make the platform more engaging We note that the rollout of the 280 character limit for tweets  double from the legacy 140 limit  and introduction of Threads have made tweeting easier and more expressive  These have also resulted in an uptick in tweet impressions  Twitter introduced Bookmarks last month to enable users to save tweets in one place for future reference Twitter has also been focusing on  live  to turn around its fortunes  Live streaming has resulted in an increase in user engagement  Notably  ad engagements increased 75  year over year in the last reported quarter As video ads generate more revenues than text based substitutes  Twitter is trying to incorporate more video oriented content to attract more advertising revenues Notably  in the last quarter  Twitter delivered GAAP profit for the first time in its 10 year history  Management remains focused on improving the core platform  which is likely to sustain its profitability Steps to Grab More Ad Revenues Twitter s ability to attract advertising revenues amid significant competition from the likes of Facebook  Snapchat and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  will be a key factor determining its growth Talking about Twitter s possible shift toward images and videos with the camera feature  CNBC was quoted saying   The new function would combine location based photos and videos with Twitter Moments around notable events  Companies could sponsor events or place ads in between tweeted real time photos and videos  The feature directly competes with Snapchat s location based Story posted in the Discover tab of the application  While Twitter s diversified user base is a positive  Snapchat s predominantly young user base has been a major concern for investors Although Snapchat has been trying to combat all odds by bringing new features  the recent redesign of the application has disappointed users  We believe user dissatisfaction with the new design can dent its advertising revenues  at least in the near term Moreover  Twitter s tweak in timeline to highlight major news events other than the current focus on sports based news is expected to increase user engagement on the platform and be accretive to growth It is also opening avenues for the company to compete with Facebook  This is because the social media giant has resorted to News Feed changes in order to limit public content  news and video  The change affected Daily Active Users  DAUs  in its most penetrated market   the United States and Canada   in the last reported quarter  Per Facebook  these updates brought down time spent on the platform by 5  or an estimated 50 million hours per day Although Twitter s Monthly Active User of 330 million falls way behind Facebook s whopping 2 3 billion  such diversification measures are expected to boost its presence in the social media market and drive more advertisers to the platform Zacks Rank   Stock to ConsiderTwitter carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A top ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Paycom

today You can see AT T s shares have decreased  12 8  in the last one year  underperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s fall of  11 5   Despite the disappointing price performance  the Zacks analyst is optimistic about AT T s wireless growth prospects ahead of the launch of standards based mobile 5G services and the FirstNet project Further  another major positive is AT T s net gain of 4 1 million total wireless subscribers  with 2 7 million in the United States  driven by connected devices  postpaid phones and prepaid  and 1 3 million in Mexico  in fourth quarter 2017  Despite cord cutting  AT T gained 368 000 DIRECTV NOW connections in the final quarter of 2017 However  AT T continues to struggle in the competitive U S  wireless market  Other challenges like loss in access

six months  underperforming the  25 5  gain of the Zacks Investment Banking industry  However  the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three out of the trailing four quarters Though several issues  including sluggish global economic growth and lower client activity levels with weak fixed income trading revenues  remain near to medium term headwinds  the Zacks analyst thinks the company s well diversified business and focus to capitalize on growth opportunities through strategic moves will continue to strengthen the overall business Cost control measures are commendable  Additionally  steady capital deployment activities have boosted investors  confidence  You can   Sanofi s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date  declining  5 9  vs   0 1   However  Sanofi has several new products in its portfolio and candidates in its pipeline that can contribute to long term growth  Particularly  the Zacks analyst is optimistic about sales prospects of Dupixent  which could prove to be an important growth driver Meanwhile  the recently announced acquisitions of Ablynx and Bioverativ are expected to strengthen Sanofi s position in the rare blood disorders market  However  Sanofi s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product  Lantus facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and the presence of biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan  Other headwinds include generic competition for many drugs and slower than expected uptake of new products like Praluent  Meanwhile  the performance of the Consumer Healthcare franchise was soft n 2017  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are

111197,332712,EFX,Are U S  Banks On The Verge Of A New Golden Era ,opinion,"The massive changes that took place in the past year and those that are well underway could actually help the banking industry enter a new golden age  Thus  the prospects for bank stocks look bright 
The key factors that could drive the industry s growth are a new tax regime  a rising interest rate environment and rolling back of tough post financial crisis banking regulations 
Primarily  a continuation of interest rate hikes  reinforced by rising inflation expectations  and the Fed s unwinding of its giant balance sheet  have the potential to lift banks  profitability to levels not achieved since the last recession  And  if history is any guide  the high rate environment that the economy is reaching will last long and continue to help the industry thrive 
Secondly  the new tax legislation will significantly reduce the effective tax rates for some of the nation s biggest banks  helping them pocket more profit  Moreover  the tax cuts are expected to provide a major impetus to the economy  which will indirectly increase business for banks 
Finally  the initiative to reduce the strictness of post crisis strict banking rules  aka Dodd Frank  will bring the much needed relief to small and mid size banks  primarily helping them reduce fixed costs 
Moreover  the industry has gained enough footing on its underlying structure to enhance business returns after dealing with challenges in the past several years  So chances of stagnation are dim 
Banks Capable of Standing on Their Own Feet
Business reorganization post financial crisis  effective expense management  enhanced focus on non interest revenue sources  technical affluence  ability to grab cross selling opportunities with economic improvement and many more positive factors could support banks in augmenting profits steadily 
With increasing capability of consumers and businesses to borrow money  prospects of loan growth are rising  So  in case the industry doesn t get significant support from the rate environment  high loan volume would back revenue growth 
Moreover  sound capital levels that banks generated by meeting strict regulatory requirements should help easily absorb likely credit costs related to their exposure to the troubled sectors  High credit risk in banks  loan portfolios led to high loan loss provisions in the past  but provisions are currently at very low levels  While the expected ease of capital restriction in the near term could weaken banks  credit profile  any possible disorder should be manageable for a decent period with the existing capital power 
Though the earnings performance over the last few years has failed to more than offset the negatives arising from a challenging backdrop  the results depict banks  efforts to pair aggressive actions  like creating new revenue sources  with defensive measures  like efficient expense management  to stay afloat 
Moreover  banks have learned how to adapt to a changing landscape and deal with crises  They are now capable of dodging pressure from the operating environment more easily 
Banks are trying to reorganize risk management practices to address potential solvency issues from rising interest rates 
 Check out our latest  for a more detailed discussion on the business trends  
Loans and Deposits Should Keep Growing
While loan growth remained muted in the last several quarters due to apprehensions related to the actions of the Trump administration and the Fed  lower unemployment  wage growth and higher disposable income as a result of an improving economy should eventually push up demand for consumer  real estate and small business loans 
Further  the expectation of continued rise in interest rates should increase demand for loans in the near term  as borrowers will tend to avoid a higher cost of borrowing later on 
On the deposit side  less levered consumers and businesses will continue to support strong deposit levels  Also  high levels of corporate cash holdings remain favorable for deposit growth  While the trend so far has been to cap the cost of funding by keeping the rates on deposits almost unchanged  higher rates will eventually increase the cost of maintaining deposits 
Moreover  the Fed s move to unwind its giant balance sheet will increase banks  competition for deposits 
Banks No Longer Lag In Terms of Technology
Beyond adopting technologies to enhance cyber security  banks have significantly reshaped products and distribution systems with the help of technology and artificial intelligence to drive efficiency  This has been helping them better formulate strategies and enhance performance of business segments 
While the ongoing adoption of technology  including efforts to create their own cryptocurrencies  will elevate their expenses in the quarters ahead  concerted efforts to cut expenses and better revenues through high tech products and services should be enough to strike a balance 
Stocks Worth Buying Right Now
The optimism over changes related to policy  regulation and technology should keep propelling bank stocks higher  But to ensure better bets  one may consider buying stocks that carry a favorable Zacks Rank 
Here are a few top ranked bank stocks you may want to consider 
Citigroup Inc  NYSE C    C   This Zacks Rank  2  Strong Buy  stock has rallied 6 3  over the past six months versus the S P 500 s gain of 10 8   The stock s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised roughly 4 7  upward over the last 60 days

 excluding refinery sales  to increase in the band of 4 5  compared with 2 5 4 5  projected earlier Hawaiian Airlines too raised its guidance for first quarter operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  owing to better than expected passenger revenue performance in each of its geographies and higher cargo demand across the network  The company now expects RASM to increase 3 5   up from

sector participants after continued struggles in this space  At most carriers  load factors improved as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion  thus leading to packed planes Notably  At Delta Air Lines  load factor was up 40 basis points year over year to 81 5  in February  with traffic increasing 3 8  and capacity expanding 3 4   Higher traffic growth in the same month led to 200

reduced corporate tax rate  courtesy of the new tax law  Thus  implying that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  among others  This

their respective dividend payouts for 2018  We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Bright PictureThe Zacks

In its most recent reported quarter  Q4 18  the company easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates   Pfizer posted year over year gains in revenues  1   adjusted income  30   and adjusted diluted EPS  32    The report also showed that the company s tax rate would fall from 23  to about 17   and that management approved a  5 billion share repurchase program   Further  during the conference call management alluded to future consolidation within the segment along with several partnerships  
The company s innovative business segment  branded drugs  vaccines  and consumer health  grew by  8  YoY with direct sales revenues improving by  47  YoY   The big drivers behind the success of the innovative segment was Eliquis  oral anticoagulant prescribed by cardiologists  Xeljanz  used for moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  and Prevnar  a pneumonia vaccine  
Looking ahead  besides its legacy branded drugs  the company has a strong pipeline of new products focused on oncology  and biosimilars  generic drugs    One of the most exciting new drugs is Ibrance  a new treatment for breast cancer that is expected to generate almost  6 billion in annual sales by 2020  
Towards the end of 2017  management approved a  6 3  increase to its quarterly dividend  making the new annual dividend  1 36  or a  3 7  annual yield   Pfizer has paid an annual dividend since 1901  and has increased it for the past nine consecutive years   Moreover  the company is expected to use its tax savings to further increase its share repurchase program  and boost its dividend payments for the next several years  
This strong earnings report  and positive future outlook has caused analysts to increase their earnings estimates for the next two quarters and next two fiscal years as you can see in the table below 

Delta Air Lines Inc    NYSE DAL    a Zacks Rank  2  Strong Buy  is a major American airline with its headquarters on the northern boundary of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport  within the city limits of Atlanta  Delta started operation by crop dusting and flying mail and then introduced passenger service  Delta s business is focused on making global connections  flying people and cargo throughout the United States and around the world  Delta Air Lines offers customers service to more destinations than any global airline with Delta and Delta Connection carrier service  Delta Air Lines and the Delta Connection carriers offer service to nearly 370 destinations on six continents  Delta has added more international capacity than all other U S  airlines combined and is the leader across the Atlantic

Another tailwind for the company is their co brand partnership with American Express  NYSE AXP  as Delta gets the interchange fee   In 2017  the Delta AmEx card portfolio realized  80 9 billion in charges where  1 975 billion in EBIT went to Delta   This is expected to increase to  2 7 billion by 2020 due to the contractual increase in the price per mile Delta gets from AmEx   Further  the whole partnership deal with AmEx generated  3 billion in revenues in 2017  and this is expected to increase to  4 billion by 2021  the contract goes through 2022   
Looking forward  management guided 2018 EPS in a range between  6 35 6 70  well above its previous guidance of  5 35 5 70   This boost is mostly due to the tax reform plan which by itself is expected to benefit EPS by  1 00 1 25   For Q1 18  management guided EPS at  0 65 0 75  and increased Revenue Per Available Seat  RASM  expectations from 2 5 4 5  YoY to 4 5    The rise in RASM is due to improvements in both leisure  and business travel  
The increase in 2018 EPS guidance and upgraded Q1 18 RASM expectations caused analysts to positively revise estimates for FY 18  and FY 19   Further  the stock price has continued to move upwards since the beginning of 2016   You can see both of these improvements in the Price and Earnings consensus graph below Price and Consensus   
During the December quarter the company repurchased  325 million worth of stock as part of its  5 billion share repurchase program announced in March of 2017   The company also pays a solid annual dividend yield of  2 16

111221,332736,EFX,Timing Economic Expansion  3 Stocks For Good Times   Bad,opinion,"The length of the current U S  economic expansion cycle is nearing a record  which makes it tricky for investors to choose stocks for their portfolio  Ideally  we need companies that will perform well even when the economic cycle takes a turn for the worse  For instance  companies that are less dependent on discretionary spending will fare better when the economy treads downward 
Also  companies with lower debt burdens will be more resistant to recessionary shocks  Recently  a fair bit of volatility has been witnessed in the market  This  coupled with hawkishness on the part of the Federal Reserve  indicate that the best course of action for investors right now is to play safe  For a portfolio  market anxiety can easily be balanced by investing in a less volatile industry 
So which industry can guarantee stability during a recession 
Screening Industries for Safety
Let s get the obvious out of the way  In a recession  retailers rarely have the benefit of a floor on sales  Industries that deal in consumer staples witness lower margins as customers cut corners and shift habits 
Focusing on infrastructure companies  their growth is likely to be hampered as new projects are delayed in a recessionary environment  However  infrastructure must be maintained  which grants such companies a steady  stable revenue base  Infrastructure companies have long term master agreements with utilities to maintain and service pipelines  electrical grids or telecom equipment 
The replacement of outdated and risky infrastructure is as essential  Doubtless these companies benefit from economic expansion  But this revenue base makes them a good choice in bad times too 
Likewise  renewable energy calls for the improvement of existing electrical grids and construction of new power sources  Transmission and distribution spending are reaching new highs and are set to sustain the trend in the upcoming days  Innovative technologies like fracking require new infrastructure in under developed regions  which gives another boost to infrastructure companies 
Stocks that Fit
There is one American company that stands out as a leading provider of infrastructure solutions   Quanta Services Inc    NYSE PWR    Other companies in the same space include Fluor Corp    NYSE FLR    Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC    KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR    and AECOM   NYSE ACM    While all these companies provide exposure to the industry we discussed  it will be prudent to assess these companies comparatively as well 
Assessing Stocks Under Different Metrics
In terms of earnings history  Quanta Services beat estimates just twice in the trailing four quarters  while Jacobs Engineering managed to generate four healthy beats with an average of 11 4   Fluor has generated three strong beats in the trailing four quarters with an average of 8 4  
Quanta Services  forward PE multiple stands at 13 4 right now  lower than the  s PE of 17 8  Jacobs Engineering is undervalued as well  with its PE of 15   Fluor is priced almost at par with the industry  as its PE multiple currently stands at 17 7 
In the past year  Quanta Services  shares have lost 6 4   which indicates that the company is trading at a discount right now relative to its growth prospects  In contrast  Jacobs Engineering s shares have returned 8 1   while Fluor s shares have rallied 8 3  

However  what we are concerned about safety in turbulent times  Let s take a look at the companies  debt equity ratios  Quanta Services  debt to equity ratio currently stands at just 0 18  much lower than the industry ratio of 0 42  Jacobs Engineering compares unfavorably with the industry with a ratio of 0 43   Fluor is also riskier than the industry in terms of debt burden  with a ratio of 0 46 
Quanta Services  inherent stability is underlined by its low beta of 0 86  which compares favorably to that of Jacobs Engineering at 1 54 and Fluor s beta co efficient of 1 52 
Also  in terms of growth  Quanta Services is expected to grow 34 6  this year  higher than the industry s growth expectation of 23 6  
Estimate Revisions
Let s see how the analyst community currently feels about these stocks 
Quanta Services  which carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   has been attracting bullish analyst attention in recent times  The company s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has trended up from  2 47 to  2 65  in the past two months  which indicates that analysts expect good things from the company this year 
Jacobs Engineering  which holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   has also witnessed positive estimates revisions  Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings rose from  3 60 to  4 00 in the past 60 days  highlighting bullish analyst sentiment 
Fluor sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has been enjoying favorable estimates revision activity  Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has jumped from  2 38 to  3 26 in the past two months You can see  
Clearly  analysts are feeling optimistic about the space as a whole  The Engineering R D Services industry currently holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 72 out of more than 250 industries  and lies among the Top 27  of all industries  Positive industry developments will benefit the stocks as well 
While all the stocks hold strong growth potential and enjoy favorable industry trends  in terms of valuation and financial stability  Quanta Services trumps Jacobs Engineering and Fluor  However  in terms of earnings history and Zacks Rank  Jacobs Engineering and Fluor beat Quanta Services

111222,332737,EFX,Will Soft Margin Trends Weigh On NIKE s  NKE  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   is slated to release third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 22  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this leading sports apparel retailer will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported In the last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of nearly 18   Moreover  it has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for more than three years  delivering positive earnings surprises for 22 straight quarters  In the trailing four quarters  the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 22 5   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement NIKE  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 52 cents  reflecting year over year decline of 23 5   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has been going down in the last seven days  However  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  8 8 billion  reflecting an increase of 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Moreover  NIKE underperformed the  sector in the past month  indicating a negative sentiment ahead of the earnings release  Its shares declined 3   wider than the sector s fall of 0 8  

Factors at PlayNIKE s robust growth and innovation efforts have been reflected in its robust earnings surprise trend  Additionally  persistent growth in international locations and global NIKE Direct business  along with solid demand for the NIKE brand  has been boosting top line While the company s overall sales performance remains impressive  sales in its key North American market continues to suffer  The soft sales in North America can be attributed to the lackluster product assortments  increased promotions due to the growth of e commerce and intensified competition  Moreover  the company s wholesale business in the region has been impacted by increased focus on online sales  We believe the overall environment is likely to remain promotional in North America  hurting the results in this segment  These trends in North America make us cautious about the company s overall performance Backed by the continued softness in North America  NIKE retained its previously stated soft outlook for fiscal 2018 and provided a bleak third quarter view  The company expects near term results to be hurt by currency headwinds and a promotional retail environment across the United States For fiscal 2018  reported revenues are anticipated to increase mid single digits  In third quarter fiscal 2018  the company anticipates revenues to be flat to slightly below the second quarter level due to the timing of new product launches coming late in the quarter  The company expects the strength in international business to be partly mitigated by decline in North America and in the Converse segment Furthermore  NIKE has been witnessing strained margins for a few quarters now  Gross margin in the fiscal second quarter shriveled due to foreign currency headwinds and the rise in product costs per unit  Moreover  higher SG A expenses can be attributed to the increase in operating overheads and demand creation expenses Going forward  the company expects gross margin to contract about 50 100 bps in fiscal 2018 and 125 175 bps in the third quarter  While the company anticipates the underlying drivers for gross margin to improve in the third quarter  currency headwinds and a promotional retail environment across the United States is likely to outweigh margin growth Reported SG A for the fiscal is anticipated to increase in the mid single digit range  including prudent operating overhead management alongside investing in its Consumer Direct offense  In third quarter fiscal 2018  SG A expense is anticipated to increase low double digits due to increased demand creation opportunities and higher operating overheads to boost digital capabilities Driven by the softness in North American sales and the pressure on margins  we remain skeptical about the company s performance in the upcoming release What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  NIKE has an Earnings ESP of  0 11   Although its Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the stock s negative ESP makes earnings prediction difficult Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Guess  Inc    NYSE GES   has an Earnings ESP of  1 25  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  The Michaels Companies Inc    NASDAQ MIK   has an Earnings ESP of  2 02  and a Zacks Rank  2 G III Apparel Group Ltd    NASDAQ GIII   has an Earnings ESP of  22 45  and a Zacks Rank  2 Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away ",2018-03-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-soft-margin-trends-weigh-on-nikes-nke-q3-earnings-200298521,200298521

111242,332757,EFX,4 Growth Stocks In Insurance Industry Poised To Surge In 2018,opinion,The U S Insurance Industry battled a plethora challenges in the form of a tumultuous 2017   a year plagued with weather related events  regulatory upheavals as well as political turmoil  However  the U S  insurers have entered 2018 with renewed confidence and are anticipating improved performance as the year rolls on Although there will be challenges to counter in 2018  the insurers remain focused on achieving two important objectives   growing top line sales while bolstering bottom line profitability With a rapidly changing regulatory climate  unpredictable nature of the occurrence of natural calamities and a volatile operating environment  we expect some of the insurers to face these challenges head on and remain optimistic about the operational performance of such insurance companies in 2018 We will discuss some driving factors that should help insurance companies to perform better this year  raising optimism and allaying apprehensions among investors Potential Impact of Rising Interest RatesThe insurance industry as a whole has been positively impacted by rising interest rates  With the Fed delivering with its promise of hiking interest rates thrice in 2017  the insurers remain hopeful for the same number of rate increases in 2018 and two more in 2019  The anticipation of the first rate hike in March as indicated by the Federal Reserve in Jan 31 meeting has restored hope  Currently  the interest rate ranges between 1 25  and 1 50   which is expected to boost the insurance industry s prospects If we view the life insurance industry separately  we can identify its connection with interest rates  given the high sensitivity of the players  business models to interest rates  Consequently  the life insurers will get a relief from the operating pressures resulting from tight credit spreads that the low rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time  But the insurers will not see a significant benefit due to the substantial reduction of their interest sensitive product lines in the low rate era  Nonetheless  rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide required relief to insurers to maintain margins Meanwhile  property and casualty  P C  insurance industry holds a significant amount of bonds that would decrease in value with interest rates rising steadily going forward  This will lead to capital volatility in the industry However  the rising rate environment would keep easing the pressure on P C insurers  investment income  and thus their earnings  Moreover  a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive  inducing growth in carriers Overall  a progressing rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry  with regard to their investment income  which forms a major portion of their revenues   thereby accelerating the insurance companies  overall growth in the future Better Underwriting Results   A Possibility The insurance industry was hit badly by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017  which hurt the underwriting performance to a great extent  Per a report by Fitch Ratings  the insurance industry is expected to return to substantial underwriting profitability in 2018 at a slow pace  Moreover  combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to break even The capital strength displayed by the insurers will help them to counter near term volatility and the effects of adverse events Other Factors Resulting in Favorable PerformanceThere are a few other factors that are likely to impact the insurance industry positively this year  The unemployment rate is projected to stay below 4  in 2018 and the gross domestic product is expected to grow 2 5  for the same period   both of which are considered good for the economy This apart  a recovering housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written Further  the recent tax cut  which reduced the tax rate to 21  from 35   is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a large extent  A lower tax rate would aid the companies  bottom line  boosting margins directly  Additionally  the tax cut is anticipated to make U S  insurers more competitive globally Key PicksDespite some of the challenges raising concerns for insurers this year  positives like rising interest rate environment  better underwriting results and gradually improving economy will help the following stocks perform well and yield profits through an

111333,332848,EFX,4 Top Ranked   Promising Auto Stocks Ahead Of Q1 Earnings,opinion,Most automotive companies beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter ending Dec 31  2017  Strong sales of crossovers  sports utility vehicles  SUVs  and pickup trucks contributed to the rise in revenues for the auto companies  Per the latest   as of Mar 7  in fourth quarter 2017  the auto companies recorded year over year earnings growth of 24 3   while revenues were up 2 6  Of late  auto companies have been plagued with several challenges  The recent rise in interest rates and strict credit conditions resulted in declining sales for these companies in February  In fact  strong sales of crossovers and SUVs were inadequate to offset the decreasing sales from pickup trucks Also  the decision to raise tariffs against the usage of imported steel and aluminum might hamper profit margins for the automakers  which are heavily dependent on these metals  This initiative might help the ailing steel and aluminum industries revive growth but the U S  automotive companies will lose their competitive edge over foreign automakers In the last three months  the  sector has underperformed

automakers and overall improvement in the economy  The recent growth in employment creation and rise in workforce across low  middle and high wage industries will lead to a hike in the spending ability of consumers  thus strengthening the economy  Furthermore  tax cuts by the Trump government are expected to benefit the broader economy in the coming quarters Moreover  per an updated outlook provided by the leading rating agency  Moody s  the U S  auto sales are projected to decline lesser than expected in 2018  driven by improving the economy and rising demand  The rating agency estimates a sale of 16 9 million light vehicles this year  against the December s projection of 16 8 million unit sales Screening the StocksOverall  the auto sector has been bearish so far this year

111359,332874,EFX,Should Value Investors Pick Cambrex  CBM  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cambrex Corporation   NYSE CBM    stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cambrex has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cambrex s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 34 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cambrex has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 19 7  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in the near future PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio Cambrex s PEG ratio stands at just 1 3  compared with the industry average of 3 7  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cambrex currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cambrex a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cambrex is just 1 3  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 5  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CBM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cambrex might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F  This gives CBM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 34  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cambrex Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCambrex is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 29  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio

FB  Remains a BuyFacebook has found itself in the news for all the wrong reasons over the last few days as Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team release more information regarding their investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 U S  Presidential election Still  as the social media giant stares down what could prove to be a prolonged period of heightened scrutiny and possible government regulation  its stock seems highly enticing Last Friday  Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups for interfering with the 2016 U S  elections  with the purchasing of ads on Facebook being one of many illicit activities mentioned  also read    Then  over the weekend  Facebook advertising executive Rob Goldman drew attention for a  that pointed to a much broader Russian goal of interfering with the American democratic process in general which Facebook later noted reflected only his personal opinion Mueller s Russian investigation will likely reveal far more information and could have wide ranging implications far beyond Facebook  But Mark Zuckerberg s firm is also not alone  and the Mueller investigation has also pointed to attempts by Russians to use Alphabet s YouTube  Twitter and Instagram to sway U S  public opinion    We already have about 10 000 people working on safety and security  and we re planning to double that to 20 000 in the next year to better enforce our Community Standards and review ads   Zuckerberg said in a recent statement With that said  let s take a look at why Facebook is still a stock to consider buying even as the Mueller investigation heats up Why Buy FacebookInvestor should think of Facebook with one word in mind  advertising  Advertising accounted for 98 5  of the company s  12 972 billion Q4 revenues  The average price per ad on Facebook rose by 43  last quarter  and as advertisers find it increasingly hard to reach users via television and print  this number could climb even higher Going forward  Facebook investors should note that the social media giant is expected to account for 11 3  of all U S  advertising spending in 2019  passing the entire print category  according to a  Facebook has never been more trafficked or profitable  especially as it grows outside of the U S  For instance  the world s second largest country  India  is experiencing a mobile phone and internet boom Aside from its user base and advertising reach  Facebook currently presents shareholders with a ton of bang for their buck  At the moment  Facebook is trading at 24 37x earnings  which marks the cheapest price investors have ever been able to buy the social media giant s stock in its history  While this could mean that enough investors think that Facebook s growth fueled glory days are over  expansion does seem to be in the cards for the foreseeable future The company is projected to see its sales surge nearly 42  in the current quarter  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2018  Facebook is expected to see its revenues hit  55 41 billion  which would mark a 36  year over year jump  The company is also projected to expand its bottom line by nearly 17  Furthermore  Facebook has witnessed 17 earnings estimate revisions with 100  agreement to the upside for 2018  as well as ten upward estimates for the following year  The firm is expected to see its earnings expand at a strong annualized rate of 26 51  over the next three to five years Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and boasts  B  grades for both Growth and

111403,332918,EFX,These Tech ETFs Dispel Rate Hike Fears  Hit 52 Week High ,opinion,"The latest Fed minutes reflected the increased confidence of policy makers in U S  inflation and the need to raise rates faster in 2018  especially amid the materialization of tax cuts  This has driven the yield on 10 year U S  Treasury bonds to 2 94   which is a   and was up from 2 46  recorded at the start of the year  read     
Yield on the 30 year Treasury bond shot up to its highest since July 2015  while yield on the two year Treasury note scaled the highest level   Many analysts  including Macquarie Group  foresee  renewed hawkishness from the FOMC in the coming months   courtesy of solid wage and inflation data 
Needless to say  the minutes came across as equity bashing with the three big ETFs including SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY    AX SPY    SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average  SI SPDR  ETF   V DIA   and PowerShares QQQ ETF  ending up in the red   Fears of faster ceases in cheap money inflows kept the broader market under pressure post the release of the Fed minutes  In fact  the all world fund iShares MSCI ACWI ETF  lost about 0 4  on Feb 22 
However  there are certain investing areas which held their heads high and even hit a 52 week high on the day  Below we highlight those areas 
Sizzling Tech Investing Areas
The technology sector has been in great shape  Emerging new technologies like cloud computing  big data and Internet of Things  IoT  are expected to drive the sector in the coming days  This kind of a cyclical sector often grows in an improving economy 
The latest Fed minutes displayed that both voting members and the other policymakers had upgraded forecasts for the economic outlook since last December 
Another reason to be bullish on the sector is increasing dividends and buybacks by tech companies  Per the  issued on Feb 14  the technology sector is expected to grow 22 6  on fourth quarter 2017 earnings versus the projected growth of 13 9  for the S P 500 
Software 
Earnings from the Computer Software   Services sector are expected to grow 33 5  in the fourth quarter of 2017  marking the third highest growth rate among seven tech categories  PowerShares Dynamic Software ETF   SPDR S P Software   Services  NYSE XSW  ETF  and iShares North American Tech Software ETF   SN IGV   are expected to cash in on this winning trend 
Internet   Social Media
Internet and social media stocks are riding high on rising demand for online activities  Investors should also note that semiconductor companies play a major role in the IoT space  Now  the IoT chip market is projected to register  an annual growth rate of  and hit  17 billion by 2022  according to Research and Markets  
In fact  the Electronic   Semiconductors segment is expected to log about 68 1  earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2017  per Earnings Trends  Global X Social Media ETF   CM SOCL     First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF  and PowerShares NASDAQ Internet ETF  are some of the funds that should gain from the online hype  read    
Cyber Security 
The fear of cyber attacks is rising rapidly and so is the demand for cyber security  Be it the ransomware WannaCry or Petya  one or another cyber incident kept disrupting global stability in the last few months  Last September  Equifax  NYSE EFX   the credit reporting agency  revealed a huge data breach  Most recently  the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics faced a similar issue  Needless to say  demand for cyber security related stocks are red hot for now  read    
ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF  and First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF  have thus successfully brushed off rising rate worries and remained steady

111407,332922,EFX,5 Top Rated Stocks To Buy Despite February Retail Sales Dip,opinion,On Mar 14  the U S  Commerce Department reported that retail sales declined 0 1  for the month of February  This marked the third straight month of decline for the metric since April 2012  However  core retail sales increased  and the economic picture remains promising  This indicates that the headline number is likely to pick up in the near term Despite overall retail sales decline  a closer look of the report reveals some specific retail segments have performed well  This provides a silver lining to an otherwise grim scenario  These include building materials and clothing stores as well as restaurants and bars  Given that economic fundamentals remain strong  betting on retail segments which have performed well despite February s decline in overall sales makes for a smart choice Core Retail Sales ImproveRetail sales have dipped by 0 1  in February 2018  This was in sharp contrast to the consensus estimate of an increase of 0 4   Notably  U S  consumer spending accounts for nearly two thirds of its GDP   However  January retail sales data was revised to reflect a 0 1  decline instead of the previously reported drop of 0 3  The Commerce Department report shows that core retail sales inched up 0 1  last month after remaining unchanged in the prior month  Core retail sales data excludes sales figures of automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  This is a major positive since it closely corresponds to the consumer expenditure component of U S  GDP However  certain specific industries performed well last month  Sales at building material stores increased 1 9   Further  sales at clothing stores  online retailers  restaurants and bars and sporting goods and hobby stores were up 0 4   1   0 2  and 2 2  respectively U S  Economy Remains StrongOn Feb 8  a survey among economists conducted by The Wall Street Journal predicted U S  GDP to rise 2 8  in 2018  better than 2 5  in the fourth quarter of 2017  Jobs data released on Mar 9 showed that the economy added 313 000 jobs in February 2018  exceeding the consensus estimate of 208 000  However  wages increased by only 2 6  on an annualized basis compared with 2 9  in the prior month  Consequently  investors  apprehensions over rising inflation were significantly dispelled On Mar 8  a report of Federal Reserve stated that the U S  household wealth moved further into record territory of  98 75 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2017  This big push in household wealth was primarily driven by stock market rally and soaring real estate prices  Substantial increase in wealth is likely to make many Americans more confident and help them spend more fueling economic growth Our Top PicksU S  consumer spending increased at an annualized pace of 3 8  in the fourth quarter of 2017  the fastest in more than a year  This is one of the many economic measures which indicate that the decline in retail sales is likely a temporary phenomenon  Sales are likely to pick up once consumers feel the positive impact of tax cuts and increased government spending In anticipation  it makes good sense to buy stocks from those retail segments which performed well last month despite the negative headline figure  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and provides strong growth potential  You can see  Builders FirstSource Inc    NASDAQ BLDR   is a leading supplier and manufacturer of structural and related building products for

111410,332925,EFX,UBS To Merge Equity And Debt Capital Markets In Asia Pacific,opinion,"UBS Group AG   NYSE UBS   is taking initiatives to unite its equity and debt capital market business in the Asia Pacific region in order to streamline its operations 
Per an internal memo issued by the bank  the step has been taken due to the synergies that exist between the two divisions such as  overlapping investors and product cross over   Further  David Chin  head of corporate clients solution business in the region said in the memo   These changes are aimed at optimizing our business in the region  serving clients more cohesively  
Gaetano Bassolino  former head of debt capital markets in the region had been appointed the head of Asia Pacific capital markets  Also  per the memo  Hannah Malter  the chief of staff for Asia Pacific  will be rejoining the equity capital markets to support the firm s Asia into U S  initial public offerings 
Per a Financial Times article  no jobs are expected to be lost due to this merger  Also  the step has no relation with the recent probe of Hong Kong s Securities and Futures Commission in its prior initial public offerings  IPOs  
Last week  the commission had placed a ban on UBS Group from sponsoring IPO in Hong Kong for a period of 18 months  Also  a fine of HK 119 million was imposed 
However  the bank mentioned its intentions to contest the regulator s decision in latest annual filing  Also  it assured employees of continuing  business as normal  via an internal memo till its appeal is heard by the authorities  which it expects to happen in fourth quarter 2018 
UBS Group s efforts to bolster performance through restructuring and other financial targets bode well for the long term  Also  effective cost reduction initiatives might continue to support its bottom line growth  However  pressure on revenues due to suspension from IPO sponsoring and challenging domestic economic conditions remain key concerns 
Shares of UBS Group have gained 14 2  over the past year  outperforming the  s rally of 12 5

111415,332930,EFX,Is GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  GlaxoSmithKline has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  GlaxoSmithKline s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that GlaxoSmithKline has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 6  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for GlaxoSmithKline stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  GlaxoSmithKline has a P S ratio of about 2 3  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  GSK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  GlaxoSmithKline currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes GlaxoSmithKline a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though GlaxoSmithKline might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives GSK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat  The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days  while the next year estimate has seen three up in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 6 1  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has increased 4 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and Consensus    This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineGlaxoSmithKline is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 19  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2  instill investor confidence However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in GlaxoSmithKline Can Hackers

111430,332945,EFX,Will ACADIA  ACAD  Disappoint Investors In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ACAD   is expected to release fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 27  In the last quarter  ACADIA delivered a positive surprise of 15 87   The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9 95  in the last four quarters 
ACADIA s shares have tumbled 21 3  year to date compared with the  s decline of 2 5  

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
ACADIA is focused on developing products for treating unmet medical needs in central nervous system   CNS    The growth of its first approved drug  Nuplazid  pimavanserin   for treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson s disease   PD   psychosis  has been impressive since its launch in April 2016 
The drugs sales have been impressive and has helped the company to garner 32  revenues in the third quarter  The company expects the trend to continue this time around as well and in the fourth quarter of 2017  The number of patients receiving Nuplazid treatment continues to grow and banking on this trend  the company increased its 2017 guidance for Nuplazid net sales between  124 million and  127 million 
The company is also on track with its multi year plans of developing Nuplazid in indications beyond PD psychosis  The company is studying the drug in five clinical programs for Nuplazid   Alzheimer s disease agitation  Alzheimer s disease psychosis  Schizophrenia inadequate response  Schizophrenia negative symptoms and major depressive disorders 
In October 2017  the company initiated a phase III HARMONY Study in dementia related psychosis or DRP  The company also received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for Nuplazid for the treatment of DRP  Following an End of Phase II meeting with the FDA  robust positive results from one phase III study  together with supported data from prior studies with Nuplazid could serve as the basis of a supplementary new drug application 
We expect the company to provide further update on the progress of this study during fourth quarter earnings call 
The company expects research and operating expenses to be in the mid  40 million range and SG A to be in the high  60 million to low  70 million range due to higher clinical costs related to studies and to support its commercial activities for Nuplazid 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for ACADIA this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  ACADIA has an Earnings ESP of  3 75   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 60 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 58 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  ACADIA currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

111436,332951,EFX,Despite Russia Woes  Facebook  FB  Stock Remains A Buy,opinion,"Facebook   NASDAQ FB   has found itself in the news for all the wrong reasons over the last few days as Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team release more information regarding their investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 U S  Presidential election 
Still  as the social media giant stares down what could prove to be a prolonged period of heightened scrutiny and possible government regulation  its stock seems highly enticing 
Last Friday  Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups for interfering with the 2016 U S  elections  with the purchasing of ads on Facebook being one of many illicit activities mentioned  also read    
Then  over the weekend  Facebook advertising executive Rob Goldman drew attention for a  that pointed to a much broader Russian goal of interfering with the American democratic process in general which Facebook later noted reflected only his personal opinion 
Mueller s Russian investigation will likely reveal far more information and could have wide ranging implications far beyond Facebook  But Mark Zuckerberg s firm is also not alone  and the Mueller investigation has also pointed to attempts by Russians to use Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   YouTube  Twitter   NYSE TWTR    and Instagram to sway U S  public opinion   
 We already have about 10 000 people working on safety and security  and we re planning to double that to 20 000 in the next year to better enforce our Community Standards and review ads   Zuckerberg said in a recent statement 
With that said  let s take a look at why Facebook is still a stock to consider buying even as the Mueller investigation heats up 
Why Buy Facebook 
Investor should think of Facebook with one word in mind  advertising  Advertising accounted for 98 5  of the company s  12 972 billion Q4 revenues  The average price per ad on Facebook rose by 43  last quarter  and as advertisers find it increasingly hard to reach users via television and print  this number could climb even higher 
Going forward  Facebook investors should note that the social media giant is expected to account for 11 3  of all U S  advertising spending in 2019  passing the entire print category  according to a  
Facebook has never been more trafficked or profitable  especially as it grows outside of the U S  For instance  the world s second largest country  India  is experiencing a mobile phone and internet boom 
Aside from its user base and advertising reach  Facebook currently presents shareholders with a ton of bang for their buck  At the moment  Facebook is trading at 24 37x earnings  which marks the cheapest price investors have ever been able to buy the social media giant s stock in its history  While this could mean that enough investors think that Facebook s growth fueled glory days are over  expansion does seem to be in the cards for the foreseeable future 
The company is projected to see its sales surge nearly 42  in the current quarter  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2018  Facebook is expected to see its revenues hit  55 41 billion  which would mark a 36  year over year jump  The company is also projected to expand its bottom line by nearly 17  
Furthermore  Facebook has witnessed 17 earnings estimate revisions with 100  agreement to the upside for 2018  as well as ten upward estimates for the following year  The firm is expected to see its earnings expand at a strong annualized rate of 26 51  over the next three to five years 
Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and boasts  B  grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system  And due to the recent market wide selloff  shares of Facebook rest nearly 10  below their 52 week high  which means investors might consider scooping up the social media power while some have ditched the stock

111443,332958,EFX,Why Did Snap Stock Plummet Today ,opinion,"Shares of Snap Inc    NYSE SNAP   closed nearly 7  lower on Tuesday after Citigroup  NYSE C  analysts downgraded the social media stock on the back of a controversial new update that has left many users unhappy 
Citigroup s Mark May downgraded Snap to  sell  from  hold  and lowered his price target to  14 from  18  which would represent a slide of more than 31  from last week s close  May cited a  significant jump  in negative reviews following Snapchat s major redesign a trend which he says could hurt the stock if it impacts user growth and user engagement 
Snap s app overhaul and subsequent criticism from users comes shortly after many Wall Street hoped that the young company had reached a turning point  Earlier this month  shares skyrocketed nearly 50  in just one trading period in the wake of the company s better than expected earnings report 
Snap reported an adjusted loss of 13 cents per share in the fourth quarter  coming in ahead of our consensus estimate that called for a loss of 15 cents per share and improving from its 19 cents per share loss in the year ago period 
Evan Spiegel s company also posted total revenues of  285 7 million  up about 72  year over year  Snapchat added about 28 8 million daily active users in the quarter  lifting its total 18  to touch 187 million 
But the app s new design reorganizes the platform in a way that users are largely unfamiliar with  largely abandoning a basic structure that has been in place for years  If this new style fails to resonate with Snapchat s most loyal users  the company s first impressive quarter might just be its last

111458,332973,EFX,Can Under Armour Bounce Back In 2018 ,opinion,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research  This week we explore Under Armour s   NYSE UAA   Q4 results and look to the company s future  which seems highly uncertain amid stiff competition and shifting sports retail trends 
Coming off the company s dismal third quarter  Under Armour s North American sales dipped once again during the vital holiday shopping period  The sportswear company also posted a quarterly loss  based largely on impacts from the new Republican tax law as well as its own restructuring plan 
Investors were happy to note that Under Armour grew its international sales and its direct to consumer revenues  partially offsetting a big shift in U S  retail patterns that has seen downturns from Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    Foot Locker   NYSE FL   and others 
Nevertheless  Under Armour and CEO Kevin Plank face increased competition from Adidas   OTC ADDYY   both domestically and abroad  Meanwhile  Lululemon Athletica   NASDAQ LULU   and other smaller North American retailers  as well as footwear firms such as Skechers   NYSE SKX    have also made life harder for a brand that many said looked poised to challenge Nike   NYSE NKE   in the U S  for years to come  
Looking ahead  Under Armour will begin to focus more heavily on non performance  athleisure apparel and footwear which is where the industry is currently trending  As it tries to expand its market share in North America and internationally  the company also needs to grow its presence on social media platforms like Twitter   NYSE TWTR    Facebook   NASDAQ FB    and Instagram as online sales become more vital than ever 
Now the question for many investors is simple  can Under Armour claw its way back  or are its days of massive growth simply over

111464,332979,EFX,Here s What Nvidia Thinks About Cryptocurrency Mining,opinion,"It is no secret that Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   has emerged as one of Wall Street s favorite stocks over the past two years  The graphics chip maker has exploded in value and garnered significant investor attention thanks to the continued growth of its core business and the emergence of several new businesses  and now it feels like Nvidia has its hands in nearly every corner of the modern technology world 
This Santa Clara  California based processor manufacturer has been a top choice among PC gamers looking to build high end machines for years  but now the company is a major player in many other exciting markets  including datacenters  self driving cars  and cryptocurrency mining 
Interestingly enough  Nvidia s rapid rise has come at the same time as a massive surge in the cryptocurrency market  so the fact that the company s GPUs are often used in the coin mining process makes the whole story even more remarkable 
Led by huge gains from the likes of bitcoin and Ethereum  cryptocurrencies have become all the rage in the financial sector as proponents and critics debate the merits of these digital assets  Naturally  this has also led to increased interest in cryptocurrency mining  a process that sees users rewarded with new coins or tokens when they volunteer their own computing power for the necessary blockchain maintenance that makes these cryptos work 
Nvidia and competitors like AMD   NASDAQ AMD   come into play here because their GPUs pack the punch needed to power the dedicated mining rigs that many are rushing to build  Nevertheless  Nvidia has been hesitant to consider cryptocurrencies a driving force behind its growth 
 While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify  we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter   said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress in the company s latest earnings    That said  our main focus remains on our core gaming market  as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile  
Analysts in that conference call were clearly wanting to hear more about Nvidia s perception of cryptocurrencies  but they were met with a bit of stonewalling from the company s enigmatic CEO  Jensen Huang 
Fielding a question centered on whether his management team s outlook on cryptos has been  modeled more conservatively   Huang responded simply by saying   We model crypto approximately flat  
Of course  Nvidia s balance sheet does not stonewall  We know that Nvidia witnessed total GPU revenues of  2 461 billion in its most recent quarter  up about 33  from the prior year period 
A vast majority of that revenue is coming from the businesses that Nvidia actually markets its products toward  and we should not discount the strength of its gaming  datacenter  and professional visualization segments 
But as much as Nvidia management would like to shift the conversation away from cryptocurrencies  it is clear that coin miners are having some sort of impact on the company s top line

Global Industrial Segment
Sales in the segment grew 6 1  year over year to almost  1 29 billion  The upside was driven by major gains in Water  Food   Beverage and Life Sciences unit 
Europe  North America and Latin America led the Global Industrial regional growth  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income improved 4  on a year over year basis 
Global Institutional Segment
Sales increased 8 5  to  1 22 billion  led by strong growth in the Specialty business line  The segment witnessed solid growth in North America and Asia Pacific 
Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income remained flat year over year 
Global Energy Segment
Sales rose 10 8  to  853 2 million owing to strong growth in the well stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business 
Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 4  year over year 
Other Segment
Sales declined 6 8  year over year to  189 7 million  Sales in this segment witnessed robust growth in North America

Our Take
Ecolab ended the fourth quarter on an unfavorable note  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts  Despite strength in Pest Elimination business  the Other segment declined year over year on reported basis  Ecolab operates in highly competitive markets  which might mar prospects over the long haul 
We believe that volatility in foreign currency exchange rates will remain a significant headwind for the company  Ecolab faces pricing pressure in the Energy segment which is likely to hurt profits 
On the brighter side  a strong guidance instills optimism on the stock  Further  Europe  North America and Latin America led the Global Industrial regional growth in the quarter  Strength in the Global Institutional segment led by growth in the Specialty and Healthcare business lines is also a positive  A robust product portfolio and expanding customer base is likely to drive organic sales over the long haul

111492,333007,EFX,Fed To Speed Up Rate Hikes  4 Bank Stocks To Buy,opinion,Major indices regained stability following an erratic week that ended Feb 9  Last week  the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 4 3   marking the largest gain since the election of Trump  On top of that  the S P 500 registered a gain of 4 3  over the last five trading sessions through the week ending Feb 16  the highest since 2013 It seems investors are no longer fretting over the spike in inflation rates but are instead focused on record low unemployment levels and better than expected job addition  In fact  analysts believe that the record job additions and strong GDP data will help the indices maintain the bullish momentum Investors should know that out of the 10 sectors tracking the S P 500 index  the Financial industry rallied 4 7  last week  In particular  banks are poised to generate more profits from higher lending rates  In other words  the possibility of aggressive rate hikes by the Fed through 2018 will likely boost bank profits Fed May Raise Rate AggressivelyPer the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  the consumer price index ticked up 0 5  through January 2018  beating market expectations of 0 3   The index rose 2 1  over the past 12 months  indicating that the central bank might make an aggressive move to raise policy rates Leading investment management firm BlackRock added that the central bank could lift policy rates three or four times in 2018  The rate hike will increase the borrowing cost  leading to the payment of higher interest to lenders  This is expected to ensure higher lending income for banks Loans to GrowThe mid month report of the University of Michigan shows that the U S  consumer sentiment index for the month of February has not only touched a record high but has also risen more than market expectations The index scaled 99 9 in February  surpassing the estimate of 95 5 made by Reuters economists  It also reflects the second highest mark over the past 14 years  This clearly shows that consumers are more interested in the news of low unemployment  wage growth  and solid GDP data than the market s tumultuous movement  Hence  significant job addition and healthy consumer sentiments will boost the demand for loans and other related products of banks GDP Data Solid  The nation s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the final three months of 2017  following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3   per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  In fact  this marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009 Notably  in the first quarter of this year  GDP is expected to jump   per the latest estimate by Atlanta Fed Significant Job Addition   Low Unemployment  Per the U S  Labor Department report  200 000 new non farm payroll jobs were created in January  beating market expectations  According to a survey by Reuters  most economists were expecting an addition of 180 000 jobs Also  the jobless rate remained at an ultra low level of 4 1  and workers  hourly wages increased 2 9  year over year in January 2017 Tax Reforms to Benefit BanksThe tax bill  which was signed into law last year  will likely benefit banks  Although major banks took a hit in the fourth quarter owing to non recurring non cash chargea related to the tax reform bill  financial institutions expect the reform to prove beneficial in the long term During the fourth quarter  Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   reported net loss of  18 3 billion  or  7 15 per share  The results included a non recurring non cash charge related to the tax reform of  22 billion  However  Citigroup expects lower effective tax rate to drive net income Moreover  with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  TCJA   JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   expects its effective tax rate to be 17  in the first quarter of 2018  19  in 2018  and nearly 20  in the near term Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   believe that the tax reform will likely lower their effective tax rates to 19  for 2018  Media reports claimed that the rate for 2018 will be significantly below the actual rate paid during 2016 and hence will increase the combined profit of banks by at least  7 billion this year Which Stocks to Focus On Picking bank stocks with strong

This is why it makes good sense to invest in select homebuilding stocks at this point Multi family Starts SurgeIn January  housing starts increased 9 7  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 33 million units  This is the highest level recorded since October 2016 and the second highest since the end of the Great Recession  The figure was also 7 3  higher than the January 2017 pace of 1 24

existing home sales came in at 5 57 million units  below most estimates  primarily due to a preexisting shortage in inventories  The resultant increase in housing prices and a spike in mortgage prices are the major impediments for the housing sector in the current year Fortunately  homebuilders have responded by continuously stepping up the construction of single family homes  This is a clear indication that they continue to have confidence in the economy  since such homes are usually bought  not rented  Multi family homes have also shown an increase  with a discernable shift toward luxury apartments Moreover  a report released last week by the National Association of Home Builders indicated that homebuilder confidence has maintained at an appreciably high level during February

Arkansas  the company is a leading rural local exchange carrier in the United States The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 49 billion  reflecting year over year improvement of 13 7   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 39 cents per share  indicating year over year growth of 23 5  Meanwhile  the company has a negative earnings surprise history  Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters  with an average miss of 57 0  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsWe appreciate Windstream s focus on improving sales  cutting costs and pricing initiatives  which are expected to boost profitability and check churn  Meanwhile  the company is seeking diversification from legacy telecom services to more business  enterprise  and wholesale opportunities  To meet this end  Windstream has made a significant financial investment to upgrade the company s network and product portfolio  including significant advances in software defined wide area network  SD WAN  capabilities and a new Cloud Core architecture  Additionally  the acquisitions of EarthLink and Broadview have also played a major role in boosting the company s SD WAN and cloud suite The launch of a multi featured SD WAN solution and its cloud to cloud disaster recovery management solutions should rake in considerable profits  Expansion of its metro fiber network business in newer areas and its aim to extend the deployment of G fast technologies over traditional copper telephone wires bode well The company announced SDN enabled multi vendor services partnerships with Ciena Corporation   NYSE CIEN    Infinera Corporation   NASDAQ INFN   and Coriant in the MEF17 Proof of Concept

well   The stock price has declined 35 5   underperforming the  s gain of 5 3  in the said time frame  Moreover  Windstream has been losing access lines  thanks to pricing pressure and fierce competition  The company is under pressure due to losses in the wholesale business  Being a local exchange carrier  Windstream is exposed to stringent regulatory measures by the Federal Communications Commission as well as state regulations Further  continuous investments in technology and network upgrades may dent the company s earnings  Outdated network equipment has been the primary reason for discontinuation of the DSL  digital subscriber line  service in CLEC  competitive local exchange carrier  territories across 25 states Despite management s efforts to modify financial profile  we are concerned about Windstream s highly leveraged balance sheet Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Windstream is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  Windstream has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 39 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with the  Zacks Rank  Windstream has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Windstream Holdings  Inc  Price

111607,333122,EFX,Bitcoin s Energy  The Information Economy And  Possible  Decentralization ,opinion,"The near vertical rise and fall in price of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in recent months has been accompanied by reporting about   The amount is enormous  more than enough to supply the entire country of Ireland 
Many other cryptocurrencies operate under less energy intensive designs  But the more than 1 000 other digital coins beyond Bitcoin certainly use a considerable amount of energy though there is no overall estimate I m aware of   For the technically minded   is a discussion of two popular methods associated with validating transactions  one of which is considerably less energy intensive  
We d like to think that the information economy of which these newfangled currencies are part bears lightly on the broader environment  But as I pointed out in my piece  much of what happens in the information economy is simply focused on extracting more resources more quickly to create more goods and services for more customers  The physical economy isn t disappearing  It is merely being exploited more completely using digital information 
And beyond this   Every person who works in the so called information sector of the economy must be housed  clothed  schooled  provided transportation  provisioned with household goods  given opportunities for entertainment and recreation   and  supplied with a wide array of public services  
Having said all this  I find one aspect of the blockchain technology behind the explosion in digital currencies to be promising  This technology offers a possible path for decentralizing banking and finance and myriad other Internet related services we ve come to rely on from big corporations  By creating a highly efficient transparent network with accounts readable by anyone and validation done by anyone who is willing to set up the necessary equipment  these networks make possible much wider use of micropayments to small service providers  That could make centralized Internet based services obsolete over time in many areas and bring power back to system users 
Conceivably  you could take back control of your personal information instead of trusting someone else to handle it securely  a need reinforced by regular major data breaches such as the Equifax  NYSE EFX  debacle   In the area of data backup and storage  you could choose to deal with many small distributed providers of data storage instead of dealing with one large company  Think Napster  with a small fee  for storage as opposed to large cloud services companies such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
Right now the accessibility and security issues related to participating in these incipient networks are formidable for average people  But those pushing blockchain technology are hard at work on these issues 
Perhaps of most interest to me is the application of blockchain to energy markets  Already Rocky Mountain Institute is leading efforts to develop blockchain technology for these markets  Three candidates for the technology are customer billing  renewable energy certificates  and peer to peer energy sharing networks 
Saying one understands all the implications of blockchain technology today would be similar to saying one understands all the implications of the Internet in the early 1990s 
Apart from the headline grabbing fortunes made by early entrants into the blockchain world  there seem to be much more profound implications to this technology  While Bitcoin is getting most of the attention  it is very much a single purpose vehicle for those who want to store wealth in a currency not controlled by central banks  I ll leave predictions about Bitcoin s future to others 
But the future of blockchain in general seems worthy of attention  The biggest threat it poses to the established order is the possibility of decentralizing wealth and power  Whether it will accomplish that to any degree is unknowable  But it is worth thinking about if you can avert your eyes from the current frenzy in the cryptocurrency marketplace ",2018-01-22,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-of-bitcoin-the-information-economy-and-the-possible-decentralization-200282101,200282101
111612,333127,EFX,WisdomTree  WETF  Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates  Revenues Rise,opinion,"Have you been eager to see how WisdomTree Investments  Inc    NASDAQ WETF   performed in Q4 in comparison with the market expectations  Let s quickly scan through the key facts from this New York based exchange traded fund   ETF   and exchange traded product   ETP   sponsor and asset manager s earnings release this morning 
An Earnings Miss
WisdomTree came out with adjusted earnings per share of 4 cents lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents  Results reflected higher expenses  partially offset by increase in revenues and growth in assets under management 
How Was the Estimate Revision Trend 
You should note that the earnings estimate revisions for WisdomTree depicted neutral stance prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable at 7 cents over the last seven days 
However  before posting an earnings miss in Q4  the company delivered positive surprises in two of the prior four quarters  Overall  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of nearly 0 9  in the trailing four quarters 
WisdomTree Investments  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Revenue Came in Better than Expected
WisdomTree posted revenues of  61 4 million  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  61 1 million  Also  revenues increased 20 8  year over year 
Key Takeaways The company recorded an after tax charge of  0 4 million as a revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the passage of tax reformTotal Expenses   55 7 million  up 31 8  year over yearAs of Dec 31  2017  U S  listed ETF assets under management  AUM  was  46 8 billion  up 16 6  year over year  Also  the company witnessed a 76 1  growth in European listed AUM which totaled  1 8 billion What Zacks Rank Says
The estimate revisions that we discussed earlier have driven a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for WisdomTree  However  since the latest earnings performance is yet to be reflected in the estimate revisions  the rank is subject to change  While things look unfavorable  it all depends on what sense the just released report makes to the analysts

These factors are likely to continue to drive growth  Yet  lingering political uncertainties in key international markets and currency headwinds might continue to limit revenue growth  Moreover  integration risks linked to Starwood purchase is an added concern  Even so  its investments in technology for hotel bookings are anticipated to improve guest experience  which in turn might boost occupancy

111624,333139,EFX,Household Debt And Credit Report  Up  116B In Q3  Another Peak,opinion,"The latest household debt for Q3 2017 was up 0 9  from Q2 and currently at  12 96T and currently at its peak  Here is an excerpt from the latest press release 

NEW YORK   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York s Center for Microeconomic Data today issued its   which reported that total household debt increased by  116 billion  0 9   to  12 96 trillion in the third quarter of 2017  There were increases in mortgage  student  auto and credit card debt  increasing by 0 6   1 0   1 9  and 3 1  respectively  and a modest decline in home equity lines of credit  HELOC  balances  decreasing by 0 9    The Report is based on data from the New York Fed s Consumer Credit Panel  a nationally representative sample of individual  and household level debt and credit records drawn from anonymized Equifax  NYSE EFX  credit data  

As a result of the housing and mortgage crisis of the Great Recession  economists have been paying more attention to the liabilities portion of household balance sheets  Among the New York Federal Reserve Board s many economic reports is the Household Debt and Credit report  which is released quarterly with data going back to 2003 
Data is collected through the NY Fed s Consumer Credit Panel which is constructed from a nationally representative random sample of Equifax credit report data resulting in a sample size of over 40 million individuals quarterly  Here is some background on the report from the NY Fed 

The large increases in consumer debt and defaults of mortgage debt in particular during the Great Recession highlighted the importance of understanding the liabilities reflected on household balance sheets  To that end  one of the CMD s large data collection projects is the New York Fed  which is constructed from a nationally representative random sample of Equifax credit report data  Analysis of this data set is regularly reported in the CMD s Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit  The data set can be used to calculate national and regional aggregate measures of individual  and household level credit balances  and delinquencies by product type  The Consumer Credit Panel also provides new insights into the extent and nature of heterogeneity of debt and delinquencies across individuals and households 

The chart below shows total debt balance nation wide by composition in trillions of dollars  The current total is  12 96T  well exceeding the 2008 peak

111627,333142,EFX,SailPoint IPO Soars As Investors Turn To Cybersecurity,opinion,"Sailpoint Technologies Holdings Inc  NYSE SAIL   the Texas based company offering enterprise identity solutions to companies eager to take cybersecurity more seriously  enjoyed a successful IPO Friday that saw its shares surge by nearly 20   After the company priced its IPO at  12  it enjoyed Friday prices up to  14 90 per share  and piqued serious investor interest as it eyed out a further stake in the cybersecurity market 
SailPoint raised some  240 million in its IPO  a hefty figure likely to inspire more confidence in its backers as the capital is applied to expanding the company s footprint in a burgeoning security market  After a slate of cyber security gaffes and data breaches  including a headline grabbing  for Uber  SailPoint s industry is enjoying a burst of investment as companies and individuals alike scramble to better their cybersecurity 
While SailPoint has yet to attain consistent profitability  the company has shown serious revenue growth recently  Revenue grew some 34  from this time last year   to  118 3 million reported for the nine month period ended September 30th  As interest in cybersecurity companies grows  SailPoint may yet enjoy even more growth as it scoops in more companies eager to better their data privacy operations 
A new era of cybersecurity CEO Mark McClain certainly thinks the company has a bright future after the recent spate of data breaches  in an interview with CNBC  he  the growing importance of information security and heightened cybersecurity in the 21st century  noting that companies like SailPoint  which help reassure larger corporations that their information is in good hands  have nowhere to climb but up in terms of market share 
While SailPoint is likely to enjoy a fresh crop of competitors eager to cash in on the industry s current boom  the company could use the impressive amount raised in its IPO to further entrench itself in the industry as it broadens its appeal to more customers  As the Internet of Things continues to expand and consume whole new portions of the economy  a rising demand for better data security measures is likely to buoy companies like SailPoint for years  if not decades to come 
High level data breaches like those besetting Uber and Equifax  NYSE EFX  lately have a tendency to draw massive amounts of media attention  capturing eyeballs of everyday customers and CEOs alike as news of digital invasions of privacy spread like wildfire  Few industries  apart from self storage  stand to gain further from this than cybersecurity practitioners  meaning investors would be wise to get in on the ongoing digital gold rush while the getting s still good 
Moving past losses SailPoint still has work to do if it wants to secure such a rosy future for itself  however  while the company has enjoyed growths in revenue in recent years  it needs to remain cautious about the losses its posting  Net losses grew from  6 5 million in 2016 to  13 million in 2017  for instance  meaning the company will need to do more to trim the fat as it grows if it hopes to ride the cybersecurity tide all the way to the bank 
Profitability is likely to be achieved by SailPoint if it learns how to scale back its frivolous spending and manages to properly leverage the funds from its IPO  however  The company has been around since 2005  having already endured many digital revolutions that have shaken up the field of cybersecurity  and will likely continue to woe over customers with employee verification systems and other cybersecurity offerings  Modern cybersecurity strategies are an extraordinarily hot market  if it plays its cards right  SailPoint shouldn t struggle to find business for years to come  With a steady hand at the wheel  the cybersecurity company may just excel and find itself at the top of the market  it just needs to carve out a healthy chunk for itself in a burgeoning industry  something it s already gotten a start on ",2017-11-21,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sailpoint-ipo-soars-as-investors-turn-to-cybersecurity-200267391,200267391
111631,333146,EFX,One Thing That Could Slow Facebook  FB  Stock Down In 2018,opinion,"There are only a few more weeks of trading left in 2017  and as investors start to close the book on another bullish year for the stock market  it is clear that technology behemoths have dominated Wall Street  Of these  one of the year s strongest stocks has been Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   
The market established Facebook as king of the social media world years ago  but in 2017  the Mark Zuckerberg led company took another step in establishing itself as a diversified leader in the tech sector  The stock is now widely regarded as a must own internet play  and recent investments seem poised to keep Facebook on the cutting edge for years to come 
Shares of this Silicon Valley giant have gained more than 55  year to date  Based on our current consensus estimates  we expect the company s fiscal 2017 to conclude with earnings growth of 37  and revenue growth of 45  
But it has not been entirely smooth sailing for Facebook in 2017  Indeed  the social media platform found itself embroiled in several of its fiercest public relations scandals on record including one that threatens to slow the red hot stock down in 2018 
Throughout the year  Facebook has been forced to answer questions related to the use of its website to spread disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle  As it turns out  a large part of Russia s concentrated efforts to interfere in the U S  election took place on public internet forums  and new findings suggest that many American Facebook users were subjected to the country s propaganda campaign 
On top of this  increased public scrutiny over data security  punctuated by the devastating Equifax   NYSE EFX   breach this year  has the entire internet industry rethinking how it protects its users  private information 
Facebook has already received criticism from lawmakers and the general public for its failure to properly vet content on its website  Now  the company is slated to increase spending on security and double down on its initiatives to prevent abuse 
 Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well   Zuckerberg said in Facebook s latest earnings release   But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don t bring people closer together  We re serious about preventing abuse on our platforms  We re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability  Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits  
Management would expand on this in its most recent earnings call  detailing plans to increase total expenses by 45  to 60  in 2018  While some of that new spending will go towards ongoing video content  augmented reality  and artificial intelligence projects  a sizeable chunk of it will be dedicated to security investments 
 We re doing a lot here with investments both in people and technology  Some of this is focused on finding bad actors and bad behavior  Some is focused on removing false news  hate speech  bullying  and other problematic content that we don t want in our community   Zuckerberg added 
 We already have about 10 000 people working on safety and security  and we re planning to double that to 20 000 in the next year to better enforce our Community Standards and review ads  
In short  the biggest thing weighing on Facebook shares in 2018 will be Wall Street grappling with the fact that the company will not be as profitable as it probably could be  Nevertheless  Facebook should still witness solid top and bottom line growth next year 
Based on our latest consensus estimates  Facebook is expected to post full year 2018 earnings of  6 55 per share and revenues of  53 90 billion  which would represent year over year growth rates of  12 48  and  34 16  from 2017 s projected totals 
How exactly will investors react to the company s increased spending  Only time will tell

111647,333162,EFX,Positive Start To The Q3 Earnings Season ,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      We are off to a good start to the Q3 earnings season despite the less than stellar banking results  with an accelerating revenue growth trend as particularly notable at this stage       Total earnings for the 52 S P 500 members that have reported already are up  13 3  from the same period last year on  6 9  higher revenues  with 76 9  beating EPS estimates and 73 1  beating revenue estimates      The growth pace and beats proportion was very strong in the Q2 earnings season relative to historical periods  but the aggregate picture emerging from the Q3 earnings season is keeping up with the preceding quarter s strong showing      There is plenty of momentum on the revenue side this earnings season  with the revenue growth pace accelerating and an above average proportion of companies beating top line estimates      Bank results have been underwhelming  with the growth pace modestly decelerating from the trend that we have been seeing in other recent quarters and fewer companies are coming out with positive revenue surprises      For the quarter as whole  total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  3  from the same period last year on  4 9  higher revenues  With double digit growth in each of the first two quarters of the year and earnings growth in the last quarter of the year currently expected at  9 1   the Q3 growth is on track to be the lowest this year      Including the Finance sector  Q3 earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Autos  Aerospace and Transportation sectors      Earnings growth for Q3 drops to  1 1   from  3   when the strong Energy sector contribution is excluded from the aggregate picture  The Conglomerates sector is the only other sector  in addition to Energy  with double digit earnings growth in Q3  The Tech and Industrial sectors are a shade below the  10  level        For full year 2017  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  7 1  on  4 6  higher revenues  which would follow  0 7  earnings growth on  2 2  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11 8  in 2018 and  9 2  in 2019       Earnings growth is expected to turn positive in Q3 for the small cap S P 600 index  with total earnings for the index expected to be up  8 3  from the same period last year on  5 2  higher revenues  This would follow persistent earnings declines for the small cap index   S P 600 earnings growth was negative in 3 of the last 4 quarters      Strong growth from the Finance  Technology and Energy sectors is driving the small cap growth  The Finance sector s role is particularly notable in the small cap index  with Q3 earnings growth dropping to  0 9   from  8 3   on an ex Finance basis We now have Q3 results from 52 S P 500 members that combined account for 16 7  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 52 index members are up  13 3  from the same period last year on  6 9  higher revenues  with 76 9  beating EPS estimates and 73 1  beating revenue estimates The comparison charts below compare the results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of 52 index members in other recent periods 

What these comparison charts shows are      The earnings growth rate   13 3   for these 52 index members is about in line with what we saw from the same group of companies in Q2 and the 4 quarter average 
     The Q3 revenue growth rate   6 9   represents an acceleration from all other periods in the chart
     The proportion of positive EPS beasts  76 9   is below the proportion we saw in Q2  but in line with the 4 quarter average    
     Revenue beats for these 52 index members at 73 1  is exactly the same as the preceding quarter  which itself was an unusually high revenue beat rate relative to historical periods The most notable element of the results thus far is the momentum on the revenue side  as the above points show  I am emphasizing this revenue momentum through modified comparison chart below 

While overall Q3 earnings growth represents a deceleration from the double digit growth pace of the last two quarters  the growth rate is expected ramp up in the current and coming quarters  with Q4 earnings growth currently expected at  9 1  Importantly  estimates for Q4 have inched up a bit since the Q3 results starting coming out  That s unusual and will most likely change in the coming days  but it nevertheless shows that estimates for the current period are nicely holding up  The chart below contrasts the Q3 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods 

Unlike the year over year growth pace  the dollar amount of total earnings is expected to remain in record territory  as the chart below shows 

Please note that the June quarter tally in the chart above was a new all time quarterly record for the S P 500 index  But the record isn t expected to last much longer  with each of the next two quarterly tallies surpassing the preceding period s record

111653,333168,EFX,Threats To Digital Wealth Point To Need For Tangible Backup,opinion,"By Stefan Gleason  Originally Published on Money Metals Exchange
Recent high profile cyber security breaches at Equifax  NYSE EFX  and other financial institutions highlight the perils of an all digital economy  When wealth can be evaporated or expropriated at the stroke of a key  how secure can your finances really be 
Obviously  there is a big difference between wealth you can tangibly hold and wealth that exists only in electronic form 
One advantage of paper cash is that it can t be hacked or stolen digitally  Paper money isn t by any means hard money like gold and silver  but it does at least provide some of the privacy and convenience features that come with tangible assets  That s why bankers and bureaucrats want to ultimately ban the use of paper Federal Reserve Notes and force all cash transactions to go online 
A recent story in the Wall Street Journal suggested   reducing the supply of cash in the U S  could help lower crime and make the Fed s job easier   Limiting our access to cash    to help monetary central planners do their job   somehow it didn t occur to the Founders to enshrine that principle into the Constitution 
Kenneth Rogoff  former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund  says eliminating  50 and  100 bills is necessary to reduce tax evasion and black market transactions 
According to Rogoff   Another advantage of eliminating large bills would be the effect on monetary policy  The Federal Reserve should be able to implement negative nominal interest rates vastly more effectively in the absence of large bills  which could prove quite important as a stimulative tool in the next financial crisis  
A negative interest rate policy is effectively a tax on holding cash in a bank  But the policy doesn t work so well when people can hold paper cash and thus escape the negative rate exaction 
The war on cash is proceeding in small steps  with lots of nudging from corporate America  Visa has launched a  Cashless Challenge  to incentivize small businesses to stop accepting paper currency   Visa is helping lead the cashless movement by working to reshape how people pay and get paid   the credit card giant boasts 
Meanwhile  digital crypto currencies such as Bitcoin continue to proliferate even as they risk being targeted by government regulators  Higher Bitcoin prices raise the incentives for hackers and cyber terrorists to try to break into and disrupt Bitcoin exchanges  As more capital flows into the underground asset class  governments become more interested in regulating or banning it  The banking system becomes more interested in combating or co opting it 
One of the banking establishment s biggest guns is JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon  He recently bashed Bitcoin as a  fraud   The manager of the world s largest hedge fund  Ray Dalio  unleashed similar language on the crypto currency 
The anti Bitcoin message sent by financial titans has undoubtedly been received by the U S  Treasury Department and Federal Reserve  U S  regulators have thus far taken a mostly hands off approach to cyber currency markets  But that could change at any time 
In September  China moved to ban crypto currency exchanges  Following China s crackdown  U S  politicians threatened a regulatory attack on Bitcoin as part of an economic sanctions package against North Korea 
Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey  D  said in a CNN interview   The only answer is to go to final sanctions on the North Koreans    The crypto currency Bitcoin  which they are using to supply funding to their economy   all of it should be shut off  
The advantage of  low tech  free market currencies such as gold and silver coins is that they cannot be shut down  They are completely off the electronic financial grid 
Precious metals could be subject to conventional regulatory attacks  to be sure  The U S  has a sad history of banning the private ownership of gold 
But in the era of digital currencies  online banking  and smartphone enabled day trading  physical gold coins aren t even a drop in the bucket  They re more like a drop in the ocean relative to the tens of trillions of dollars in wealth that could be seized digitally 
It s not a question of whether or not to participate in the digital economy at all  Almost all of us do to some extent  including whenever we use debit or credit cards   The question is whether or not or to be 100  reliant on digital finances without any grounding in tangible wealth 
We don t foresee a day when that will become safe or prudent  As long as we live in uncertain times  the timeless value of physical gold and silver should command a prominent place in your personal finances

111656,333171,EFX,Forget Spending Concerns  Buy Facebook  FB  After Earnings,opinion,"Shares of Facebook   NASDAQ FB   were down nearly 3  in morning trading Thursday as concerns over the company s plans to spend more cash outweighed its solid earnings results  Nevertheless  the social media stock s brief retreat from all time highs might actually present the perfect buying opportunity 
Facebook released its third quarter earnings report after the closing bell Wednesday  The company posted profits of  1 59 per share and revenues of  10 33 billion  beating our respective consensus estimates of  1 29 and  9 88 billion  These figures also represented year over year growth of 47 4  and 80 7   respectively 
In addition to strong top and bottom line expansion  Facebook once again reported impressive user growth  with daily active users surging roughly 16  to hit a staggering 1 37 billion  also read    
But despite this estimate crushing growth  investors seem to be concerned with the comments from the company s polarizing founder and CEO  Mark Zuckerberg 
 Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well   Zuckerberg said   But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don t bring people closer together  We re serious about preventing abuse on our platforms  We re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability  Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits  
Recently  Zuckerberg has emerged as the latest villain in the ongoing saga related to Russia s interference in the U S  election  As details chronicling the country s use of Facebook to spread disinformation during the campaign cycle have emerged  Zuckerberg and the rest of his executive team have scrambled to save face and take accountability for the content published on their platform 
On top of this  increased public scrutiny over data security  punctuated by the devastating Equifax   NYSE EFX   breach this year  has the entire internet industry rethinking how its protects its users  private information 
For Facebook  it appears the response is to double down on security  and the promise of new spending has investors fleeing this morning  But should they be 
In the wake of the company s earnings announcement  at least 13 brokerages have already raised their price targets on the stock  with a median target of  208 representing a 13 9  premium to Wednesday s record high close 
 Yes  we take foreign meddling in U S  elections very seriously  Call it what it is political warfare  And countering will and should raise the cost of doing business for FB  But that business is inherently extremely impressive   said RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney 
Mahaney s firm made the most bullish call on Facebook  raising its price target to  230 from  195  In a similar vein  Susquehanna Financial s Shyam Patil noted that Facebook has a history of outperforming 
 While the initial expense growth outlook for 2018 may have been more aggressive than anticipated  we would note that  Facebook  has a history of underspending guide  and we are currently well below the low end for expense growth in 2018   Patil wrote in a note 
For now  Facebook remains a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   While this ranking could change based on possible estimate revisions in the near future  investors should understand that Zuckerberg s plans to invest in security do not fundamentally change the remarkable growth story that his company has created 
This fiscal year has seen impressive top and bottom line growth  and we expect that to continue into fiscal 2018  In fact  our current consensus estimates are calling for earnings and revenue to swell by 21 8  and 31 1   respectively  next year

Brothers Inc   NYSE    NYSE TOL       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Q3 Earnings Season Kicks Off  4 Housing PicksThe current housing scenario doesn t seem all that rosy with housing data for the July August period showing dismal growth  Of late  the industry has been dealing with a shortage in inventory which is raising prices in several parts of the country Meanwhile  the devastating Harvey and Irma hurricanes created uncertainties for builders  This  along with higher labor  land and material costs has also been affecting the homebuilding industry Meanwhile  National Association of Realtors  NAR  has cut its 2017 forecast for existing home sales owing to a tepid spring selling season and the impact of hurricanes  The group now expects the sale of 5 44 million homes in 2017  down 0 2  from 5 45 million in 2016 and well below 5 52 million expected earlier What Do the Numbers Say Existing home sales  which make up a larger part of all the U S  real estate activity  fell to a one year low in August  down 1 7    per the latest report by NAR  This marked the fourth decline in five months  bringing down the annual rate to the lowest level in 12 months  Housing starts dropped 0 8  sequentially in August  In July  existing home sales slipped 1 3  from the previous quarter while housing starts dropped 4 8  sequentially It is important to note that on a year over year basis  housing starts were 1 4  higher in August  Single family starts were even stronger  growing 17 1  from a year ago  Meanwhile  building permits  another economic indicator of the health of the housing sector  increased 5 7  sequentially and 8 3  year over year Is Declining Data a Matter of Concern It is important to note here that the  has managed to outperform the broader market  S P 500  in the third quarter of 2017 despite the recent dampeners  The industry gained 6 2   compared with the S P 500 index s 3 8  increase  Notably  the homebuilding industry ranks among the top 25  of all Zacks industries In spite of the lackluster monthly figures  the housing industry seems to be still going strong on a healthy economy  solid job market and affordable mortgage rates The U S  economy grew 3 1  in the second quarter  showing a significant jump from 1 2  growth in the first quarter  Along with strong economic growth  the labor market helped the industry to maintain its stature Although the unemployment rate was weak in September in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey and Irma  economists are expecting the numbers to rebound in the coming months and the economy to continue growing  Average hourly wages rose 2 9  from a year ago  Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides the basis for stronger demand  Along with this  solid homebuilder confidence raises optimism for the entire housing industry  Although the index dipped 3 points in September from August  it remained at a confident level of 64 points  according to the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  Housing Market Index report  Notably  the index has remained above 60 since September 2016 Thus  though the homebuilding industry might face some bottlenecks in the short term  the overall picture is pretty compelling Q3 So Far and Expectations for 2017The Q3 earnings season has already seen releases from 26 S P 500 members  For the quarter as whole  total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up 1 2  from the same period last year on 5 1  higher revenues  With expectations of double digit earnings growth in each of the first two quarters and high single digit growth in the concluding quarter of the year  Q3 is anticipated to see the lowest growth The Q3 earnings season has so far seen releases from 15 4  of the construction companies in the S P 500 cohort  According to the latest   100  of the companies have surpassed earnings estimates while 50  beat revenue expectations  Total earnings at these construction companies increased 7  on 12 2  higher revenues For 2017  total earnings for the broader construction sector are expected to increase 14 2  and revenues are expected to increase 9 1  Offsetting the recent adversities  homebuilders like KB Home  NYSE       and Lennar Corporation  NYSE       reported stellar third quarter results  KB Home s earnings and revenues grew 21 4  and 25 3  year over year  respectively  on strong demand and favorable industry fundamentals The company

NowFollowing supply glut and lackluster global demand  oil prices remained low for more than three years  Since late 2014  crude oil went from over  90 a barrel to under  30  However  the market has recovered from their historic lows with prices finally rebounding to the  50 a barrel threshold mark  The improving commodity pricing environment looks somewhat sustainable on tightening supplies  improving demand outlook and OPEC deal extension talks However  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation have stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more  Per Energy Information Administration s   EIA   latest inventory release  U S  production rose 88 500 barrels a day in September The overall picture for the sector seems rather optimistic  The latest weekly release from Baker Hughes shows positive signs for the oversupplied oil market  wherein it reported a fall in oil and natural gas rig count in the United States  The total U S  rig count fell by 4 to 936  for the week ended Oct 6  The rig count fell fourth time in the last five weeks as the energy companies reduce their spending Investors have also pinned hopes of recovery over the recent U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles   pointing to a slowdown in shale output  The latest report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 29  following a decrease of 1 8 million barrels in the previous week  U S  crude oil plus products comparative inventories have declined 120 million barrels in 26 of the last 32 weeks  Improving domestic demand scenario and increased crude oil exports support the data  Adding to the positive momentum  OPEC and fellow exporters also announced plans to remain open to extend their production cut agreement beyond March  Some cartel members including less compliant nations like Iraq have also signaled another around of supply cuts Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for the year  helping to tighten the market significantly All these factors point toward the growing stability of the oil industry for the remainder of 2017  along with growth prospects in 2018 What We BelieveWith a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns  It is not easy to be sure about such outperformers  This is

111705,333220,EFX,4 Key Upstream Energy Stocks To Buy Under  10 Now,opinion,"Following supply glut and lackluster global demand  oil prices remained low for more than three years  Since late 2014  crude oil went from over  90 a barrel to under  30  However  the market has recovered from their historic lows with prices finally rebounding to the  50 a barrel threshold mark  The improving commodity pricing environment looks somewhat sustainable on tightening supplies  improving demand outlook and OPEC deal extension talks 
However  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation have stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more  Per Energy Information Administration s   EIA   latest inventory release  U S  production rose 88 500 barrels a day in September 
The overall picture for the sector seems rather optimistic  
The latest weekly release from Baker Hughes shows positive signs for the oversupplied oil market  wherein it reported a fall in oil and natural gas rig count in the United States  The total U S  rig count fell by 4 to 936  for the week ended Oct 6  The rig count fell fourth time in the last five weeks as the energy companies reduce their spending 
Investors have also pinned hopes of recovery over the recent U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles   pointing to a slowdown in shale output  The latest report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 29  following a decrease of 1 8 million barrels in the previous week  
U S  crude oil plus products comparative inventories have declined 120 million barrels in 26 of the last 32 weeks  Improving domestic demand scenario and increased crude oil exports support the data  
Adding to the positive momentum  OPEC and fellow exporters also announced plans to remain open to extend their production cut agreement beyond March  Some cartel members including less compliant nations like Iraq have also signaled another around of supply cuts 
Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for the year  helping to tighten the market significantly 
All these factors point toward the growing stability of the oil industry for the remainder of 2017  along with growth prospects in 2018

111706,333221,EFX,Facebook s Sandberg Backs Russian Ad Details Disclosure,opinion,"Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   COO Sheryl Sandberg in a sit down interview with news site Axios has expressed anger over how Facebook was  by Russian factors to meddle with the 2016 elections and said that Facebook  owes an apology  to America 
Reportedly  Sandberg further stated that Facebook is now more  determined  to prevent a recurrence in the future and in favor of making the Russian linked ad details public  However  she did not say when the company will do so 
However  she refrained from answering questions  which required an  if there was any  overlap in targeting between Trump s campaign and fake accounts on Facebook  Facebook  Inc  Price

   
Last month  Facebook revealed that it had identified Russian accounts spending nearly  100 000 in ads  over 3K   which coincided with the U S  election  from June 2015 to May 2017   This caused a massive uproar and now the government machinery wants to impose stricter regulation on these social media companies 
These ads were mostly targeted at divisions on grounds of politics and social norms and often touched upon sensitive topics like immigration and racial issues  gun rights as well as LGBT matters  Facebook added that about 10 million users have watched the Russia backed ads 
Facebook furnished extensive records on Russian ad spending during U S  Presidential elections to special counsel  Robert Mueller and subsequently to the Congress 
Sandberg s interview is the first of its kind by a top level Facebook executive since the fiasco 
Not just Facebook  even Twitter   NYSE TWTR   and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  are also in the eye of the storm since the elections for dissemination of fake news that allegedly influenced elections  Twitter also revealed that it had found over 200 accounts related to Russian factors bot network 
These companies are battling extensive PR damage  Moreover  pressure from governments of various countries including France  Germany  which goes into election a few days from now  and Britain to curb the spread of fake ads news and extremist activities on their platforms is mounting 
The interview comes right before the House hearing where executives from Facebook  Twitter and Google are expected to testify  per media reports

111707,333222,EFX,Valeant Reports Positive Results On Psoriasis Drug Siliq ,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc    NYSE VRX   announced that one of its divisions  Ortho Dermatologics  announced results from the long term phase III extension study  AMAGINE 2 
The study demonstrated that Siliq injection provided sustained high levels of skin clearance  PASI 100  over more than two years in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis 
The results from a phase III multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study  AMAGINE 1  which evaluated the efficacy of brodalumab in a subset of patients with prior exposure to ustekinumab  demonstrated that Siliq was similarly efficacious with improved skin clearance in patients both with and without prior ustekinumab exposure 
We note that Siliq is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and have failed to respond or have lost response to other systemic therapies  
The drug was approved in February   However  weakness in the dermatology segment persists and is expected to impact the top line 
Valeant entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN   granting the former an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Siliq globally  except in Japan and certain other Asian countries where the rights are held by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co   Ltd   The agreement was amended in July 2016 to entitle Valeant the right to develop and commercialize brodalumab in Europe 

Valeant s stock has lost 7 2  in the year so far compared to gain of 1 4  for the  
Once an acquisition giant  Valeant has been caught up in various controversies since October 2015  Following a substantial decline in Valeant s share price in the first quarter of 2016  Bill Ackman and Steve Fraidin joined the board in March 2016 as part of Pershing Square s effort to stabilize the company  Thereafter  Joseph C  Papa took charge as the new CEO  The new management took various efforts to turnaround the company 
Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process but the company s efforts to sell non core assets and lower debt is commendable  The divestiture of non core assets is expected to help the company streamline its product portfolio and focus on core areas of dermatology and lower debt 
Although the approval of new drugs brings some hope  we believe it is still a long road ahead for Valeant before investors faith can be restored in the stock  Earlier in the year  Bill Ackman  chairman of Perishing Square  NYSE SQ  Holdings  Ltd stated that investing in Valeant was a big mistake on his part 
Zacks Rank   Key Picks
Valeant currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Some better ranked stocks in the health care sector are ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ACAD   and Celgene Corp    NASDAQ CELG    Both carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Celgene s earnings estimates for both 2017 and 2018 have inched up 0 7  in the past 90 days  The stock has rallied 18 4  this year  outperforming the industry

111710,333225,EFX,Will Harvey Mar United Continental s  UAL  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   is scheduled to report its third quarter earnings on Oct 18  after market closes  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 10   Moreover  the bottom line improved 5 36  on a year over year basis backed by operating revenue growth of 6 43   However  this Chicago based carrier is likely to face turbulence in the third quarter  Evidently  multiple headwinds including the back to back hurricanes have hurt the entire space  Hurricane Harvey has hurt United Continental the most as Houston is the carrier s second largest hub  The negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings has decreased 15  over the last 30 days Consequently  the stock has struggled so far this year underperforming the Zacks  on a year to date basis  Shares of United Continental have declined 8   as against the industry s rally of 16 4  
Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact United Continental s third quarter results 
More than 7 400 flights were cancelled at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport  IAH   with operations suspended at the airport due to the unprecedented storm for more than four days due to Harvey 
The carrier now anticipates third quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  to decrease between 3 5  and 4  on a year over year basis  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter PRASM is pegged at 12 67 cents  much lower than 12 78 cents reported in the second quarter of 2017  Pre tax margin for the third quarter is projected between 10  and 10 5  
Increased costs  fuel and labor  are expected to hurt the bottom line  Fuel price is forecasted to be  1 70 per gallon  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62  Cost per available seat miles  excluding fuel  profit sharing  third party business expenses and other special items are estimated to vary between 2 5  and 3   The company anticipates capacity to increase 3  year over year 
Apart from United Continental other carriers like Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   and American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   are also likely to be hurt by the natural calamities 
What Does Our Model Say 
Our proven model too does not show conclusively that United Continental will beat earnings in third quarter 2017  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case as highlighted below 
Zacks ESP  United Continental has an Earnings ESP of  2 69  as both the Most Accurate estimate is 5 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 87 per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  United Continental s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  acts as a spoiler  The bearish rank  combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision 
A Transportation Gem
With United Continental likely to disappoint  investors interested in the airline space may consider Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA   as our model shows that this company possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its upcoming release 
Hawaiian Holdings has an Earnings ESP of  0 19  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company will report third quarter results on Oct 19  You can see

Zacks Consensus Estimate  Including previously disclosed mortgage related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share  earnings came in at 84 cents per share  comparing unfavorably with the prior year quarter s earnings of  1 03 per share Though rise in rates provided some respite  lower revenues aided by a fall in non interest income were recorded  Moreover  expenses soared  Further  reduction in loans acted as headwind for the quarter  Though the bank s commercial portfolio improved  consumer loans disappointed  Improvement in credit quality and steady capital deployment activities were experienced Third quarter net income came in at  4 6 billion  down from  5 6 billion recorded in the prior year quarter  Results included  1 billion worth of discrete litigation accrual The quarter s total revenues were  21 9 billion  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior year quarter figure of  22 3 billion Furthermore  on a year over year basis  revenue generation at the business segments was mixed  Community Banking and Wholesale Banking segments  total quarterly revenue decreased around 2 4  and 1   respectively  while Wealth and Investment Management revenues increased around 2 4  Loans Fall  Interest Income Rise  Costs EscalateWells Fargo s net interest income in the quarter came in at  12 5 billion  up 4  on a year over year basis  Increased interest income from trading assets  investment securities  loans held for sale and mortgages held for sale  along with higher other interest income  mainly drove results  Further  net interest margin expanded 5 basis points  bps  year over year to 2 87   reflecting the rising interest rate environment Non interest income at Wells Fargo came in at around  9 5 billion  down 9  year over year  primarily due to low mortgage banking revenues  lower net gains from trading activities and reduced service charges on deposit accounts As of Sep 30  2017  total loans were  951 9 billion  down around 1  year over year  Reduction in its consumer loan portfolio was recorded  partially offset by growth in commercial loans  Total deposits were  1 3 trillion  in line with the prior year quarter Non interest expense at Wells Fargo was  14 4 billion  up 8  from the year ago quarter  The upsurge in expenses primarily stemmed from rise in almost all components of expenses  Nonetheless  Wells Fargo remains committed to achieve expense reductions of  4 billion by the end of 2019 The company s efficiency ratio of 65 5  was above 59 4  recorded in the year ago quarter  A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a fall in profitability Credit Quality ImprovedWells Fargo s credit quality metrics improved in the quarter  Allowance for credit losses  including the allowance for unfunded commitments  totaled  12 1 billion as of Sep 30  2017  down 4 7  year over year Provision for credit losses was  717 million  declining 11  year over year  Net charge offs were  717 million

quarter Book value per share advanced to  36 96 from  35 81 recorded in the comparable period last year Our ViewpointWells Fargo reported a disappointing quarter  Top line headwinds  aided by lower non interest income  persist  Further  escalating expenses remained a major drag  along with slowdown in mortgage business  However  improved credit quality was a positive This banking giant has been much in the news following the sales scam that came into light in September 2016  The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in its auto insurance business and online bill pay services  Wells Fargo s chief executive officer   Timothy Sloan   apologized for causing its customers trouble and promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come We believe  over the long term  investors will not be disappointed with their investment in Wells Fargo  given its diverse geographic and business mix  which enables it to sustain consistent earnings growth  We also believe strategic acquisitions and the bank s efforts to address current adversities will help the company expand its business and enhance profitability  Wells Fargo   Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Currently  Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Among other major banks

 driven mainly by improved credit card loans  and elevated interest rates supported net interest income  In addition  rise in advisory fees supported the top line growth  A slight fall in operating

At the top of the list of names in the group  I see two Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  The first name on the list is P A M  Transportation  PTSI    This is a very small cap stock that is very thinly traded with average daily volume of roughly 15 000 shares   Despite the lack of trading  PTSI has been a solid performer of late  as the stock has moved higher by around 40  in the last month 
PTSI has a value style score of A and a growth style score of D   Normally I am all about the growth and a D would turn me off  but this stock is in a hot space so that makes it worth a closer look 
The next name on the list is a lot bigger and much more liquid   Werner Enterprises  WERN  is also a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports a value style score of B and a growth style score of A   At  2 3B in market cap  it is much bigger than PTSI  
WERN  saw a steep sell off at the open  but over the last month or so  the stock is up just 3 8    WERN has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate rise of late  The estimate stood at  1 13 90 days ago and has since moved higher to  1 24   The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate also moved higher over the same time period  from  1 41 to  1 51 
 Werner Enterprises  Inc  Price and Consensus    
A Bunch Of  2 s
As I scan down the list of the trucking stocks  I see 5 stocks with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and most of them are of decent size  Of the  2 s  I like Old Dominion  ODFL  as it has a growth style score of B
Other tickers with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  in the industry include ARCB  HTLD  LSTR and ULH 
A  3 With A Great Chart
In looking at all the stocks in the group I could not pass up the chance to highlight this stock that is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold    It has a wonderful chart and is certainly worth a deeper look   Covenant Transport Group  CVTI  has a chart that dreams are made of   The most recent quarter was a meet  but the one before that was a solid beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   
CVTI is slated to report earnings next week and you know that I will be watching it Covenant Transportation Group  Inc  Price

111785,333300,EFX,Snapchat Continues To Enjoy The Support Of Teens Per Survey,opinion,Snap Inc  s   NYSE SNAP   messaging application Snapchat is the most preferred social networking medium among teens  per Piper Jaffray s 34th semi annual survey Reportedly  47  of the respondents  with average age of 16 years  said that they prefer using Snapchat compared with 12  respondents in the fall 2016 survey Snapchat was followed by Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   photo sharing app Instagram  which enjoyed the support of 24  of the respondents while the main social networking platform had 9   Twitter   NYSE TWTR   and Pinterest finished at the fourth and fifth spots  respectively with merely 7  and 1  votes in the survey However  the company doesn t enjoy a  unique user base  as 90  of the users also use Instagram  per the survey Notably  shares of Snap have lost 32 4  of its value since its listing date of Mar 2  2017 against 12 1  growth of its  User EngagementIn the last reported quarter  the company recorded 173 million daily active users  DAUs   which increased 21  year over year  driven by growth in North America and European markets Notably  in the second quarter  the company s average revenue per user  ARPU  in North America was  1 97  almost 88  higher than the global average of  1 05 Per a recent report by Axios  Snap witnessed a  in user engagement since it unveiled its location based Map feature in June 2017  This bodes well for the company as user growth holds the key to attracting advertisers  which is the primary source of revenues for Snap Snap projects users to send over a trillion Snaps this year or nearly 3 billion daily  The company believes that Snapchat users visit the application 20 times a day and spend over 30 minutes daily Per eMarketer  this year  Snapchat s domestic user base is likely to increase 25 8  to 79 2 million driven by a 19 2  increase in users in the 18 to 24 age group  In fact  for the first time  Snapchat is projected to have the highest teen audience  12 to 17   18 to 24 cohorts  compared to both Facebook and Instagram  per eMarketer However  the market research firm has once again slashed the 2017 U S ad revenue estimates for Snap from the earlier estimate of  770 million to  642 5 million  In March this year  the research firm had slashed the domestic ad revenue forecast from  805 million to  770 million  On a worldwide basis  Snap s revenues are now projected to be  774 1 million  down from the earlier projection of  900 million Snap Inc  Price   Facebook   A Big ThreatCompetition from Facebook poses a serious threat to the company  Facebook has started to mimic Snapchat features on its platforms to boost user growth and engagement levels and has also succeeded in making these more popular than Snapchat Instagram has seen terrific success and now has over 800 million users  Moreover  Instagram Stories  an unabashed copy of Snapchat s feature of the same name  has more than 250 million DAUs While eMarketer anticipates a 3 4  decline in Facebook s monthly average user base for the 12 to 17 age group this year  Instagram users in the same age group are projected to increase 8 8  Further  eMarketer anticipates Instagram to continue its lead over Snapchat in the next few years with domestic revenues touching  3 billion in 2017  By 2019  Snapchat is projected to earn  2 billion in domestic ad revenues while Instagram is expected to earn more than thrice the amount Further  per Piper Jaffray s survey  nearly 60  of the teens voted Instagram as a better advertising platform while 45  voted for Snapchat  In fact  the respondents chose email over Snapchat for approaching them with advertisements Although Snap is undertaking a lot of initiatives to woo users and advertisers to its platform  the company s lack of popularity in the international quarters and its sole focus on under 30 users are the main concerns  We believe Snapchat needs to focus more on the global market and target other age groups in order to stay ahead in the competition Zacks Rank and a Key PickSnap has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A better ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Yelp Inc

results  Only about 1  of the companies from the Finance sector have reported so far  marking 13 5  earnings growth on 14  higher revenues per our    However  a soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector s third quarter results  Per our Earnings Outlook  earnings are estimated to decline 45 1  on 0 7  lower revenues Being integral to the insurance industry  property and casualty insurers have suffered the wrath of a slew of catastrophes  Spells of tropical storms and tremors have rocked the operational performance of non life insurers for the third

catastrophe environment  will help companies meet insurance claims   Underwriting profitability of insurers will be affected by deterioration in combined ratio due to catastrophe losses incurred  This in turn will drag the companies  bottom line   Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results  insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to withstand the loss to some extent Amid bad news  there are reasons for insurers to fall back on for cushion  Though the Fed hadn t approved the rate hike at the last September meet  the interest rate

111817,333332,EFX,Rite Aid Stock Down 80  This Year  Is Amazon The Only Threat ,opinion,A lot has been going on with drugstore chain retailer Rite Aid Corporation   NYSE RAD    which has lost a whopping 80  this year  much wider than the  s decline of 12 5   In fact  the stock has plunged nearly 21  over the past week  on speculations of Amazon com Inc  s   NASDAQ AMZN   entry in the drugstore business After Amazon s takeover of Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM    a move that has kept grocery retailers on their toes   it looks like the online giant is now eyeing the drugstore industry  Though the news hasn t been confirmed by Amazon  various media reports suggest that the e commerce king is undertaking several steps to enter the prescription drug distribution space  Per the reports  Amazon is in talks with pharmacy benefit managers and various talented personnel to analyze the drugstore trends to foray into the market However  Amazon s expansion strategy is just one of the reasons behind Rite Aid s debacle  Let s take a look at the other reasons for which this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has lost ground Merger Fallout With WalgreensRite Aid suffered a huge setback in June  when its merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc    NASDAQ WBA   was terminated for failing to get the Federal Trade Commission s  FTC  nod after two years of investigation  Thereafter  Walgreens agreed upon a fresh bargain to buy 2 186 Rite Aid stores  associated distribution assets and inventory  for  5 175 billion as well as termination charges of  325 million  However  this contract was also amended recently  to Walgreens agreeing to buy 1 932 Rite Aid stores  three distribution centers and related inventory in an all cash deal  The former will now pay  4 375 billion for the deal  While this proposal finally won the FTC s clearance last month  the string of all these events weighed upon investors  sentiment Unfavorable Reimbursement Rates Dent MarginsRite Aid has been battling unfavorable reimbursement rates for a while now  Evidently  lower pharmacy reimbursement rates dented the company s Retail Pharmacy gross profit  which in turn hurt Rite Aid s adjusted EBITDA in the first two quarters of fiscal 2018  Well  Rite Aid s adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 100 and 110 bps in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018  respectively  Nevertheless  termination charges of  325 million received from Walgreens partly cushioned Rite Aid s operating results in the second quarter  However  management expects reimbursement rates to continue to pressurize pharmacy margins in the second half of the fiscal Unimpressive Surprise History  Dismal Q2 PerformanceRite Aid s earnings surprise history is not very impressive  The company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20 8  in the trailing four quarters  including two quarters of negative earnings surprise  Though the company s bottom line matched the Zacks consensus mark in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  the company reported a loss of 1 cent as against the year ago period earnings of 3 cents per share  Additionally  the top line remained soft  with same store sales declining on account of lower pharmacy and front end sales  Apart from these factors  Rite Aid s second quarter debacle could be attributable to the impact of the merger ditch as well as the reduced reimbursement rates  as discussed above Any Positive Signals Ahead While the final pact with Walgreens will reduce Rite Aid s core business  it is likely to lower Rite Aid s debt position and improve its financial leverage and balance sheet  Management stated that it intends to use the funds from this deal to repay roughly  270 million worth of net liabilities associated with the divested assets  nearly  100 million of restructuring expenses and transaction fees and  85 million as income tax  Moreover  Rite Aid will continue to operate its pharmacy benefit manager   EnvisionRX  RediClinic and Health Dialog Thus  the latest contract should make Rite Aid a smaller  but stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates  However  management chose not to provide any guidance until it gets any clarity on the timing of its planned store divestitures  So for now  we prefer to remain on the sidelines Still Want Exposure in the Drugstore Segment Investors can count on Diplomat Pharmacy  Inc    NYSE DPLO    which has delivered back to back positive earnings surprises in the past two quarters  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 4

expectations  However  the stock declined after the company s operating expenses declined about 2  and the cost of credit increased 15  due to global consumer banking as well as high credit reserve

Economists commented that only a few Americans applied for unemployment benefits in this period as business resumed in Texas and Florida  with more people resuming work  post the recent carnage by two destructive hurricanes Moreover  initial claims in Puerto Rico were also lower not because of people going back to work but due to the absence of electricity after the island was ravaged by Hurricane Maria  Consequently  people could not file claims from the island nor could the claims be processed  As a result  the analysts expect such claims to show up in the coming weeks Meanwhile  the Core PPI for the month of September increased by 0 4   up from 0 1  in August  The consensus estimate for the period was 0 2   However  PPI for September increased by 0 4   in line with the consensus estimate

wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Domtar Corporation   TO UFS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a

Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in

it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Domtar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Domtar s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Domtar has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 7  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Domtar has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Domtar currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Domtar a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 4  which is far better than the industry average of 7  Clearly  UFS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Domtar might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives UFS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen no upward and three downward movements in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Domtar Corporation Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near termBottom LineDomtar is

111844,333359,EFX,Can International Paper  IP  Prove To Be Suitable Value Pick  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put International Paper Inc    NYSE IP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  International Paper has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually

International Paper is just 1 8 a level that is lower than the industry average of 21  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  IP is a

111848,333363,EFX,Reasons Why Sysco  SYY  Can Be A Great Pick For Investors,opinion,"The food industry s performance has been dismal for quite some time now due to the prevailing pricing and competitive pressure  Evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms have been plaguing the industry  A shift in consumer preference toward non genetically modified  organic  and gluten free products is also hurting business  The acquisition of Whole Foods by online giant Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  has further made competitors skeptical and raised concerns 
Despite industry wide issues  Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY   has been on a growth trajectory over the last few months  We believe Sysco s impressive earnings history and solid growth strategies are making the stock a viable bet  Let s delve deeper and try to find out what s taking this food company higher 
Why Invest in Sysco 
Favorable Rank and VGM Score  Sysco  with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  flaunts a VGM Score of A  which makes it a favorable investing option  You can see   
We note that the  is a comprehensive tool that will allow investors to filter through the standard scoring system and choose better winning stocks  In order to screen out potential winning stocks  we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 and a VGM Score of A or B 
Share Price Performance  Sysco has exhibited a bullish run in the past six months gaining roughly 4 6  as against the  s decline of 7 4   The industry is currently placed at the top 35  of the 265 Zacks Classified industries  The stock also exceeded the Consumer Staples sector  which gained only 3 8  in the said time frame 
 

 
Further  we believe there is still much momentum left in the stock  which is quite evident from its low beta of 0 52 and a long term earnings growth rate of 8 4  
Rising Estimates  Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the stock over the last 60 days with estimates moving up  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at 73 cents  up from 72 cents per share in the said time frame  Similarly for fiscal 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased from  2 75 per share to  2 77  over the same time frame 
Impressive Earnings History  Sysco delivered positive earnings surprises in six of the past seven quarters  with in line results in one  Acquisition and margin improvement has been driving the company s earnings  We note that Sysco has been consistently witnessing an improvement in sales  driven by acquisitions and volume growth  The buyouts of London based Brakes Group and Supplies on the Fly e commerce platform are encouraging  Sysco s acquisition of London based Brakes Group in July 2016 has benefited the company significantly  In fiscal 2017  Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in UK and it recorded earnings of 14 cents per share  exceeding its EPS estimates  Brakes is also making good progress in its supply chain transformational efforts  which is helping them to be efficient and will ultimately improve overall service and reduce costs Sysco Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
     
Improving Margins  Sysco has been impressively managing expenses since the past few years and is making progress in both SG A and supply chain  which is reflected in higher operating income growth 
Further  Sysco delivered positive gross margins in the last nine quarters  after declining consistently since the last two fiscal  Modest inflation will also lead to margin improvement  Sysco was under deflationary pressure for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters  and the trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation from the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Meat prices are abating  and dairy and produce prices have also begun to rise 
Valuation Multiples  If we look into the company s P E and P S multiples  we note that the company generally trades below its industry average 
Sysco has a forward PE ratio of 19 6  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 is 22 5  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified industry s PE ratio  which is pegged at 20 3  This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers

111862,333377,EFX,Why An Earnings Beat Is Likely For Schwab  SCHW  In Q3 ,opinion,The Charles Schwab Corporation   NYSE SCHW   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results on Oct 16  before the market opens  Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year Last quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenue growth  lower level of fee waivers and no provisions were among the positives  However  higher expenses and a decline in trading revenues remained headwinds The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history  Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 2 1  However  activities of Schwab during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s earnings remained stable at 41 cents  Nevertheless  it reflects a year over year improvement of 19 6  Additionally  the company s revenues for the to be reported quarter are projected to be  2 19 billion  The figure is expected to witness growth of 14 2  year over year Schwab s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 40 9  in a year s time  outperforming the 38 2  growth for the  it belongs to The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Will the stock s rally continue post third quarter earnings release  Let s see how things are shaping up A Positive Surprise in Store According to our quantitative model  chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to be reported quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Schwab is  0 20  Zacks Rank  Schwab currently carries a Zacks Rank 3  which when combined with a positive ESP  increases the chances of an earnings beat Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsGrowth in Trading Revenue to Remain Muted  Owing to an unchanged monetary policy standpoint of the Fed  most part of the third quarter did not witness much volatility  Moreover  overall trading activities remained sluggish in the quarter in the absence of any tangible development on the reforms proposed by the Trump administration  However  Schwab opened 107 000 and 123 000 new brokerage accounts in July and August 2017  respectively  indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market  Moreover  the company s efforts to lower trading fees should have also helped add more brokerage accounts  Thus  the overall slump in trading revenues should not have affected Schwab much  Its trading revenues are expected to remain more or less stable Asset Growth Should Boost Net Interest Revenue  Schwab witnessed a rise in average interest earning assets in July and August on a year over year basis  This should get reflected in the company s results for the quarter as well  Hence  higher assets  along with improvement in the rate scenario  should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter Decline in Fee Waivers  Following the rate hikes in December 2016 and March 2017  Schwab witnessed a 98  year over year decline in its fee waivers in the second quarter  which helped the company  earn more  Moreover  we believe that following the latest rate hike in June  the company should have been able to waive off all of its fees  This should further boost its top line growth in the to be reported quarter Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider  as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  according to our model Comerica Incorporated   NYSE CMA   is slated to release results on Oct 17  It has an Earnings ESP of  0 23  and

111866,333381,EFX,Is AK Steel A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AK Steel Holding Corporation   NYSE AKS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AK Steel has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  AK Steel s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AK Steel has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 8  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AK Steel has a P S ratio of about 0 3  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  AKS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AK Steel currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AK Steel a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  a great indicator of value  comes in at 4 7  which is far better than the industry average of 6 9  Clearly  AKS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though AK Steel might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F  This gives AKS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen two up and five down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 25  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 11 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AK Steel Holding Corporation Price and Consensus    The stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAK Steel is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 29  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax  NYSE EFX  Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a

111894,333409,EFX,Equifax  EFX  Tanks As Reports Claim Another Cyber Attack,opinion,Shares of Equifax Inc    NYSE EFX   fell yesterday after the website   Ars Technica   reported that the credit information provider may have been subject to another cyber attack  Per Ars Technica  Randy Abrams  an independent security analyst  discovered that the company s web site is prompting to install Adobe s   NASDAQ ADBE   Flash updates which has been found containing malware Following the above discussed report  the company s shares were seen tumbling around 3  during mid day on Thursday  However  later in the day  the stock recovered almost half of the loss  after Equifax announced that it is not subject to any another cyber attack and its systems have not been compromised Equifax s spokesmen Wyatt Jefferies said that the company was  aware of the situation identified on the Equifax com Web site in the credit report assistance link   He further added   Our IT and security teams are looking into this matter  and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline  The company in a statement noted that   The issue involves a third party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data  and that vendor s code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content   Equifax further stated that the vendor s code has been removed from its webpage and it is conducting further analysis on this matter Notably  the brand image and creditability of Equifax has already been in question ever since the company announced last month that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database Since then  Equifax has been facing huge customer criticism  while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach  Moreover  with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap  its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon Shares of Equifax have lost approximately 24  of its value from the Sep 7 closing price  In the year to date period  the company has lost 8   significantly underperforming the  to which it belongs to  which has recorded growth of 31 7  Investors seem concerned that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients  It is feared that this will have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance in the near term Sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax s data breach case makes it one of the worst cases in recent times  The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts  applying for credit cards or loans  buying insurance  renting an apartment or even for tax frauds It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States  three main consumer credit reporting agencies   Equifax  TransUnion   NYSE TRU   and Experian  Therefore  with access to social security  driver s license and credit card numbers  criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for longer periods of time Hence  we believe investors  concerns are justified as the mishap will have a lasting impact on Equifax s results  in the form of financial costs relating to settlement of lawsuits and litigation expenses  Moreover  it will be very tough for the company to repair its brand image  as well as retain the current customer base Currently  Equifax carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  A better ranked stock in the same industry is Fidelity National Information Services  Inc    NYSE FIS   which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  The stock has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 12  4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans  But which stocks are the best buy candidates right now  And what does the future hold for the cybersecurity industry Equifax is just the most recent victim  Computer hacking and identity theft are more common than ever  Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to inform Zacks com readers about this  170 billion year space  More importantly  it highlights 4 cybersecurity picks with strong profit potential ,2017-10-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/equifax-efx-tanks-as-reports-claim-another-cyber-attack-200218710,200218710
111897,333412,EFX,Will Trading Weakness Impact Goldman s  GS  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Expected slump in trading business is likely to adversely affect The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  s   NYSE GS   third quarter earnings  to be reported on Oct 17  Moreover  the bank is anticipated to record year over year decline in earnings and revenues Goldman s second quarter 2017 results recorded a positive earnings surprise of 17 6   driven by higher equities revenues and low expenses  However  lower fixed income revenues thwarted the bottom line  Notably  the quarter witnessed challenging market making environment  reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels This earnings beat translated into impressive price movement for the company  During the three month period ended Sep 30  shares of Goldman gained 6 9  Will the upswing in stock price continue post third quarter earnings release  It majorly depends on whether the firm is able to beat on earnings this time  Notably  Goldman recorded positive earnings surprise in three of the last four trailing quarters as depicted below Goldman Sachs Group  Inc   The  Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn t call for an earnings beat this time around  A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold    for increasing the odds of an earnings beat Unfortunately  this is not the case here  as elaborated below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at  4 31  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Goldman s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsMarket Volatility  Being an investment bank  Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility  Therefore  the company is likely to be affected by the subdued volatility experienced during the quarter Top line Pressure  Reduction in equity issuance and feeble equity trading volumes are expected to negatively influence fee revenue growth this time around  Nevertheless  persistent rise in debt underwriting  mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates  will likely provide some respite  Though continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support the bottom line numbers  Goldman might remain under pressure due to lackluster fixed income trading activities on low volatility during the to be reported quarter Per the Thomson Reuters data  the total deal value of announced M As globally increased during the quarter  Notably  in the third quarter  Goldman acted as an advisor and helped closed M A deals worth over  300 billion  Therefore  M A advisory fees for the bank are expected to lend support to revenues Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at  7 64 billion  down 6 5  year over year Rise in Net Interest Income  In addition to elevated interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending   particularly  in the areas of commercial and industrial  as well as consumer   might perk up interest income Strong Expense Management  Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run rate expense savings of around  1 6 billion in 2016  The bank is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities  Thus  continuation of expense management is likely to aid bottom line expansion in the coming quarters Notably  this banking giant s performance was inadequate to win analysts  confidence during the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased slightly to  4 31  over the last seven days Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Comerica Incorporated   NYSE CMA   is slated to release results on Oct 17  The company has an

111899,333414,EFX,Should Value Investors Pick Tahoe Resources  TAHO  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tahoe Resources Inc    NYSE TAHO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tahoe Resources has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 8  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Tahoe Resources  current PE ratio much below its midpoint  which is 17 5  over the past three years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 0  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Tahoe Resources has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 9  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tahoe Resources has a P S ratio of about 1 9  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is way below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tahoe Resources currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes TAHO a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Tahoe Resources is just 3 2  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 9 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 4  which is much better than the industry average of 13 5  Clearly  TAHO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Tahoe Resources might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score

111910,333425,EFX,Will Trading Slowdown Hurt Morgan Stanley  MS  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Morgan Stanley s   NYSE MS   third quarter results  scheduled for Oct 17  are expected to show a decline in trading income   one of the major revenue components  While this could majorly affect its earnings  an expected improvement in revenues from other segments should offset the negative impact on earnings     Similar to the prior quarter  slump in fixed income trading revenues is expected to be the main reason for the decline in trading revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of  1 18 billion reflect a decline of 5 1  sequentially and 20 5  from the year ago quarter  On the other hand  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of  1 88 billion indicates a decrease of 12 7  from the prior quarter  However  equity trading revenues are expected to be flat on a year over year basis The decline in trading revenues is largely attributable to higher than usual volatility  due to the Brexit aftermath and the impending U S  presidential election  in the year ago quarter  But trading activities remained sluggish in the to be reported quarter as well Absence of any concrete development on the proposed financial reforms by the Trump administration and an unchanged monetary policy of the Fed were the primary reasons for reduced volatility for the major part of the quarter Overall  Q3 trading revenue is expected to be  2 86 billion  down 10 3  from the last quarter and 9 8  from the prior year quarter Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley s Q3 results Underwriting fees to rise  Though equity underwriting volumes in the third quarter were low owing to seasonality  this is not likely to have any significant impact on Morgan Stanley s equity underwriting market share  given its strong global presence  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of  297 million reflects a jump of 25 8  from the prior year quarter Additionally  as the interest rate hike is expected to continue  many U S  companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later  As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley s total underwriting fees  this has been leading to strong gains for Morgan Stanley  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of  395 million reflects year over year growth of 8 5  All in all  total underwriting fees is projected to witness a 15 3  year over year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is  692 million Stable advisory fees  With the overall improvement in global M A scenario during the third quarter  Morgan Stanley should be able to generate decent advisory fees  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is  502 million  relatively stable year over year Net interest income  NII  to increase marginally  Improvement in demand for loans   particularly  in the areas of commercial and industrial  and consumer   is expected to support NII  Further  a rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income Expense control to support bottom line  Morgan Stanley s cost savings plan   Project Streamline   is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter  Also  as much improvement in revenues is not likely  chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low Here is what our quantitative model predicts Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our    Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0 00  Zacks Rank  Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise Nonetheless  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 81 cents reflects a 1 3  improvement on a year over year basis  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  9 billion indicate a marginal growth from the prior year quarter Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Comerica Incorporated   NYSE CMA   is scheduled to report results on Oct 17  It has an Earnings ESP of  0 23  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  The Earnings ESP for Synovus Financial Corp    NYSE SNV   is  0 52  and it carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 17 M T Bank Corp  s   NYSE MTB   Earnings ESP is  0 33

111915,333430,EFX,Is Teck Resources  TECK  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Teck Resources Limited   NYSE TECK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Teck Resources has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 8  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Teck Resources  current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint  which is 14 8  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 36 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Teck Resources has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Teck Resources  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Teck Resources has a P S ratio of about 1 5  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Teck Resources currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes TECK a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Teck Resources is just 0 8  a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 2 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 9  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 8 1  Clearly  TECK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Teck Resources might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives TECK a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past thirty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has climbed about 16 0  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has risen about 7 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Teck Resources Ltd Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTeck Resources is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a good industry rank  top 23  out of more than 250 industries  and strong Zacks Rank  Teck Resources looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax  NYSE EFX  Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news

111941,333456,EFX,Q3 Earnings Season Gets Going,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      The Q3 earnings season has gotten underway already  with results from 26 S P 500 members out at this stage  Total earnings for these 26 index members are up  22 5  from the same period last year on  9 4  higher revenues  with 84 6  beating EPS estimates and 84 6  beating revenue estimates      This growth pace and beats proportion is about in line with what we had seen from the same group of 26 index members in the preceding quarter  but it is an improvement over the 4  and 12 quarter averages  respectively      For the quarter as whole  total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  1 2  from the same period last year on  5 1  higher revenues  With double digit growth in each of the first two quarters of the year and earnings growth in the last quarter of the year currently expected to be in high single digits  the Q3 growth is on track to be the lowest this year      Tough comparisons for the Finance sector was all along keeping the overall Q3 growth pace down  with the sector s year over year comparison notably deteriorating over the last two months as a result of the insurance industry s exposure to this year s active hurricane season      Q3 earnings for the insurance industry  which alone brings in roughly a quarter of the Finance sector s total earnings  are expected to be down  45 1  from the same period last year on  0 7  lower revenues   Excluding the insurance drag  Finance sector earnings would be up  3 8  from the same period last year        Including the Finance sector  Q3 earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Autos  Basic Materials  Aerospace and Transportation sectors      Earnings growth for Q3 drops to  0 7   from  1 2   when the strong Energy sector contribution is excluded from the aggregate picture  The Conglomerates sector is the only other sector  in addition to Energy  with double digit earnings growth in Q3      Growth is expected to be strong for the Technology sector  with Tech earnings expected to be up  9 7  from the same period last year on  6 7  higher revenues      As has been the trend in recent years  estimates for Q3 have come down since the quarter got underway  but the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other recent periods      For full year 2017  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  6 9  on  4 7  higher revenues  which would follow  0 7  earnings growth on  2 1  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11 8  in 2018 and  9 2  in 2019       Earnings growth is expected to turn positive in Q3 for the small cap S P 600 index  with total earnings for the index expected to be up  12  from the same period last year on  6  higher revenues  This would follow persistent earnings declines for the small cap index   S P 600 earnings growth was negative in 3 of the last 4 quarters      Strong growth from the Finance  Technology and Energy sectors is driving the small cap growth  The Finance sector s role is particularly notable in the small cap index  with Q3 earnings growth dropping to  1 3   from  12   on an ex Finance basis 
Estimates for Q3 came down since the quarter got underway  with the current  1 2  expected earnings growth down from  6 3  in late June  as the chart below shows 

We know from history that actual Q3 earnings growth will be a lot higher than what is expected at present  with the final growth tally for the quarter likely in the vicinity of what was expected at the start of the quarter   6 3    But whatever the final growth tally for Q3 turns out to be  it is unlikely to surpass what was achieved in the preceding two earnings seasons  What this means is that the Q3 growth pace will be the low point for the year The negative revisions trend was widespread  with all sectors experiencing estimate cuts  The more recent estimate cuts were to the Finance and Transportation sectors whose profitability suffered as a result of this year s unusually active and impactful hurricane season The positive earnings report from Delta    and favorable pre announcements in recent days from United Continental    and American    have eased some of the initial post hurricane worries about the air carriers  But the earnings impact of this year s hurricanes is very much real for the insurers  as you can see in the negative revisions trends for a number of industry players like Chubb  NYSE CB      Travelers     AIG    and reinsurers like Everest Re    Earnings growth for the Finance sector was barely in positive territory ahead of these insurance issues  but the hurricane season pushed the sector s Q3 earnings growth into negative territory  The sector is now expected to see a  8 6  decline in Q3 earnings on  1 1  higher revenues  with earnings growth in the insurance industry expected to be down  45 1   Excluding the insurance industry drag  total Finance sector earnings would be up  3 8  from the same period last year 

Unlike the year over year growth pace  the dollar amount of total earnings is expected to remain in record territory  as the chart below shows

111944,333459,EFX,Top Analyst Reports For Royal Dutch Shell  Morgan Stanley   Aetna,opinion,"Thursday  October 12  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   RDS A   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   MS  and Aetna  AET   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Royal Dutch Shell shares are up  12 6  so far in 2017 vs  the  1 8  gain for the Zacks Integrated Oil industry  The integrated behemoth s upstream unit have benefited from the steady oil recovery  while production contribution of BG assets continues to be strong 
The supermajor has also been able to reduce operating costs and progress on its large divestment program  Importantly  the company generated a surge in cash flows during the most recent quarter  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend 
However  with oil unable to stay above the psychologically critical  50 threshold for more than a few days  Shell s near to medium term revenue outlook remains cloudy  The Zacks analyst is also apprehensive that the group s disposal program could affect production  which fell 11  sequentially in second quarter  Hence  the analyst advises investors to wait for a better entry point before buying shares in Europe s largest oil company 
 You can   
Morgan Stanley s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Bank industry  over the last six months   20 8  vs   16 4    The performance was supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters 
The company s efforts to offload its non core assets to lower balance sheet risk and cost saving initiatives  Project Streamline  will likely lead to improvement in profitability  However  continued fall in corporate loan balances remains a near term concern  This is significantly hurting the company s interest income growth 
 You can   
Buy rated Aetna s shares outperformed the Zacks Health Maintenance Organization industry year to date  increasing  26  vs  a gain of  24 7   The Zacks analyst expects the company to derive long term growth from its Government business  Cost reduction initiatives and growing ACO collaborations pave the way for long term growth 
A strong balance sheet is another positive  Its International expansion is also perceived as an opportunity in the face of increased regulation in the U S  Following strong second quarter results  Aetna rasied its earnings guidance which cements investors  confidence in the company  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 6 3  upward over the last 90 days 
Aetna has  however  been incurring losses in its public exchange business and has been exiting exchanges to avoid losses from this business  Furthermore  its membership growth remains under pressure  Increasing medical benefit ratios are also likely to hurt margins

111974,333489,EFX,Are Bank Stock Gains Sustainable ,opinion,"It has been a tough ride for bank stocks this year  with the industry unable to sustain the post election momentum after mid February 2017  As a group  bank stocks didn t do much from mid February through early September  But they have experienced dramatic gains since September 8th  with a number of major bank stocks trading at or near their highs for the year This lack of sustained performance notwithstanding  the industry remains an integral part of the  Trump Trade   with the industry handily outperforming the broader market since November 7th The chart below plots the performance of the Zacks Major Banks industry relative to the S P 500 Index since the elections  Please note that the Zacks Major Banks industry includes all the money center banks and big regionals that kick off the Q3 earnings season for the industry on Thursday October 12th with the JPMorgan  NYSE JPM     and Citigroup    results 

What this chart  blue line represents the banking group  shows is that stocks in the Zacks Major Banks industry are up  28 5  since November 7th  outperforming the S P 500 index s  19 2  gain in that same time period  The broader Finance sector  of which the Major Banks industry is big part  accounting for roughly 40  of the sector s total earnings  is up  24  since November 7th Bank stocks are up more than  8  over the past month  roughly double the S P 500 s performance in that time period  Optimism about tax policy changes appears to be a contributing factor to the group s recent momentum  It s hard to be overly optimistic about substance and timing of a policy legislation given the healthcare experience  but lower corporate taxes will be highly beneficial to the banking industry  As large as many of these big industry players are  they are still primarily domestic oriented businesses that stand to benefit from lower corporate tax rates  just as small cap stocks do  Trends in treasury yields have an outsized bearing on bank stocks since they are a big driver of bank margins  You can see this correlation in the year to date stock market performance of the industry relative to the 10 year treasury yield  bank industry is blue line   with the industry s bounce since September 8th coinciding with the most recent bottoming in the treasury yields 

Whether the group s recent outperformance over the past month is a function of treasury yields  or hopes of tax law changes or both  it s foundations appear shaky  Tax cuts would be good for banks  but who knows when or whether they will arrive  Treasury yields have been unable to cross the 2 4  level at the high end  though they reached that level three times since March this year  They are heading to that level again  with the 10 year yield getting a modest bump from the stronger looking wage growth numbers in the otherwise  noisy  September jobs report  But if recent history has to repeat itself  then we should look for yields to start moving down after getting close to the 2 4  level   With these two supports for the group less than credible  let s take a look at the group s earnings potential to see if we can find support there What Are Banks Expected to Report in Q3 Bank earnings failed to impress in the Q2 earnings season and all of the factors that weighed on Q2 results remained in place in Q3 as well  keeping expectations in check  Net interest margin benefited from the June Fed rate hike  but that incremental gain likely got offset by persistent deceleration in loan growth and soft trading revenues  The September quarter is traditionally a seasonally weak period on the capital markets front  This year s Q3 was mixed  with stable fixed income trading flows and positive fixed income underwriting trends offset by weak equity trading volumes and issuance What all of this means is that bank stocks could benefit from low and relatively easy to beat expectations Total Q3 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry are expected to be down  5 1  from the same period last year on  2 2  higher revenues  This would follow  10  earnings growth in Q2 and  19 4  growth in 2017 Q2  JP Morgan  JPM  and Citigroup  C   on deck to release Q3 results on Thursday  are expected to report  6 6  and  8 2  lower earnings from the year earlier level  respectively The table below shows the sector s Q3 earnings growth expectations at the medium industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding three periods 

Please note that the Major Banks industry  of which JPMorgan  Citigroup and others are part  accounts for roughly 45  of the sector s total earnings  insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor  accounting for about 25  of the total   The insurance industry has been hard hit by this year s very active and impactful hurricane season  with estimates for insurers taking a big hit since the quarter got underway We discussed the hurricane impact in our weekly Earnings Trends report here     
Expectations for Q3Total Q3 earnings are expected to be up  2 2  from the same period last year on  5  higher revenues  This would follow  11 1  earnings growth in 2017 Q2 on  5 5   the second quarter in a row of double digit earnings growth Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter unfolded  with the current  2 2  growth down from  6 3  at the end of June  The chart below shows how Q3 earnings growth expectations have evolved since the start of the quarter 

Please note that while Q3 estimates have followed the well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years  the magnitude of negative revisions nevertheless compares favorably to other periods  In other words  Q3 estimates have come down  but they haven t come down by as much The table below shows the summary picture for Q3  contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q2 

In terms of sector focus  the strongest growth in Q3 is coming from the Energy sector which benefits from easy comparisons  Excluding the Energy sector  the aggregate growth pace drops to  0 4  from  2 2   The Conglomerate sector is the only other sectors with double digit growth rates  Earnings growth is also strong for the Technology sector  with total earnings for the sector expected to be up  9 7  on  6 7  higher revenues On the negative side  Q3 earnings are expected to be below the year earlier level for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Transportation  Aerospace  Basic Materials and Autos sectors The chart below shows Q3 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  the growth pace has started decelerating from the double digit level of the first two quarters of the year 

The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for the S P 500 index  As you can see  we have only 8 index members reporting results this week  with the earnings season really ramping up the following week

111975,333490,EFX,Will The Ride Get Bumpier For Airline Stocks ,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that stocks in the airline space have been plagued by multiple headwinds like weather related disruptions  pricing issues and high costs  The turbulence in the sector is largely responsible for the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declining 2 5  over the last three months  With Q3 earnings season coming up  the ongoing turbulence may result in airlines performing disappointingly  Let s delve into the details 
Harvey  Irma Ground Airlines   Q3 Unit Revenue Views Cut
Harvey  which wreaked havoc on America s fourth largest city  Houston  with heavy rainfall  has negatively impacted airline operations and caused multiple flight cancellations  In fact  air travel was hurt with two Houston airports  George Bush Intercontinental Airport  IAH  and William P  Hobby Airport  HOU    remaining closed for a few days  since the noon of Aug 27  due to Harvey induced heavy rainfall  The airports are operational now 
United Continental Holdings  UAL   the parent company of United Airlines  was the worst hit  as Houston is the carrier s second largest hub  In September 2017  company trimmed its views with respect to pre tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  for the third quarter mainly due to Harvey  The carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3  and 5  year over year  the earlier guidance provided in July was  1  to   1   
In fact  Harvey has impacted the third quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points  The carrier now expects pre tax margin between 8  and 10   previous guidance was 12 5  and 14 5   
Spirit Airlines  SAVE   which also has significant exposure to Houston  expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately  8 5 million in the third quarter due to the natural calamity  Currently  Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  to decline between 7  and 8 5   the previous guidance was 2  and 4    In fact  per the company  100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey  Also  aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the bleak forecast 
Southwest Airlines  LUV   which had to call off approximately 2 800 flights due to Harvey  now expects operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  for the third quarter in the range of down 1  to slightly up  on a year over year basis  The metric was earlier projected to increase approximately 1  from the year ago quarter 
Close on the heels of Harvey  came another natural calamity  Irma  which also hurt airline operations  American Airlines Group  AAL   which has significant exposure to Florida including its hub at Miami International Airport  had to cancel multiple flights due to Irma  The natural calamity also caused it to trim its third quarter TRASM view 
High Costs Likely to Hurt Q3
With labor deals in vogue in the aviation space  labor costs have escalated  thereby hurting the bottom lines in the last few quarters  The picture is likely to be no different in the third quarter   For example  labor costs shot up significantly at Alaska Air Group  ALK  following the amendment to the pay related pilots  contract at its subsidiary  Horizon Air 
Following the agreement  the company expects third quarter cost per available seat mile  excluding fuel and other special items  between 8 cents and 8 05 cents  High labor costs are also expected to hurt results at Allegiant Travel Company  ALGT   Allegiant carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Moreover  increasing fuel costs do not bode well for airlines  Oil prices are currently hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  way higher than the lows of around  26 a barrel touched in February last year  The rise in fuel costs  which again may be Harvey induced  are also likely to distort the Q3 earnings picture for airlines  For example  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL  now expects fuel prices per gallon in the third quarter between  1 68 and  1 73  The figure was much less in the second quarter of 2017 
Capacity Overexpansion   Declining Airfare
Carriers like Spirit Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp   JBLU  registered declines in their respective load factors  percentage of seats filled by passengers  in August  The reason for the downturn was capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth in the month  The metric had declined for most carriers in July as well 
Woes related to capacity overexpansion plagued airline stocks in the not so distant past  particularly 2015  also  In light of the above traffic reports  it is quite natural for fears related to capacity overexpansion to resurface 
In such a scenario  investors fear that capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid 2014  despite the recent resurgence  jet fuel prices climbed 8 5  in August   Moreover  airfares have remained low  with the metric declining in August as well after the fall in July 
According to   air fares  roundtrip  in the United States are likely hit a low of  216 in October  Capacity over expansion is believed to be the primary reason for the decline in airfares  While low air fares are favorable for fliers  it is a drag on the top lines of carriers due to their lesser profits 
Threat from Low Cost Carriers
The emergence and success of low cost carriers like Spirit Airlines and JetBlue Airways have posed significant threats to legacy carriers  In a price sensitive economy  it is not only a question of the survival of the fittest but also of the cheapest  In fact  United Continental  while trimming its guidance for the third quarter attributed the move to its price war with carriers like Spirit apart from Harvey and high fuel costs 
United Continental and American Airlines introduced Basic Economy Fares earlier this year to attract more budget conscious passengers  Recently  American Airlines announced its decision to expand basic economy fares to more domestic flights in a bid to compete more effectively with low cost carriers 
Other Headwinds
In July 2017  American Airlines  Frontier Airlines and Delta were heavily fined by the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  for flouting rules pertaining to consumer protection  The DOT fined Frontier Airlines  400 000 for breach rules pertaining to oversales and disability  American Airlines was penalized to the tune of  250 000 as it failed to make timely refunds to passengers  Delta was fined  200 000 by the agency for revealing inaccurate baggage related reports 
United Airlines  the subsidiary of United Continental  again grabbed headlines in July owing to passenger harassment issues  following the infamous David Dao episode in April  This time  the carrier  forced a passenger  Shirley Yamauchi  on a flight from Houston to Boston  to remove her 27 month son from his seat  the ticket for which had cost almost   The toddler had to sit on his mother s lap during the course of the journey while his paid seat was given to another passenger 
The twin terror attacks in Spain  in August 2017  also do not bode well for airlines  Such acts of terrorism affect airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears  Moreover  as a result of mass shooting in Las Vegas  travel to this favorite tourist destination might be hurt  As a result  travel focused stocks  which include airlines  are likely to be on the back foot 
Moreover  technical glitches have been a nuisance for carriers  Evidently  the likes of Delta and Southwest Airlines have seen their operations being affected by technological problems this year  Given that technological infrastructure is a key expense for airlines  the profitability of carriers might be affected in the event of such malfunctions  going forward

111976,333491,EFX,Thaler Thinks Markets Are Behaving Irrationally,opinion,Fresh off his Nobel Prize for Economics  University of Chicago Professor Richard Thaler has admitted to being puzzled and worried about the current market exuberance   We seem to be living in the riskiest moment of our lives  and yet the stock market seems to be napping   Thaler says he doesn t understand it  anyone paying attention to global risks today surely would have made some investment adjustments by now  Yet stock indexes remain near all time highs Thaler proved that human beings are  predictably irrational   helping shed light on how sound investment strategies can go awry   Economic agents are human  and  economic models have to incorporate that   Thaler was quoted as saying about his award winning work  So what is it Thaler is so worried about now In an interview with Bloomberg  Thaler explains his is puxzzled by not only record highs in the main indexes  but extremely low volatility as well  Outside forces have not been able to correct for potential headwinds or roadblocks  from a massive data breach at Equifax   NYSE EFX   to saber rattling between President Trump and North Korea s Kim Jong un regarding nuclear annihilation  nothing has been able to move the needle deeply to the negative  nor for long  Failures of major policy shifts in Congress   including repealing and replacing Obamacare  as well as sound immigration reform   have added to this perceived wall of worry On top of this  we ve seen an extraordinary amount of natural disasters in the Western Hemisphere in just the past 60 days   hurricanes in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico  earthquakes outside Mexico City  and now devastating wildfires in Northern California   which are costing lives and livelihoods  and will require extraordinary capital outlays to make these regions whole again  And finally  the looming shadow of the investigation into Russia s involvement with the Trump administration in affecting last November s U S  General Election has yet to be brought to light So what does Thaler see as the biggest risk the stock market is avoiding currently  the one that is most likely to set a correction into play from our current lofty levels   Surely  the markets  record highs  can t be based on the certitude that there will be a massive tax cut  given the seeming inability of the Republican Congress to get their act together   Meaning Thaler thinks that  as with healthcare and immigration reform previously this year  Congress will again be unable to bring forth meaningful change on tax reform  And if this results in no windfall corporate tax cut   this year  next year  or ever   chances are this reality will set in and manifest as a new downward trend President Trump will give an address this evening regarding his tax reform proposals  including how many Americans will stand to receive  4000 as a result of new tax policy  But deficit hawks on the right will not see much benefit in putting an additional  1 2 trillion back onto the books just to score a near term cash windfall  And this is before even discussing whether anyone on the left side of the congressional aisle will have any interest in providing fiscal benefits to multi billion dollar corporations ,2017-10-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thaler-thinks-markets-are-behaving-irrationally-200218240,200218240

Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio 
Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others

112061,333576,EFX,Amazon Is Testing Its Own Delivery Service  How Worried Should UPS   FedEx Be ,opinion,"It wouldn t be the retail rivalry of the 21st century if e commerce giant Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   didn t announce a new initiative soon after brick and mortar titan Walmart   NYSE WMT   made headlines of their own  see   and   
According to a   Amazon is testing a program dubbed  Seller Flex  that would both allow more items from third party merchants to be listed under the Prime umbrella  and provide delivery services for those sellers on its platform 
Amazon would also take care of picking up packages from its third party merchants  as well as delivering these items to customers  homes  potentially eliminating the need for its major delivery partners like UPS   NYSE UPS   and FedEx   NYSE FDX   
While the company won t completely stop using UPS and FedEx these carriers will still be used for some delivery situations Seller Flex demonstrates the growing desire by Amazon to control more aspects of its delivery logistics division  the program would also take delivery decisions out of the hands of third party sellers 
More control would give Amazon  greater flexibility over the last mile to shoppers  doorsteps   letting  it save money through volume discounts  and  helping it  avoid congestion in its own warehouses by keeping merchandise in the outside sellers  own facilities   writes Bloomberg 
Seller Flex builds on Amazon s previous delivery improvements  Fulfillment by Amazon lets merchants ship goods to Amazon warehouses around the U S  in order to be stored  packed  and shipped out  while Seller Fulfilled Prime is a program introduced last year that allows sellers to list their products under Prime even if they aren t stored in Amazon warehouses 
The new delivery service was originally rolled out in India two years ago  and over time  Amazon has been marketing the service to its U S  based merchants in order to prep for national expansion  Seller Flex was piloted earlier this year on the West Coast  and the company hopes to increase it in 2018  notes Bloomberg 
Potential Impacts
Monday saw shares of both UPS and FedEx slip in the wake of the report  and the companies fell about 1 48  and 0 50   respectively  in late morning trading 
The threat of disruption caused by Amazon has no doubt been on the minds of these two delivery carriers  but neither have seemed  about the online retailer s encroachment over the past year  Granted  both of UPS and FedEx s networks are vast and intricate  but Amazon is one of the most widely used online shopping sites in the U S   not having as solid of a relationship with the company could be hurtful 
It will be interesting to see if UPS or FedEx takes any steps to counteract these measures  especially if Seller Flex is rolled out nationwide  Perhaps one of the carriers will develop a closer relationship with Jet com or other online retailers that are looking to expand delivery services 
One should also consider the timing of this report  The holiday shopping season is fast approaching  and Bloomberg points out that online holiday spending will reach  129 billion in the U S  this year  Consumers become dependent on companies like Amazon  UPS  and FedEx to send and receive gifts on time  and a busy holiday season is the perfect time to test and showcase a new delivery service  demonstrating that it can operate successfully on its own 
4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax  NYSE EFX  Hack 
Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans  But which stocks are the best buy candidates right now  And what does the future hold for the cybersecurity industry 
Equifax is just the most recent victim  Computer hacking and identity theft are more common than ever  Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to inform Zacks com readers about this  170 billion year space  More importantly  it highlights 4 cybersecurity picks with strong profit potential ",2017-10-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amazon-is-testing-its-own-delivery-service-how-worried-should-ups--fedex-be-200217240,200217240
112062,333577,EFX,Airline Industry Outlook   October 2017,opinion,"Airline stocks are unlikely to set the stage on fire in the third quarter of 2017  results of which are around the corner  Multiple headwinds of late have prevented the space from flying higher 
This scenario is reflected in the latest three month performance of the NYSE ARCA Airline Index  The sector tracker has shed value to the tune of 2 5  in the period  The headwinds are likely to negatively impact third quarter results of airline stocks 
Let s delve into the challenges confronting this key sector 
Back to Back Natural Calamities
Hurricane Harvey  followed by Irma  caused airline stocks like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL  and United Continental Holdings  UAL  to call off multiple flights  United Continental was the worst hit by Harvey  as Houston is the carrier s second largest hub 
The Chicago based carrier cited Harvey as one of the reasons for trimming its views with respect to pre tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  for the third quarter  In fact  Harvey is expected to hurt third quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points  American Airlines Group  AAL  also trimmed guidance for the third quarter due to the devastating impact of Irma 
That said  recent comments from management teams suggest that the hurricane impact may be a lot less severe than had been expected  This has helped the stocks recover some of their earlier losses 
High Costs
High fuel costs are also likely to limit third quarter earnings growth  Harvey contributed to an increase in fuel prices due to gasoline shortages caused by the storm  Fuel costs have been on the rise lately  with oil prices hovering around the  50 a barrel threshold  This upsurge can be attributed to an improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks 
United Continental projects third quarter fuel price per gallon between  1 72 and  1 77  earlier view   1 56 to  1 61   The likes of Delta and Southwest Airlines  LUV  have also lifted their respective forecasts for fuel prices 
Escalation in fuel cost apart  the surge in labor costs is also expected to distort the earnings picture of airlines  With airline companies inking pay related deals with various labor groups  costs on this front have spiked  Escalated labor costs have hurt the bottom lines of carriers in the last few quarters  and the third quarter of 2017 is unlikely to be any different 
Soft Air Fares   Capacity Issues
Declining air fares are hurting the top lines of carriers  Low air fares bring good news for fliers but are a bane of airline companies 
According to   air fares  roundtrip  in the United States are likely hit a low of  216 in October  Problems related to capacity over expansion are also hurting carriers  This is highlighted by the fact that the likes of JetBlue Airways  JBLU  and Spirit Airlines  SAVE  witnessed declining load factors  percentage of seats filled by passengers  in August as capacity expansion outweighed traffic growth in the month  July traffic reports also unveiled declining load factors for most carriers 
Other Headwinds
The price war between low cost carriers like Spirit Airlines and legacy carriers like United Continental is another cause for concern in this sector  Issues related to customer dissatisfaction have hurt carriers this year  Apart from the infamous David Dao incident  issues relating to customer dissatisfaction have surfaced at other carriers like Spirit Airlines and Delta 
Zacks Industry Rank Highlights Gloomy Scenario
The Zacks Industry Rank of 228  out of 250 plus groups  carried by the  further highlights the plight of the airlines  This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 11  of the Zacks industries 
We classify our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the past decade  using a week s rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1

Some Positives Remain
Even though stocks in the space are currently struggling  the sector does have a few bright spots  Latin American carriers like Copa Holdings and GOL Linhas  GOL  are witnessing good times on the back of an improved Latin American economy  GOL Linhas holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   
Moreover  the busy Labor Day travel period  Aug 30 Sep 5  for U S  airlines this year further highlights that demand for air travel remains strong  This bodes well for airlines 
Attractive Valuation
Despite the headwinds  the sector is attractively valued  which also highlights that all is not lost for stocks in the space  Going by the EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  ratio  which is often used to value airline stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses  the industry doesn t look expensive at this point 
The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 7 7x  which is better than what the industry saw in the last five years  The ratio is much lower than the high end of the five year range  The industry also compares favorably with the broader market on the same valuation metric 
The airline industry s favorable positioning compared to the overall market certainly highlights the fact that despite its current struggles  the sector might rebound in the long term

112063,333578,EFX,The Earnings Impact Of Hurricanes,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      The Q3 earnings season has gotten underway already  with results from 22 S P 500 members out at this stage  All of these companies have fiscal quarters ending in August  but they form part of our September quarter tally      Total earnings for these 22 index members are up  27 1  from the same period last year on  7 3  higher revenues  with 86 4  beating EPS estimates and 81 8  beating revenue estimates      This growth pace and beats proportion is about in line with what we had seen from the same group of 22 index members in the preceding quarter  but an improvement over the 4  and 12 quarter averages      For the quarter as whole  total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  2 3  from the same period last year on  5  higher revenues  With double digit growth in each of the first two quarters of the year and earnings growth in the last quarter of the year currently expected to be in high single digits  the Q3 growth is on track to be the lowest this year      Tough comparisons for the Finance sector was all along keeping the overall Q3 growth pace down  with the sector s year over year comparison notably deteriorating over the last two months as a result of the insurance industry s exposure to this year s active hurricane season      Q3 earnings for the insurance industry  which alone brings in roughly a quarter of the Finance sector s total earnings  are expected to be down  24 6  from the same period last year on  0 7  lower revenues   Excluding the insurance drag  Finance sector earnings would be up  3 8  from the same period last year        Including the Finance sector  Q3 earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Autos  Basic Materials  Aerospace  and Transportation sectors      Earnings growth for Q3 drops to  0 5   from  2 3   when the strong Energy sector contribution is excluded from the aggregate picture  The Conglomerates sector is the only other sector  in addition to Energy  with double digit earnings growth in Q3      Growth is expected to be strong for the Technology sector  with Tech earnings expected to be up  9 7  from the same period last year on  6 7  higher revenues      As has been the trend in recent years  estimates for Q3 have come down since the quarter got underway  but the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other recent periods      For full year 2017  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  7 1  on  4 6  higher revenues  which would follow  0 7  earnings growth on  2 1  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11 5  in 2018 and  9  in 2019       Earnings growth is expected to turn positive in Q3 for the small cap S P 600 index  with total earnings for the index expected to be up  10 6  from the same period last year on  5  higher revenues  This would follow persistent earnings declines for the small cap index   S P 600 earnings growth was negative in 3 of the last 4 quarters      Strong growth from the Finance  Technology and Energy sectors is driving the small cap growth  The Finance sector s role is particularly notable in the small cap index  with Q3 earnings growth dropping to  0 3   from  10 6   on an ex Finance basis 
Hurricanes and natural disasters disrupt all economic activities  but insurers and transporters get directly hit  We saw this in the estimate revisions over the past month for operators in both of these areas  Chubb  NYSE CB      for example  is now expected to report a loss of  25 cents per share in Q3  But as recently as a month ago  the insurer was expected to earn   2 68 per share Other major insurers like Travelers     AIG    and reinsurers like Everest Re    have similarly suffered major estimate cuts as a result of this year s unusually active and impactful hurricane season  The earnings impact on air carriers like United Continental    and Delta    isn t in the same league as Chubb and Everest Re  but it has nevertheless been notable Earnings growth for the Finance was barely in positive territory ahead of these insurance issues  but the hurricane season pushed the sector s Q3 earnings growth into negative territory  The sector is now expected to see a  3 5  decline in Q3 earnings on  0 9  higher revenues  with earnings growth in the insurance industry expected to be down  24 6   Excluding the insurance industry drag  total Finance sector earnings would be up  3 8  from the same period last year 
Estimates for Q3 have come down since the quarter got underway  with the current  2 3  expected earnings growth down from  6 3  in late June  as the chart below shows 

We know from history that actual Q3 earnings growth will be a lot higher than what is expected at present  with the final growth tally for the quarter likely in the vicinity of what was expected at the start of the quarter   6 3    But whatever the final growth tally for Q3 turns out to be  it is unlikely to surpass what was achieved in the preceding two earnings seasons  What this means is that the Q3 growth pace will be the low point for the year 

Unlike the year over year growth pace  the dollar amount of total earnings is expected to remain in record territory  as the chart below shows 

Please note that the June quarter tally in the chart above was a new all time quarterly record for the S P 500 index  But the record isn t expected to last much longer  with each of the next two quarterly tallies surpassing the preceding period s record

112064,333579,EFX,Market Reaches New Milestone  4 Retail Growth Stocks To Buy,opinion,"Barring a few hiccups  the U S  stock market has displayed a decent run since the start of 2017  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 14 7   the S P 500 has gained 13 4   while the tech laden Nasdaq Composite Index has surged 21 4  so far this year  With plenty of positive news   Trump s ambitious tax plan  surge in factory activity to a 13 year high last month  uptick in construction activity and optimism surrounding the upcoming earnings reports   the rally is expected to continue 
Though the stock market currently looks bullish  one can t ignore the fact that the three major indices are trading close to their 52 week highs that is at lofty valuations  If the major indices breach their set benchmark  it is likely to boost the risk appetite of investors 
Until this happens  you can fine tune your portfolio with growth stocks  These are generally hot and flourishing stocks with earnings growth potential  Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors  we are focusing on   The sector has gained 18 8  so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S P 500  Although the sector occupies the bottom 13  position  14 out of 16  in the Zacks classified list  it still holds promise given the favorable economic indicators 
Retail Space Rides on Favorable Indicators
The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  improving labor market  and rising housing market and manufacturing sector signal that the economy is on a recovery mode that rose 3 1  in second quarter 2017  marking the best growth in three years  Further  the Fed s indication of a likely rate hike in December implies the underlying fundamental strength of the economy 
Steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration boost consumer confidence  We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales in the current retail landscape  which is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping 
Incidentally  most retailers have adopted the omni channel mantra  and also recorded solid bumps in e commerce sales this year  With the holiday season approaching  these factors are favorable for retailers  who make the most of the season 
National Retail Federation projects a 3 6 4  rise in November and December sales  excluding autos  gas and restaurant sales  to  678 75  682 billion  up from  655 8 billion last year and better than the five year average sales growth of 3 5

112065,333580,EFX,PayPal  PYPL  Stock Hits All Time High  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Shares of PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL   surged over 2 50  to reach a new all time high on Thursday  and now many investors might be wondering if they should get in on the digital payment company  despite it breaking through a brand new threshold 
People use cash less and less these days  especially in the developed world where mobile  online  and contactless payment options have become normal 
Fintech and mobile payments platforms are tangible  usable  and practical for the average person  This makes companies that operate in this sector potentially very valuable  both today and in the future 
PayPal is one of the original online and digital payment companies  and since spinning off from eBay   NASDAQ EBAY   a few years ago  the firm has gone on quite the run and now boasts over 210 million active accounts 
The companysaw its stock price pop to hit  65 63 per share on Thursday  a new all time intraday trading high  Let s take a look at some of what the company has done recently  as well as some key fundamental metrics  to see if investors might want to invest in the digital payment firm 
Recent Moves 
PayPal owns mobile peer to peer payment giant Venmo  which is widely popular with millennials and has experienced massive year over year growth  and the company now partners with credit card giants Visa   NYSE V   and Mastercard   NYSE MA   where previously they were at odds 
In August  Mastercard introduced a new PayPal Cashback credit card  On Thursday  PayPal and Mastercard announced that they expanded their partnership to include more services on a larger global scale in Canada  Europe  Latin America  the Caribbean  the Middle East  and Africa 
 Together we expect to accelerate digital payment adoption across the world  improve the payment experience online  in app and in store  and empower millions of consumers to seamlessly manage and move their money   PayPal Chief Commercial Officer Gary Marino said in a statement 
These new relationships have helped PayPal grow more quickly  On top of that  PayPal has struck deals with over  including Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    and JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM    all within the last year and a half 
Fundamentals 
PayPal s second quarter saw the company s revenues pop 18  to hit  3 14 billion  while the company s earnings jumped 27   PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  with an overall VGM grade of  C  
PayPal might not be the most attractive investment for value minded investors  as it is currently trading at almost 35x earnings  This  however  does mark a massive discount to the industry  which is trading at 62x earnings its younger competitor  Square   NYSE SQ    has a P E ratio of 160 39 
The company s P B ratio of 5 15 is not great either  but again  it is comparable to the  Internet   Software  industry average 
The digital payment solution firm s 13 91  cash flow growth helps demonstrates that the company is healthy compared to many of its peers that have more cash going out than coming in 
PayPal s revenues are projected to gain 18 99  this quarter and gain 18 62  on the year to hit as high as  12 94 billion  based on our current consensus estimates  The  Internet   Software  industry is set to experience 9 73  year over year sales growth  PayPal s quarterly earnings are expected to pop 24 60  this quarter and 22 45  for the year 
These substantial gains are projected even though  within the last 60 days  PayPal has received eight downward earnings estimate revisions against only one positive change  However  since spinning off in 2015  PayPal has beat quarterly expectations every time 
Bottom Line
In a mobile centered and digital world  fintech and online payment companies will be positioned to cash in on the future of transactions  PayPal is a pioneer in the industry and might just be a company investors consider now and down the road

112066,333581,EFX,4 Large Cap Drug Stocks To Buy On Solid Momentum Ahead Of Q3,opinion,"The pharmaceutical sector has been grabbing investors  attention of late with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 13 1  and the  20 7  year to date  outpacing 14 7  gain for the S P 500  New drug approvals and tax reforms are expected to provide a further impetus to the stocks  However  factors like drug pricing and competition from biosimilars will continue to act as major deterrents  
On the other hand  companies like Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   are resorting to workforce reduction for a leaner cost structure  On the M A front  apart from Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   acquisition of Actelion Ltd in June  nothing much has happened in this space  Merck   Co   NYSE MRK   recently announced that it will acquire Germany based Rigontec  a privately held immuno oncology focused biotech to boost its immune oncology pipeline  Nevertheless  the proposed tax reforms are expected to boost cash balances of the companies which in turn can be used for mergers acquisitions 
Here we have picked four of the largest drug companies which look well poised for growth and can be a prudent choice for adding to one s portfolio 
Based in Switzerland  Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   is one of the leaders in health care solutions with a wide array of drugs and services  Novartis has a presence in the field of oncology  neuroscience  ophthalmology and generics  Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor  Exjade  Jakavi  Zykadia  Tasigna  Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade 
The recent FDA approval of Kisqali for advanced or metastatic breast cancer and breakthrough gene transfer treatment  Kymriah suspension for acute lymphoblastic leukemia has further boosted the portfolio  The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR T therapy space

112141,333656,EFX,4 Investment Management Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Q3 Earnings,opinion,A gradually stabilizing economy and interest rate hikes are expected to aid the performance of investment managers in the recently concluded quarter The investment management industry  which comprises asset managers and brokerage firms  typically benefits from a rising rate environment  As interest rates rise  brokerage firms engage in more investment activities  Moreover  as they earn interest income on un invested cash in customer accounts  higher rates allow them to make more interest income Also  most investment managers have waived off the majority of their fees with the rates rising since last year  This decline in fee waivers is expected to aid the company s top line growth in their upcoming results Further  the performance of investment brokers is generally measured through monthly average client trades per day that represent the number of trades from which they can expect commission or fees  Per the monthly metrics released by most brokerage firms  the average revenue trades for July and August have witnessed improvement on a year over year basis  This should get reflected in their results for the to be reported quarter Despite inflation related issues and increasing chances of political uncertainty  most of the asset managers have seen an improvement in their assets under management  AUM  for July and August  Moreover  with expectations of modest volatility  the performance of asset managers is expected to be decent for the to be reported quarter Hence  it s a wise idea to bet on a few investment management stocks that are expected to report sequential earnings growth Choosing the Right StocksWith the help of the   we have shortlisted four investment management stocks whose earnings per share  EPS  for the prior quarter witnessed growth of more than 1  sequentially  Also  these stocks have an estimated sequential EPS growth of 5  or more for the to be reported quarter  Further  these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see  Omaha  NE based online brokerage firm  TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation   NASDAQ AMTD    currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1  Its earnings for the previous quarter grew by 10  sequentially  Its estimated EPS growth for the to be reported quarter is 8 1  Affiliated Managers Group  Inc    NYSE AMG    based in Massachusetts  carries a Zacks Rank of 2  It witnessed sequential EPS growth of 3 7  in second quarter 2017 and has an estimated EPS growth of 38 5  for the third quarter BGC Partners  Inc    NASDAQ BGCP    based in New York  provides brokerage services in the real estate markets  The company carries a Zacks Rank of 1  Its earnings witnessed sequential growth of 4 4  in the previous quarter  Its projected EPS growth for third quarter 2017 is 10 7  Stifel Financial Corp    NYSE SF    based in St  Louis  MO  provides wealth management and investment banking services to retail and institutional clients  It carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and its second quarter 2017 EPS witnessed a sequential growth of 21 6   It has an estimated EPS growth of 9 5  for third quarter 2017 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax  NYSE EFX  HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans  But which stocks are the best buy candidates right now  And what does the future hold for the cybersecurity industry Equifax is just the most recent victim  Computer hacking and identity theft are more common than ever  Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to inform Zacks com readers about this  170 billion year space  More importantly  it highlights 4 cybersecurity picks with strong profit potential ,2017-10-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-investment-management-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-q3-earnings-200217170,200217170
112142,333657,EFX,Here s Why Tyson Foods  TSN  Should Be In Your Portfolio Now,opinion,"Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN   hogged into limelight after it increased fiscal 2017 earnings guidance on Sep 28 and announced restructuring initiatives to strengthen its business to drive profits  The producer of chicken and poultry based food products now expects fiscal 2017 bottom line to be in the range of  5 20  5 30 per share  higher than its prior guidance of  4 95  5 05 
Meanwhile  management expects favorable market conditions to continue to boost its financials in fiscal 2018 and projects earnings in the range of  5 70  5 85  reflecting year over year growth of 8 13   We believe continued focus on protein rich brands and cost savings are driving the company s profitability 
Evidently  shares of the company have been on a growth trajectory over the past three months  In the said time frame  the company s shares have increased 18 9  compared with the  s rise of 14 2   In fact  Tyson Foods  shares have increased more than 8  since it raised earnings guidance  Tyson Foods also flaunts a  of A  which makes it a favorable investing option 

Let s delve deeper and try to find out what s taking this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company higher 
Focus on High Protein Brands
Tyson Foods has been witnessing earnings growth courtesy of its improved sales performance  Notably  the company delivered higher sales volumes driven by increased demand for high protein foods  The acquisition of AdvancePierre acquisition  which was carried out in June  will enable the company to expand its fastest growing portfolio of protein packed brands and fresh prepared foods offerings 
While Tyson Foods is restructuring its portfolio to focus more on protein rich brands  it s exiting its non core businesses  such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery  Kettle and Van s  to focus on protein packed brands and drive sales 
Improved performance of the company s Beef segment  backed by enhanced domestic demand  improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports  is also fueling sales  The company is also witnessing higher demand for chicken and pork  which is expected to drive Tyson Foods  top line 
In fact  management expects sales growth across all of its business segments buoyed by rising consumption  easy availability of livestock and higher pricing 
Cost Savings
Meanwhile  cost savings is further boosting earnings momentum  Tyson Foods expects to generate cost savings of  200 million   400 million  and  600 million in fiscal 2018  2019  and 2020  respectively  through the AdvancePierre acquisition 
Also  the company is seeking to reinventing its supply chain and procurement process and lowering overhead costs to boost savings  These cost savings are expected to improve the performance of Tyson Foods  Chicken and Prepared Foods segments  Meanwhile  to streamline its management  the company would slash 450 jobs from corporate offices in Chicago  Springdale  and Cincinnati 
We expect that the company s dedicated efforts toward inducing operational efficiency and reducing costs to improve margins and thereby profits in the forthcoming months 
Innovation Aids Portfolio Growth
Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up  As an increasing number of health conscious U S  consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts  Tyson Foods considers it a high potential category  Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas  Stuffed Hash Browns  Tyson Food Service Fully Cooked Drumsticks and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers 
Valuation Multiples
If we look into the company s P E  EV EBITDA and P S multiples  we note that the company generally trades below its industry average 
Tyson Foods has a trailing P E multiple of 14 8 and EV EBITDA multiple of 10 0  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the industry at large  as the P E multiple and EV EBITDA multiple for the industry is pegged at 16 0 and 11 2  respectively  These are also trading below S P 500 levels of 20 6 and 11 4  respectively  This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to the industry and S P 500 
Currently  Tyson Foods has a P S ratio of 0 7  This is also lower than the industry average of 1 1 and S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2

112211,333726,EFX,Does Cooper Tire   Rubber Company  CTB  Look To Be A Suitable Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cooper Tire   Rubber Company   NYSE CTB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cooper Tire   Rubber has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cooper Tire   Rubber s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cooper Tire   Rubber has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 2  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cooper Tire   Rubber has a P S ratio of about 0 7  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cooper Tire   Rubber currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cooper Tire   Rubber a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 7  which is far better than the industry average of 6 8   Clearly  CTB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cooper Tire   Rubber might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of B  This gives CTB a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and three down in the same time period This has had an unfavorable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 12  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen by 3 4   You can see the  for the stock in the chart below Cooper Tire   Rubber Company Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCooper Tire   Rubber is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 21  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax  NYSE EFX  Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach

the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cooper Standard has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cooper Standard s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past three years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cooper Standard has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 1  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cooper Standard has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cooper Standard currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cooper Standard a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 4  which is far better than the industry average of 8 7  Clearly  CPS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cooper Standard might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives CPS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and five down in the same time period This has had an unfavorable impact on the consensus estimate through as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged at  2 52 in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cooper Standard Holdings Inc  Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCooper Standard is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a striong industry rank  Top 17  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax  NYSE EFX  Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach

112279,333794,EFX,Should You Buy Mazor Robotics  MZOR  As It Hits New High  ,opinion,"Shares of Mazor Robotics   NASDAQ MZOR   surged over 5  on Wednesday to touch a new all time high  Now the question for investors is  should you consider buying the surgical robotics maker s stock 
Mazor Robotics  medical devices focus on robotic guidance technology to help assist surgeons  The company has seen its stock price skyrocket from under  25 per share at the start of the year to its new all time intraday trading high of  52 20 a share  This alone might scare away investors who are worried that it will be hard for Mazor Robotics to break through a new threshold soon 
Let s take a look at what the company does and some of its current fundamentals to see if it might be a stock for investors to consider 
Company 
Mazor Robotics is a young surgical robotics company with a market cap of  1 28 billion that operates out of offices in Orlando  Florida and Caesarea  Israel  The company currently makes two different pieces of robotic surgery equipment  the  Mazor X  and  Renaissance   The products are designed to help innovate surgical techniques for spine surgeries  
The surgical assurance platforms help surgeons maximize procedural predictability and patient benefits  The larger  trademarked Mazor X features a workstation with a large touchscreen monitor that serves as a guidance screen and the surgeon s control panel  The robotic guidance system has a surgical arm  a 3D camera with special tracking  and a surgical control system 
The company s core focus is on pre op analytics  intra op guidance  and intra op verification  which allows the surgeon to review the surgical plan in 3D  while the brace along with the surgical arm provide more control and precision than a human 
The concept is relatively simple  a surgeon operates at a workstation near the patient and the robotic components essentially perform the physical act of the surgery on the patient 
Mazor Robotics  products have caught some investors  eyes already  including medical device giant Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT    Medtronic purchased a stake in Mazor Robotics last year as part of a deal that allowed Medtronic to distribute the Mazor X system 
Mazor Robotics announced recently that the two companies would further their partnership  with Medtronic s total investment in the company climbing to  
Current Fundamentals 
Mazor Robotics is currently a Zacks Rank   2  Buy   with  C  grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system  Like many young experimental medical and biotech companies  Mazor Robotics does not currently represent great value to investors  Because it is still unprofitable  the company currently has no price to earnings ratio  and has a P B ratio of 19 34 and a 26 26 P S ratio 
Mazor Robotics  0 60 Sales Assets ratio falls just short of the industry average  Yet the company looks to be on a solid growth trajectory with current cash flow growth of 20 08   beating the    industry average of 4 37  
Over the last 12 weeks  the company s stock price has climbed 17 80   which tops the industry s 0 31  loss  Mazor Robotics 129 33  year to date price change crushes the industry average as well as the S P 500 
Within the last 60 days  the surgical robotics company has received one full year upward earnings estimate revision  as well as one for the following year  Mazor Robotics earnings are projected to pop 4 35  for its current quarter based on our consensus estimates  The firm s full year EPS is expected to fall 3 01  to post an  0 89 per share loss 
Yet  the company s revenues are projected to skyrocket 92 66  this quarter and 59 16  for the year  This indicates that the early stage medical device company is clearly expanding rapidly but this expansion has been costly 
Bottom Line
Investors who can handle the ebbs and flows that often come along with young firms in the biotech and medical device industries might consider Mazor Robotics  especially if Medtronic decides to buy the firm outright down the road

112280,333795,EFX,Verizon  VZ  To Gain From Customer Friendly Prepaid Plans ,opinion,U S  telecom behemoth  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    is launching customer friendly prepaid family plans to attract more subscribers  We believe that such strategy to remain competitive and strengthen foothold in the wireless industry will benefit Verizon The U S  wireless prepaid industry is getting more competitive with every passing day  The industry is also struggling with saturation issues  The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user has narrowed significantly  forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business Currently  Verizon is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  You can see  Verizon s Latest Prepaid OfferingAll prepaid lines include unlimited talk  text and data tiers along with 3GB  7GB  10GB and Unlimited data  Each data size is priced separately for the first line and then followed by discounted rate from second to fifth lines to help cut down on costs The 3GB Plan is available for  40 a month for the first line and  30 a month for the second fifth line  The 7GB Plan for  50 a month for the first line and  35 a month for the second fifth lines  The 10GB Plan is priced at  60 per month for the first line and  40 per month for the second fifth line  Finally  the unlimited offering is priced at  80 per month for the first line and  60 per month for the second fifth lines With Verizon s new service  customers can choose a single specific plan for each member of the family  enabling them to customize individual monthly data plans Verizon had previously targeting prepaid customers  In April  Verizon introduced its unlimited prepaid plan with unlimited data  talk and text for  80 a month  Video streaming was limited up to 480p We believe such offerings should help Verizon strengthen prepaid customer base  We look forward to seeing  how the company performs in its upcoming third quarter 2017 financial results Price PerformanceOver the past three months  shares of Verizon have returned 14 7  compared with the  s increase of 7 6    Unlimited Prepaid Data Plan WarStiff pricing competition in the industry is a genuine concern  Few months back  we witnessed four major wireless telecommunications companies  Verizon Communications  AT T Inc   NYSE T    T Mobile US Inc   NYSE T   and Sprint Corp   NYSE S    participating in the unlimited postpaid data plan war in order to strengthen foothold in the market  These wireless operators are now extending their unlimited data plan to the prepaid market as well T Mobile US  prepaid wireless service  MetroPCS Communications  Inc  has heated up the battlefield with its latest offering of unlimited LTE data  talk and text for  75 for two lines  In terms of the service differentiators  video streaming is supported in SD at 480p along with a  100 instant rebate on devices for new customers for each line That s almost in line with Sprint s Boost Mobile  which offers a prepaid unlimited plan for  50 per month for the initial line and  30 per month for each line after that  for an  80 per month deal for two lines  That offer  unlike MetroPCS  includes an international flair consisting of unlimited talk and texts to Mexico and 8GB of roaming data while south of the border  On the video front  Boost also touts  mobile optimized streaming  in HD U S  telecom behemoth AT T s Cricket prepaid wireless brand  offers a special two line bundle of unlimited talk  text and data also for  80 per month  along with free phones  certain models  for new customers  It also allows calls and texts to Mexico and Canada  with no roaming charges United States Cellular Corp  s   NYSE S   decision to increase the amount of data available in its existing prepaid plans have helped it gain 35 000 prepaid subscribers in the recently reported second quarter 2017 Bottom LineRapid technological invention and innovation have resulted in significant competition within the telecommunications industry  Product life cycle and upgrade cycle have declined drastically with several firms coming up with new versions of products and services within a short span of time  To combat competition  the players are thus increasingly looking at new avenues  Extending unlimited data plan to the prepaid market is one such avenue 4 Stocks to Watch

112310,333825,EFX,Why Did Shopify  SHOP  Stock Slump Today  ,opinion,"Shares of Shopify   NYSE SHOP   fell more than 10  after notorious short selling firm Citron Research argued that the e commerce platform is fraudulently promoting  get rich quick schemes  
In a video posted on Citron s website  Andrew Left  who has garnered attention for successful bets against companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX    questioned Shopify s user claims and compared its business to multi level marketing companies like Herbalife   NYSE HLF   
 Shopify says they have 2 500 Shopify plus merchants out of their universe of 500 000  Now let s say they have another 20 000 Shopify Advanced  The question I ask you  the question no one on Wall Street has addressed is who are the other 450 000 merchants on Shopify    Left said 
In a larger   Citron criticized Shopify s marketing strategy  which relies on  partners  to refer new merchants to the platform  The report also took jabs at the company s hyperbolic advertising copy  For example  Citron noted that Shopify s website uses the word  millionaire  at least 92 times 
It s certainly true that Shopify attempts to appeal to entrepreneurial minded individuals  and as Citron mocked  the company even includes a sample resignation letter on its site insinuating that customers could quit their day jobs and open a Shopify store 
But Citron s report makes several mentions of the Federal Trade Commission and concludes by implying that Shopify could soon find itself in some legal trouble 
 We are forwarding all of our information  hundreds of pages  to the FTC and we expect Shopify to face the same scrutiny as the many companies of the past who sell dreams to unsuspecting customers  
Left gave the stock a  60 price target and suggested that it could slip further if the FTC gets involved  That call would represent a 49  slump from Tuesday s close and a 42  drop from Wednesday s intraday low 
Whether or not Shopify has intentionally or illegally misled customers and investors is a question that only regulators can answer  and it is worth noting that Left confirmed he is short the stock  Nevertheless  Citron have an interesting track record with pointing out dubious business models and making accurate short calls in the past

112311,333826,EFX,5 Top Performing Energy Stocks Of September,opinion,"For more than three years oil prices have been weak following supply glut and lackluster global demand 
However  in September  the commodity crossed the  50 per barrel mark after more than five weeks  Higher than expected demand and the pledge to cut down supply by leading producers supported the upside 
Crude Rally in September
As per   The West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude rose more than 9  through September 
The commodity saw a 12 2  gain in third quarter 2017  after losing ground for two consecutive quarters this year  Most importantly  this quarterly gain is the highest since the April to June quarter of 2016 
Oversupply Concerns Ease  
Record OPEC Compliance  On Nov 30  2016  OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb crude production by 1 2 million barrels a day  Following the footsteps of the cartel  early last December  non OPEC players headed by Russia decided to cut oil output by 558 000 barrels per day  Hence collectively  crude production has been lowered by 1 8 million barrels a day 
Further  on the May 25 meet  producers from both the sides voted to extend the cut in oil production till the first quarter of 2018  During the Sep 22 Vienna meet  the OPEC and non OPEC oil producing players declared that their compliance level had touched 116  in August against 94  conformity in July 
Notably  August compliance was the highest since crude producers started complying with the output cut accord  Russia alone conformed to the pact by more than 100  
U S  Oil Rig Count Declines  Rigs exploring crude in the U S  resources declined for the first three weeks of September 
Demand Picture Improves
Record Global Demand  According to The International Energy Agency  IEA   global oil demand improved by 2 3 million barrels per day during the second quarter of the year  The year over year improvement was the highest since mid 2015  The agency believed that oil demand from both Europe and the United Sates was higher than estimated 
Investors should know that the U S  economy grew at the fastest pace during the April to June quarter of 2017 in more than two years  Given the healthy economic picture of the world s largest crude consumer  demand for oil should improve further 
Energy Stocks Rally
The advancement of crude in September was likely beneficial for oil exploration and production companies  Also  probably  firms engaged in manufacturing equipment for oil field drilling and completion activities clinched new contracts 
With the help of our   one can find prospective energy stocks  In particular  we have shortlisted five companies that have gone up 10  or more during September and have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

The new clip on device  Google Clips  is an AI powered camera concept that automatically takes photos as one goes throughout their day  Clips looks for smiles  people you know  and exciting moments and Google says it will only get smarter over time 
Google also revealed the specifications for its new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones  The devices will feature a rear camera with 12 2 MP  1 4 m pixels  autofocus with laser and dual pixel phase detection  optical and electronic image stabilization  and an f 1 8 aperture lens

Both the Hero 6 and the Fusion were relatively well received and are certainly two of the most powerful products in the action camera market  The new cameras helped shares of GoPro surge even higher  and coming into today  the stock was up more than 24  over the past four weeks 
Today s slump is likely being exacerbated by this recent run  although it s clear that investors are worried about Google s entrance into the personal camera business  However  Google Clips is a concept that is noticeably different than GoPro s core model  and at  249  Clips is also in a lower price range than GoPro s marquee devices

112464,333979,EFX,Should Value Investors Consider BorgWarner Inc   BWA  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BorgWarner Inc    NYSE BWA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BorgWarner has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  BorgWarner s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that BorgWarner has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for BorgWarner stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BorgWarner has a P S ratio of about 1 2  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  BWA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BorgWarner currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BorgWarner a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though BorgWarner might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of D  This gives BWA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat favorable  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten up and no down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged at 86 cents in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BorgWarner Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite this somewhat bullish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBorgWarner is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover a strong industry rank  Top 18  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite carrying Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach

112469,333984,EFX,Is Delphi Automotive  DLPH  A Good Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Delphi Automotive PLC   NYSE DLPH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Delphi Automotive has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 5  While Delphi Automotive s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 13 7 over the past five years  it stands below the highs for the stock  thus leaving scope for entry still However  the stock s PE stands above the Zacks Auto sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 4  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Delphi Automotive s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Delphi Automotive has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  This suggests that the stock is undervalued from the P S aspect as well Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Delphi Automotive currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Delphi Automotive a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Delphi Automotive is just 1 1  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 5  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DLPH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Delphi Automotive might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score and Momentum Score of A each  This gives DLPH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite mixed  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen 10 upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Delphi Automotive PLC Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDelphi Automotive is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  this Zacks Rank  3 company has a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among Top 18  of more than 250 industries   which hints at favorable broader factors  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau

wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cummins Inc    NYSE CMI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good

to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cummins has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 7  This level compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 5 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Cummins  current PE above its median over the observed period  which stands at 15 5x   with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  Hence  we could infer that the stock is slightly overvalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend Further  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Auto sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Nevertheless  we should also point out that Cummins has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 3   lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a more value oriented path may be ahead for Cummins stock in the near term PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cummins has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is higher than the Zacks Auto sector average  which comes in at 0 7x right now too CMI is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cummins currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cummins an apt choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Cummins might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade

estimates have been trending upward lately  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen 10 upward

112507,334022,EFX,Is Daimler  DDAIF  A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Daimler AG  DE DAIGn    OTC DDAIF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Daimler has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 9  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 5 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Daimler s current PE among its lower zone  below its median over the observed period  which stands at 8 9x   Hence  we could infer that the stock is undervalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend  Thus  the present level seems to be a suitable entry point for the stock from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Daimler has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 7 4   lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a more value oriented path may be ahead for Daimler stock in the near term PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Daimler has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is similar to the industry average  which comes in at 0 5x right now too As we can see  the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Daimler currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Daimler a solid choice for value investors  and all of its above listed metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Daimler might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives DDAIF a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending upward lately  The current year has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has also seen two upward revisions and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a small but meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 4 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Daimler AG Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineDaimler is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a formidable industry rank  among the Top 4  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a

112539,334054,EFX,Wells Fargo CEO Faces U S  Senators  Fury Over Scandals,opinion,"At a heated senator meeting held on Tuesday  Wells Fargo   Company s   NYSE WFC   Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan vigorously tried to defend America s third largest bank for its past wrongdoings amid a volley of questions raised by the senators 
Sloan was grilled for forcing the affected customers of fake accounts scandal into arbitration in order to avoid courtroom experience  He responded by saying that the bank has not prevented its customers from suing and would not do so in the future either 
The senators charged Wells Fargo of hiding the problems in auto insurance business in the meeting that was held last year regarding the fake accounts that had been created 
Further  in a follow up after the hearing  the committee had asked whether there was any evidence of other fraudulent activity in the bank or discovery of any misconduct  To this  the bank reported only about certain employees in the community banking division and did not disclose the auto insurance scandal  which had come to light in July 2016 
Sloan defended himself by saying that he got the insurance program suspended in September 2016 after he came to know about the problems 
While one of the democrats suggested regulators to consider revoking the bank s charter and shutting it down completely  the other suggested Wells Fargo s CEO to be fired 
Sloan apologized for causing its customers trouble and has promised to take appropriate steps to make it a better bank in the times to come Further  Sloan also disclosed that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is investigating fees charged from customers to extend interest rate lock periods for mortgages  He also revealed that the bank plans to contact over 108 000 customers to address complaints about fees charged to lock in mortgage rates The bank still has a long way to go before it can put all these troubles behind and focus on improving its performance  The legal costs will remain elevated in the near future and will hurt its financials Shares of Wells Fargo have gained nearly 1  year to date  underperforming the  s rally of 9 5  Currently  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Some better ranked stocks in the financial space are M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB    Syvonus Financial Corp    NYSE SNV   and National Commerce Corporation   NASDAQ NCOM    All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

112573,334088,EFX,Will More Job Options Support Business Services Stocks ,opinion,"Stocks in the Business Services sector have been strong performers lately  reflecting the group s favorable fundamentals  which we have listed below  This should give readers a good sense of the factors that are expected to help these stocks over the near  to medium term 
Asset light Business Model  By virtue of the nature of its operations  these companies provide services instead of products to others  This  in turn  frees them from producing goods that would otherwise need manufacturing facilities  As a result  business services do not have inventory or stock  and thus do not have to bear costs for such items 
Moreover  services can be tailor made for any situation  This is not possible or feasible for something tangible 
Labor Intensive  The sector  which offers intangible products  has immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning 
Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the unemployment rate in August was 4 4   with non farm payroll employment increasing nearly 0 2 million in the month  Jobs were added in manufacturing  construction  professional and technical services  health care and mining industries  Unemployment decreased 50 basis points since August 2016  The professional and business service industry added 0 02 million jobs in August 
Ushering in more good news for the sector  President Trump has hinted at creating more jobs and employment  Trump had shown his discontent about moving job outside the U S  during the election campaign  He said   I just want to let all of the other companies know that we re going to do great things for business  There s no reason for them to leave anymore  
Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries  China and India  are together expected to create 300 million placements in the global job market by 2030 
Global Reach  Companies can reach consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising   Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of such firms in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products  Thus  these service providers help in widening a company s customer base and maintaining a better retention ratio alongside opening the door to international trade 
A key development in this regard has been noticed in the banking space  Online banking for transfer and collection of money from anywhere in the world  mobile money transfer and ATMs are fast gaining traction  The Western Union Company  NYSE WU   WU  and MoneyGram International Inc   MGI  are among those that continuously offer cutting edge services via electronic channels to ensure smooth fund transfers  Fund transferors are also forming alliances with banks and mobile operators to launch their services 
Mobile payment is gaining popularity owing to its convenience and round the clock accessibility  We expect this channel will see a faster adoption rate than any other electronic channel  Western Union s Vigo and OrlandiValuta branded services are available through a network of more than 500 000 agent locations in 200 countries and territories and over 100 000 ATMs 
Importantly  90  of those locations are outside the U S  The company plans to add retail locations and more account based options  MoneyGram has 350 000 agent locations across 200 countries and territories 
A large portion of the world market remains underpenetrated  With the strategic introduction of money transfer in these markets  service providers should enjoy ample business opportunities 
In addition  a continued shift toward electronic forms of payment from paper based forms has created a dependence on plastic money or debit and credit cards  This has encouraged card processors to ramp up their growth profile  Visa Inc  NYSE V    V  and MasterCard Inc   MA  are among the companies that are well placed to benefit from the tailwinds  riding on their respective fundamental strengths 
Cost Effective  All business operators prefer to minimize cost of operation and maximize margins  This sector offers cost effectiveness to companies that opt for services that would otherwise be far more expensive 
With specialized services  these providers reduce operational cost and in turn  lower the overall cost of companies  Notably  a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for service providers  This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies  thereby fueling margin expansion 
Our data shows that Business Services margins have consistently grown in the past few quarters  and will likely retain the momentum in the next few quarters too  Importantly  Business Services margin expansion is better than that of the S P 500 Index 

 
Gaining from Stronger Currencies  Companies in countries with stronger currencies can gain if their jobs or services are done by companies from countries that have comparatively weaker currencies  This is because these companies would get to spend less and thus gain from currency translation  In turn  this would lower the cost of goods or services and favor margin expansion 
Specialized Service  The industry offers specialized services based on the latest technologies  This is crucial for security and consulting services  To safeguard data  companies are compelled to engage security service providers  which need the latest and most efficient technologies to persuade clients and win business contracts 
Also  increasing mergers and acquisitions across the globe have been improving the prospects of legal service providers  Consulting is another wing of this industry that is rapidly gaining traction 
Business complexities are on the rise and companies are opting for expert advice before entering into any new venture rather than risking losses by trial and error  Thus  this service sector looks promising due to its indispensability to companies that are struggling to survive in a competitive market 
Bottom Line
The U S  economy is now improving and population continues to increase in the nation  This sector  being labor intensive  involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses the issue  While emerging nations are becoming important destinations for business services  these economies pose challenges to employment growth in developed economies 
Given the inherent strengths  the business service sector has enough steam left to drive the engine toward growth

112575,334090,EFX,Multiple Headwinds Pose Threats To Business Services Stocks,opinion,"Despite the positives in the Business Services  we cannot ignore the headwinds limiting the positives mentioned in                   
Discussed below are some inherent challenges faced by the Business Services sector 
Continuous Spending on Research and Development  Importantly  consulting service providers need to stay abreast with the latest technologies through continuous spending on research and development  The performance of these providers can be hampered if they do not acclimatize to or adopt new services to cope with the latest developments 
Maintaining Skilled Workforce Involves High Costs  Since skilled workers are always in demand  there is a possibility of a high turnover rate in the sector  The training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs  in turn affecting margins  This space needs to have a more skilled workforce to take advantage of technology that develops at a rapid pace 
Competition  Maintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers  As discussed earlier  the main business of one company can be a business service for another  So target customers for both may at times be the same 
Therefore  a business service provider needs to be adequately equipped to win over customers  While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures  relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services 
Regulatory Hurdles  By virtue of having operations across the globe  service providers face regulatory hurdles and compliance related issues  The Western Union Company  NYSE WU   WU  expects compliance costs to be at the higher end of 3 5   4  in 2017 
MoneyGram International Inc   MGI  is being probed by a federal grand jury in relation to its consumer anti fraud and anti money laundering programs from 2003 to early 2009  The company is also involved in many other government investigations and litigations  Any adverse results might lead to potential liability against damages  which could put pressure on margins and cash flows 
Taking into consideration an unfavorable Zacks Rank  we prefer to avoid Acacia Research Corp   ACTG   Fang Holdings Ltd   SFUN   Liberty Tax  Inc   TAX  and Core Mark Holding Company  Inc   CORE  carrying a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
You can see  
To Conclude
The dearth of skilled labor in the business services sector can affect its prospects  Non availability of quality workforce at a reasonable rate might increase overall operational costs 
In addition  the highly fragmented nature of the industry makes it difficult for such companies to set a distinct trend or predict a concrete future for it

compared with 1 08  for the other months  Historically  the period between the end of April and the end of October  had been the worst  six months  for the Dow and the S P 500  while the period between June end and October end is considered the worst for the Nasdaq This bearish trend  however  hasn t played out so far this year  All the major indices continued to scale record highs on

developments including catastrophic hurricanes  threats of war from North Korea and cyber breach at credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  Given such positives  the month of October is not likely to put an end to the bull market  Equities  moreover  have a reputation of maintaining gains as the fourth quarter is usually the strongest  This calls for investing in some rock solid stocks this month for

low inflation Trump s Tax Policy ProposalsTrump has urged Congress to move fast with the lowering of corporate taxes and had recently held a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss a tax deal  He has been working on a major tax overhaul in more than three decades  Ever since 1986  the tax code hasn t been restructured  when President Ronald Reagan along with a divided Congress broadened the tax base and slashed marginal tax rates Trump proposed a multi trillion dollar tax cut that would boost the U S  economy and drive corporate profits  Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 20  from 35   Low corporate tax will benefit businesses of all sizes  as most of them will see the improvement in their bottom lines 5 Top Performing Stocks for

112577,334092,EFX,Ahead Of Jobs Data  Lennar Beats On Home Sales,opinion,"Tuesday  October 3  2017After a busy week of new economic data   as well as speeches from members of the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC    last week  this week we look toward September employment metrics  The first of these will come out ahead of the opening bell tomorrow with the ADP   NASDAQ ADP   private sector jobs totals for last month  followed by Friday s all encompassing non farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Expectations are for roughly 150 160K new jobs for the month  with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4 4  However  sometimes an earnings report from a particular company can illustrate the relative health of industries on a more macro level  and this morning we see results from new home builder Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN    This company has now beaten earnings estimates for the seventh straight quarter  which is impressive  Other reads also point to a solid fiscal Q3 2017  August   which include improved demand and higher price points along the way Lennar is based in Miami  FL  which took an indirect hit from Hurricane Irma a month ago  However  we don t see much negative impact in the company s Q3 as a result  this will likely become more obvious in the company s Q4 report  and possibly beyond   Q3 earnings of  1 06 per share topped expectations by a nickel  Revenues in the quarter rose 15  year over year to  3 26 billion  ahead of the  3 22 billion in the Zacks consensus  A higher number than expected of new homes delivered was cited for the company s outperformance Lennar also saw an increase of 20 basis points on home sales gross margin  and financial services rose 12 3  year over year  Part of this came from very impressive multi family home sales growth  up 26 7  from Q3 2016 to  103 4 million in the quarter  Further  expenses were ratcheted down a tad in Q3  with SG A costs down 9 2  year over year So what we see in microcosm here   and it will take reports from Lennar competitors such as D R  Horton   NYSE DHI   and Beazer Homes   NYSE BZH   in weeks to come to flesh out these narratives   that the new home market is showing signs of growth  They look modest  but the numbers are all pointed in the right direction  And as new homes are bought by families currently in rental units and or at home with Mom and Dad  this opens up availability for more consumers to enter those rental units  Those in starter homes may more easily upgrade to their  dream homes   helping accelerate the cycle  This is especially important as the baby boomer generation decides to downsize to smaller homes and assisted living facilities The pre market is up again across the board  following a new set of all time closing highs for the Dow  Nasdaq and S P 500  Even the more volatile Russell 2000 Small Cap looks strong  Find out more from Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras  latest Profit from the Pros   Mark VickerySenior EditorCan Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio

112578,334093,EFX,The September To Remember,opinion,"Given the volume of recent memorable events  it appears September will become a month to remember  Not only did we witness horrific natural disasters in Texas  Florida  Puerto Rico  and Mexico but Americans have also had to digest the saber rattling by the North Korean  Rocket Man  leader  Kim Jong Un   If that wasn t enough  there were a slew of headlines detailing the Washington gridlock and dysfunction over healthcare legislation   tax reform  hackings at Equifax  NYSE EFX  affecting up to 143 million credit accounts  the planned unwinding of the Federal Reserves  4 2 trillion bond portfolio  and a controversy over NFL football players kneeling during the national anthem 
Despite all these notable events  the Dow Jones Industrial Average just posted its 8th consecutive quarter of advances  For the three months ending in September  the Dow impressively climbed more than 1 000 points   4 7   to a new record high of 22 381  For the year  the Dow remarkably has risen approximately  13   excluding dividends  which translates into a total 2017 return of more than  15   thus far 
However  not everybody has participated in the financial party  Negative political headlines have by and large paralyzed the hearts and minds of the general public  but as I have been writing for some time  stocks do not care much about governmental affairs   stock prices care about fundamentals  There have been two critical  fundamental components fueling the repetitive new highs experienced in the stock market  1  The extraordinarily persistent surge in corporate profits  see chart below   and 2  The stubbornly declining interest rates  which are near generationally low levels  When investors are offered next to nothing interest rates in their bank accounts  and coupon payments on Treasury bonds remain paltry  10 Year Treasury closed month at a yield of 2 33    suddenly stock opportunities can look much more attractive in a scarce investment environment

And geographically speaking  the rise in corporate profits has not been limited to the U S  There has also been a synchronized escalation in corporate earnings globally  Whether we are talking about Europe  China  or emerging markets  in general  the economic recovery in these regions is now occurring coincidentally with the U S  Case in point is the Purchasing Managers Index  PMI   which serves as a broad indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector  The chart below highlights the  over the last year and a half

In addition to these numerous positive factors  a cheaper  weaker  U S  dollar has also contributed to our nation s economic tailwind  More specifically  a lower valued dollar makes American goods sold abroad cheaper for foreign buyers  This currency exchange rate dynamic is important because 43  of Fortune 500 sales  S P 500  are  
Tax Reform to be Born 
You probably don t need me to tell you that gridlock in Washington D C  is alive and well  but new details surrounding potential tax reform legislation that surfaced last week has lifted short term investor optimism  As you can see from the chart below  the U S  has the highest corporate tax rate among 35 developed countries in the OECD  Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development   thereby making U S  business less competitive globally  In hopes of reversing this trend  a basic framework was introduced by the President that proposed a top corporate rate of 20   top small business rate of 25   and streamlined personal tax brackets of 12   25   and 35   down from 7 brackets   Other key elements of the tax plan include  a doubling of the standard deduction for middle class Americans  the elimination of the estate tax for the wealthy  the repeal of the alternative minimum tax  and immediate tax write offs for business capital investments 

Source  The Financial Times
Many other important details have yet to be released and further specifics remain to be negotiated on Capitol Hill  For example  the removal of deductions for state and local taxes was announced  however additional information explaining how the estimated  2 2 trillion in tax cuts will be funded has yet to surface 
Regardless of the tax reform outcome  the economy continues to chug along at a healthy clip  Most recently  Gross Domestic Product  GDP   the central statistic in measuring the health of the U S  economy  was revised higher to a respectable   The latest natural disasters may clip third quarter growth temporarily  however  the consensus remains the economic expansion stands on firm ground  despite the financial drag of the hurricanes 

While geopolitical  meteorological  and athletic anthem headlines have made this a  September to Remember   fundamental strength and other factors have contributed to this enduring and unforgettable bull market  There will be many more noteworthy headlines to occur in coming months and years  but placing these events in the proper context and investing wisely will lead to a much more positive  memorable existence

112603,334118,EFX,Business Services Industry Stock Outlook   September 2017,opinion,"The business services sector includes companies that provide ancillary services to other industries in the market  Companies from this sector help other firms focus on their core competencies  helping them benefit from operating efficiencies  Many of these functions fall within otherwise ancillary areas for most companies    for example  payroll processing  staffing  marketing advertising and information technology  to name some of the major areas 
The outlook for these businesses moves in line with the broader economy  with the business friendly orientation of the current administration widely expected to give the U S  economy a growth nudge 
Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   gross domestic product is estimated to increase in the upcoming quarters  too  GDP growth is now expected to accelerate 2 1  in 2017 and 2 6  in 2018  This favorable outlook for the U S  economy is a net positive for the business service sector as well  No doubt  the sector has been a strong performer this year  with the Zacks Business Services sector up  10 9  in the year to date period  roughly in line with the S P 500 index s  11 4  gain 
The intensely competitive business services sector must diligently work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues in order to maintain profitability  Focus on functions and activities in line with core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale  as well as improving competitive positioning 
Economic sensitivity aside  business service companies are quite conservatively managed  with a large number of players sharing excess cash with investors through dividends and share buybacks  Another attribute of the sector is its highly fragmented nature  with no single service provider enjoying market dominance  Per business reports  the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25  to the sector s total revenue 
Stand Alone Zacks Sector  Favorable
Given the group s unique nature  Zacks has classified it as one of the 16 sectors  the S P s official GIC classification has only 11 sectors where business services are grouped within the  Industrials  sector   Notably  with about 3 4  of total market capitalization  the sector generated 2 8  the total S P 500 income in 2016 
This industry offers an array of services that include marketing  consulting  staffing  security  telecommunications  Internet services  logistics and waste handling  In its expanded sense  the U S  business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about  620 billion  though many of these companies do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry 
Within the Zacks Industry classification  we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries at the medium  M level  and 265 industries at the expanded  X level   We rank all 265 X level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available in the  
We rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries into two groups   the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one  To learn more visit    
Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks   the core of our Industry Rank   has an impressive track record  verified by outside auditors  to foretell stock prices  in particular over the short term  one to three months   We have eight X level industries within the Business Services sector  namely Auction Valuation Services  Business Information Services  Business Services  Consulting  Financial Transaction Services  Outsourcing  Staffing and Waste Removal Services 
Outsourcing at  32  Business Information Services at  36  Financial Transaction Services at  51 and Consulting at  71 fall in the top half 
Waste Removal at  175  Business Services at  181  Staffing at  194 and Auction Valuation Services at  231 are industries that fall in the bottom half 
Our top picks from the Outsourcing industries are Atento S A   ATTO  and Broadridge Financial Solutions  Inc   BR   both carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Bureau Veritas SA  BVRDF  and CBIZ  Inc   CBZ   carrying a Zacks Rank  1 are our top picks from the Consulting industry The Dun   Bradstreet Corp   DNB  and FactSet Research Systems Inc   FDS   carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   are our favorites from the Business Information Services Green Dot Corporation  GDOT  with a Zacks Rank  1  and Mastercard Inc   MA   Visa Inc  NYSE V    V   Total System Services  NYSE TSS   Inc   TSS  and The Western Union Company  NYSE WU   WU    all carrying Zacks Rank  2    are our favorite picks form Financial Transaction Services industry Nevertheless  the sector is among the top 50  of our Zacks Sector classification 
You can see  
Valuation of the Business Service Sector
The valuation of the business service sector seems attractive relative to its own history as well as the broader S P 500 index 
The Zacks Business Service sector is currently trading at a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 9 4X  Over the last 5 years  the sector has traded as low as 8 6X and as high as 12 8X  with a median of 10 6X  In other words  the sector is currently trading below the 5 year median on a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA basis 
On a forward 12 month EPS basis  the sector is currently trading at 20 5X  which compares to the 5 year range of 15 2X and 20 8X  with a 5 year median of 19 3X  In other words  the sector is trading towards the high end of its 5 year forward 12 month P E range 
The sector is trading at a discount to the S P 500 index on the trailing 12 month EV EBITDA basis 
The sector modestly underperformed the S P 500 index in the last one year period  While the sector gained  11 9   the index gained  15 6  
Earnings Review   Outlook
Earnings of the business service sector in the second quarter witnessed 11 1  growth on 4 4  revenue improvement  While bottom line growth was in line with the S P 500  top line growth was shade below index s performance 
Companies will start reporting third quarter earnings in the next few weeks  Earnings are expected to be breakeven  while revenues will grow 2 9   Both compare unfavorably with the S P 500 
For full year 2017  earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 9 4  on 5 4  revenue growth  This compares favorably with the S P 500 s expected earnings increase of 7 5  on 4 6  higher revenues from 2016 
For full year 2018  earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 12 1  on 5 7  revenue growth  This compares favorably with the S P 500 s expected earnings increase of 11 0  on 5 1  higher revenues from 2017 
Notably  our  report shows that Business Service is one of the most impressive sectors in terms of positive growth 
The graph below shows year over year bottom line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S P 500

112604,334119,EFX,Gaming The Stock Market With Poker Smarts ,opinion,"Do you play or watch poker  Even if you don t  you will not regret learning how to apply poker wisdom to investing in stocks 
You can start with the video attached to this article or  for a quick and focused dive  check out this bit of applied wisdom I shared with my TAZR Trader members this week in a portfolio where we ve successfully  gamed  the market and rode several stocks to new highs    while all around us many expert players have said  You can t buy that  It s too expensive  
When You Get the Best of It  Make the Most of It
That s actually a quote by  mathematics of gambling  expert Mason Malmuth  in a book of his I read many years ago titled Gambling Theory and Other Topics 
If you are familiar with the probability and statistics applications of poker to investing  you already know what Malmuth is talking about 
The randomness and viciousness of poker demands that you ruthlessly apply optimally rational probability based thinking to your decisions    in addition to deep and active psychoanalysis of your opponents 
Some players are masters of poker hand probability analysis and want very little opponent interaction  body language facial  reading  or social gamesmanship 
These are the players who wear sunglasses and try to avoid most interaction at the table 
Then there are the true  behavioral scientists  like Daniel Negreanu  Since behavioral finance economics are a pet project of mine    and I started my  this year in dedication to those fascinating arenas    I am vastly interested in all related topics and Negreanu is an unparalleled practitioner of applied behavioral science 
He is so secure with his probability weighted strategies for any given hand that he can spend the majority of his time and attention at the table analyzing  dissecting and  gaming  player behavior and interactions    which is where the real difference and edge is found in games with a high  randomness component  
This focus and meta awareness of the table  the deck  and the players gives him an uncanny ability to determine what cards his opponents are likely holding  It may begin with a hunch or guess  but as he verbalizes  jokes and sometimes taunts other players he can nearly always confirm his suspicions with an amazing degree of accuracy 
If you want to learn how to play poker  better or at all  watch or read Negreanu 
Now  what does this have to do with investing in or trading stocks 
 1  Know Your Probability Scenarios
 2  Play Your Opponents for Both their Strengths   Weaknesses
For us  this comes down to  1  Knowing our risk reward in every trade and then  2  Gaming the institutional demand we expect at different price levels 
Short term technical traders who use price charts and indicators  including volume  live and die by this analysis 
What I do with my short to medium term portfolio  where I may hold fundamentally strong stocks through several quarterly earnings reports  is like a bigger version of the short term technical analysis game  but with the added fundamental and behavioral components 
Cautious Players Who Get It Wrong  Curious Ones Who Get It Right
While big name fund managers like Ray Dalio of Bridgewater or Howard Marks  of value distressed investment firm Oaktree Capital  come out waving red flags  we have to be able to discern if they are being overly conservative  once again  and missing the next leg of a big global economic cycle that could last for another 2 years 
Other successful  players  at the table like David Tepper of Appaloosa  Dan Loeb of Third Point  Steve Mandel of Lone Pine  Lee Ainslee of Maverick Capital  and Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global are not wringing their hands about global macro worries  They are still  heads down  picking stocks  for the long run of 2 to 5 years  Like Alibaba   NYSE BABA   
And it s important to keep the history of this  table  in perspective too  There have been numerous high profile calls for a market melt down in the past 2 years  Jeff Gundlach and the perma bear Albert Edwards from SocGen also come to mind 
But in all their macro analysis  they miss the simplest of factors  technological innovation   investment liquidity   66 trillion tied to global equity markets    stable economic growth and liquidity  favorable interest rates    equities as the premier growth investment over many years of a long cycle 
Overcomplicating this equation only leads to missing great and lengthy rallies 
This has happened several times in my career trading growth stocks  And it is why I think we should still be buying growth stocks on the dips in this bull market to S P 3 000 
Because I have little reason to believe this time will be different 
But if you want to dissect the behavior of one player who is convinced something is wrong and he s throwing in the towel  check out the video that accompanies this article where I share the news this month of a fund manager who called it quits  citing how  wrong  and  almost impossible  the stock market is 
Why You Still Buy Alibaba for  200 and Beyond
I also share more insight on why I remain an investor in Alibaba shares at these levels  It seems every week Jack Ma and company reveal another market initiative that is sure to capture new and expanded sources of revenue in China and globally as they continue their dominant growth in multiple business segments 
And in the video  I also show you which fund managers were still buying or starting new positions in Alibaba in the second quarter 
Finally  I review what s going on with my   200 Club  where I mistakenly sold Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   on Monday and added NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   today  Thankfully  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Align Technology   NASDAQ ALGN   have not been removed 
Disclosure  I own BABA  NVDA  ALGN  and FB shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio

Momentum Trader  It looked like Halozyme Therapeutics  HALO  was going to lose 27 cents this quarter  but then the company entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop cancer drugs  Now  the biopharma company is expected to see a 54 cent gain  Dave thinks this deal could be  the thing that puts HALO on the map   so he joined the breakout today by adding a 12 5  allocation in HALO  Read more in the full commentary  Counterstrike  You don t have to be an investing wizard to know that Equifax  NYSE EFX  is in trouble after its recent hack  The question is  how much trouble  Jeremy thinks the stock price gets cut in half again to around  60  Therefore  the simultaneous bounce in its share price and drop in its Zacks Rank has set up a great opportunity for the portfolio  On Wednesday  the editor shorted EFX with an 11  allocation  Learn more in the full write up  Home Run Investor  It s been a long  slow and steady rise for Blucora  BCOR   and now the company is expected to grow earnings by 28  this year and 20  next year  Dave is excited about this pick and bought it for the portfolio on Wednesday  BCOR is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  provider of Internet based solutions for consumers and business partners  Read the commentary for the editor s complete breakdown of this new pick  Large Cap Trader   What do I think of the tax plan   I wouldn t read too much into it  This has to get through the House and the Senate  Once that happens  if that happens  I think only then  will markets truly care   Tech stocks were the big winner today  On the surface  that could be due to the announcement of tax plan details  However  that is a global growth story  not a USA story  The S P500 did move up  but less convincingly   In my economist mind  it is  watch for action  and NOT listen to words on the tax plan      John Blank Options Trader   What we know so far is that corporate tax rates are expected to drop from 35  down to 20    That s a little higher than the 15  that was talked about prior  but is still a massive decrease from current levels   Fewer tax brackets for individuals  A doubling of the standard deduction  A larger child tax credit  And a repeal of both the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax  

 Of course  this is just the proposal  I m sure it will look different by the time it gets passed into law  And you can be sure you ll see plenty of partisan bickering along the way  But there seems to be genuine interest on both sides of the aisle to cut corporate and middle class taxes   People are calling the tax reform plan  revolutionary  and  transformational   And I couldn t agree more  This has the potential to usher in decades of new prosperity   And that means a soaring stock market      Kevin MatrasHave a Great Evening Jim Giaquinto

112606,334121,EFX,Lithia Motors  Chuy s Holdings  Snap  Facebook And Amazon Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 28  2017    Lithia Motors  Inc   NYSE    NYSE LAD       as the Bull of the Day  Chuy s Holdings  Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ CHUY       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Snap Inc  NYSE    NYSE SNAP        Facebook  Nasdaq    NASDAQ FB      and Amazon Nasdaq    NASDAQ AMZN       Here is a synopsis of all four stocks   Lithia Motors  Inc   NYSE       keeps reporting record earnings even as auto sales slow  How does this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  keep doing it Lithia is one of the largest auto retailers in the United States with 167 dealerships in 18 states  It offers 30 brands of new and used autos along service and body parts Adding to Its StoresOn Aug 8  Lithia announced it acquired the Downtown Los Angeles Auto Group  which operated Audi  Mercedes Benz  Nissan  Porsche  Toyota  and Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  stores in downtown Los Angeles and a Nissan store in Carson  CA This group is expected to generate  1 billion in revenue  and another  0 55 in earnings per share  for Lithia Lithia has been slowly adding to its stable of stores across the country  This opportunity deploys approximately half of the  300 million raised in our recent senior notes offering   said Bryan DeBoer  President and CEO  The remaining funds from the notes offering  our free cash flow and a recently increased syndicated credit facility support our continued growth cadence  Improving performance to realize the full potential of our acquisitions achieves greenfield rates of return   he said Raised Full Year GuidanceDue to this large acquisition  and its impact on earnings  Lithia raised its full year 2017 earnings guidance to a range of  8 55 to  8 70 a share As a result  the analysts raised estimates as well  with 3 estimates rising for 2017 and 5 moving higher for 2018 The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to  8 63 from  8 25 in the last 90 days  That s earnings growth of 16 3  compared to 2016 when it made  7 42 2018 s Zacks Consensus Estimate also rose to  9 44 from  8 74  a gain of 9 4  27th Record Quarter in a RowOn July 28  Lithia reported its second quarter results  Revenue and earnings per share were the highest in company history and it was the 27th consecutive quarter of record results Second quarter revenue rose 16  to  2 5 billion from  2 1 billion in the year ago quarter Key same store sales metrics remained positive even as auto sales weaken Total same store sales rose 3  even though new vehicle sales increased just 1   Used vehicle same store sales helped boost the quarter  as those gained 4  Service  body and parts same store sales also continue to be robust  rising 7    Chuy s Holdings  Inc   Nasdaq       is struggling in the challenging restaurant industry  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is expected to see an earnings decline this year Chuy s is a Texas based Tex Mex restaurant chain  It operates 86 full service restaurants across 19 states where each location offers a unique  unchained  look and feel Comparable Restaurant Sales Drop in the Second QuarterOn Aug 3  Chuy s reported its second quarter results and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 31  It was the second quarter in a row it had met the estimate Revenue rose 7 5  to  94 5 million compared to the year ago period However  comparable sales fell 1  in the second quarter driven by a 2 4  decrease in the average weekly customers offset by a 1 4  increase in average check  The comparable restaurant base was 64 restaurants  The quarter was also negatively impacted by 30 basis points due to Easter falling in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 In response to the weak market conditions  Chuy s has lowered its development target to 12 new restaurants  which was the low end of its range of 12 to 14  for the year  It is also reviewing the 2018 pipeline and intends to be conservative heading into the new year For now  Chuy s expects to open 8 to 12 new restaurants in 2018 Lowered Full Year GuidanceFull year earnings guidance was lowered to the range of  1 04 to  1 08 from  1 11 to  1 15 to reflect the market conditions As a result  analysts also cut their estimates  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate falling to  1 04 from  1 09 just 60 days before  This is an earnings decline of 3 7  as the company made  1 08 in 2016 Comparable restaurant sales growth was also revised down to  1 5   to 0 5  from 0 5  to 1 5   Additionally  this was adjusted in August  before the hurricanes hit  so it s possible that further revisions downward are still to come Additional content Can Snapchat Maintain Its Lead Over Instagram Per market analytics company Jumpshot  as reported by Recode  Snap Inc s  NYSE       messaging application Snapchat added 52  new users in the United States compared with 48  for Facebook s  Nasdaq       Instagram in August  However  the margin seems to be narrowing  On a month over month basis  while Instagram registered an improvement in new additions  Snapchat suffered a decline The scenario is totally different when it comes to the global market  While Snapchat had 38 5  of new signups in August  Instagram registered 61 5   per Jumpshot Growing Popularity of Instagram vs Snapchat s EffortsSnapchat offered serious competition to Facebook in terms of attracting teenagers young adults to its platform  Consequently  Facebook started to mimic Snapchat features on its platforms so as to boost user growth and engagement levels and succeeded in making these more popular than Snapchat The slowdown in Snapchat s user growth is attributed primarily to the popularity of Instagram Stories which is a blatant rip off of the former s hallmark feature In August last year  Facebook added the  Stories  feature to Instagram  In November 2016  Instagram started allowing users to add links to their Stories Later  Facebook launched the same on Messenger  WhatsApp as well as on its main platform Facebook again copied the features of Snapchat by adding augmented reality filters  hashtag stickers and direct messaging features  enabling users to send text and disappearing photos and videos in the chat section  Instagram Stories was recently reported to have crossed 250 million users  substantially outperforming Snapchat s 173 million Snap s primary source of revenues is advertising  A decline in user growth may look unattractive to advertisers and thereby dampen its growth opportunities However  Snapchat is aggressively ramping up its original content efforts in a bid to attract new subscribers and survive tough competition from established players like Amazon  Nasdaq       Prime  Hulu and HBO  Facebook  on the other hand  recently announced its plans to spend  1 billion on original content over the next one year Per eMarketer s latest report  this year  Snapchat s domestic user base is likely to increase 25 8  to 79 2 million driven by a 19 2  increase in users in the 18 to 24 age group  In fact  for the first time  Snapchat is projected to have the highest teen audience  12 to 17   18 to 24 cohorts  compared to both Facebook and Instagram  per eMarketer For Facebook  eMarketer anticipates a 3 4  decline in its monthly average user base for the important 12 to 17 age group  a sharp deceleration from 1 2  decline witnessed last year  An 8 8  growth in Instagram users in the 12 to 17 age group is projected We believe Snapchat needs to focus more on the global market and target other age groups in order to stay ahead in the competition 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax  NYSE EFX  HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of

Koppers Holdings Inc   NYSE    NYSE KOP       and ExlService Holdings  Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ EXLS       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Losing Trades Spring Back to Life in SeptemberAs conflicts between the United States and North Korea intensified and tech behemoths saw sharp declines  capital tiptoed back to sectors that have been underperforming this year  Among such sectors is banks  a group that was headed to record the worst year since 2013 even a month ago  With the Federal Reserve likely to sell off bonds at a gradual pace  Treasury yields moved north  This in turn boosted net interest margin  an important profitability metric for the banking sector Energy companies are also gaining ground this month as crude oil futures entered a bull phase as markets are approaching a rebalancing of demand and supply   Among other prominent reversals were small caps gaining traction  Investors are thrilled that President Trump s renewed initiative to push for a tax reform could spark a revival in such stocks  Before this month  the Russell 2000 index of small caps had seen the highest number of short positions since September 2008 Since these losing trades have sprung back to life this month  investing in the same seems prudent  It has also been a breather for Wall Street strategists as such movements help the bull market scale record highs Banks Ride the Wave of Steepening Yield CurveThe KBW s bank measure has shown better returns this month  climbing more than 4   That s a turnaround from the first eight months of this year  when the index trailed the broader markets by more than 7 percentage points  This is welcome news for market bulls who have added  5 3 billion to financial focused exchange traded funds this year The Fed is widely expected to start reducing its massive portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities after its two day policy meeting ended on Sep 20  This will be for the first time ever that the central bank will unwind its crisis era stimulus program  The bond selloff  in the meanwhile  is pushing the long term Treasury yields higher Additionally  such yields are climbing after U S  consumer prices accelerated in August  U S  consumer prices rose 0 4  last month  the highest one month gain since January  This has pushed the year over year increase to 1 9  from 1 7  in July  Since banks lend over the long term and borrow for shorter periods  an increase in the long term yield is beneficial for them Oil is on Fire   Energy Shares GainThe price of oil has surged more than 20  to trade around  52 a barrel  significantly recovering from its June lows of about  42  Oil prices moved north after major producers said that the global market was on its way toward tallying international demand and supply levels  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries   OPEC    Russia and several other producers had trimmed output by 1 8 million barrels per day  bpd  to match demand levels this year  which propelled oil prices nearly 15  in the past three months Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al Marzouq  who chaired the recently held meeting in Vienna of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee declared that production curbs were helping bring down global crude inventories to their five year average  which OPEC has been striving to achieve for quite some time  While the energy minister from the United Arab Emirates said that the country was complying with OPEC s supply cuts  Nigeria is also pumping below the output cap as per its oil minister Small Caps Regain AppealIt has  undoubtedly  been a rough year for small cap stocks  The Russell 200 index  which tracks small cap companies  lost 1 4  last month but gained 3 4  this month  beating the large cap S P 500 s gain of 1   In fact  on Sep 25  the index had hit an all time high of 1 453  Some analysts believe that such a feat was possible due to a general rotation out of large caps  mostly dominated by technology companies  and into smaller domestic firms However  most analysts opine that investors are upbeat about a tax plan that helped  1 8 billion flow into small caps last week  Trump has promised to cut corporate tax rate from 35  to 15  as the economy has showed signs of progress  Gross domestic product  a broad measure of the goods and services produced in the United States  rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3  in the second quarter  supported by solid consumer outlays and pickup in business investments Slashed corporate tax rates  in ther meanwhile  are particularly a boon for small caps  Being predominantly domestic firms  small caps are less adept at reducing tax bills 5 Solid ChoicesSeptember has seen renewed interest in banks  energy and small cap stocks that have mostly lagged throughout the year  While no single catalyst is responsible for this uptick  it has somewhat signaled a return of confidence in the U S

112677,334192,EFX,Colfax To Gain From Buyouts   Divestments  Risks Remain,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on Colfax Corporation   NYSE CFX   on Sep 26  This machinery stock is poised to benefit from its inorganic initiatives  solid product portfolio and cost saving strategies  The company s earnings are projected to rise 11 3  in the next three to five years In the first half of 2017  the company s shares have yielded 9 6  return  However  exposure to headwinds  including forex woes  industry competition and high debt levels  might restrict Colfax s growth momentum in the near term Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Tailwinds Boosting Colfax s Growth OpportunitiesAcquisitions   Divestments  Over the past few months  Colfax has been restructuring its business portfolio through meaningful acquisitions and asset divestments  Notably  in second quarter 2017  it acquired TBi  a leader in robotic torch technology  and HKS  a developer of advanced process analytics and sensors  These buyouts will strengthen its welding process analytics and robotic welding torches operations in the Fabrication Technology segment  Also  the company anticipates completing the acquisition of Siemens AG s Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH business in the fourth quarter  It will boost the company s Howden trading platform       Recently  Colfax agreed to sell its Fluid Handling business to CIRCOR for proceeds of approximately  860 million  It anticipates recording material gain upon completion of the deal in the fourth quarter of 2017  The asset divestment will enable the company to focus on its core business operations Strategic Initiatives   Diversification Benefits  In December 2016  Colfax claimed to have realized roughly  50 million in savings from its cost reduction programs  Also  the company anticipates realizing another  50 million from its additional cost savings strategies in 2017 In the years ahead  Colfax seems well positioned to leverage benefits from its diversified customer base in the power generation  oil  gas and petrochemical  mining  marine and general industrial and other end markets  Furthermore  international diversity has played a major role in shaping the company s profitability over time  The company operates in the United States  Europe  Asia  the Middle East and South America Promising 2017 Guidance   Long Term Targets  Colfax anticipates benefiting from its organic and inorganic growth initiatives as well as improving end market conditions in 2017  It predicts the Gas and Fluid Handling segment to witness organic growth in the third quarter  It increased its adjusted earnings guidance to  1 65  1 75 per share from the previous projection of  1 60  1 75  The mid point now stands at  1 70 versus  1 68 earlier Over the long run  three to five years   the company anticipates organic growth  CAGR  in the range of 1 2  above Gross Domestic Product  and segment margins to be in the mid teens level Headwinds Posing Threat to Colfax s ProspectsPoor Valuation  On a P E  TTM  basis  Colfax looks overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 24x and 22 9x in the last three month period  This makes us cautious on the stock Diversification Woes   Global Uncertainties   We believe that geographical diversification has exposed Colfax to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo political issues  Notably  in second quarter 2017  the company s net sales and Gas and Fluid Handling s orders declined 0 7  and 1 7   respectively  year over year  due to adverse foreign currency translation  Moreover  as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers both in the United States and international markets  it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries Also  end markets served by Colfax are highly susceptible to global economic conditions  Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial conditions in countries where the company operates  will adversely hurt its sales  earnings and cash flow Stiff Competition  Colfax faces active competition in its Gas and Fluid Handling business from both larger and smaller companies offering similar products and services  or those producing different items for same uses  Some

112759,334274,EFX,Can Chicago Bridge   Iron Resuscitate Its Ailing Fortunes ,opinion,Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V    NYSE CBI   has been plagued by formidable headwinds in recent times  The stock has actually tanked almost 40  in the past year Last month  the company reported dismal second quarter 2017 operating results  which included a bleak guidance and some aggressive measures to counter balance sheet weakness  The company plunged to eight year lows in the aftermath of the results  as investors abandoned the stock in light of the miserable guidance and a dividend suspension This energy infrastructure services firm was forced to take desperate actions to shore up its financial position after reporting an immense drop in revenues and a huge loss  The company s total backlog also fell 7 5  year over year The bottom line was under great pressure as operating expenses and interest expenses both flared up year over year  Consequently  the company reported a colossal GAAP loss of  3 02 per share  in stark contrast to the year ago earnings of  1 09  The company s margins were deeply impacted by a rise in cost at two gas turbine projects and two LNG export facility projects  Interestingly  this is the company s third consecutive quarter of missing both top  and bottom line estimates A key reason for the bottom line loss was that the company booked substantial charges  roughly  548 million pretax  in relation to four Engineering projects  Lower than expected labor productivity  elevated costs for fabrication  and craft labor  weather related delays  subcontractor  and indirect costs were responsible for the cost overruns With respect to guidance  Chicago Bridge   Iron now expects second half earnings of  1 00  1 25 a share on revenues of  3 7  4 0 billion  Combined with revenues of  3 11 billion in the first half  the guidance implies 2017 expected sales of  6 81  7 11 billion   which is well below the previous projection of  9 5  10 5 billion for the year  Further  after racking up GAAP losses of almost  4 a share in the first half of 2017  there seems to be a slim chance that Chicago Bridge   Iron s bottom line will be in the green this year The new CEO  Patrick Mullen  announced several measures to address the company s chronically poor project execution  improve efficiency and strengthen the balance sheet   Chicago Bridge   Iron intends to sell its crown jewel Technology licensing business for roughly  2 billion or more  net proceeds are likely to exceed the company s entire net debt of about  1 5 billion   The company is also implementing a comprehensive corporate and operating cost reduction program  which  it expects  will generate savings of  100 million on an annualized basis Also  the company announced that it would discontinue paying its dividend with immediate effect  The step reflects severe balance sheet weakness  as it mentioned that the dividend cut was apparently necessary in order to satisfy creditors and ensure compliance with certain debt covenants at end of June  The suspension of the dividend is expected to result in annual cash savings of  28  30 million With slumping revenues  bleak guidance  distress sale of a key operating unit and the need for extreme strategic action  we believe the future looks exceedingly uncertain for Chicago Bridge   Iron However  post sale of the technology licensing unit  the company s operations will be more streamlined and will centre on large scale engineering  procurement  and construction  and fabrication capabilities with dominant

112945,334460,EFX,High Fuel Costs Likely To Hurt Airlines Q3 Earnings Picture ,opinion,"Fuel costs account for a major chunk of an airline s operating costs  Hence  decline in fuel costs are a boon for any airline company  In such a scenario  operating expenses of carriers are significantly reduced  thereby boosting their bottom line through huge savings 
However  fuel costs are on the rise lately  with oil prices crossing the  50 a barrel threshold mark  This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks  This upsurge  however  does not spell good news for carriers 
Fuel Cost Outlook Raised by Carriers
It is a well documented fact that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had disrupted airline operations significantly  Harvey contributed to an increase in oil prices due to gasoline shortages caused by the storm  Higher fuel prices are expected to limit earnings growth of carriers in the third quarter  United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   projects fuel price per gallon between  1 72 and  1 77  earlier view   1 56 to  1 61  
Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   also lifted its forecast for fuel prices  The low cost carrier expects fuel price  economic  per gallon between  2 00 and  2 05  earlier projection was in the band of  1 95 and  2 00   Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   also raised its outlook for the same to  1 68  1 73 from the earlier  1 55  1 60 bracket  backed by rise in market price that began in late July 
Labor Costs 
As noted above  decline in fuel costs over the last few years had been a boon for airlines  Evidently  the financial health of carriers had improved significantly by means of huge savings induced by low fuel costs 
The financial prosperity of carriers had not gone unnoticed by their employees  who too were eager to get a share of the pie  This  in turn  propelled frequent new labor deals across the labor intensive airline industry  thus increasing labor costs 
This had dented the earnings picture for airlines over the past few quarters and the third quarter is likely to be no different  With upsurge in fuel costs  the bottom line of airline stocks are expected to dent further this time 
 Top Lines Likely to Be Hurt
Major airline players like United Continental and American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   had to call off multiple flights due to Harvey and Irma  This is likely to hurt their top line in the third quarter  Markedly  the airline companies like United Continental  American Airlines  JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   and Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   also trimmed their unit revenue outlook for the quarter  stung by these headwinds 
As a result  Spirit Airlines expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately  8 5 million  This view takes into account the multiple flights cancelled by the company as well as the continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to Harvey  Weak airfares are likely to pressurize revenues 
Conclusion
The above commentary clearly suggests that turbulence is likely to affect airlines in the third quarter  Furthermore  the rise in fuel costs has proved to be a bane for carriers  In fact  according to the International Air Transport Association   IATA    oil price in 2017 is projected at  54 per barrel for Brent Crude that is above  44 6 per barrel in 2016  This significant increase in the input costs for airlines highlights the gloomy days ahead for the sector participants

Carnival reported earnings of  2 29 per share  excluding  0 46 in non recurring items   which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 20 per share  The company also beat sales expectations  with  5 52 billion in revenues topping our estimate of  5 39 billion  Carnival s quarterly revenues popped 8 2  and increased for the  
What investors might appreciate even more is the fact that the string of powerful hurricanes in the Caribbean  including Hurricanes Irma and Harvey  did not greatly impact Carnival 
The storm s devastation would likely not have affected the company in its third quarter  but Carnival said that it expects to continue full speed ahead during the holiday travel season  having avoided any major impact from the storms 
 Many people throughout these areas have been impacted and several ports are temporarily unavailable   Carnival President and CEO Arnold Donald said in a statement   Fortunately  our owned destinations including Amber Cove  Dominican Republic  Cozumel  Mexico  Mahogany Bay  Honduras  Half Moon Cay and Princess Cays  Bahamas  as well as more than 40 other ports  plus all those in Mexico  are fully operational and welcoming guests

The company now expects full year 2017 net revenues to climb 4   which is up from its June guidance  Carnival projects to post fourth quarter earnings between  0 44 and  0 50 per share and full year earnings in the range of  3 64 to  3 70 a share

The drug  called intepirdine  was being tested in patients that suffered from mild to moderate Alzheimer s and who did not respond to initial treatments  The late stage trial was highly anticipated  but intepirdine failed to improve cognitive abilities and daily activities  it was also compared to a placebo 
 While we are deeply disappointed by these trial results  we also are saddened for the millions of patients and families impacted by Alzheimer s disease   Axovant CEO David Hung said   However  we believe that the fight against Alzheimer s and other important areas of unmet need in neurology is too important to be derailed by this setback  
Alzheimer s is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory  thinking  and behavior  symptoms develop slowly and worsen over time  becoming severe enough that they interfere with daily life  Alzheimer s affects more than 5 million Americans  and is the  in the U S 
While there is no current cure of Alzheimer s  there are treatments available for symptoms  But  have been approved to treat symptoms  with the most recent drug approval in 2003 
Axovant s setback follows that of other companies  Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY    Merck   NYSE MRK    and Denmark s Lundbeck all suffered through failed Alzheimer s drug trials  Similar to Lundbeck s drug idalopirdine  intepirdine is a so called 5 HT6 antagonist  which works to block the 5 HT6 receptor to release acetylcholine  a neurotransmitter that is needed for normal cognition 
Axovant  though  isn t giving up completely  The company is now testing intepirdine in patients that suffer from a condition known as Lewy body dementia  a neurodegenerative disease with symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer s or Parkinson s  This trial s results are expected at the end of the year  The company will also test the drug in patients whose dementia is affecting their balance and gait 
Shares of Axovant are up over 97  year to date  and the stock experienced a nice rally back in April when Dr  Hung came on as chief executive  The company has three other drugs in development  and currently sits at a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank

StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world  the U S  government has been designing submarines for decades  In 1954  the U S  Navy was the first to launch a nuclear powered submarine  These submarines were markedly better than the diesel engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling  Currently  the U S  Navy has three classes of nuclear powered attack submarines   Virginia class  Ohio class and Los Angeles class Notably  the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one in the United States  operated by two prime players like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII    As a result  both the companies enjoy a large share of the market and high profit margins In this context  it is imperative to mention that recently the U S  administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation s defense budget  thereby encouraging submarine manufacturers in boosting their production  Evidently  the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated  8 1 billion for submarines Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor  This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines  The company is also a prime contractor for the development of Columbia class submarines and Virginia class submarines Given the Navy s recent acknowledgement of the nuclear submarines as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same  the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear powered submarine industry Recently  the U S  Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill  The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018  worth  700 billion  includes  25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding  Going forward  the bill is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics  which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the

113015,334530,EFX,Is Ensign Group  ENSG  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Ensign Group  Inc    NASDAQ ENSG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ensign Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 3  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Ensign Group s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 16 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Ensign Group has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 6  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Ensign Group s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ensign Group has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ensign Group currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ENSG a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Ensign Group might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F  This gives ENSG a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen two downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has not witnessed any estimate revision in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen about 3 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Ensign Group  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and

113017,334532,EFX,Should Value Investors Pick HealthSouth  HLS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put HealthSouth Corporation   NYSE HLS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  HealthSouth has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 3  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts HealthSouth s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 17 2  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that HealthSouth has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for HealthSouth s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  HealthSouth has a P S ratio of about 1 2  This is considerably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  HealthSouth currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes HLS a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for HealthSouth is just 1 6  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 9  which is considerably better than the industry average of 14 6  Clearly  HLS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though HealthSouth might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C  This gives HLS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 1 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below HealthSouth Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHealthSouth is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 18  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio  Earlier

113021,334536,EFX,Losing Trades Spring Back To Life In September  Top 5 Picks,opinion,As conflicts between the United States and North Korea intensified and tech behemoths saw sharp declines  capital tiptoed back to sectors that have been underperforming this year  Among such sectors is banks  a group that was headed to record the worst year since 2013 even a month ago  With the Federal Reserve likely to sell off bonds at a gradual pace  Treasury yields moved north  This in turn boosted net interest margin  an important profitability metric for the banking sector Energy companies are also gaining ground this month as crude oil futures entered a bull phase as markets are approaching a rebalancing of demand and supply   Among other prominent reversals were small caps gaining traction  Investors are thrilled that President Trump s renewed initiative to push for a tax reform could spark a revival in such stocks  Before this month  the Russell 2000 index of small caps had seen the highest number of short positions since September 2008 Since these losing trades have sprung back to life this month  investing in the same seems prudent  It has also been a breather for Wall Street strategists as such movements help the bull market scale record highs Banks Ride the Wave of Steepening Yield CurveThe KBW s bank measure has shown better returns this month  climbing more than 4   That s a turnaround from the first eight months of this year  when the index trailed the broader markets by more than 7 percentage points  This is welcome news for market bulls who have added  5 3 billion to financial focused exchange traded funds this year The Fed is widely expected to start reducing its massive portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities after its two day policy meeting ended on Sep 20  This will be for the first time ever that the central bank will unwind its crisis era stimulus program  The bond selloff  in the meanwhile  is pushing the long term Treasury yields higher Additionally  such yields are climbing after U S  consumer prices accelerated in August  U S  consumer prices rose 0 4  last month  the highest one month gain since January  This has pushed the year over year increase to 1 9  from 1 7  in July  Since banks lend over the long term and borrow for shorter periods  an increase in the long term yield is beneficial for them Oil is on Fire   Energy Shares GainThe price of oil has surged more than 20  to trade around  52 a barrel  significantly recovering from its June lows of about  42  Oil prices moved north after major producers said that the global market was on its way toward tallying international demand and supply levels  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries   OPEC    Russia and several other producers had trimmed output by 1 8 million barrels per day  bpd  to match demand levels this year  which propelled oil prices nearly 15  in the past three months Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al Marzouq  who chaired the recently held meeting in Vienna of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee declared that production curbs were helping bring down global crude inventories to their five year average  which OPEC has been striving to achieve for quite sometime  While the energy minister from the United Arab Emirates said that the country was complying with OPEC s supply cuts  Nigeria is also pumping below the output cap as per its oil minister Small Caps Regain AppealIt has  undoubtedly  been a rough year for small cap stocks  The Russell 200 index  which tracks small cap companies  lost 1 4  last month but gained 3 4  this month  beating the large cap S P 500 s gain of 1   In fact  on Sep 25  the index had hit an all time high of 1 453  Some analysts believe that such a feat was possible due to a general rotation out of large caps  mostly dominated by technology companies  and into smaller domestic firms However  most analysts opine that investors are upbeat about a tax plan that helped  1 8 billion flow into small caps last week  Trump has promised to cut corporate tax rate from 35  to 15  as the economy has showed signs of progress  Gross domestic product  a broad measure of the goods and services produced in the United States  rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3  in the second quarter  supported by solid consumer outlays and pickup in business investments Slashed corporate tax rates  in ther meanwhile  are particularly a boon for small caps  Being predominantly domestic firms  small caps are less adept at reducing tax bills 5 Solid ChoicesSeptember has seen renewed interest in banks  energy and small cap stocks that have mostly lagged throughout the year  While no single catalyst is responsible for this uptick  it has somewhat signaled a return of confidence in the U S  economy We have  thus  selected five stocks from such areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy   These stocks also have a  of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G

113039,334554,EFX,Should Value Investors Consider DaVita Inc   DVA  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DaVita has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DaVita s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five year Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at about 18  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that DaVita has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 3  which is higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  DaVita s P CF ratio of 5 4 is significantly lower than the industry average of 9 1  which indicates that the stock is hugely undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DaVita currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DaVita a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P S ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 0 9  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 1  Clearly  DVA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DaVita might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives DVA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and two down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc  Price and Consensus   Even though DaVita has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDaVita is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 18  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  over the past six months  the industry to which it belongs has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to become more favorable  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com

As the security community processes the news and scrutinizes Equifax s cybersecurity posture  numerous doubts have surfaced about the organization s competence as a data steward  The company took six weeks to notify the public after finding out about the breach  Even then  the site that Equifax set up in response to address questions and offer free credit monitoring was itself riddled with vulnerabilities  And as security journalist Brian Krebs first reported  a web portal for handling credit report disputes from customers in Argentina used the embarrassingly inadequate credentials of  admin admin   Equifax took the platform down on Tuesday  But observers say the ongoing discoveries increasingly paint a picture of negligence especially in Equifax s failure to protect itself against a known flaw with a ready fix

A house in Sunnyvale just sold for close to  800 000 over its listing price 
Your eyes do not deceive you  The four bed  two bath house   less than 2 000 square feet   listed for  1 688 000 and sold for  2 470 000 
 I think it s the most anything has ever gone for over asking in Sunnyvale   a record for Sunnyvale   said Dave Clark  the Keller Williams agent who represented the sellers in the deal   We anticipated it would go for  2 million  or over  2 million  But we had no idea it would ever go for what it went for

 Plenty of discussion about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies last week  J P  Morgan s top quant  Marko Kolanovic  wrote 
 Cryptocurrencies cannot be reliably valued and they have significant  tail risk  that could come in the form of a regulatory ban   writes Kolanovic   Moreover  the whole cryptocurrency market exhibits some parallels to fraudulent pyramid schemes  
It s likely that other governments will follow in China s footsteps and crack down on digital currencies  he added 
 While we don t know whether the price of cryptocurrencies will go up or down in the near term  the history of currencies  governments and financial fraud tells us that the future for cryptocurrencies will likely not be bright   according to the strategist

 And the New York Times had a great article which included this description of an Initial Coin Offering 
If you re having trouble picturing it  Imagine that a friend is building a casino and asks you to invest  In exchange  you get chips that can be used at the casino s tables once it s finished  Now imagine that the value of the chips isn t fixed  and will instead fluctuate depending on the popularity of the casino  the number of other gamblers and the regulatory environment for casinos  Oh  and instead of a friend  imagine it s a stranger on the internet who might be using a fake name  who might not actually know how to build a casino  and whom you probably can t sue for fraud if he steals your money and uses it to buy a Porsche instead  That s an I C O

After Hurricane Irma  Florida residents are lacking in many necessities  One of the more frustrating is a scarcity of insurance adjusters  which is threatening to anger policyholders and potentially delay the state s rebuilding efforts 
Many of the state s adjusters responsible for inspecting property damage and estimating the value of the loss are 1 000 miles away  working on claims made after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas 
Insurers are scrambling to get more of the nation s 57 000 independent adjusters to Florida  creating a bidding war and the promise of a record payday for those who are available  Some Florida home insurers have increased fees paid to adjusters by about 30   insurers and adjusters say  In some cases adjusters can earn  30 000 for evaluating a single complex property claim

Moving people from 100 year flood plains will not be a cheap endeavor 
One of the toughest questions  according to Bill Read  a former director of the National Hurricane Center  is what to do about the tens of thousands of homes already in the 100 year flood plain  Houston s median home price last year was  230 000  buying out a hypothetical 50 000 homes would cost  11 5 billion  Acquiring and demolishing every damaged structure would cost more than  31 billion 
Buyouts on that scale are  just unthinkable   Read said 
But Emmett  the Harris County judge  is thinking about it  He said the government should move  as soon as possible   and said it would cost  billions and billions of dollars  
 There s no question we re going to have a large scale buyout of houses in Harris County and in this entire region   he added

113063,334578,EFX,The Third Quarter Ends  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"For the Global Week Ahead  here are five big themes  Reuters says these are likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders 
 1  Third Quarter of 2017 Ends
It s the end of the third quarter  Q3   What a remarkable quarter it has been  
Wall Street and world stocks have climbed to record high after record high  chalking up the longest streak of quarterly gains in two decades  At the same time  volatility has remained anchored at the lowest levels in decades  By some measures  the last few days have been the calmest in U S  stock market history  
Bond markets have also been well behaved  considering many of the world s major central banks are preparing to shrink their balance sheets  There s been a little more volatility in FX  with the euro breaking above  1 20 and sterling recovering sharply this month  
What does that mean for the week ahead  Potentially some profit taking and position squaring as investors lock in what they got during the quarter  If that s the case  some weakness in stocks  bonds and the euro  
 2  U K  Pound Moving Higher 
Sterling has  with a week to go in Q3  has put in its best quarterly performance against the U S  dollar since Q2 2015  
The week ending Sept  9th  when the Bank of England began talking about raising interest rates in what would be its first hike in a decade  was the best for the U K  pound in eight years  
Late last week  a major speech came on Brexit from U K  Prime Minister Theresa May  It did not break much new ground for markets  The U K  pound was slightly lower on the day  raising questions over where the impetus for another move higher in sterling will come from  
 3  Bailouts of Russian Banks 
B N Bank  Russia s 12th biggest lender  became the latest domino to tumble in the country s banking sector  Markets will be on alert for hints of more trouble  
B N s bailout request came three weeks after the rescue of Otkritie Bank  While earlier  licenses were revoked at Yugra bank and Tatfondbank  
Investors reckon more banks will fail  stemming from Western sanctions and unbridled expansion before that  That means Russian financials  shares  down  12  this year  may see little respite  Broader Russian shares have lost  8   Bonds of afflicted banks have fallen heavily  
The central bank will sell bonds and hold deposit auctions to finance the rescue  But if the sums are massive  it could fuel inflation   a setback in Russia s battle against price growth  That would be bad news for the rouble and Russia s local bonds  which have so far easily withstood the bank malaise  
 4  Asian Policy Rates Stay Attractive 
Low inflation is a global pandemic  That also keeps real interest rates in Asia attractive  
It used to be that when the Federal Reserve raised rates  Asia s emerging economies would follow  With the U S  central bank announcing the final stage of its exit from unconventional policies  policymakers are watching for any evidence of risk aversion  
For the moment  though  there are no signs of outflows from the region and there is little pressure to compete for funds with higher rates  In fact  India and Indonesia cut rates in August and could even have room to cut again   perhaps even joined by Thailand  The Thai central bank holds a policy meeting on Sept  27th  
 5  Equifax  NYSE EFX  and Bitcoin 
Equifax and bitcoin have been much on investors  minds this month  
Fallout from Equifax s massive data breach  which compromised the social security numbers and other personal information of as many as 143 million Americans  wiped out more than one third of the company s market value  sending its shares to a more than 2 1 2 year low  
Meanwhile  the price of a bitcoin declined to about  3 000 from a September peak of about  5 100  as Chinese authorities said they would ban trading of the cryptocurrency in their country  
Bitcoin has bounced back above  4 000  But Equifax shares  which fell as low as  89 59 from  142 72 before the scandal broke  have rebounded only to about  96  
If Equifax shares were priced in bitcoin  they would be worth just 2 cents each  So  as investors enter the final quarter of the year  will Equifax or bitcoin be at the top of manager s buy and hold list

Stocks closed near session highs  Most of the day the S P 500 and NASDAQ traded in negative territory  while the Dow Industrials flipped from positive to negative in a tight range  And the S P 500 is now pushing 2500  That seems pretty high  some might say overvalued 
Although the dollar index is up for the past 3 days  since the start of the year  the dollar index is down about 11   so from an international investors view  investing in the S P 500 has been a losing proposition 
In real numbers  stocks are rising  which is what matters most  Going back to the lows of 2009  the S P 500 is now up 269   surpassing the 266  advance notched during the 1949 to 1956 bull market  and that means the current bull market is the third strongest in US history 
At 8 1 2 years  the bull market is already the second longest ever  trailing only the 1990 2000 run during the dot com era  If you look at annualized returns  the market has been running at a less than red hot 17  
Trump kicked off his morning with a pair of tweets urging lawmakers to pass tax cuts and reform  Trump hosted a bipartisan round table with lawmakers at the White House to discuss big issues including tax reform and infrastructure 
It s mid September and Republicans still can t pass a budget  That s because the  is really about tax reform  a clash between Republican leadership and a caucus of arch conservatives who see this moment  months before any major tax bill is likely to come before the full House  as their best chance to force deep cuts to both tax rates and social welfare spending 
The only way to get any deal passed is through reconciliation  In budget reconciliation  each committee is instructed on how much savings it must produce to pass a  reconciliation bill   So  how do you solve a problem like cutting taxes without blowing up the deficit  In any scenario  Republicans are relying on projections of increased economic growth from tax cuts to offset the revenue losses from those cuts 
But under most projections  growth alone won t be enough to offset the full losses from the deepest tax cuts  and that leaves spending cuts  But Republican leadership has promised an increase in defense spending  so that means big spending cuts elsewhere  Democrats and Republicans are unlikely to work together  and the Republican Party is polarized between its own moderates and conservatives 
No budget resolution means no tax reform  Do you know the tax reform plan  No  and you are not alone  The tax reform plan has not seen the light of day  House Speaker Paul Ryan said a tax reform  outline  will be released the week of Sept  25 that reflects the consensus of the two congressional tax committees and the Trump administration  Ryan said the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee would take input after the outline is released and produce bills  in the weeks ahead  
Congress won t vote again this year to raise the debt ceiling  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says  He said  to extend the borrowing limit to December 8 doesn t eliminate the so called  extraordinary measures  the Treasury secretary can use to keep borrowing 
Meanwhile  the Treasury Department reported this morning that the federal government ran a  of  108 billion in August  just slightly more than in the same month a year ago  For the fiscal year to date  however  the shortfall is running well ahead of where it was in August of last year  Through this August  the deficit is  674 billion  up 9  from the year ago period  So far  this fiscal year  spending is up 3  compared to a year ago  and receipts are up 2  
A handful of Republican senators will fight to repeal Obamacare until the last possible moment  They have less than three weeks  Sens  Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham have unveiled the latest version of their health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare  they have until the end of September to pass the bill using the special budget procedure that allows the legislation to advance without any Democratic votes 
The bottom line is cuts to federal health care spending  in the name of more state flexibility  On its face  this new legislation would encounter many of the same problems that earlier Republican health care bills did  Medicaid cuts and coverage losses  Meanwhile  bipartisan talks have gotten underway for a narrow bill to help stabilize  not roll back  the health care law 
Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled the 2017 version of his  Medicare for all  legislation  shifting talk of single payer on Capitol Hill from an abstract conversation over whether the government should provide universal health coverage to a concrete discussion of a specific bill 
Everything from primary care to hospital stays would be covered under the plan without a requirement for out of pocket spending on deductibles and co payments  And patients could still use private insurance programs to cover services deemed not medically necessary by doctors  like cosmetic surgery 
With Republicans in control of Congress  single payer won t pass  but the idea of single payer universal health care is gaining popular approval  a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds 53  of Americans support the idea 
Inflation at the wholesale level rebounded toward the end of summer  but most of the increase reflected higher gasoline prices  The producer price index  or PPI  rose 0 2  last month  A nearly 10  jump in the cost of gas accounted for most of the increase in wholesale inflation last month  Wholesale food costs  on the other hand  posted the biggest decline in more than two years 
The latest snapshot on wholesale prices  however  indicated that inflation is still muted  Aside from fuel  prices of most other goods and services were little changed  The price of fuel could remain elevated for a while after all the damage caused to refining operations in the Houston area after Hurricane Harvey 
What s more  Hurricane Irma caused widespread fuel shortages in Florida that could keep pressure on fuel costs nationwide as supplies are rushed to the state  The increase in prices in August pushed the 12 month rate of wholesale inflation to 2 4  from 1 9   just a tick below a five year high  The yearly change in the so called core rate of inflation  however  was unchanged at 1 9  
Gasoline prices nationwide have surged to  2 65 a gallon from  2 34 in mid August as flooding from Harvey disrupted fuel supplies  according to American Automobile Association data  The rise in gasoline prices is one reason why bond markets are starting to price in faster inflation 
Hurricane Irma just went from bad to worse  Eight people are dead and more than 100 have been evacuated to hospitals from a nursing home that had no air conditioning  The nursing home  the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills  had electricity but the transformer that powered the air conditioning failed  The police and state authorities were conducting a criminal investigation into the deaths  Florida Power and Light was alerted to the power outage on Tuesday but they did not send help

Are they right 
Is Bitcoin a modern day tulip bubble leading greedy investors to the slaughter 
Well  yes AND no 
It s complicated 
I agree with both men that it s a dangerous speculative trade right now  It is in a bubble  but we re likely not near the top yet 
And  as a currency  Bitcoin is a fraud   it s absolutely NOT a currency currently   but the underlying technology  blockchains et al   will revolutionize the way we protect our personal information and the way we transact 
It s the foundation for the bottom up economy we re becoming 
Let s tackle each point in turn 
Bitcoin breached  4 000 per unit recently  And it s gone up and down like a yo yo  Just look at this chart  which contains both Bitcoin and Ethereum 

The most recent run in both is clearly a bubble  But  apply Elliott Wave Theory to it and it looks like only a third wave up  This means there s now a fourth wave crash already in motion and then another steep fifth wave up ahead 
And this should be just the first stage of a very long term boom in the underlying technologies 
The thing to understand here is that these digital coins are trading more like the stocks of these early stage companies than a credible currency substitute  They are not behaving like currencies  they re not currencies yet  and they re certainly not a stable store of value 
But with decades of high growth  scale  efficiency  and consolidation  digital currencies could supplant central banks with bottom up creation and much more stable values 
I hope I see that in my lifetime  Stick it to the Central Banks  Man alive  I hate them 
That said  in the near term  like Jamie Dimon  I wouldn t touch any Bitcoin speculation with a 10 foot pole  If it drops back to around  2 000  and if Ethereum gets near  150  then it could be worth a play  but only as a high risk speculative one for a small part of your portfolio 
Beyond Bitcoin
Cryptocurrencies are one thing  The technologies they re built on are another thing entirely  And it s the latter that has really captured my imagination 
For years now I ve entertained growing concerns about the safety and security of the internet  In 2015  my computer and email was hacked twice in six weeks  My credit cards still get hacked regularly and I m forced to change them every three or four months 
The internet is great for googling information and communicating through email and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and other social platforms  but hackers are in control like the Russian mob  Online financial transactions  and online personal details  are simply not safe or secure  Equifax  NYSE EFX  recently offered a brutal reminder of this fact 
Blockchain technologies could be the answer here  They could become a new platform for transactions  providing greater transparency  practically unbreachable security  faster speeds and lower costs 
Don Tapscott  a Canadian business executive  author  consultant  and speaker calls it  the Internet of Value or Money  
To people like Don and me  and even Steve Jobs  information technologies  and now blockchain  are all about bringing power to the people and eliminating centralized intermediaries 
Put the information  the transaction power  the control over our own identity in our own hands and let us deal directly  peer to peer  This will allow our economy and businesses to organize around customers and operate from the bottom up  not the top down 
Based on the venture capitalists clamoring to back blockchain technologies    1 1 billion has been invested since 2013   this is a serious new technology and not some flash in the pan  Yet to compare  internet companies got much more during their early days 
My 45 Year Innovation Cycle sheds some light on this 
There s a big difference between new technologies in their early stages in niche markets and their later stages moving into the mainstream 
The last such mainstream cycle around personal computing and the internet ran from 1988 into 2010  Before that it was electricity  phones  cars  radios  and TV from 1942 to 1965 
It s during that move into the mainstream that whole new major industries and leading edge companies are created and growth and productivity soars 
I see blockchain technology as the next step in the  maturing  internet revolution  It s not yet a major new industry and job creator  But it could be  one day  as the next mainstream revolution is set for 2032 to 2055 
The internet made information radically more accessible and affordable  if not free  
That s what blockchain technologies propose to do for financial transactions 
And like Uber and Airbnb  this technology will initially be deflationary  It will lower costs and destroy more jobs than it creates  It will disrupt the centralized  and often corrupt  financial services industry 
But like Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  and other companies that followed maturing trends with lower costs  this will paradoxically free up spending power for the everyday person and create easier access to the economy and the financial system 
This is part of how we recreate the middle class again  just like we did after World War II 
This is a big and eventually lifechanging deal 
Just don t speculate on Bitcoin  It s in a bubble  Not of the tulip bubble proportions  but bubbly enough to burn you ",2017-09-19,Harry Dent,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-and-blockchain-hype-or-fundamental-financial-revolution-200214015,200214015

The Dow and the S P 500 hit record highs  The Dow has posted gains for 7 consecutive sessions and 5 consecutive record high closes  The was the 40th record high for the Dow this year 
The S P 500 topped 2500 Friday and held that milestone level today  At the start of the year  bullish analysts were anticipating S P 2500 by the end of the year  so take the next 3 months off  go home and relax 
Assuming nothing explodes  the big economic event this week will be the Fed FOMC meeting  The Fed is expected to begin Quantitative Tightening by beginning to sell off some of its  4 5 trillion dollar in Treasuries and mortgage backed securities 
On Wednesday  the Fed will wrap up its 2 day meeting on monetary policy and likely announce that it will start selling in October  just a little bit  at first  You ll hardly notice  they say  or at least they hope you won t notice  Fed policymakers hope the sell off will be like watching paint dry 
The central bank is trying to avoid a repeat  taper tantrum   the swift run up of nearly 1 percentage point on the yield of the 10 Year Treasury in 2013 after then Chairman Ben Bernanke discussed the tapering of bond purchases for the first time  And so  the Yellen led Fed has been extremely transparent about its plans to start selling some of those bonds 
It seems inevitable that such a big seller will push down prices  which would  in turn  push yields higher  And yet  that has not been the bond market response  The Fed announced plans for a sell off in July  and since then  yields on the 10 year Treasury note have sunk from 2 28  to a low of 2 04  before bouncing back up to 2 23  today  The 2 Year note remained flat during that same time 
The plan that has been laid out calls for the balance sheet to initially shrink by only  10 billion per month  The pace of the run down would then increase by  10 billion every quarter  up to a maximum of  50 billion per month  And the Fed is expected to keep a very sizeable balance sheet 
And other central banks around the world are still buying  so there are plenty of buyers to soak up the excess  There s momentum in the market  There s lots of cash  Even though the Fed s about to reduce their balance sheet  you continue to have aggressive global monetary policy 
 said it would buy the missile and rocket maker Orbital for about  7 8 billion in cash  with plans to establish a new  fourth business sector  Orbital has billion dollar contracts with NASA as well as the US Army 
The deal  expected to close in the first half of 2018  comes as the firing of missiles by North Korea in recent months has focused attention on missile defense systems  Northrop s offer price of  134 50 an Orbital share represents a premium of 22  over the stock s Friday close

Maria is now a Category 4 as it moves closer to the islands over the next 48 hours  It is still too early to predict if Maria will hit the US mainland  Meanwhile  Hurricane Jose is traveling up the East Coast of the US and could affect an area from North Carolina to New England  The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning for parts of New England 
The National Association of Home Builders  index for September showed that builder confidence in the market for newly built single family homes dropped during the month on worries that the recent hurricanes will make it difficult to find workers and materials  The NAHB Wells Fargo housing market index fell 3 points to 64  and August s reading was cut by a point to 67 
Obamacare repeal is on the brink of coming back from the dead  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his leadership team are considering voting on a bill that gets rid of the individual and employer mandates and the 2 3  tax on medical devices  and block grants money to states  leaving reform up to governors 
It would be a last ditch attempt to repeal Obamacare before the GOP s power to pass health care legislation through a party line vote in the Senate expires on Sept  30  No final decision has been made  but the GOP leader has told his caucus that if the bill written by Sens  Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy has the support of at least 50 of the 52 GOP senators  he will bring it to the floor and once again the fate of repeal may rest with Arizona Senator John McCain 
Democrats are demanding a Congressional Budget Office score on the latest Obamacare repeal plan  The CBO  a non partisan fiscal analysis unit of Congress  said it will make a preliminary assessment of the bill s impact next week  But it said it won t be able to estimate the impact on the deficit or changes in insurance coverage or premiums for several weeks 
The Justice Department is investigating whether Equifax  NYSE EFX  executives violated insider trading laws when they sold Equifax shares before the company disclosed the hack  The three senior executives dumped almost  2 million worth of stock days after the company learned of the breach 
The company s first order of business ought to have been to create a simple way for people to figure out if their data was potentially compromised  On this count  Equifax failed and continues to fail 
If you have tried to go on the Equifax site to see if your data has been compromised  you have probably been bounced from here to kingdom come and arrived at the idea that Equifax has no idea who or what has been compromised  By the way  the FTC has issued a scam alert   if someone calls you on the phone and says they are from Equifax  they are not  it is a scam  hang up 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has ordered National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts and their debt collector  Transworld Systems to pay at least  21 6 million in penalties and restitution for illegally filing debt collection lawsuits 
According to the agency  the companies allegedly sued borrowers without being able to prove the debt was owed or pursued collection on loans that were too old to sue over  and relied on false and misleading legal documents  A federal judge must still sign off on the judgments against the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts  a collection of 15 trusts that own more than 800 000 private student loans 
Toys R Us  the largest toy retailer in the country is expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today  The timing is unusual  just before the start of the holiday shopping season  Toys R Us vendors fell on the news  Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  dropped 6 2   Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  down 1 7   While this bankruptcy might be considered just another brick and mortar firm falling to online sales  the reality has more to do with private equity firms  KKR and Bain  loading up a successful firm with debt 
Last week  Chase Bank CEO Jamie Dimon recently rejected Bitcoin as a  fraud   likely causing additional sell offs after the news of the Chinese exchange ban was released  Dimon commented that Bitcoin was in a bubble not unlike the famous Tulip bubble during the 17th century  However  in a somewhat surprising move  JP Morgan purchased a large block of Bitcoins just after the CEO s harsh criticisms ",2017-09-19,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-streak-200214026,200214026
113115,334630,EFX,Four Dumb Facts About The Equifax Hack ,opinion,"Hey everybody  Dave Bartosiak here with Trending Stocks at Zacks com giving you the four dumbest things about the Equifax   NYSE EFX   hack 
In case you haven t heard  hackers breached the data of credit agency Equifax and made off with a few social security numbers and sensitive information  A few million  Well  143 million to be exact  So basically nearly half of the US population  That s right folks  the place that tricks off on you for missing one credit card payment two years ago when you had the stomach flu and sets you up for a 20  loan on your Miata as punishment for your irresponsible behavior  allowed 143 million customer s data to be hacked  Dumb  Oh  it gets better 
Dumb fact number two  the hack wasn t a one time event  Hackers exploited a security flaw which was 9 years old  slowly accessing the data over several months  We have attained footage of the hackers cracking the code 
The vulnerability was in a popular open source software package known as Apache  NYSE APA  Struts  What s even crazier is that at least 65  of Fortune 100 companies still use web applications built with the Struts framework  Information comprised includes names  Social Security numbers  birth dates  addresses and driver s license numbers  About 209 000 consumer s credit card numbers were stolen as well  Boy am I glad Equifax gets to tell potential lenders about how responsible I am with life 
Dumb fact number three  is that three Equifax execs  including the CFO  sold shares in early August  6 500 shares by the CFO  4 000 by the president of their US Information Solutions unit  and 1 719 shares by another president  Doesn t sound like much money  but when you price them at  146  it s a pretty good chunk of change  The company knew about the hack on July 29th  But  before you give these guys a black eye  they each have a history of selling shares and in the grand scheme of insider compensation  this is a drop in the bucket  All three of these guys still own over 40 000 shares 
Dumb fact four  in an attempt to stop the bleeding  Equifax created a website that would allow consumers to check if they were affected by the breach  In the fine print you have to agree to in order to check if you are affected  they snuck in a line saying you would waive your rights to sue Equifax or be part of any class action lawsuit 
I suggest everybody out there take a detailed look at your credit report using anyone but Equifax  When you do  dispute any inaccuracies  The bureau has 30 days to respond to your dispute  If they don t respond within 30 days  the item is dropped from your report  With the flood of disputes Equifax is likely to get now  you may finally be able to resolve some lingering issues like that collection account from your days as an Enzyte customer Equifax  Inc  Price and Consensus   Obviously the market didn t like the breach  sending Equifax shares tumbling since the move  After trading over  142 last week  shares have tumbled down to  113  We ve still got it as a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  right now as most analysts haven t jumped out and dropped earnings estimates yet  Those which have commented on the breach believe the stock is oversold  I d wait until the Congressional hearings to initiate a position for those looking to buy the dip

113117,334632,EFX,Equifax Drops After Massive Security Breach ,opinion,"In a world where the internet is ubiquitous  no online service is completely safe from hackers  Credit reporting company Equifax Inc  NYSE EFX   said last week that  its systems were struck by a cyberattack   Up to 143 million consumers in the U S  may have been affected  Some U K  and Canadian residents were also compromised in the breach     Social Security numbers  birth dates  addresses and driver s license numbers   Furthermore  the  credit card numbers for about 209 000 consumers were also accessed   The hackers were able to use a vulnerability on a U S  website application to gain access to certain files from mid May through July of 2017   The intruders also accessed dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182 000 consumers   Though the attack was stated to have begun in mid May  the breach was not discovered until July 29 
Since exposing one of the largest hacks of the year  the compromised company is now facing dozens of federal lawsuits  More than  have been filed so far  In one case Equifax is accused of misleading shareholders about its ability to protect consumer data  The agency knew about the hack more than a month before the truth came out  The lawsuit claims the company inflated financial statements to bring up the share price  before being exposed  According to   another lawsuit was filed in Portland  Oregon   Customers say that Equifax has been negligent when it comes to information security  Two firms are leading the class action lawsuit  Olsen Daines PC and Geragos   Geragos  The plaintiffs are Oregon residents whose information was stored by the agency and hacked by an unauthorized third party  They re asking for billions in damages   If successful this could cause major financial difficulty for Equifax as the company only makes about  600 million in earnings each year 
After Equifax announced the security breach about  3 billion was wiped away from the company s market cap as its shares dropped as much as 17  in the immediate trading session  On Monday key law makers demanded a detailed account of the company s security systems  They are concerned that customer s sensitive information was not properly protected 
The unfortunate thing is that consumers who never signed up for Equifax services may still be affected by the hack  If you feel that you may be a victim of this security breach there are a few things you can do  such as place an initial 90 day fraud alert on your file  This is free and will require lenders to contact you if someone  including yourself  tries to apply for any kind of new credit  Government info  The good news is you only have to do this with one credit bureau in order for the alert to be placed on all three

113136,334651,EFX,Watch Out  Deep Subprime Auto Loan Delinquencies Reach 2007 Levels  ,opinion,"Subprime auto delinquencies have staked up so much that we are back at  


There s a section of the auto loan market   known in industry parlance as deep subprime   where delinquency rates have ticked up to levels last seen in 2007  according to data compiled by credit reporting bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  

 Performance of recent deep subprime vintages is awful   Equifax said in a slide show on second quarter credit trends 
Analysts have been warning for years that subprime car loans pose a threat to lenders as delinquency rates have edged higher since reaching a post recession low in 2012  But it wasn t until last quarter that the least creditworthy borrowers started to show the kinds of late payment profiles that accompanied the start of the financial crisis 
 We re seeing an increase in delinquencies across all credit scores  but in the highest credit quality  it s just a basis point or two   Chief Economist Amy Crews Cutts said in an email Tuesday   In deep subprime  the rise is more substantial  What stood out to me was the issuers  Those that have been doing this for a decade or more were showing the  better  performance  while those that were relative newcomers were in the  worse  category  
The reason for the increase  she posited  is that lenders have loosened underwriting requirements as more firms tap into a declining market for car loans  not that there are more customers with worsening credit profiles 
 It isn t a case of chasing a larger subprime share   Cutts said in an email Tuesday  There s been  almost no change in median credit scores  That means they are letting other underwriting characteristics slide   she said  referring to the lenders that issue the bulk of subprime loans   so called monolines that specialize in one area of the credit market and dealer finance companies that work specifically with car sellers 
 As soon as lenders  and the investors behind them  get overconfident that they have better models and can make excess profits by disrespecting credit risk  they always get their hats handed to them sooner or later   Cutts said   The mortgage market learned this lesson at the expense of the entire global financial system  and it is playing out now in a micro level  in the ABS market for subprime auto loans  

The Next Big Short 
Some expect subprime autos will be the next big short  but there is plenty of disagreement 
May 16  2017  Steve Eisman says  
March 27  2017  The Daily Reckoning says  
April 20  2017  former Fed Advisor to Fed Richard Fisher makes the case that households have been squeezed to death and subprime auto loans could be the next major problem for the economy  Video below 

My Take
We likely will not see a credit meltdown in the US like we saw on 2007 
However  subprime loans of all sorts will get smacked hard  So will junk bonds 
A credit crisis in the Eurozone is possible  if not outright odds on  The European banking system is a mess 
Equities are due for a huge slide  but it may take many years to play out as opposed to a quick crash

113141,334656,EFX,Three Equifax Managers Sold Stock Before Massive Cyber Hack Revealed,opinion,"Equifax  NYSE EFX  reports  
Equifax discovered the breach on July 29  Yet just at the end of last week  the public was notified of the breach  In the interim  three Equifax executives dumped about  1 8 million in Equifax shares 
Hey  why not  It s only a  small percentage  of their holdings 

Credit reporting firm Equifax reported on Thursday a breach in which cyber criminals gained access to personal information on as many as 143 million U S  consumers 
The firm said the  cybersecurity incident  resulted in hackers accessing names  Social Security numbers  birth dates and other personal information on as many as 143 million consumers  The U S  population is estimated to be around 324 million  according to the Census Bureau 
Thousands also had their credit card numbers and dispute documents accessed 
Equifax said in a statement that hackers  exploited a U S  website application vulnerability  to gain unauthorized access to the files between mid May and July  However  the company s investigation has turned up  no evidence  that hackers accessed the company s core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases 

Don t Worry  It s Not  Core Data 
Hackers got 143 million credit card numbers  social security numbers  and birthdates 
Don t worry  that s not core data 
Time To Dump Stock
Bloomberg reports  

Three Equifax Inc  NYSE EFX   senior executives sold shares worth almost  1 8 million in the days after the company discovered a security breach that may have compromised information on about 143 million U S  consumers 
The credit reporting service said late Thursday in a statement that it discovered the intrusion on July 29  Regulatory filings show that three days later  Chief Financial Officer John Gamble sold shares worth  946 374 and Joseph Loughran  president of U S  information solutions  exercised options to dispose of stock worth  584 099  Rodolfo Ploder  president of workforce solutions  sold  250 458 of stock on Aug  2  None of the filings lists the transactions as being part of 10b5 1 scheduled trading plans 
The three  sold a small percentage of their Equifax shares   Ines Gutzmer  a spokeswoman for the Atlanta based company  said in an emailed statement  They  had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time  
Equifax said in its statement that intruders accessed names  Social Security numbers  birth dates  addresses and driver s license numbers  as well as credit card numbers for about 209 000 consumers  The incident ranks among the largest cybersecurity breaches in history 
Equifax shares tumbled 13 percent to  124 in extended trading at 7 49 p m  in New York 

SEC Investigation Coming
A SEC investigation is undoubtedly on the way  Any findings will be swept under the rug  The absolute worst that likely to happen is a tiny fine  I suspect nothing at all will happen 
Out of the Blue
Here is the key point   None of the filings lists the transactions as being part of 10b5 1 scheduled trading plans  
That s OK   1 8 million is only a  small percentage  
Nothing will be done about this  Instead  every now and then  the SEC will make a case out of someone like Martha Stewart  At the very least  enforce the laws  or don t  This type of action creates mistrust

Why Not Make Insider Trading Legal 
Insider trading laws do not apply to members of Congress  They can be on any committee about to issue a ruling on anything and take advantage  Hey  why not spread the wealth 
That may sound sarcastic  but it s not  Insider trading is not going away 
What precisely is wrong about having information and acting on it 
Had there not been insider trading laws  the public may have found out about this long ago  Instead  insiders dumped shares over time and no one knows how many of their friends got tipped off as well

113142,334657,EFX,The Week Ahead  Have Odds Improved For Market Friendly Policy Agenda  ,opinion,"We have a normal data calendar  Central to stock market prospects is the resolution of several key policy issues  The possible outcomes have a wide range of market impacts  from fear to a major boost in corporate earnings  The debt limit Harvey aid deal between President Trump and Democrats was a surprise to most  Still digesting the implications  the punditry will be wondering 
Have the odds improved for a market friendly policy agenda 
Last Week Recap
My expectation that of a focus on what might go wrong was partly correct  Then the hurricane news and political reactions became the lead stories  There was little market moving data 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500  via Jill Mislinski  The most notable feature is the narrow range  The supposed  delayed reaction  to the N  Korean H bomb story was responsible for the Tuesday dip 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
The Silver Bullet
As I indicated recently I am moving the Silver Bullet award to a standalone feature  rather than an item in WTWA  I hope that readers and past winners    will help me in giving special recognition to those who help to keep data honest  As always  nominations are welcome 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
There was little economic news  but it was generally positive  The negatives were not very significant 
The Good
Wholesale inventories increased 0 6  more than the expected gain of 0 4   This is a positive for GDP  assuming that inventory restocking is needed 
China economic growth looks better   in Dr  Copper 
Non farm productivity increased 1 5  compared to 0 9  last month 
Debt ceiling deal avoids a government shutdown  so it is basically market friendly  The full story is more complicated 
ISM non manufacturing recorded 55 3  up from 53 9 in July  and in line with most expectations    

Job gains better than thought  The preliminary benchmark revision shows that the net job gains for the year ending in March was 95 000 more than expected  This report is important as a check on the aggressive spinning done on every  employment Friday     
Overall global growth continues  Dr  Ed Yardeni has a good analysis with some interesting charts and explanations  Here is a key quote and a chart example 

The global economy is running on all six cylinders  It may not be a global synchronized boom  but it is the most synchronized expansion of economic activity that the global economy has had since the recovery from the 2008 2009 recession 



The Bad
Harvey could imply more mortgage delinquencies  There could be as many as 300K new delinquencies and 160K more that are past due    
Factory orders declined 3 3  versus last month s gain of 3 0   A decline of 3 2  was expected 
Jobless claims spiked  This was the expected Harvey effect   shows the effect clearly 

The Ugly
Irma  Not just another hurricane  The entire state of Florida in the path  Modern modeling and forecasting has helped in evacuating seven million people  One way of measuring the magnitude is the accumulated cyclone energy  ACE   the total wind energy of the tropical system   has these amazing comparisons 

Irma generated the most ACE  44 2 units  by a tropical cyclone on record in the tropical Atlantic and also the most in a 24 hour period on record  breaking the old record set by Allen  1980  


It also generated more ACE than the first eight named storms of this Atlantic hurricane season  Arlene Harvey  combined 

Harvey   puts the extent of the damage in perspective 

Equifax  NYSE EFX   Not only was the confidential information of 143 million people exposed  but the notification was not made for more than a month  Meanwhile  three top executives sold stock before the announcement  Here is  of what might happen and what you can do  There oughta be a law   but there really isn t 
Noteworthy
America s  


The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a normal economic calendar  Most important is retail sales  August   The only July data of real interest is the JOLTS report  which the Fed uses to analyze tightness in the labor market 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
Only three weeks ago we were wondering whether a market friendly policy agenda was in peril  Things can change quickly in the current political climate  The deal between President Trump and the Democrats came late in the week  Avoiding a US credit downgrade is a big threat  A government shutdown would also be a market negative  By contrast  tax reform could provide a major boost  perhaps as much as 8  in expected S P 500 earnings 
Most of what you see or read on this story will be highly political  perhaps with a soap opera quality  That is not our purpose  Buried beneath the popular discussions is a serious question for investors 
Have the odds improved for a market friendly policy agenda 
It is early in the discussion  but here are the key viewpoints 
This was an impulsive decision   a reaction to lack of GOP help on his agenda    
The decision has no implications for future bipartisanship  The House vote was 316 90  but all of the  
The decision just postpones the key issues  Nothing has been solved 
While the circumstances were unusual  it does show that bipartisan action is possible when needed 
As usual  I ll have more in my Final Thought  emphasizing my own conclusions

We follow some regular featured sources and the best other quant news from the week 
Risk Analysis
I have a rule for my investment clients  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

Notes on changes 
We have added a distinction between the technical appeal of the market on a short term  two months or so  and a long term basis  The mildly bearish interpretation does not imply a full exit from trading  It is a warning that conditions are not as attractive 
The nine month recession probabilty from the C Score has moved from  10  to  15  
The Featured Sources 
  Business cycle analysis via the  C Score 
  Strong quantitative indicators for both economic and market analysis 
  All things earnings  for the overall market as well as many individual companies 
  Business cycle indicator and market timing tools  It is a good time to show the chart with the business cycle indicator 
  Regular updating of an array of indicators  Great charts and analysis 
Guest Sources
 raises some concern about what he groups as  consumer long leading indicators   He notes that several of these are somewhat off their peaks   something to watch 
 that the widely followed Shiller CAPE indicator is about to turn less bearish  It will not require any decrease in market price nor an increase in earnings  The earnings decline from the Great Recession is about to drop out of the calculation  Most people do not understand exactly how this measure is determined  so this will be a surprise as the CAPE ratio declines by 10  over two years 
Scott Grannis also notes    that other valuation models show a very different picture 
Insight for Traders
We have not quit our discussion of trading ideas  The weekly Stock Exchange column is bigger and better than ever  We combine links to trading articles  topical themes  and ideas from our trading models   covered the danger in trying to win every trade   has taken the lead role on this post  using information from me and from the models  He is doing a great job 
Insight for Investors
Investors should have a long term horizon  They can often exploit trading volatility 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be this post from Farnam Street    The estimated reading time is two minutes  but I recommend that you linger a bit  Nearly every point is worth pondering  The summary captures the basic idea 

There are a host of other differences  but they can effectively be boiled down to two things  fear and reality 


Amateurs believe that the world should work the way they want it to  Professionals realize that they have to   Amateurs are scared   scared to be vulnerable and honest with themselves  Professionals feel like they are capable of handling almost anything 


Luck aside  which approach do you think is going to yield better results 

This post is loaded with great ideas to help in analyzing your own investment process 
Stock Ideas
Our ideas this week have a focus on yield  although the methodology differs 
 once again combines an interesting stock idea  Smuckers  SJM  with a lesson on how to perform your own analysis  Of special interest is his discussion of dividends versus retained earnings  Consider that some companies pay dividends but do not diminish their power to grow and execute  Others believe that retaining capital assists growth 
 recommends a look at the worst performing of the dividend aristocrats  Check out his list  which includes a few names that we hold 
 notes that Crown Castle  NYSE CCI  is the highest yielding stock held by Bill Gates  I would not use that as my key selection criterion  but it is an interesting idea  He also recommends   NYSE CB  
 from Lee Jackson s screen  These are pretty aggressive 
Blue Harbinger has a first rate analysis  comparing two popular REITs   Ventas  NYSE VTR  and Welltower  NYSE HCN  
Personal Finance
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich has an interesting topic every day  His own commentary adds insight and ties together key current articles  This week  among several good posts  he has one that shows special value both for advisors and investors  His theme is  and he highlights  solid and practical analysis of some key life decisions  Job changing  a big investment decision  or downsizing your home  What I especially like about Gil s series is his interaction with readers  The post stimulated a lot of comments that were worth following up  He did so 
Abnormal Returns has a different topic each day  I read them all  but individual investors might find the  most relevant  There are always many great links  but  about eliminating  or reducing  usage of your car is particularly interesting  There are also several great retirement stories 
Strategy
David Templeton    looks at the trends and reversals in growth and value stocks  The analysis is interesting for those heavily invested in dividend stocks 
A solid investment perspective requires a sound foundation  That is what I do each week with our Indicator Snapshot  Some  including a nearby critic  have suggested that I might possibly  on occasion  be a little verbose   Moi    Here is a valuable alternative source 
 has one of his typical market assessments   both clear and wise 

We re constantly told that it s a reckless bubble that s all about to crash  Or it s all due to manipulation from the Fed  and it s all about to crash  Please  Predicting that the world is about to end is one of the favorite pastimes on Wall Street  Still  the bull marches on  In fact  this year may turn out to be the lowest year on record for the stock market s volatility 


If there s a golden rule for long term investing  it s that betting on disaster is always overpriced  and betting on  it ll all work itself out  is always a bargain

Final Thoughts
Has the political environment improved  Clearly it has  Important legislation was passed that many market participants thought unlikely just a few days ago  These same critics will now have two objections 
The plan is short on specifics 
It only delays the questions 
Those viewpoints demonstrate little understanding of the US political process  Compromise always takes more time than expected  is un liked by everyone  and never begins with specifics 
The Trump Democrat deal changes everything  No one knows for sure what the possible new alignments might be  We only know that they could not be worse than the gridlock we had 
What worries me 
The lack of progress on the North Korean situation and related issues with China  While I do not expect a shooting war  the topic of trade sanctions against North Korea s partners is a danger  This requires careful monitoring 
Wasting the opportunity to shake up existing Washington alliances  Most of the needed policies require bipartisan cooperation between moderates

113171,334686,EFX,Household Debt And Credit Report  Q1 2017 Update,opinion,"As a result of the housing and mortgage crisis of the Great Recession  economists have been paying more attention to the liabilities portion of household balance sheets  Among the New York Federal Reserve Board s many economic reports is the Household Debt and Credit report  which is released quarterly with data going back to 2003 
Data is collected through the NY Fed s Consumer Credit Panel which is constructed from a nationally representative random sample of Equifax credit report data resulting in a sample size of over 40 million individuals quarterly  Here is some background on the report from the NY Fed 

The large increases in consumer debt and defaults of mortgage debt in particular during the Great Recession highlighted the importance of understanding the liabilities reflected on household balance sheets  To that end  one of the CMD s large data collection projects is the New York Fed  which is constructed from a nationally representative random sample of Equifax  NYSE EFX  credit report data  Analysis of this data set is regularly reported in the CMD s Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit  The data set can be used to calculate national and regional aggregate measures of individual  and household level credit balances  and delinquencies by product type  The Consumer Credit Panel also provides new insights into the extent and nature of heterogeneity of debt and delinquencies across individuals and households 

The latest household debt for Q1 2017 was up 1 2  from Q4 and currently at  12 73T  exceeding the 2008 Q3 peak of  12 68T  Here is an excerpt from the latest release 

Aggregate household debt balances increased in the first quarter of 2017  for the 11th consecutive quarter  finally surpassing the 2008Q3 peak of  12 68 trillion  As of March 31  2017  total household indebtedness was  12 73 trillion  a  149 billion  1 2   increase from the fourth quarter of 2016  Overall household debt is now 14 1  above the 2013Q2 trough  Mortgage balances  the largest component of household debt  increased again during the first quarter  Mortgage balances shown on consumer credit reports on March 31 stood at  8 63 trillion  an increase of  147 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016  Balances on home equity lines of credit  HELOC  declined by  17 billion and now stand at  456 billion  Non housing balances were mixed in the first quarter  Auto loans and student loan balances grew  by  10 billion and  34 billion respectively  while credit card balances declined by  15 billion  

The chart below shows total debt balance nation wide by composition in trillions of dollars  The current total is  12 73T  surpassing the last peak in 2008  Notice that even though the current Total Household Debt is greater than it s 2008 high  mortgage debt is still currently lower than during the recession  The student and auto loans  however  have been on the rise 

The next chart drills down into student loan debt and auto loans  It s no surprise the Student Loans have been on the rise

113175,334690,EFX,Household Debt And Credit Report  Up  114B In Q2,opinion,"As a result of the housing and mortgage crisis of the Great Recession  economists have been paying more attention to the liabilities portion of household balance sheets  Among the New York Federal Reserve Board s many economic reports is the Household Debt and Credit report  which is released quarterly with data going back to 2003 
Data is collected through the NY Fed s Consumer Credit Panel which is constructed from a nationally representative random sample of Equifax  NYSE EFX  credit report data resulting in a sample size of over 40 million individuals quarterly  Here is some background on the report from the NY Fed 

The large increases in consumer debt and defaults of mortgage debt in particular during the Great Recession highlighted the importance of understanding the liabilities reflected on household balance sheets  To that end  one of the CMD s large data collection projects is the New York Fed  which is constructed from a nationally representative random sample of Equifax credit report data  Analysis of this data set is regularly reported in the CMD s Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit  The data set can be used to calculate national and regional aggregate measures of individual  and household level credit balances  and delinquencies by product type  The Consumer Credit Panel also provides new insights into the extent and nature of heterogeneity of debt and delinquencies across individuals and households 

The latest household debt for Q2 2017 was up 0 9  from Q1 and currently at  12 84T  exceeding the 2008 Q3 peak of  12 68T  Here is an excerpt from the latest press release 

NEW YORK   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York today issued its which reported that total household debt increased by  114 billion  0 9   to  12 84 trillion in the second quarter of 2017  There were modest increases in mortgage  auto and credit card debt  increasing by 0 7   2  and 2 6  respectively   no change to student loan debt and a modest decline in balances on home equity lines of credit  decreasing by 0 9    The Report is based on data from the New York Fed s Consumer Credit Panel  a nationally representative sample of individual  and household level debt and credit records drawn from anonymized Equifax credit data  

The chart below shows total debt balance nation wide by composition in trillions of dollars  The current total is  12 84T  well exceeding the 2008 peak  Notice that even though the current Total Household Debt is greater than it s 2008 high  mortgage debt is still currently lower than during the recession 

The next chart drills down into student loan debt and auto loans  It s no surprise the Student Loans have been on the rise

113209,334724,EFX,Vail Resorts  Illumina  Coca Cola  Boston Scientific And Equifax Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   October 26  2016    highlights definitely Vail Resorts  NYSE     as the Bull of the Day Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   NASDAQ      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Coca Cola  NYSE     Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX   NYSE     and Equifax  NYSE EFX   NYSE      

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

	I last wrote about Vail Resorts  NYSE      as a Zacks  1 Rank Strong Buy in December as analysts continued to raise earnings per share  EPS  estimates and price targets  and the stock climbed to new highs above  130 on excitement about the newly renovated Park City asset 

	What s changed about this story in the past 3 quarters  It s only gotten better 

	For a base of comparison  here s what I wrote back then   

For the current fiscal year ending in July  the full year EPS consensus rose over 15  from  3 33 to  3 85 in the past 90 days  And next year s projections went from  4 18 to  4 45  representing 15 5  annual growth  

	Well  Vail Resorts finished its 2016 fiscal year in July with EPS of  4 01  better than the  3 85 consensus almost a year ago  And the current fiscal year  ending July 2017  is now projected to hit EPS of  5 24    nearly 18  better than the  4 45 projected in December    for over 30  growth this year 

	Analysts and investors love that kind of growth  and its visible in share prices which hit all time highs over  160 last month  And the Zacks Rank  driven by analyst estimate revisions  guided investors the whole way by consistently keeping MTN shares a  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  for the past year 

	Last winter was clearly very good to Vail s business  especially as they capitalized on an acquisition that gave them the largest ski resort in the US  Here s how I described the start of an exciting season right after the company reported a strong Q1 FY 2016   

Early Snow   Park City   Lifting Revenues

	November snowstorms in the West allowed Vail Resorts to open its Colorado  Utah and California ski resorts prior to schedule  The pre Thanksgiving opening of these resorts is expected to boost Vail s top line in the coming quarter as the company cashes in on the demand for skiing early in the season  especially for those eager to schedule holiday trips 

	This includes the newly renovated Park City resort in Utah  Vail bought Park City in Sep 2014 and took over the Canyons resort the year earlier  Later  it joined both through a gondola to form the biggest ski resort in the U S  Here s how management proudly spoke of their newest achievement in a December 18 press release at the grand opening of the Quicksilver Gondola   

	 Park City is one of the most spectacular places on Earth and now  for the first time ever  our guests will have unprecedented access to over 300 trails  41 lifts and 7 300 acres of skiable terrain across one Park City   said Bill Rock  chief operating officer of Park City   Quicksilver  Miners Camp and the  50 million in capital improvements across the resort will completely transform the guest experience at Park City  We are thrilled to debut these projects in time for the Christmas holiday  

	Further  the company s two biggest season passes   the Epic and the Epic Local   would give guests access to the both the resorts  This would bring in a large number of guests  which would in turn boost the company s revenues in the crucial winter months  Vail has been able to raise ticket prices as they watch the volume of ticket sales increase 

  

Illumina  NASDAQ       a leading developer of next generation tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function  saw its shares plunge over 25  in the after hours session on October 10 when the company warned that Q3 revenue would be  18 23 million lower than expected as its sequencing instruments sales down were down 26  

	This was the second such pre announcement of weaker numbers this year and investors responded quickly by dropping the stock from  185 to  135  Analysts took a little more time to respond with revisions to their estimate models  causing the stock to become a Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell  the following week 

	The downward EPS revisions took the 2016 consensus down 4 8  from  3 53 to  3 36  representing only 1  growth for the full year 

	And while 2017 estimates only dropped 4 6  from  4 11 to  3 92  maintaining double digit EPS growth  the uncertainty about future sales and profits spreading out to next year could increase with only 8 analysts providing revisions thus far 

 Sell  With Margin Pressure Ahead

	One investment bank analyst in particular was actually very quick to announce their new stance  On October 11  Paul Knight  CFA  of Janney Montgomery Scott dropped ILMN to a  Sell  rating with a  125 price target  Here s what he had to say   

Lack of visibility in whole genome sequencing sales and the continuing investment in diagnostics with Helix and Grail will constrain profitability  Our Fair Value of  125 is based on a 21x multiple of 2017 EBITDA per share  5 95  With diminishing revenue and operating visibility  we believe the multiple paid compared to historical  28x  and LS Peers  14x  will continue to converge  

	Knight explained further that in addition to the deceleration in revenue   the diagnostics businesses take 6 9 years to develop significant commercial traction and the consequent investment in Helix and Grail will limit margin expansion at the company  

Bright Century  Cloudy Decade

	Illumina provides proprietary life science tools like microarrays to support genetic analysis for genomic research centers  academic institutions  pharmaceutical and biotech companies  and clinical labs 

	The company s tools will provide information that could be used to improve drugs and therapies  customize diagnoses and treatment  and cure disease  Illumina is developing a comprehensive line of products that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of functional analysis required to achieve the goals of molecular medicine  In this sense  they have big  long term goals 

	With many life sciences and genetics  tools  companies  the future seems bright  But the payoffs are often distant  or at least choppy  Illumina shares are now over 40  off their all time high of  240 from July 2015 

	And after warning twice this year  investors may be less likely to give third chances to management guidance  Until the estimates start turning back up  it s time to let ILMM shares settle into a new value area  The Zacks Rank will let you know

113286,334801,EFX,60 Day Delinquency Rate In Auto Loans Highest In Nearly Two Decades,opinion," Subprime Flashback 
A high level of missed payments for recent subprime loans made recently has raised concerns about underwriting standards  As standards have weakened  so have delinquencies 
The 60 plus day delinquency rate among subprime car loans that have been packaged into bonds over the past five years climbed to 5 16  in February  according to Fitch Ratings  the highest level in nearly two decades 
In a  Subprime Flashback  the Wall Street Journal reports that  

To understand how far the U S  auto business has been reaching for new customers  consider the early performance of a bond issue called Skopos Auto Receivables Trust 2015 2 
The bonds were built out of subprime auto loans and sold in November  Through February  about 12  of the underlying loans were at least 30 days past due  a third of which were more than 60 days delinquent  In another 2 6  of loans  borrowers had filed for bankruptcy or the vehicles had been repossessed 
About 12  of the loans backing bonds sold in November by Exeter Finance Corp   another Dallas based subprime lender  were more than 30 days delinquent through February  according to the company 
Loan payments have been slipping as well for the broader group of subprime borrowers who make up a big slice of the auto market  The 60 plus day delinquency rate among subprime car loans that have been packaged into bonds over the past five years climbed to 5 16  in February  according to Fitch Ratings  the highest level in nearly two decades 
 What s driving record auto sales is not the economy  but record auto lending   said Ben Weinger  who runs hedge fund 3 Sigma Value LP in New York and who has bearish bets on some auto lenders 
The total volume of U S  auto loans is now at an all time high of close to  1 trillion  with a fifth made to subprime borrowers  according to Equifax  NYSE EFX   Many of those loans are repackaged into bonds to free up capital so that new loans can be made 
Issuance of bonds backed by U S  subprime auto loans topped  27 billion last year  the highest in a decade and up 25  from 2014  according to Asset Backed Alert  an industry newsletter that has flagged concerns around Skopos and other  deep subprime  lenders 
Some 87  of the loans were to borrowers with credit scores below 600  on a scale of 300 to 850  A third of those had scores below 500 or no credit scores at all 

Loans Fuel Sales

Sliced and Diced Into Investment Grade
The Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc   gave most of the bonds in the November deal investment grade ratings 
According to Kroll  half the loans in the pool could default and all the bonds still would be repaid 
If those estimates are accurate  Kroll should use its earnings and buy the entire pool 
Rate Shopping Whores
In this perverse business  the agencies willing to hold their nose and assign the highest ratings get the most business 
In recent Chicago bond offerings  Kroll gave the best rate assignments ",2016-03-14,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/60-day-delinquency-rate-in-packaged-subprime-auto-loans-highest-in-nearl-200121445,200121445

113290,334805,EFX,Can Facebook  FB  Keep its Earnings Streak Alive in Q1 ,opinion,Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on Apr 27  The company had reported a positive earnings surprise of 18 00  in the last quarter  It has also delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3 37  over the trailing four quarters   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Things to Watch Out for this TimeInvestors will keep an eye on online and mobile advertising revenues in the first quarter earnings release  Facebook has gained significant traction in its mobile ad business within a very short span of time  Mobile monetization has increased with a higher number of marketers  continuing investment in new products and robust performance of its newsfeed ads  This combined with its massive user base and its ability to track personal details over time  make it a formidable force in the online ad market  Notably  in the fourth quarter  mobile ad revenues grew 81  to  4 5 billionrepresenting 80  of total ad revenue After opening its ad platform to worldwide advertisers six months back  Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow for Facebook  Though management did not provide the exact numbers for the fourth quarter of 2015  it seemed the ad platform was well received as reflected in increases in both overall ad impressions and average ad prices  Average price per ad increased 21  from the year ago quarter and ad impressions grew 29   due to increases in mobile impressions  Investors will once again be focused on Instagram s money minting abilities to boost overall ad revenues for the company As per an analyst  Instagram will generate  572 5 million revenues in the first quarter  taking total 2016 revenues to a whopping  3 2 billion  Notably  Facebook was subject to severe ridicule when it acquired the snazzy photo sharing app in 2012 for a billion dollars  Apart from Instagram  Oculus  Messenger and WhatsApp have been labeled as multibillion dollar opportunities  Facebook is now working aggressively to monetize these platforms User growth numbers will also be in focus  With gargantuan 1 59 billion users  Facebook is the largest social media platform   Facebook s Monthly Active Users  MAU  and Daily Active Users  DAU  have also crossed the billion mark  In the fourth quarter  even Mobile DAUs grew 25  year over year to an impressive 934 million  Moreover  WhatsApp boasts over 1 billion users whereas Messenger recently crossed the 900 million user mark  With user base already at sky high levels  growth is eventually and imminently headed for a relative slowdown Long Term OpportunitiesAt its F8 developer conference concluded recently  Facebook has more than ever clearly highlighted its ambitions of becoming more than just a social network  The social media giant outlined its plans for the next decade  which is all about going full throttle with AI and AR VR technology  Messenger was again the key topic of discussion at the conference with all talks of chatbots and  conversational commerce   We believe CEO Mark Zuckerberg will eventually bring  conversational commerce  to WhatsApp as well Though Facebook stumbled a bit with the initial shipments of its VR headsets  Oculus Rift  hitting a roadblock  However  this is unlikely to deter Facebook ambitious plans  An analyst observes that Rift has the potential to  handsomely  pay off the  2 billion investment that Facebook made for acquiring Oculus two years back  He expects Facebook to sell 600 000 units this year and another 2 million plus units equaling to over  1 6 billion in revenues in the 2017 As of now  all of these appear to be terrific growth engines but it will be one Herculean task for the company to actually make all of them work  Moreover  intensifying competition for users   ad dollars and increasing investments threatens to thwart its growth prospects Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Facebook is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Facebook has an Earnings ESP of  2 27   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 43 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 44 cents Zacks Rank  Facebook has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat Please note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks that  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Silicon Motion Technology Corp   NASDAQ SIMO    with an Earnings ESP of  7 27  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Equifax Inc    NYSE EFX   with an Earnings ESP of  1 75  and a Zacks Rank  2 GoDaddy Inc    NYSE GDDY   with an Earnings ESP of  33 33  and a Zacks Rank  2 Want the latest recommendations

113330,334845,EFX,5 Things To Ponder  Salmagundi Introspections ,opinion,"This past week has been a virtual tennis match watching the evolution of the Greek bailout negotiations  No Deal  Deal  No Deal  Deal 
However  despite the fallout that would likely come from a Greek  exit   the markets have largely managed to ignore the risk and hit an all time high this week  Market valuations  bullish sentiment and complacency are all pushing higher as the focus remains on the ignition of the ECB s QE program as a stimulus for the markets  In fact  this is so much the case that the net percentage of managers overweight eurozone equities is at the highest level on record 

What could possibly go wrong 
This weekend s reading list is a selection of articles discussing a variety of topics I found of interest this past week  However  I highly suggest that you read this week s post on  No Economy Is An Island  which discusses the very important feedback loop of global deflation onto the US economy 
1  Fed Destroy s Mainstream Meme 
This past week the Federal Reserve released their latest FOMC minutes which supported my recent writings which discuss the negative effects of falling oil prices on the economy  Tyler picked the following gem out of the released minutes 

 Several participants noted that there were signs of layoffs in the oil and gas industries  and that persistently low energy prices might prompt a larger retrenchment of employment in these industries 
In addition  it was observed that if capital investment in energy producing industries slowed significantly  it could damp the overall expansion of economic activity for a period  especially if the slowing took place after most of the positive effects of lower energy prices on growth in household spending had occurred

2  Lenders Step Up Financing To Subprime Borrowers by Alan Zibel and Annamaria Andriotis via WSJ

 Loans to consumers with low credit scores have reached the highest level since the start of the financial crisis  driven by a boom in car lending and a new crop of companies extending credit 
Almost four of every 10 loans for autos  credit cards and personal borrowing in the U S  went to subprime customers during the first 11 months of 2014  according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by credit reporting firm Equifax  NYSE EFX  
That amounted to more than 50 million consumer loans and cards totaling more than  189 billion  the highest levels since 2007  when subprime loans represented 41  of consumer lending outside of home mortgages  


3  So Much Inconsistency by Jeffrey Snider via Alhambra Partners

 The primary attempt at maintaining such an imbalanced status quo is the  recovery   An actual and sustained period of true economic growth would cover a lot of problems  which is why so many Keynesians long so fondly for the 1950 s that  paid  off the huge debts of the 1930 s and 1940 s  That was always the plan even from the ashes of the panic  as  extend and pretend  was the proffered  solution  not to the recovery itself but rather bridging the divide between heavy recession and its natural and organic appearance 
Unfortunately  seven years can no longer be called a  bridge   as extending so long amounts to admissions of fecklessness  So QE was changed in the public mind from restoring  normalcy   market of last resort  backward redistribution  to an economic management tool via inflation expectations  forward redistribution   

4  The Paradox Of Negative Interest Rates by Izabella Kaminska via FT Alphaville

 As Paul Krugman always likes to recount  strange things happen at the zero bound  Macroeconomics gets weird  Liquidity traps prevail  And a whole slew of paradoxes come into being 
And that s largely because below the zero bound things get even stranger still 
What you think should happen  doesn t  and what you think definitely won t happen  does  Furthermore  negative interest rates don t just kill off the traditional point of banking  they encourage bad incentives and dubious market practices for all purveyors of capital  

5  Equity Markets No Place For Long Term Investors by John Hussman via Hussman Funds

 Last week s advance had the earmarks of a short squeeze  featuring a low volume advance to marginal new highs on a number of indices including the S P 500  on hopes that a Greek bailout and a firming in oil prices will put a floor under global economic deterioration  On factors that affect our estimate of the market return risk profile  credit spreads remain broadly wider than they were a few months ago  and our primary measures of market internals remain unfavorable  Meanwhile  equity valuations   on the most historically reliable measures we identify   are now fully 117  above their pre bubble norms  on average  As of Friday  our estimate of prospective 10 year S P 500 annual nominal total returns has declined to just 1 4   suggesting that even the dismal 2  yield to maturity on 10 year bonds is likely to outperform equities in the decade ahead  ",2015-02-22,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-to-ponder:-salmagundi-introspections-242625,242625
