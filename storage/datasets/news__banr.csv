31059,252574,BANR,Can Value Investors Consider Banner Corporation  BANR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Banner Corporation   NASDAQ BANR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Banner Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 8  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Banner Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 01 over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares quite favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 66  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  Banner Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 22  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the times ahead P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Banner Corporation s P CF ratio of 6 99 is much lower than the Zacks Finance industry average of 26 33  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Banner Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Banner Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Banner Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives BANR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen no upward and four downward revisions in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision versus four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 6 3  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 7 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Banner Corporation Price and Consensus   Such bearish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBanner Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite  a strong industry rank  among Top 38  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the rank and industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become

31068,252583,BANR,Signs That Your Trading Will Ruin Your Retirement   November 25  2019,opinion,"You have a substantial retirement portfolio  You re an accomplished investor  You ve done truly well selecting stocks  You probably already own a couple of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
First Defiance Financial   NASDAQ FDEF    Banner   NASDAQ BANR   and First American Financial   NYSE FAF   
If you did something similar  would it be advisable for you to trade your own retirement nest egg 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

31172,252687,BANR,3 Hidden Dividend Stocks We ll Be Toasting In 2029,opinion,"If you want to retire on dividend income  then you probably need to avoid S P 500 stocks altogether 
Collectively they yield 1 9  today  This means that a million dollars invested will generate just  19 000 per year  That s  side hustle  money  not an actual full salary 
Another problem with buying popular stocks and  hoping  they appreciate in price  The odds are actually stacked against you thanks to an uneven business playing field  Check out the returns of  safe  S P 500 stocks year to date  Would you like to throw a dart blindfolded at this board 

Source  Contrarian Outlook
If you delved into some of the stocks from this grossly overcrowded index  you  
Had a better than 50  chance of losing money 
Had a better than 30  chance of losing at least 10 
Had a roughly 20  chance of gaining  but only around market average or less 
Had a 0 2  chance of actually doubling your money 
Numerous uber popular growth picks have disappointed wildly  whether it s Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  scraping together low single digit gains  NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   plunging 17  in 2018 or Facebook  NASDAQ FB  losing a quarter of its value in less than a year 
Momentum giveth  and momentum taketh away just as quick 
Stocks with high  sustainable yields  realistic growth and defensive characteristics might not give you anything to brag about in 2019  but when they help you retire with cash to spare a decade or more from now  you ll have plenty to crow about 
Let me show you a few stocks I think can leg it out not just through 2019  but through 2029 and beyond  These are decidedly under the radar picks that you may not have heard of  but they re primed to become popular over time as Wall Street gets wise to their total return potential 
Store Capital Corp   NYSE STOR 
Dividend Yield  4 4 
I ll start with a real estate investment trust  REIT  that I highlighted a couple months back when the stock market was busy scraping its knee  That REIT is STORE Capital  STOR   and it was one of a handful of stocks that were printing in green ink when everything else was dripping red 
A quick recap 
 STORE  stands for  single tenant operational real estate    in other words  it s a single tenant commercial REIT  It s a triple net lease REIT to boot  which means that tenants aren t just on the hook for rent  but also for taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  The upside for the REIT in this arrangement is that its operational results become a lot more stable and predictable  as they re no longer dealing with the variation in those other costs 
STORE is interesting in part because of its wide tenant list   it spreads out 412 customers in 109 industries across 2 084 properties in 49 states  In fact  its top five tenants only account for 12  of its base rent  which is tiny compared to a lot of its peers  Also  while other commercial REITs such as Realty Income  O  and National Retail Properties  NNN  focus on larger tenants  most of STORE s tenants are smaller in nature  the companies typically generate between  10 million and  1 billion in annual revenues 
I also like STORE s practice of actually buying up properties from many chains  then turns around and rents those facilities back to the selling companies  And naturally  the steady dividend growth since its 2014 IPO 
But the clincher for STORE is the vote of confidence from Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   BRK B  holding company  Buffett became the company s third biggest shareholder in June 2017 when he spent  377 million on a 9 8  stake in the company   a rare REIT buy for Berkshire  which makes it all the more notable 
Banner Corporation  NASDAQ BANR 
Dividend Yield  2 7 
Bank stocks typically aren t considered among the juggernauts of dividend stocks  and   thanks in large part to Federal Reserve s careful watch on how the country s financial firms spend their profits   but a couple of more regional banks are indeed true payout performers 
Though they certainly fly under the radar 
Banner Corporation   via its wholly owned subsidiary  Banner Bank   is a West Coast financial firm that operates more than 200 locations in its home state of Washington  as well as Oregon  California and Idaho  So it does have some brand power out West  though it s a virtual unknown elsewhere in the country  And as a  2 2 billion  smid cap  stock  it typically doesn t attract much Wall Street attention 
But Banner packs a one two punch that makes it worth notice 
For one  the company has been steadily growing for years   its  225 8 million in 2014 revenues have shot up to  463 9 million in 2017  and it s already posted about  370 million in revenues so far this year  It likely will continue expanding as a result of a very recently completed merger  Banner at the start of November finished its acquisition of Washington based Skagit Bancorp  tacking on  922 million in assets and 12 locations along the I 5 corridor from Seattle to Canada 
The other way Banner is plumping up  The payout  Not only has Banner more than doubled its dividend from 18 cents at the end of 2015 to 38 cents today  but it has paid out a  1 special dividend in 2017 and a 50 cent special dividend this year 
Banner Bank s Dividend Hulks Out
Banner s returns have been surprisingly muted considering its operational results  Expect that to change as more investors become wise to this story   and as it grows into its dividend growth 
Calamos Strategic Total Return Closed Fund  NASDAQ CSQ 
Distribution Rate  8 2 
The Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund is a closed end fund  and while it s an oldie   it came to life in March 2004   it s a goodie 
Even if Wall Street persistently fails to realize it 
Closed end funds are similar to exchange traded funds in that they also trade on an exchange  But a few differences that often make them oh so much better  For one  they can use leverage to essentially buy more of what they re buying  which when properly done can be used to juice gains and income distributions  They re also actively managed   yes  this makes them cost more than comparable ETFs  which tend to be index based  but human managers can make use of leverage  as well as pivot more quickly to avoid some dangers that indexes might run into headfirst 
They re typically actively managed  which makes them more expensive  but In fact  I ve previously recommended switching out several popular ETFs for higher yield CEF replacements 
Back to CSQ  Calamos Strategic Total Return is an equity first CEF that is just more than 60  invested in common stock  with the rest in various debt including corporate bonds and convertibles  At a glance  the stock portion of its portfolio looks like your typical blue chip mutual fund  with holdings such as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  sitting up top  However  it uses roughly 33  leverage to generate a massive distribution on top of the price appreciation it generates 
And Here s What a CEF Can Do 
The result is nothing short of astonishing  This little known CEF has simply  pantsed  the S P 500 over the long term  Albeit  there s more volatility because of the leverage  but it s clear that the results haven t garnered the respect they deserve 
That s fine  I don t need an analyst to tell me it s OK to collect nearly 20  annual returns like clockwork 
Earn 28  Returns Every Year From America s Safest Stocks
Calamos hit the nail right on the head  We can have a lot of success by taking blue chips like Alphabet and Facebook  many of which pay no dividends whatsoever  and finding a way to squeeze giant distributions out of them 
In fact  I ve discovered a way to do just that   and generate nearly 30  in annual total returns  This is one of the best income opportunities I ve come across in years  and I ve already started to put my own personal money to work in it 
Honestly  it sounds crazy on its face  I m talking about taking some of Wall Street s most growth oriented blue chips  such as Alphabet and Visa  NYSE V   into  double threat  holdings that put traditional dividend payers like Procter   Gamble  PG  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  to shame  But you and I really can take stocks like Visa  sub 1  dividend  and Alphabet  not a penny in dividends   and collect both double digit upsides and 8  plus dividends out of them 
That s the income generating genius behind my new discovery   Dividend Conversion Machines  
These stocks have specialized businesses that allow them to do what other stocks simply can t  They wring high single digit dividends from some of the most skinflint companies in America  One of my Dividend Conversion Machines takes Visa s 0 6  payouts and magnifies it to 9 2   Another one can take Google s 0  and produce a 9 4  yield out of thin air 
And no  this isn t an options strategy  or some dangerous derivative  or the  next Bitcoin   What I m going to show you is perfectly SAFE   it s essentially the same as buying traditional American blue chip stocks  In fact  I ll even show you the four steps you ll need right now

Go to your trading account 
Instead of entering a buy order for  say  Disney by entering the stock s  DIS  symbol  enter the 3 letter code for one of my 4 Dividend Conversion Machines instead 
Instead of getting Disney s 1 6  dividend  start collecting an 8   income stream 
That s it 
The incredible investments I m going to show you in just a second are 100  as safe as investing in  stodgy  blue chips   except you get retirement enhancing dividends and BIG upside too  In fact  they even have another leg up on traditional blue chips  They pay out their dividends monthly  which is ideal for retirees who need that income to pay their bills   and ideal for investors planning for retirement because those dividends will compound even faster
