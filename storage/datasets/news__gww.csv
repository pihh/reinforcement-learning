7482,228997,GWW,Special Report  Wall Street cleans up on  clean  coal subsidies,news,"By Tim McLaughlin
 Reuters    Earlier this year  the chief financial officer of global insurance giant Arthur J  Gallagher   Co   N AJG  explained to analysts how the company had turned a little known U S  energy subsidy into a profit machine  worth hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line 
The money came from the U S   clean coal  tax credit  a provision of the American Jobs Act of 2004 meant to encourage the use of chemically treated coal to cut pollution in the nation s power plants 
To capitalize on the subsidy  A J  Gallagher arranged investor partnerships to produce vast quantities of refined coal  as the fuel is known in the industry  for utilities across the nation  splitting the benefit of the lucrative government incentive   now worth more than  7 per ton 
 Our return on investment is staggering   CFO Douglas Howell told analysts in the March 14 call   Oh  200 percent  300 percent  400 percent  500 percent  I mean  just because it costs so little to develop  clean coal facilities 
A J  Gallagher s experience reflects a truth about the U S  refined coal tax credit  a subsidy that now costs taxpayers about  1 billion a year  While coal mining firms  utility companies and power consumers can benefit indirectly from the subsidy  the big winners are a diverse group of investors   ranging from Wall Street s most powerful banks to insurers  meat packers and drug makers   who identified the incentive as an easy way to make money 
Over the past decade  these companies have financed the construction of facilities to produce refined coal  which are situated next to coal fired power plants and typically cost about  4 million to  6 million each to develop  They then sell the resulting coal to utilities below cost  but make eye popping returns from the subsidy rather than the underlying business  according to regulatory documents and interviews 
A J  Gallagher s Howell took credit for designing a business model to maximize profits from the subsidy in his March call with analysts 
 It is our machine   he said   We developed it  We pioneered it  
The company has accumulated about  850 million worth of tax credits  mostly from its side business in taxpayer supported refined coal  Howell said on an Oct  25th conference call with investors and analysts 
 And at current production levels  of refined coal  he said   that may total another  700 million through 2021  
Howell declined to comment for this story  A J  Gallagher spokeswoman Linda Collins minimized the importance of clean coal to the company 
 Refined coal is not a part of our core brokerage and risk management business   Collins said in an email 
Refined coal activities  however  accounted for 25 percent of the company s  5 28 billion in total revenue during the first nine months of this year  according to AJ Gallagher financial statements  They also made up about a fifth of the company s  516 million in net earnings attributable to controlling interests during that period 
While the subsidy has proven a boon for investors  it has often failed to achieve the intended reductions of nitrogen oxides  or NOx  the primary contributor to smog and acid rain  Utilities that burn refined coal have trailed competitors burning raw coal in lowering NOx emissions  and 22 of 56 plants burning refined coal have seen NOx emission rates rise instead of fall  according to a Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data vetted by industry experts 
The refined coal tax subsidy is scheduled to expire in 2021  But lawmakers  including Republican Senator John Hoeven of coal producing North Dakota  have introduced legislation to extend it another 10 years  They argue it helps the environment  extends the life of the ailing coal industry   a centerpiece of the Trump administration s energy policy   and reduces power prices by giving utilities a cheap  subsidized source of coal 
 This is really an incentive to operate in a way that s more environmentally friendly while keeping power costs low   said Hoeven  whose state sits atop an 800 year supply of lignite coal 
If the extension goes through  those best placed to gain from the subsidy are an eclectic list of refined coal investors  including Wall Street banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS   JPMorgan Chase   Co Inc  N JPM  and  Capital One  Financial Corp  N COF   wealth management giant Fidelity Investments  drugmaker Mylan NV  N MYL   U S  affiliates of global commodities trader Noble Group Ltd  SI NOBG   industrial supplier W W  Grainger Inc  N GWW   Kansas based pork producer  Seaboard Corp   N SEB   and ethanol plant investor Rex American Resources Corp  N REX   according to disclosures with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  state environmental regulators and the U S  Tax Court 
CapitalOne  Goldman Sachs  JPMorgan  Mylan  Noble  Rex American  Seaboard and W W  Grainger declined to comment on refined coal s impact on NOx pollution 
These and other refined coal investors stand to gain at least  10 billion in tax incentives over the next decade if the law is extended  based on the current annual consumption of refined coal and the existing level of the inflation adjusted tax credit 
BIRTH OF THE BUSINESS
As originally drawn in 2004  the refined coal tax credit required producers to increase raw coal s market value by 50 percent to qualify for the subsidy  The market value clause made cost conscious utilities unwilling to buy the specialized product  Prospects for the clean coal business were dim 
But in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis  two U S  senators changed the landscape by deleting the market value clause   a subtle tweak tucked away in the massive  700 billion U S  financial rescue package 
A J  Gallagher  along with utility firms  Ameren Corp  and DTE Energy  also had been lobbying on the issue of refined coal  according to lobbying disclosure filings  though it is unclear if they lobbied specifically on the market value clause  Officials at Ameren and DTE declined to comment on the lobbying 
The policy edit   by Democrat Max Baucus of coal mining state Montana and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa   made it possible for refined coal producers to receive the subsidy even if they sold their product to utilities below cost  That paved the way for investors to set up operations and to ultimately make billions of dollars building refined coal to its current share of about a fifth of the U S  coal market 
Baucus said he does not remember the change to the refined coal tax credit   It was a tax credit blizzard  a deluge of credits was being discussed   Baucus said   It s very easy to change the code to give credit to companies to spur investment  The code gets crusted with barnacles of credits  and then they re removed  It s the natural ebb and flow of things  
Grassley declined to comment for this story 
The subsidy is now worth more than  7 a ton  an amount that covers losses on the discounted pricing and the operations that produce refined coal  while often leaving a profit that can amount to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year per investor  according to disclosures by tax credit investors  Because some of the operating expenses of running a refined coal facility are deductible  the tax credit s effective value can top  9 a ton 
Goldman Sachs  one of the world s most powerful banks  is currently generating estimated annual gross tax credits of about  50 million from two Missouri power plants alone  according data from the U S  Energy Information Administration showing refined coal consumption patterns at the plants  Goldman declined to comment 
 It was virtually impossible to make money producing clean coal for utilities   said Roger Jones  senior counsel at McDermott Will   Emery LLP in Chicago  who has represented refined coal tax investors   But as soon as the credit was there  people thought about capital raising to engage in this activity  
After the tax credit was revised  A J  Gallagher led the race to build refined coal facilities  constructing them next to power plants that burned the most coal in the country so as to maximize credit volumes 
It now has investments in 34 refined coal facilities in the United States  along with a 46 5 percent controlling stake in Chem Mod LLC  a leading supplier of chemicals used to refine raw coal  according to A J  Gallagher SEC filings 
Gallagher s main rival  Colorado based Advanced Emissions Solutions Inc  O ADES   holds interests in 19 refined coal facilities with tax credit investors  through a joint venture with Goldman Sachs and NexGen Resources Corp  Affiliates of Goldman Sachs account for most of those investors  SEC filings show 
Goldman Sachs  in 2011  purchased a 15 percent stake in the joint venture  a refined coal operator called Tinuum Group LLC  formerly known as Clean Coal Solutions  for  60 million  Advanced Emissions owns a 42 5 percent stake in Tinuum  whose operations produced and sold about 60 million tons of refined coal during the 12 month period that ended Sept  30  SEC disclosures show 
DRUG  TRASH FIRMS GET INTO COAL
Some partnerships include players even farther afield from the energy business  In one of refined coal s earliest and biggest financial commitments  trash collector Waste Management Inc  N WM  teamed up with JPMorgan Chase to invest in the refined coal facility at Coal Creek Station in North Dakota 
The bank and the trash company invested in a facility that treats coal by preheating it in a process that dries out several million tons of soggy lignite coal each year  increasing its energy output  Electric cooperative Great River Energy  the owner of the plant  agreed to lease its refined coal facility to JPMorgan and Waste Management for  530 million over 16 years  according to a January 2011 deal disclosed by the co op JPMorgan and Waste Management declined to comment for this story 
Another big beneficiary is drug maker Mylan  Refined coal tax credits were the second biggest component in producing a tax benefit of  358 3 million in 2016  according to Mylan s annual report  That tax benefit lifted its consolidated earnings for the year to  480 million  from  121 7 million 
Power plant owners typically sell their coal at cost to refined coal operations controlled by tax credit investors  Once the coal is treated with chemicals or dried out at an on site refined coal facility  the tax credit investors sell the coal back to the power plants at a discount that can be anywhere from 75 cents to  2 per ton   a way to ensure utilities get some benefit from the subsidy  according to agreements filed with state regulators  Central Appalachian coal  which has high energy content for power generation  costs about  75 a ton 
Coal plant owners also may structure deals with refined coal producers to collect coal handling and licensing fees or to charge rent through leases of their land used for the facilities  the disclosures show 
Last year  Louisville Gas   Electric and Kentucky Utilities  a unit of PPL Corp  N PPL   struck a deal with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs to burn refined coal at the utility s Ghent power station  The utility stands to receive  10 million a year in incentives and would bear no expense for running the refined coal operations  according to disclosures with Kentucky regulators 
For Goldman and any other tax credit investors in the deal  the gross annual tax credit  before refined coal operating expenses and incentives for the utility  is  39 million  Reuters estimates  That estimate is based on Ghent s average annual coal consumption of 5 5 million tons multiplied by the  7 03 per ton tax credit 
Goldman declined to comment on the revenue or profit it derives from clean coal tax credits 
Utility companies themselves haven t been in the vanguard of capitalizing on the refined coal subsidy  That s because the original wording of the refined coal tax credit  passed in 2004  stipulated that the producer of refined coal had to sell it to an  unrelated person   So  utilities couldn t invest in clean coal and sell it to themselves 
The IRS issued new guidance in 2009  however  that opened the door for affiliates of utilities like Detroit based DTE Energy to control or take stakes in refined coal production facilities in recent years  DTE has received some  639 million in refined coal tax credits since 2012  SEC disclosures show  DTE declined to comment for this story 
PAYING NO TAXES
In today s thriving clean coal industry  A J  Gallagher s early moves to monetize the tax credit seem prescient  Months before the subsidy first entered the tax code in 2004  the company paid  300 000 for a 5 percent ownership stake in Chem Mod  which at the time was developing chemical treatments designed to reduce coal pollution  A core group of five people at A J  Gallagher was overseeing the move into the business  according to the company s disclosures to investors 
A J  Gallagher was among several investors who paid Washington firms to lobby on refined coal  according to lobbying disclosure filings  In 2008  before Congress modified the refined coal tax credit to erase the market value clause  the company paid two law firms   Winston   Strawn  and Steptoe   Johnson   to lobby on  refined coal  and  energy and tax  issues  respectively  The lobbying disclosure documents do not detail what specific objective the companies had in their lobbying activities 
Officials from those law firms involved in the lobbying declined to comment 
David Lowman  a partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP  was lobbying on refined coal on behalf of a different company at the time  He said the refined coal industry successfully pushed to have the market value clause eliminated  In return  the industry agreed to double the pollution reduction requirement on mercury and sulfur dioxide to 40 percent from 20 percent 
By the end of 2008  Gallagher had built up a 42 percent stake in Chem Mod for a total investment of  13 3 million  according to company disclosures  Now it was ready to launch into developing facilities 
The dive into a newly subsidized business was part of the company s strategy to find profits in taxpayer financed incentives  Dating to the 1980s  Arthur J  Gallagher has sought out opportunities  for example  in subsidized low income housing and the so called synfuel tax credit  designed to promote domestically produced synthetic fuels that can reduce U S  import dependence 
Gallagher s approach to refined coal  however  has made it a heavyweight  and it has been pivotal in recruiting tax investors to help finance refined coal operations throughout the country  In 2009  it negotiated partnerships with Fidelity and the U S  subsidiary of France s Schneider Electric SE  PA SCHN  to produce refined coal for a utility at three South Carolina power plants  U S  Tax Court disclosures show  Gallagher also has struck deals to put refined coal operations inside the fence of power plants owned by DTE and St  Louis based utility Ameren Corp  N AEE  
Net earnings from its  clean energy  investments are estimated to be  115 million in 2018  or 17 times more than what the company reported in 2010  Looking ahead  the company can carry forward its stockpile of  850 million in credits to reduce its taxes in future years

The Fed will  act as appropriate   Powell told the House Financial Service Committee in the first of two days of testimony about the state of the economy  It is a phrase he has used often in the last few months because he and the Fed are worried about the domestic economy and slowing business investment  trade disputes and other issues affecting global economic health   
But it was music to investors  ears  The NASDAQ Composite surged 0 75   hitting new closing and intraday highs  The S P 500 jumped at the open  briefly topping 3 300 for the first time before dropping back to a 0 45  gain and just under its July 3 close of 2 995 82 The Dow Jones industrials added 0 3   also reaching a new intraday high of 26 983  up 200 points from the day before  But then the blue chips slid back 
The stock rally was accompanied by a 4 5  jump in oil prices  which was partly due to worries that storms in the Gulf of Mexico will shut down offshore production wells  The Gulf produces about 17  of U S  crude oil  West Texas Intermediate crude  the benchmark U S  oil  finished up  2 60 to  60 43 a barrel  Brent crude  the global benchmark  added  2 85 to  67 01  WTI is up 33  this year  while Brent is up nearly 25   
Gold  meanwhile  moved solidly above  1 400 an ounce  finishing at  1 212 50 an ounce  and palladium shot up toward  1 600 an ounce 
But the big question of the day was if the Fed believes it needs to cut interest rates  And Powell offered many reasons that seemed to suggest a rate cut is coming at its July 30 31 meeting  Investing com s Fed Rate Monitoring tool suggests the Fed will cut its key federal funds rate to 2  2 25  from 2 25 2 5   And maybe another rate cut in the fall 
Rates have been coming down as global economic worries    most prominently the U S  China trade dispute and tensions in the Middle East    grabbed investor attention  But Wednesday  longer term rates were higher  The 10 year Treasury yield moved up to 2 07  from 2 06  as investors shed bonds for stocks  The 10 year yield is still off 23   this year

Will the upcoming earnings release provide a boost to Pentair s stock  Let s take a look 
Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsPentair s distributors had accelerated spending in the fourth quarter of 2018  in anticipation of price increases  However  wet and cold weather delayed pool construction activity in several of Pentair s key markets  impacting demand for Pentair so far in 2019  As a result of slower sell through  inventory levels have built up  which is likely to have impacted the third quarter revenues  Unfavorable weather in the United States significantly delayed the planting season  which in turn is likely to have impacted the sale of its agriculture sprayer products  Farmers have also been delaying equipment purchases owing to the continued trade uncertainty and lower commodity prices during the quarter to be reported  Pentair s third quarter revenues are anticipated to reflect these headwinds  However  recent acquisitions are likely to have contributed to growth Further  inflation in material and other costs  which include the impact of tariffs  is likely to get reflected in the company s performance and consequently the bottom line in the third quarter  Notably  Pentair has undergone certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing fixed cost structure  which is likely to have negated the impact of higher raw material costs on the third quarter results  Further  productivity improvement and price hikes implemented to combat higher input costs are also likely to have contributed to third quarter margin improvement Pentair s projects third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance at 54 56 cents  The company had reported adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter of 2018  Per the company  sales in the quarter were anticipated to be flat to up 2  on a reported basis and approximately down 1  to 3  on a core basis compared with the prior year quarter What do Estimates for the Segments Indicate The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aquatic Systems segment s revenues is currently pegged at  212 million  suggesting a decline of 9  year over year  The segment s operating profit for the quarter is projected to fall 10  year over year to  54 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Filtration Solutions segment s revenues is  270 million  which indicates an improvement of 12  from the prior year quarter  The consensus estimate for the segment s operating profit is at  44 million for the third quarter  suggesting growth of 15  from the  38 million reported a year ago The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Flow Technologies segment s revenues is pegged at  238 million for the quarter to be reported  flat compared with the year ago quarter  The segment is expected to report an operating income of  39 million in the quarter  a projected growth of 7  from the prior year quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Pentair this time around   This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Pentair s Earnings ESP is  2 14  Zacks Rank  Pentair currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  You can see Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are a few  stocks which you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases John Bean Technologies Corporation   NYSE JBT   has an Earnings ESP of  0 55  and a Zacks Rank of 3 Sealed Air Corporation   NYSE SEE   has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  2 40  W W  Grainger   NYSE GWW    a Zacks Ranked  3 stock  has an Earnings ESP of  0 53  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pentair-pnr-to-report-q3-earnings-whats-in-the-offing-200475755,200475755

7505,229020,GWW,Is W W  Grainger  GWW  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put W W  Grainger  Inc    NYSE GWW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  W W  Grainger has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 53  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 35  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  W W  Grainger s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 19 03 over the past five years The stock s PE however compares unfavorably with the Industrial Products Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 9  This indicates that the stock is overvalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  W W  Grainger has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 75  which lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for W W  Grainger stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  W W  Grainger has a P S ratio of 1 4  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 23x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  W W  Grainger currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes W W  Grainger a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for W W  Grainger is 1 42  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 46  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though W W  Grainger might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives GWW a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen seven estimates go down in the past sixty days compared to three upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen ten down and two up in the same time period This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus estimate dipped 2 2  over the past two months  the full year estimate has decreased 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below W W  Grainger  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite such bearish analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineW W  Grainger is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 4  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiments and industry rank to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years

Caterpillar Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
     Shares of the company have fallen 2 7  in a year  compared with the  s decline of 6 0   Will the upcoming earnings release provide a boost to Caterpillar s stock  Let s delve deeper and analyze the factors that are likely to have influenced the quarterly results Factors at PlayTrade tensions with China and waning global demand seems to have taken a toll on the U S manufacturing sector  Per the Institute for Supply Management s latest report  the U S Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  declined to 47 8  in September 2019   the worst reading in a decade  This follows readings of 49 1  in August and 51 2  in July  This indicates a contraction in the manufacturing sector  This is anticipated to get reflected on Caterpillar s third quarter revenue results The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is  13 38 billion  suggesting a decline of 0 94  from the prior year quarter Material cost inflation  thanks to the imposition of tariffs last year  is likely to have impacted Caterpillar s margins  However  the company s pricing actions and significant restructuring  and cost reduction initiatives are expected to get reflected on the company s third quarter results How Will The Segments Fare For the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment  which contributes around 90  of the company s total revenues  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2019 is pegged at  12 8 billion  on par with the prior year quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Resource Industries segment s sales for the third quarter is pegged at  2 751 million  suggesting year over year growth of 8   Miners are resumed capital spending in the second quarter  a trend that most likely continued in the third quarter  Further  the segment s third quarter top line is likely to reflect continued strong demand for aftermarket parts on account of higher machine utilization levels In North America  construction equipment sales fell in September for the third straight month  Residential and commercial construction spending have been weak as well  This overall weakness might have affected the Construction segment s sales in the third quarter  On top of this  a muted China market is likely to have weighed on revenues given that it represents about 10  to 15  of the segment s sales  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Construction segment s sales is projected at  6 568 million for the to be reported quarter  suggesting a year over year decline of 1 5  For the Energy   Transportation segment  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is currently at  4 439 million  indicating a decline of 3  from  4 577 million reported in the year ago quarter  The Transportation sector s sales are likely to have benefited from recent acquisitions in rail services  Power Generation sales have been improving after a multi year downturn  a trend that most likely continued in the to be reported quarter  However  sales for industrial applications are likely to have been impacted by slow global economic conditions   For the to be reported quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit for the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment is pegged at  2 163 million  up 5  from the  2 064 million reported in the prior year quarter  The Resource Industries segment is anticipated to report an operating profit of  507 million  an improvement of 23  from the prior year quarter  However  the Energy   Transportation segment is expected to report operating profit of  918 million  suggesting a decline of 6  from the year ago reported figure  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Construction segment s operating profit is at  1 057 million  flat compared with the prior year quarter What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively

7524,229039,GWW,Strong Markets  New Products Aid Lincoln Electric  Costs Ail,opinion,On Apr 3  we issued an updated research report on Lincoln Electric Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ LECO    Favorable end markets  focus on product innovation and the ongoing strategic initiatives will steadily fuel the company s growth Of late  the company has been active on the acquisition front  which will further boost its portfolio and results  However  raw material inflation and weak demand in Europe might impede its near term growth Let s illustrate the factors in detail Favorable End Markets  New Products to Aid ResultsLincoln Electric consistently witnesses double digit organic sales growth in its three major end markets  namely automotive  heavy industries  energy and construction infrastructure  The momentum is expected to continue in 2019 and drive Lincoln Electric s revenues Also  the company s focus on innovative products will be a growth driver  Lincoln Electric increased its investment in research and development  and continues to roll out several solutions in the automation solutions market  These product launches are likely to favor growth  The launch of the company s new welding technology and training center  and the expansion of the two new Well Tech Centers in Dubai and Shanghai will help showcase and customize solutions for the global and regional customers The company is also gearing up for the launch of its new additive services business  which will position Lincoln Electric as a manufacturer of large scale 3D printed metal spell parts  prototypes and tooling for industrial customers  This is likely to act as a catalyst for Lincoln Electric  It also continues to invest in long term strategy for automation in support of its 2020 strategy initiatives Acquisitions  Key Growth CatalystLincoln Electric has been actively ramping up its inorganic growth profile  In January 2017  the company completed its acquisition of Air Liquide  PA AIRP  Welding  a subsidiary of Air Liquide  This buyout enhanced the company s global specialty consumables portfolio and extended its channel reach for equipment systems and cutting  soldering and brazing solutions in Europe  The company is working rigorously on the Air Liquide integration activities Last December  Lincoln Electric acquired Inovatech Engineering Corporation and its related assets to boost its automated cutting solutions and application expertise for structural steel applications  During the same month  Lincoln Electric also acquired Coldwater Machine Company  Pro Systems LLC and the related assets for expanding its portfolio of automated cutting and joining solutions  This January  Lincoln Electric acquired the soldering business of Worthington Industries  Inc    NYSE WOR    It has also agreed to buy certain brazing assets of Worthington  These transactions will enhance the company s product portfolio  accelerate growth in the retail channel and uplift its Harris business  These three acquisitions consolidations are expected to contribute  85  90 million to total revenues in the current year Recently  Lincoln Electric completed the acquisition of Baker Industries  a provider of parts  fixtures and custom tooling for the automotive and aerospace markets  This integration is likely to boost Lincoln Electric s automation revenues by roughly  500 million in annualized sales Inflation to Dampen MarginsRaw material inflation will persist in 2019 and consequently  drag margins  Although Lincoln Electric continues to announce new pricing actions  margin growth could vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of its response Soft Volumes in International Welding a ConcernThe company anticipates organic sales growth rate in 2019 to be at low to mid single digit percentage  The lower expectations can be attributed to the challenging year over year comparisons and the ongoing volume compression in the International Welding segment due to the ongoing Air Liquide integration  Further  tepid European demand is still a downside for the segment Share Price PerformanceShares of the company have outperformed the  over the past three months  The

7543,229058,GWW,4 Industrial Stocks Set For A Strong Finish In 2018 ,opinion,The manufacturing sector has held its ground this year despite impact from tariff and supply chain challenges  This momentum is likely to continue next year as well  supported by the spate of positive data coming in from the sector  Improvement in its end markets like residential and non residential construction  mining driven by ongoing recovery in the commodities  oil and gas industry  and economic growth will continue to drive the sector  Strong Manufacturing Data Despite Tariff Woes The announcement of the tariffs on steel imports into the United States earlier this year was a big blow to the manufacturing sector overall  Given that steel is a primary raw material  every manufacturing company bore the brunt of rising steel prices owing to the tariffs  Though this was mitigated to some extent with price increases  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers  Further  the industry has been plagued with shortage of skilled laborers  higher wage costs and flaring up transportation expenses  Despite these challenges  the manufacturing sector witnessed strong production output and continued strength in new orders this year  Per the Institute for Supply Management s   ISM   latest report  Purchasing Managers  Index   PMI   for November rose 59 3    maintaining growth in manufacturing for the 27th consecutive months  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  13 reported growth in November   The PMI has averaged 59 2  over the last 12 months ranging from a low of 57 3  in April 2018 to a high of 61 3  in August 2018  Notably  a reading above 50  indicates expansion in manufacturing economy  The PMI reading of 59 3  for November corresponds to an increase of 4 9  in real gross domestic product  GDP  on an annualized basis  New Orders Index registered 62 1  in November  indicating growth in new orders for the 35th consecutive month  Production Index registered growth of 60 5  in November  indicating improvement in production for the 27th consecutive month  Employment continued to expand  supporting production growth  The employment index was pegged at 58 4  in November  maintaining growth for the 26th consecutive month  Additionally  industrial production   a measure of the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors   rose 0 6  in November  Manufacturing output remained flat while mining output rose 1 7  aided by gains in oil and gas extraction  coal mining  and support activities for mining   Sector Position   Performance All the machinery industries are broadly clubbed under the Zacks  Sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The sector s earnings rose 20  in third quarter 2018  Per Zacks  projections  the sector is expected to log growth of 14  in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018  In the next fiscal  the sector s earnings are expected to rise 7 4  in the first quarter  followed by 7 7  and 10 6  in the second and third quarters of 2019  respectively   Read more     This sector has underperformed the S P 500 market in recent times owing to the concern surrounding the impact of tariffs  In the past year  the sector has dipped 27 5  while the S P 500 s declined 12 4   We believe the price performance will eventually pick up  driven by the healthy growth prospects and upbeat numbers coming from the manufacturing sector which indicate that the sector is on a firm footing  Continued improvement in residential and non residential construction  and revival in infrastructure demand bode well for the industry  Mining companies are also resuming capital spending due to the improvement in commodity prices  Further  the recently passed tax reform is likely to act as a catalyst by expediting manufacturing investment in factories  new equipment and other capital goods  We have zeroed in on four industrial stocks which have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a VGM Score of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Our research shows that stocks with an

7544,229059,GWW,5 Top Dividend Aristocrats To Buy In 2019,opinion,Wall Street may have seen a Santa Claus rally by the end of last year  but that wasn t enough to salvage a disappointing year  Investors  appetite for riskier assets like stocks took a beating in 2018  with the major bourses seeing the worst year since 2008 Few market pundits could predict such neck breaking market gyrations in 2018 after an unusually calm 2017  From the U S  China trade dispute to slow economic and earnings growth  everything only added to the chaos  The fears that gripped markets in 2018 may continue to reflect in volatile price swings this year  Thus  in order to safeguard your portfolio  investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent  After all  these stocks provide higher total returns with lower volatility But  before we select the stocks let us look at the risks that have sent shivers down investors  spines of late  Political ShakinessThough market bulls hope for progress in U S  China trade negotiations  tensions loom large  President Trump continues to threaten a tariff increase on billions of dollars worth of Chinese commodities if China fails to address U S  demands on economic and political issues  Lest we forget  such tariffs will be paid by American companies and they will invariably pass the cost onto consumers  who account for two third of U S   GDP By the way  Trump s warnings to lessen the power of the Fed Chair also raise concern  Investors may not like a hawkish Fed  but they certainly want peace and consistency  and threatening the Fed Chair is not inducing any calm Amid all these  an U S  government shutdown is set to stretch this year due to a deadlock between the White House and lawmakers over the President s intention of securing financing for a wall on the border with Mexico At the same time  dysfunction in the United Kingdom has thrown investors for a loop  No one knows what will be the impact of Brexit  In fact  if it rolls out on Mar 29 without a deal  it will most certainly hurt the global economy Global Economic Slowdown in the CardsThanks to the tax cuts and a solid labor market  the U S  economy expanded at an annual rate of 4 2  and 3 4  in the second and third quarter of last year  But  the Fed officials now expect growth to moderate over the next couple of years   Fed officials expect the pace of the economic expansion to slow down to 2 3  this year The world s second largest economy  China  saw the weakest economic growth last year  And this year looks even worse  China s Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for December dropped to 49 7 from 50 2 in November  This dismal reading on factory output raised concerns over a possible slowdown this year  Brexit  in the meanwhile  could surely rock Britain this year  Thus  threats of a global economic slowdown raised doubts over the longevity of the bull market Slower Earnings GrowthEarnings growth  in the meantime  is expected to moderate primarily due to an increase in labor and material costs pinching profit margins  Moreover  corporate profits got a boost last year due to the tax cuts  especially at the beginning of the year  However  its effects have started to wear off  and growth in 2019 doesn t look much promising U S  dollar has been rising for quite some time now  The US Dollar Index is up nearly 5  this year  hurting profits of America s multinational companies  This is because a strong dollar certainly makes U S  products more expensive abroad  dampening overseas sales Time to Buy Dividend Aristocrats  5 Solid PicksWith things not looking too favorable for the stock market at the start of the year  it s prudent to invest in dividend aristocrats for risk adjusted returns  These stocks have a solid financial structure and healthy

7550,229065,GWW,Indexes Vs Portfolios,opinion,"Across the investment cycle  every index composite is adjusted to reflect institutional interests  This always generates problems when comparing portfolio performance to any index as the cycle progresses 
The media pressure to compare short term results vs  the current crop of FANG type issues being a daily occurrence  gradually shames many institutional investors into buying into the  highest fliers   Investment committees  thinking that on Modern Portfolio teachings since 1952  that quarter over quarter performance should be the benchmark  is unfortunately driven by the media palaver  Missed in the process is the fact that media palaver is designed to increase viewership and in turn advertising revenue  There is no connection between media s push to generate advertising revenue and long term returns  Every investor becomes a victim of the consensus 
The issue of one s portfolio performance in comparison to any index always develops later in a cycle as the indices dominated by the FANG type issues of that cycle  A recent Internet posting is instructive  The headline says it all and Exhibit 3 provides the detail The S P 500 long term history is 6 1   If we come away with a multiple of that  then we have done well  I want to see 15   long term without investing in any of the FANG type issues which are pure speculation  not investments  The 15  annual target I use is for a full cycle with us specifically exiting near the cycle peak  as best as we can  and buying 5 yr Treasuries before the market economy cycles into recession  My 15  target is based on recession low to recession low vs  S P 500 6 1  
6 Stocks Accountable For Nearly All The S P 500 s Gains This Year
By Investing com  Jesse Cohen Investing com 

One cannot compare acct performance or even expect outperformance when the S P 500 has always been boosted by those few  high fliers  as the cycle progresses  The long term performance of the issues I suggest are in the range of 15    They are selected during low periods and expected to generate somewhat higher returns as they recover market acceptance  But  these are long term record issues  i e  10 years   25 years  like KSU  FAST  XOM  GWW  GILD  GIS  BUD and etc  may take 18 months to regain positive market psychology  Having already experienced fairly quick responses from DHR  HEI  MLAB  FTV  CAT  DE and etc   we have already rotated out with decent returns  Predicting when market psychology will suddenly kick any particular issue higher is impossible  The approach I recommend is to buy good management teams at relatively low prices  diversifying being patient  monitor each carefully and exit when valuation appears excessive 
Part of my investment process is to buy near recession lows and sell as it appears we are coming to a market cycle peak  I periodically lay this out in my notes  The idea behind this is that corrections are often much more than 20   It makes investing sense to sell as close to the market peak as we can identify  pay the taxes rather than sit through a correction which is likely to cycle lower than the tax expense  then reenter  The last 2 major corrections were 50    We want to use corrections as positive investment experiences  They are investment opportunities to buy 5yr Treasuries which produce decent relative gains during corrections 
Because the S P 500 always becomes skewed with each cycle s FANG type issues  like any index which become infused with these issues  is not a good short term market performance benchmark  FANG type issues are valued at 10x  Revenue  many times Earnings Share and excessively high multiples of other financial metrics  much like the 1990s Internet issues  I do not recommend these issues  The S P 500 has performance of  6  long term even with FANG types added if one looks across multiple cycles  Recent S P 500 2yr performance of 30   is skewed by these issues  I suggest individual issues with 15   historical performance  But  this is long term performance and suggested during periods of market pessimism specific to each issue  Any of them can be out of favor for a couple of years before earnings spark improved market psychology  Because the S P 500 becomes skewed with FANG type issues  it becomes impossible to use as a short term performance index against such a portfolio  NFLX  an S P 500 member  rose more than 100  the last 6 months  Jan 2018   July 2018   This issue is in  Tulip Mania  
The Investment Thesis July 30  2018 
The market cycle appears to have several years left before market peak signals develop  Common sense tends to go out the window as FANG type issues dominate the indices  The better long term investment outcomes come from having a long term disciplined approach  investing with the best CEOs and managers one can identify and ignore media hyped performance measures as dangerous to one s outcome

7551,229066,GWW,Critical Stock Market 200 DMAs Pass Oversold Test,opinion,"AT40   20 9  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs    ended a 4 day oversold period 
AT200   39 6  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAs  up 6 percentage points  VIX   17 6  drop of 17 3  
Short term Trading Call  bullish
Commentary
The average oversold period lasts 5 days  The latest oversold period just ended at 4 days  This episode was yet one more reminder why I prefer the aggressive approach to buying oversold periods over the conservative approach  The conservative approach waits to buy a sell off until after AT40 exits the oversold period 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   soared from 13 2  to 20 9   AT40  T2108  soared above the oversold threshold to end the last oversold period at 4 days 
AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  soared from 33 6  to 39 6  in a move that helped confirm a massive swing in sentiment from the bearish depths of last Thursday and Friday 
The S P 500  NYSE SPY  gained 2 2  in a move of pure poetry  The index gapped up to open just above its 200DMA and ran upward from there  The now down trending 50DMA is in play as the next line of resistance  The S P 500  SPY  made a very bullish move in breaking out above 200DMA resistance with such clean and persistent precision 
The S P 500 only gained 0 9  for this latest oversold period  This performance is roughly in line with the history of oversold periods and the resulting projection from this history 
The NASDAQ imitated the poetry of the S P 500 with a gap up and rally above its 200DMA for a 2 9  gain  The Invesco QQQ Trust  QQQ  gained 2 9  in a move that bullishly confirmed 200DMA support  
The NASDAQ gapped up and rallied away from its 200DMA  The move confirmed the abandoned baby bottom that marked the 200DMA breakdown 

The Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ  made a doubly bullish move by both confirming an abandoned baby bottom and soaring higher above its 200DMA support 
The jump in the breadth indices suggests that the market s rally was comprehensive and broad  Even the much maligned iShares US Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  managed to gain 2 2  for only its second gain in 20 trading days  The volatility index  the VIX  was the icing on the cake with a 19 1  plunge to 17 2  All that remains is a complete reversal of fear is a close below the 15 35 pivot  
The volatility index  the VIX  is now definitively on the downside slope of the latest burst of market fear 
Speaking of fear  Reuters published a very timely article ahead of Tuesday s rally titled   Investors gloomiest on world growth in decade  cut U S  equity holdings   BAML poll   I think the following quote speaks volumes confirming the extremes of fear that just washed over the market 

The survey  released on Tuesday was conducted Oct  5 to 11 and canvassed investors managing  646 billion  It showed investors remained overweight equities overall  though the 22 percent overweight was just marginally off the recent record low of 19 percent 
The poll showed that a net 38 percent of respondents expected the global economy to slow  the worst outlook on global growth since November 2008 The poll showed a dramatic 17 percentage point drop in U S  equity allocations to a net 4 percent overweight 

I sold my latest tranche of SPY call options into the rally  the options represented a quick double so by rule I sold  I held onto all my other short term trading longs  I am also still holding onto my hedges  While these hedges are very small relative to my longs  I was not bullish enough during the market s lows  For example  I did not aggressively accumulate put options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  and thus am still sitting on net losses  I took advantage of the implosion in implied volatility to add more puts 
Still  the train has not completely left the station  Plenty of upside remains until the next levels of resistance get hit and or until AT40 hits overbought levels  above 70    Moreover October s tradition of outsized drawdowns means that 200DMAs could suffer another test before a sustained rally launches  For good measure  sellers might even be able to pull off a brief break of recent lows in the next dip 
Overall  it is still time to buy the dip until the market is otherwise proven guilty  Assuming Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  can hold its monster after hours post earnings gains from Tuesday night  the stock will add one more signal that breaks the selling spell with a confirmation of 200DMA support

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with only 2 full weeks left in the trading year sees equities unable to shake out of this pullback and some sectors looking as they may be worsening 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue to move higher while Crude Oil is poised to bounce in its downtrend  The US Dollar Index continues to consolidate while US Treasuries move up in a short term trend  The Shanghai Composite continues to show signs of a possible consolidation in its pullback with Emerging Markets continuing their long term downtrend 
Volatility looks to remain above recent ranges and possibly poised to move higher  adding pressure to equity prices  The equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  responded by reversing their recent mini recoveries and turning lower  The IWM looks the worst as it is now resuming a downtrend while the QQQ is next in a short term downward channel  with the SPY holding in a consolidation range  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 19  2018  W W  Grainger reported EPS of  4 18 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 41 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 13  
For the current fiscal year  W W  Grainger is expected to post earnings of  13 81 per share on  10 94 billion in revenues  This represents a 20 51  change in EPS on a 4 9  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  15 87 per share on  11 69 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 14 94  and 6 9   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
W W  Grainger may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for GWW  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
W W  Grainger has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18 1X versus its peer group s average of 11 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 24  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective W W  Grainger  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  W W  Grainger currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if W W  Grainger fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though GWW shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does W W  Grainger Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of W W  Grainger have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including DMC Global   NASDAQ BOOM    HD Supply Holdings   NASDAQ HDS    and Ashtead Group  LON AHT  PLC   OTC ASHTY    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 15  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GWW  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-04-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ww-grainger-gww-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200307270,200307270

Review 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question   We noted this metric is used by so many traders that it often serves as a magnet  then support or resistance  But when something sends it through  it hits a lot of stops  for example  the S P 500 and Nasdaq had been skipping along the top of their 50 Day moving averages for a year  until the uptick in volatility started in February   If you missed it  a glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  How Do You Handle A Losing Streak 
If you ve been trading long enough  you ve undoubtedly experienced a losing streak at some point  And the important question is  how do you handle it  Do you make adjustments or stick strictly to your plan  One important key is to not get frustrated and start making silly mistakes such as inappropriate position sizing or risk taking  This is where the psychology of trading comes in  i e  the classic forces of fear and greed  for example  
The relationship between trading and psychology is a frequently covered topic across financial markets because the two are often so very interconnected  For example  Adam Grimes penned an excellent article earlier this week titled  Thinking about Thinking     In it  Grimes looks at a few practical ways in which psychology can cause brains to  misfire  when we re trading  particularly with regards to strings of losses  He explains what is obvious to many  i e   a string of winners can easily lead to overconfidence and to taking too much risk on the next trade    but he also explains the less obvious 

 Evolution probably favored cognitive development of paranoia  pattern recognition even when patterns are false  and immediate action  

It s an interesting 1 100 word read if you have a few minutes 
One reason traders build trading models  such as the ones we use later in this report  is to help avoid many of the common psychological errors that human traders make  another reason is because models can sift through lots of data much more efficiently than humans   However  as the Reformed Broker points out in his article from Wednesday      

 Even if a fund is quantitative  rules based and emotionless in how it operates  the investor flows coming and going into the funds will be as emotionally driven as they are everywhere else  

It s a good point  and interesting to think about  He goes on to give an example using CTA investments  whereby he points out an unfortunate case of investors chasing hot money only to wind up disappointed  There was a similarly interesting article in the Wall Street Journal a few months ago    whereby the authors tried to poke holes in Morningstar s popular star ratings because they re based simply on past performance  and there s a tendency for mean reversion among top performers  i e  what outperformed last period  tends to underperform this period   The WSJ article wasn t exactly fair to Morningstar  or successful in its critique   but it s another fun read  nonetheless 
Regarding our own trading models  we know  from testing  what to expect  And this helps us hang in there during the inevitable bad streak  It also helps if performance remains strongly positive in periods of relative underperformance  especially considering the returns have a lower correlation with the market  a powerful risk reducing diversification benefit 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models 

And as alluded to earlier  we find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And for these reasons  I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination

Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by    Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas  
Holmes  I recently purchased WW Grainger  NYSE GWW  on March 1st  when it was down  What do you think of this stock 
Blue Harbinger  Grainger is a distributor of maintenance  repair and operating   MRO   supplies to businesses and institutions  and the company has increased its dividend every year for more than 45 years in a row  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Holmes  That d be interesting if I was a dividend growth investor  but I am technical model  and I typically hold my positions for about six weeks 
BH  Well  Grainger announces earnings in a little over 5 weeks  so I m sure you are aware of that because earnings announcement can cause the price to move significantly  By the way  why did you buy Grainger 
Holmes  I am well aware of the upcoming earnings announcement  And I like these shares because I am a  dip buyer   and Grainger s dip over the last week is the sort of set up I like to see 

BH  Honestly  this looks like a really boring company to me  It s a low beta stock and the company was founded back in 1927  The shares have perked up a little since you purchased  perhaps because investors liked what  at the Raymond James Institutional Investor conference back on March 6th  I m surprised you bought this one  Holmes  but I do see the dip you re talking about  I ll check back with you on this one in about 6 weeks 
Holmes  Thanks  How about you  Road Runner  what do you like this week 
Road Runner  I bought Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  on 3 1  What do you think 
BH  The shares are up since you bought  so nice job  Why did you buy 
RR  I like to buy stocks at the low end of a rising channel  as LRCX was back on 3 1 when we bought  as shown in the following chart 

BH  I actually like that purchase  but I m partial to the semiconductor industry  in general  I still think that old story about computers eventually taking over the world has merit  and the computers are going to be powered by semiconductor chips  It s already happening with all the artificial intelligence  self driving vehicles  and the Internet of Things 
Road Runner  Interesting  You haven t been working a little too hard lately  BH  have you  And if the computers do take over the world  I ll be out of this trade long before then  I typically hold for about four weeks 
BH  Thanks  Interesting trade  Road Runner  And by the way  we wrote about man versus machine in this Stock Exchange Series a few months ago  
Road Runner  Earlier in this report we covered cognitive paranoia re read it 
BH  Thanks Road Runner  How about you  Felix what have you got this week 
Felix  I bought Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  on 3 5  I am a momentum trader  What do you think 

BH  Twitter is certainly a momentum stock lately  I seem to recall Athena also bought Twitter back on 2 22  Per Twitter s recent earnings announcement  it s nice to see the company finally turning a GAAP profit for the first time  However  I don t think this company is growing fast enough to get excited about  According to the earnings release  fourth quarter revenue grew by only 2  year over year  and net margins are only 12   Plus  it makes me a little uncomfortable that CEO Jack Dorsey is also the CEO of Square  NYSE SQ   I question his focus  And honestly  I like Square s business and growth potential much more  Here is a look at the Fast Graph for Twitter 

Felix  I typically hold my positions for about 66 weeks  which is significantly longer than the other traders 
BH  Good luck  Anything else for us this week 
Felix  Yes  here is my ranking of the top stocks in the Russell 1000 Large Cap index 

BH  Thanks for sharing  Lots to talk about in that ranking  I see you like Square Inc  NYSE SQ   semiconductor industry company Micron Technology Inc  NASDAQ MU   and US Steel  NYSE X  Jeff has covered the steel tariff twice in the last week 


Felix  Thanks  How about you  Oscar what do you have to share 
Oscar  This week I am sharing my top 20 ranking of the high volume ETF universe 

BH  I see you have the Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  NYSE UVXY  ranked at the top of your list  Those volatility based ETFs are tricky  especially with that spike in the VIX a month ago that surprised me  and a lot of others too  I know you are a momentum trader  and you typically hold for about 6 weeks  I ll keep an eye on UVXY  as well as a few others on your list  Thanks for sharing 
Conclusion 
No one gets their trades right all of the time  The trick is to make more money on your winners than you lose on your losers  And the matter of accomplishing that can be inhibited if you let the psychology of a losing streak get in your way  All serious traders have experienced a string of losing trades at some point  And it is critically important to understand the common causes of psychological  misfires  that can result  e g  fear  greed   so you are prepared to deal with them and ultimately return to growing your profits

7617,229132,GWW,Year Of The Dog Spells Good Times For Wall Street  5 Picks,opinion,The Chinese Year of the Dog kicked off on Feb 16  which has historically been promising for the U S  stock market  Astute investors  thus  should turn bullish and use this encouraging calendar year to their advantage  And why not  The Republican tax overhaul is expected to have a positive effect on earnings this year  Fears of surging inflation and higher interest rates  on the other hand  are unwarranted and likely to ease Year of the Dog is Great for the U S  Stock MarketThe U S  equity market traditionally performs well in the Year of the Dog  per LPL Research  Data from as early as 1950 showed that the 12 month return on the broader S P 500 in the year was up more than 15  on average In four of the last five Year of the Dog  the market clocked double digit gains  In 1958  returns were the highest  up 32 9   In the most recent one ending in 2006  the returns were also quite solid  increasing 12 4    Source  LPL Ryan Detrick  Senior Market Strategist at LPL added that  in fact  out of the 12 zodiac signs  no year sports a better average return   In the past Year of the Goat  Tiger  Ox  Rabbit  Pig  Monkey  Dragon  Horse  Rat  Rooster and Snake  the S P 500 had given an average return of 14 9   13 8   13 5   10 6   10 5   9 2   8 7   6 3   3 2   1 8  and 0 8   respectively Though a few may be skeptical about investing based on stars  but this Year of the Dog has certainly started off on a bullish note  The S P 500 managed to log its sixth straight rise on Feb 16  After all  U S  earnings expectations have sharply accelerated on tax stimulus  while inflation scares are overblown Tax Plan to Boost EarningsThe Trump administration s tax cut policy is expected to boost earnings  in a market that already has historically high valuations  The headline grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate is lowered from 35  to 21   Republicans also repealed the 20  corporate alternative minimum tax  while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8  to 15 5   instead of the current 35   read more    Earnings growth this year is set to be healthy  Most of the S P 500 companies have provided guidance that exceeded expectations  while the Q4 earnings season is already on track to be quite impressive  For the 398 S P 500 members that have reported results  earnings are up 14 5  from the same period last year on 9  higher revenues  with 77 9  beating EPS estimates and 75 6  surpassing revenue estimates In fact  Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 14  from the same period last year on 8 2  higher revenues  This will follow the 6 7  earnings growth recorded in the third quarter of 2017 on 5 8  higher revenues  read more    Inflation and Rate Hike Fears OverblownA surge in inflation in January possibly leading to faster than expected rate hikes did trigger a sudden panic among investors  Higher inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to hike short term interest rates at a faster pace than expected  This  in turn  will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers  which could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy But  market pundits believe that the spike in inflation last month will fizz out  Even though the consumer price index  CPI  inched up 0 5  in January from the previous month  it stayed at 2 1  in January on a year over year basis  Thus  it has fallen from the nearly 3  annual growth rate in the last three months  Meanwhile  the Fed s preferred inflation measure  the personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index  has been below the central bank s 2  target since mid 2012   Wage growth in January also doesn t hint at a surge in cost of living  After all  wages rose on colder than normal weather condition  which is a seasonal factor  Further  if managers and supervisors  salaries are excluded  hourly wages increased at a sluggish pace  This showed that much of the increase was not evenly distributed and concentrated mostly on managers  read more    5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness  investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Dog seems judicious  We

    Key Factors to ConsiderIn the first quarter  Grainger is expected to benefit from pricing initiatives  digital marketing strategies and efforts to bring its Canadian business back to profitability  Further  the first quarter margins remain typically higher due to price increase cycles  However  elevated expenses and fluctuation in oil and gas prices are likely to affect results Notably  the company is in the middle of a substantial transformation of the Canada business  Its focus on improving the business  cost structure through branch reductions  improving service to customers and the creation of North American centers of excellence will drive results  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates  net sales in the Canada segment are likely to rise around 2  to  190 million in the first quarter  Moreover  the segment will likely report an adjusted operating loss of  15 million  narrower than the operating loss of  15 6 million witnessed in first quarter 2017 Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Grainger s quarterly sales in the Unites States is  2 07 billion  reflecting around 5 9  year over year rise The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted operating income of the segment is pegged at  307 million in the first quarter compared to  306 million reported in the prior year quarter  Focus on pricing strategies  volume growth and an improving demand environment remain catalysts for the segment s performance in the quarter to be reported Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Grainger s earnings per share is pegged at  3 39 for the first quarter  reflecting year over year growth of 17 7  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  2 71 billion also indicates nearly 6 6  increase from the prior year quarter In addition  Grainger s price performance has been impressive over the past year  Shares of the company have appreciated around 27  outperforming growth of 16  recorded by the  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Grainger is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below   Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of  3 33 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 39  is  1 73   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Grainger currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  While this increases the predictive power of ESP  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise   It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter TPI Composites  Inc    NASDAQ TPIC    with an Earnings ESP of  120 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  The stock has gained 11 4  in a year s time  You can see  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    with an Earnings ESP of  3 41  and a Zacks Rank  3  Its shares have rallied 61 6  in the past year Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX    with an Earnings ESP of  1 96  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company s shares have been up 23  during the same time frame Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed  700 billion   more than a 3 800  increase in the previous 12 months  They re now bigger than Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and even Visa  The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved Zacks  has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market ",2018-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-in-the-offing-for-grainger-gww-in-q1-earnings-200306145,200306145
7628,229143,GWW,5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth To Buy Amid Choppy Markets,opinion,With markets in correction mode  it s very difficult to select stocks that will offer steady returns going forward  Investors may apply complex investment strategies with an aim to book higher returns but may not be rewarded with the desired returns Thus  at present  investors should use conventional strategies  based on key fundamentals  to select stocks  One such strategy is focus on sales growth Why Sales Growth Investors often fail to keep an eye on sales growth while picking stocks  as a company s share price is usually sensitive to its earnings momentum  Nonetheless  earnings are not the be all and end all in the sense that books can be easily manipulated  That s why sales should always be taken into consideration Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company s health and ability to sustain its business  It offers investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings Without some revenue growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable in the longer term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires sales growth Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Seattle  WA  Starbucks

7695,229210,GWW,How Do You Explain Fastenal s Valuation ,opinion," NASDAQ FAST  is expected to report earnings on Tuesday July 12th before the market opens 
The company has missed Wall Street s revenue and net income estimates in three out of the last four quarters  However  the stock appears immune to these negative surprises even as management continues to warn investors of economic headwinds 
Over the years  Fastenal has been a mystery to fundamental investors  The company has historically outperformed its competition  but investors are typically forward looking  We don t care about how well a company has performed  we care about how well a company will perform 
For example  take a look at the chart below that compares Fastenal s projected 5 year  growth rate vs competitors    NYSE MSM     NYSE GWW     NASDAQ HDS  and   NYSE WCC  
How do we explain this 
Income investors find Fastenal s dividend yield and growth rate highly attractive and are willing to pay a premium for it  The company has increased its dividends paid out to common shareholders on an average of  20  per year over the last 5 years 
However  this growth rate is not sustainable  The table below highlights how the company has needed to increase its  in order to keep up with this dividend growth rate that income investors love so much  Notice the company s YTD payout ratio currently has creeped all the way up to 69  

On a fundamental basis  Fastenal s fair value stands at  34 20 per share  which implies a  negative  23  margin of safety  However  the company is a dividend paying machine that income investors love  While a dividend growth rate of 20  is unsustainable  it s unlikely Fastenal s valuation will come back down to earth anytime soon unless the company serves up a huge earnings miss on Tuesday ",2016-07-08,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-do-you-explain-fastenal’s-valuation-200140867,200140867
7699,229214,GWW,W W  Grainger  Decades Of Growth Ahead,opinion,"The last time I analyzed W W  Grainger  N GWW   I was impressed by the company s clear growth plan and strong expected total returns 
The company s growth plan   which is discussed in detail in this article   along with its reasonable valuation and 43 years of consecutive dividend increases make the company a favorite of The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing 
W W  Grainger stacks up favorably to most other dividend growth investments at this time both qualitatively and quantitatively  I am long W W  Grainger and plan to hold the company s stock indefinitely  I suggest other dividend growth investors consider W W  Grainger as well 
W W Grainger  GWW  is the leader in the United States maintenance  repair  and operations  abbreviated MRO  supply industry
The company has a network of 713 branches and 34 distribution centers  The bulk of the company s supply chain is based in the United States and Canada 
W W  Grainger also runs the following MRO e commerce sites 

MonatoRO in Japan
Cromwell in the United Kingdom
Zoro in North America and Western Europe

W W  Grainger s Growth Story
Before examining W W  Grainger s future growth potential  it is important to understand how quickly the company has grown historically  W W Grainger has grown its earnings per share at 15  a year over the last decade  
The company s historical growth   and much of its future growth potential   come from W W  Grainger s slow consolidation of the fragmented MRO industry in North America  W W  Grainger is the industry leader in North America  yet it controls just 6  if the United States MRO market and 8  of the Canadian MRO market  The image below shows W W  Grainger s market share by region 

Source  W W  Grainger 2015 Fact Book
With its small market share relative to the large MRO market  W W  Grainger has many decades of growth ahead 
The company s well established supply chain gives it a strong competitive advantage  W W  Grainger can offer next day ground delivery to more than 95  of its customers in North America 
W W  Grainger is also focusing on international e commerce growth to grow revenue  The company is taking advantage of Japan s small geographic size and dense population to quickly build a viable distribution network in the country  The Japanese MonatoRO MRO e commerce site served over 600 000 customers in 2014   and is still growing rapidly 
W W  Grainger is expecting sales of  500 million from MonatoRO in fiscal 2015  The company expects to double sales from MonatoRO to  1 billion in just 5 years  This is not unprofitable growth  MonatoRO has a ROIC  return on invested capital  of around 40  
W W  Grainger s European e commerce operations are also performing well  European sales are expected to grow from a very small base currently to about  200 million a year by 2020 
The company s e commerce operations are also expected to grow rapidly in the United States  Sales are expected to more than triple from  300 million currently to  1 billion over the same time period 
W W  Grainger s Expected Total Returns
Investors in W W  Grainger should expect double digit total returns going forward  The company is targeting revenue growth of between 7  and 12  a year over the next 5 years  This growth will come from a mix of continued organic growth and bolt on acquisitions  plus e commerce growth 
The next largest growth driver for W W  Grainger will be share repurchases  Over the last decade  the company has reduced its share count by 3  a year on average  Over the next three years  W W  Grainger s management is committing  3 billion to share repurchases  At current prices  this comes to share repurchases of around 7 5  of shares outstanding a year 
This spectacular level of share repurchases will not occur indefinitely  W W  Grainger will fund some of these purchases by issuing long term debt  which it plans to hold permanently  W W  Grainger is targeting an extremely conservative debt to EBIDTA ratio of 1 0 to 1 5  After the current round of share repurchases is exhausted  I expect W W  Grainger to continue repurchasing shares at around 3  a year 
On top of revenue growth and share repurchases  W W  Grainger stock currently has a 2 2  dividend yield 
To summarize  the company will generate 16 7  to 21 7  annualized total returns over the next 3 years from 

Revenue growth of 7  to 12  a year
Share repurchases of  7 5  a year
Dividends of 2 2  a year

The company could potentially grow even faster if margins continue to expand  as they are expected to   W W  Grainger s net profit margin has grown at 3 9  a year over the last decade  Margin expansion is a result of economies of scale generated by the company s growth  If W W  Grainger continues to expand its margins at the same rate it has over the last decade  expected annualized returns over the next 3 years are 20 6  to 25 6   I realize these are almost unbelievable numbers  but this is the economic reality of W W  Grainger s expected growth plans 
Bear Case  Recent Weakness and Potential Troubles Ahead
There is a downside to investing in W W  Grainger  just like any stock   The expected total returns above are only applicable if the global economy doesn t fall into a deep recession  W W  Grainger s earnings per share fell by 13 8  in 2009 during the worst of the Great Recession  In 2010  earnings per share hit new record highs 
W W  Grainger s most recent results were much weaker than expected growth over the next 3 years  The company saw earnings per share decline 8  in its most recent quarter  Many of W W  Grainger s customers in the oil and gas sector are laying off employees and restructuring their businesses  This is resulting in temporary earnings declines for W W  Grainger  If oil and gas prices continue to fall  the company will not hit its lofty growth expectations 
Global recessions and falling oil and gas prices will delay W W  Grainger s growth  not cancel it all together 
The other threat W W  Grainger is facing is a new entrant to its market   Amazon  O AMZN   Amazon s new business service is targeting business purchases rather than personal purchases  At first glance  Amazon is appealing more to office related purchasers  This will affect the sales of Staples  O SPLS  and other office supply companies more than the MRO industry  Still  Amazon s focus on business customers could slow growth somewhat for W W  Grainger 
W W  Grainger Is Trading Around Fair Value
W W  Grainger has tremendous upside  The bear case for the company s stock is much weaker than the bull case  The final question for investors looking to start  or add to  a position in W W  Grainger is 
Is the company fairly valued 
W W  Grainger is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 18 4  The S P 500 currently has a price to earnings ratio of 22 0 
W W  Grainger is an extremely high quality business with excellent long term growth potential  There is no reason the company should be trading for a price to earnings multiple less than that of the S P 500  At current prices  I believe W W  Grainger to be undervalued relative to the market 
W W  Grainger is exactly the type of business I look for   a high quality  shareholder friendly business with a strong competitive advantage that has a clear and obvious growth plan  In addition  the company s stock is likely undervalued  Qualitatively  W W  Grainger s upside is much greater than its downside  Quantitatively  it ranks in the Top 10 of 180  dividend stocks with 25  years of dividend payments without a reduction using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing ",2015-11-08,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrats-part-21-of-52:-w.w.-grainger-270607,270607
7700,229215,GWW,10 Stocks To Get You Through A Bear Market,opinion,"Last month  we highlighted the common bond between the stocks that delivered big returns in the market crash of 2008  We saw that companies that earned a consistently high return on invested capital    were the only ones to survive unscathed 
While it s unlikely we re in for a repeat of 2008  recent volatility will certainly have investors wondering how to protect their portfolio in the event that our 7 year bull market has ended  and we re in for a significant downturn 
With that in mind 
They have high ROIC s  10  or higher in every year for the past decade
They have consistent ROIC s  among the lowest variance year by year of all S P 500 stocks
They earn our Attractive or better rating
Figure 1  Best Stocks For A Bear Market

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Viacom B Inc  O VIAB  is our top ranked stock on this list  and the only one to earn our Very Attractive rating  We ve liked VIAB for a long time    Since then  the stock has been on a roller coaster ride  gaining almost 75  between our first article and its peak in early 2014 before crashing back down by 50  
The recent decline is due in part to concerns over cord cutting and increasing competition for ad dollars  as well as questions over the health of executive chairman Sumner Redstone  who owns 80  of the company s shares 
These fears mask the fact that Viacom s business continues to thrive  When we remove the impact of one time write downs and restructuring charges  we see that VIAB actually grew net operating profit after tax    by 7  in 2015 and increased its ROIC for the fifth straight year 
Make no mistake  this remains a very strong business  The continual improvement in ROIC shows that cord cutters are not hurting it as much as investors believe  and while Redstone s health is a concern  he has not been heavily involved in running the business for several years now 
Not only is VIAB a strong business  the 50  drop over the past couple years means the market has already more than priced in any decline in profits that might occur  At its current price of  41 share  VIAB has a price to economic book value ratio  PEBV  of 0 5  which implies that the market believes its NOPAT will permanently decline by 50  
At such a cheap valuation  VIAB can use its  3 billion in annual free cash flow to buyback stock  retiring shares at a undervalued price  thereby increasing the overall value for remaining shareholders  Last year  VIAB returned  2 1 billion  13  of market cap  to shareholders through dividends and buybacks  and that s with the buyback program having been halted for roughly half the year  We can expect an even bigger return of capital to shareholders this year with the resumption of buybacks in October 
Buy This Blue Chip Retailer
Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  is another stock we ve been following for a long time that has been unfairly punished by the market over the past year  The market overreacted to some poor earnings reports to send shares of WMT down 27  in the last twelve months  even though the company still earns a 10 8  ROIC and has taken steps to reduce its debt load in the past year 
WMT is also the only stock on this list that also made it onto the list of stocks that gained 10   in 2008  so it has proved its ability to thrive in a down market  Its 3  gain so far in 2016 as the rest of the market falls suggests that investors know this history and are already to flocking to one of the biggest blue chips around 
At its current price of  63 share  WMT has a PEBV of 0 8  which suggests that the market expects a permanent 20  decline in NOPAT  Even with the threat of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and other online retailers  it s hard to imagine a company with WMT s track record of growth and profitability experiencing such a drastic decline 
Boring Can Be Beautiful
WW Grainger Inc  N GWW  is not the kind of company that tends to get investors excited  It s an industrial supply company that sells motors  lighting  fasteners  plumbing  and other necessities to customers in a wide variety of industries 
Not the kind of business you expect to deliver massive returns  yet over the past decade GWW has nearly tripled the performance of the S P 500  That s due in no small part to the fact that  when the market crashed in 2008  GWW fell by less than 10  
GWW s products are the kinds that most business cannot do without  They do experience slight declines in revenues and profit during a recession  but nothing too significant  At its worst point in 2009  GWW still earned an ROIC of 13  
GWW is not quite as cheap as some of the other stocks on this list  with a PEBV of 1 2  which means the market expects profits to grow by no more than 20  from current levels for the remainder of its corporate life  Those are still low expectations for a company with 12  compounded annual NOPAT growth over the past 10 years 
Finding Stability In A Volatile Market
The stocks in Figure 1 come from a number of different industries  media  consumer staples  advertising  tech  healthcare  etc  Their primary link is that they have proven their ability to thrive regardless of economic and market conditions 
Even in the troubled recession years  all these stocks continued to earn a top tier ROIC  Over the past five years  they ve had extremely low variance in ROIC  delivering consistently year over year rather than going from boom to bust 
These are the stocks you want to own when the market turns bearish  At that point  the high flying momentum stocks that sell investors on their future potential sink like rocks  Only companies that consistently deliver strong cash flow can weather the market storm

7701,229216,GWW,GWW  Counter Cyclical Cash Flow And 44 Straight Years Of Dividend Growth,opinion,"W W  Grainger  N GWW  is a time tested business that has rewarded investors with 44 consecutive years of dividend increases  Like many other industrial companies  weak energy markets  sluggish growth in China  and foreign currency headwinds are challenging GWW s current business trends 
As a result  the stock s dividend yield sits at 2 4   which is well above its five year average dividend yield of 1 5   With a sturdy business model  healthy free cash flow generation  and decent long term growth potential  GWW is a dividend growth stock we are watching for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewGWW was founded in 1927 and is a leading distributor of maintenance  repair  and operating  MRO  products that include motors  lab supplies  power transmission  test instruments  outdoor equipment  safety products  power tools  and janitorial supplies  More than 4 500 manufacturers supply GWW with 1 4 million products made available to customers through GWW s branches and distribution centers  The average customer invoice for GWW s products is about  250  and customers place orders over the phone  at local branches  online  36  of sales   and using mobile devices 
The company has over 1 4 million customers in the U S   78  of sales  and meaningful operations also in Canada  10    Japan  and Western Europe 
Its customers represent a broad collection of categories including heavy manufacturing  18  of sales   commercial construction  14    government  13    contractors  11    light manufacturing  11    retail wholesale  6    transportation  6    natural resources  5    and more Business AnalysisGWW operates in extremely large  fragmented markets  According to a company presentation  GWW pegs the North American MRO market at  150 billion and the worldwide market at  545 billion  As seen below  the U S  MRO market has also steadily grown in value over the last three decades 
Source  GWW Investor Presentation
As we mentioned  the MRO market is very fragmented  GWW provided the following image in its 2015 Fact Book  It shows that GWW has the largest market share in North America at just 6   and the other 10 largest distributors collectively hold about 26  market share 
Source  GWW Fact Books
Understand why the MRO market is so fragmented is the key to understanding GWW s competitive advantages  GWW mostly serves large customers  and these businesses require a wide range of products that they need delivered quickly and cost effectively 
With the largest network of distribution centers and store branches  over 680  in the country  GWW is strategically positioned with localized inventory that is close to its most important customers  Being in close proximity to customers helps GWW deliver products to them very quickly  offer a high quality of service  and keep costs low  Competitors would need to acquire properties in the same service area to compete with GWW  but they wouldn t have the established book of business to cover all of their costs  The mature state of the MRO market makes it very difficult for new players to crack into a geography already covered by a capable distributor  somewhat limiting competition 
GWW s scale and inventory assortment are also advantages  especially in the large customer market  As the largest player in North America  GWW has somewhat better purchasing power than local or regional distributors  This allows it to offer very competitive pricing for its products  which are generally undifferentiated from one distributor to the next 
Importantly  GWW s size also enables it to afford an extremely broad selection of merchandise  making it a one stop shop for large accounts that are constantly looking to save money by consolidating suppliers  GWW s U S  catalog offering has grown more than seven fold from 82 000 SKUs in 2005 to more than 592 000 SKUs in the 2014 edition  Impressively  the time a product is in stock has remained at nearly 100  even while increasing the product line substantially  With thousands of suppliers  this is no small feat  Grainger com in the U S  also offers access to 1 5 million SKUs 
On the topic of e commerce  many investors are surprised when they learn that GWW was recognized as the 13th largest e retailer in North America by Internet Retailer  It started the industry s first e commerce operations in 1996  and 36  of its sales last year were from this higher margin channel  online orders require less data entry work  are primarily shipped from distribution centers to bypass the branch network  and have a higher average order size  
By investing significantly in technology  GWW is better positioned than many other distributors as more sales are made online and through multiple channels  E commerce sales were only 15  of GWW s total revenue in 2009 and are expected to reach over 50  of total sales longer term 
Technology investments also help strengthen GWW s supply chain and customer service  More than 1 200 of GWW s employees are on site at customer locations providing services such as inventory management to help them lower their costs and automate inventory orders from GWW when their supplies get low  This creates switching costs and builds up customer loyalty 
Going forward  GWW s strategy is to increase its presence with small and mid sized businesses  which together account for more than 65  of the market  GWW has done very well serving large  complex customers  but its presence with smaller customers has been more limited 
The business seems to have the products  distribution  and e commerce capabilities to more effectively serve these customers  but it needs to execute  If GWW is successful and the macro environment cooperates  management expects the business to report at least mid single digit organic sales growth and consistent operating margin expansion each year  driven by operating leverage and continuous productivity improvements Key RisksGWW s business is sensitive to the industrial economy  which has really been struggling  From low oil prices to slower growth in China to the strong U S  dollar  numerous headwinds are impacting ordering trends and resulting in modest pricing pressure at GWW s customers  When growth is low  price competition can become fiercer between distributors as they look to protect market share and take out costs 
Longer term  we think GWW s greater breadth of products  strong reputation  gradually expanding distribution network  and future acquisitions should help it continue growing  The overall health of the economy will dictate the pace and timing of growth  but GWW s large markets seem to offer plenty of opportunities 
Regarding competitive threats  Amazon  O AMZN  should be mentioned given the increasing importance of online sales in the industry  GWW noted during a recent conference call that Amazon has been in its business for about 15 years  Management sees Amazon mostly in its small customer business  which represents a much lower proportion of GWW s overall sales  For now  large customers  needs are generally more complex than what Amazon or other pure play e commerce players can provide  but it s something worth monitoring 
Beyond Amazon  other non traditional players that have distribution and a broad selection of inventory are stores like Home Depot  N HD  and Lowe s  N LOW   However  we are not aware of any threats from that front today  Regardless  the large  fragmented nature of GWW s markets seems to mitigate many of these competitive risks  Perhaps the bigger risk is whether or not GWW can get profitable growth going with small and mid sized customers  which it has historically been less effective at targeting Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
GWW s dividend is literally one of the most reliable payments you can find  The company s dividend Safety Score is an outstanding 100  Let s learn why 
Over the last four quarters  GWW s dividend has consumed 40  of its earnings and 50  of its free cash flow  As seen below  the company s payout ratios have increased slightly over the last decade but have remained fairly stable  This means that GWW s dividend growth has largely been fueled by earnings growth  a healthy situation  Payout ratios below 50  also provide plenty of cushion and room for future dividend growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As we mentioned in our introduction  GWW s business is sensitive to the broader economy  However  many MRO products are  mission critical  and needed by businesses regardless of how the economy is doing  If a valuable piece of equipment breaks down  it needs to be fixed  As seen below  GWW s sales fell by 9  during fiscal year 2009  and the company s earnings contracted by just 6   Not bad for an industrial business  GWW s stock also outperformed the S P 500 by 29  in 2008 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
It s also worth noting that GWW s business model has generated extremely predictable free cash flow every single year over the last decade  Importantly  distributors actually generate more free cash flow during recessions  see the jump in fiscal year 2009  because they are able to collect their accounts receivables and liquidate some of their inventory  freeing up cash  You will also note in our earlier graph of GWW s free cash flow payout ratio that the company s payout ratio dropped from 35  in 2008 to 23  in 2009 as a result  This unique business model characteristic further strengthens the security of GWW s dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While GWW s business is fairly boring and basic  its returns on invested capital are anything but  The company s lowest annual return on invested capital over the last decade is 15   GWW is clearly a well run business with meaningful advantages in the markets it serves Source  Simply Safe Dividends
GWW s consistency and counter cyclical cash flows certainly provide a deal of comfort  However  analyzing the balance sheet is always relevant  Too much debt can still get even the safest business into unexpected trouble 
GWW recently took on debt to repurchase shares  but its balance sheet still looks to be in decent shape  All of the company s net debt could be covered with cash on hand and one year of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   GWW also has an  AA   debt rating Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  there s not much to dislike about the quality of GWW s dividend  The company s payout ratios are very reasonable  it generates counter cyclical free cash flow  and the balance sheet is healthy  This is one of the most reliable dividends out there Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
GWW s dividend Growth Score of 76 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is higher than 76  of all other dividend paying stocks in the market 
GWW has increased its dividend for 44 consecutive years and is an S P 500 Dividend Aristocrat  If the company increases its dividend for the next six years as well  it will join the exclusive list of dividend kings  which contains all companies that have raised their dividend for at least 50 straight years 
As seen below  GWW has recorded double digit dividend growth over all periods during its last 10 fiscal years  While macro headwinds have created a challenging near term business environment  we expect the company to keep growing its dividend by at least 4 6  per year until conditions improve  at which point growth could return closer to 10  Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationGWW trades at about 16x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 2 4   which is significantly higher than its five year average dividend yield of 1 5  
Assuming macro conditions eventually recover and the company gets back on track with at least mid single digit organic sales growth  we believe earnings could grow at a high single digit rate  When combined with GWW s 2 4  dividend yield  the stock appears to offer double digit total return potential  Macro conditions could further deteriorate  but patient investors seem likely to be rewarded over the next 3 5 years ConclusionGWW is a high quality industrial business with strong staying power  Its broad assortment of products  extensive distribution network  reputation for quality  and leading e commerce presence will likely keep GWW relevant for a long time in the slow changing MRO market 
The company s dividend payment is highly secure with above average growth potential  and macro headwinds have caused this blue chip dividend stock to trade at an attractive price relative to history  Patient dividend growth investors should keep an eye on GWW ",2016-02-01,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/counter-cyclical-cash-flow-and-44-straight-years-of-dividend-growth-382659,382659

The CAD fell to its lowest level since 2009 as the Bank of Canada cut its interest rate by 25 basis points for the second time in 2015 to stimulate the economy which is struggling with the declining price of oil  which makes up 25  of its merchandise export 
This caused a breakout above the triple top at 1 28 handle and it is now looking to test 1 3000 which has been the major resistance level back in 2008 and 2009 
USDCAD rallied more than 1 000 pips in just over two months as WTI crude oil started to show some weakness after finding resistance at  62 50  Although the current bullish momentum still looks strong as it is forming an uptrend channel  we see a good shorting opportunity at 1 3000 as we believe the recent surging price actions in USDCAD were driven by the anticipation of the rate cut 
Hence we expect a retracement towards the previous resistance level of the 1 2800 area which may act as interim support

7726,229241,GWW,Why Accomplished Dividend Growth Investors Can Ignore Price Volatility ,opinion,IntroductionFor a lot of reasons  dividend growth investing is becoming more and more popular every day  The historically low interest rate on fixed income is perhaps one important reason for this trend  However  an equally important  and perhaps even the most important reason  might just be that investors are better informed on the dividend growth strategy than ever before On the other hand  there seems to be a side effect to the better medicine that dividend growth investing offers  As dividend growth investing has become more popular  there have been many proponents gleefully willing to share their enthusiasm and commitment to the benefits of dividend growth investing for their retirement portfolios This has simultaneously created the equivalent of a negative feedback loop against dividend growth investing  Sometimes dividend growth investors appear to come off as smug  and this irritates certain people  Personally  I don t believe they are as arrogant  as they are enthusiastic disciples of the incontrovertible logic supporting dividend growth investing as a prudent and viable strategy However  as it often is with controversy regarding investment strategies  much of the consternations are rooted in biases rather than facts  Furthermore  I believe there is also a strong element of prejudice against all things equities built into many of the arguments against dividend growth stock investing  Investors remembering the enormous trauma of falling stock prices during the Great Recession of 2008 are quick to paint all equities with the same high risk brush Moreover  the stress from watching their retirement portfolios depreciate in value  as stock prices fell  caused many to take unnecessary losses  The Great Recession  and all the media blitz that surrounded it  panicked people into selling perfectly good stocks at the bottom of the market  For those whose investment objectives were total return in order to accommodate liquidating part of their portfolios under the so called 4  rule  this behavior was somewhat rational  Here is a link to a recent Wall Street Journal article that elaborates more on the 4  rule However  dividend growth investors  as I will elaborate more on later  who are mainly focused on the income component of their portfolios  were spared this financially devastating fate  But for now  let me state that what differentiates the dividend growth investor from the total return investor most  is their focus on income over price volatility  The point is that even though the prices of their dividend growth stocks were falling during the great recession of 2008  for the most part  their incomes continued to grow  Dividends usually don t fall with stock prices  they are usually only in jeopardy if earnings are simultaneously falling Most of the arguments that I have seen being placed against dividend growth investing as a safe and reliable investment strategy for retirement  are caused from a deeply rooted level of trauma caused by these previously mentioned massive 2008 price drops  The rhetoric usually goes something like  quality dividend paying stocks did not protect investors from the enormous losses to their portfolio values caused by the Great Recession of 2008  Dividend stocks  they argue  fell just as much and alongside non dividend paying stocks The mistake behind this logic is in not understanding that all stock price drops are not the same  For example  if the business behind the stock remains strong  i e  earnings continue to grow and advance or at least remain profitable  a falling stock price will often represent an opportunity  However  if stock prices are falling in concert with an unending deterioration of business fundamentals  then the stock price collapse may be generating a permanent impairment of capital  Understanding these distinctions is critical with implementing a successful stock investing strategy  I will provide examples later in the article Why Accomplished Dividend Growth Investors Can Ignore Stock Price VolatilityFirst of all  let me start this section by saying that it is not true that dividend growth investors do not care at all about capital appreciation  Total Return   In truth  they care very much  and who doesn t enjoy seeing the value of their stock holdings appreciate over time  However  the competent dividend growth investor attempts to build a dividend paying portfolio that will support their retirement needs without ever having to harvest any of their principal  Therefore  as long as their income is not affected by price volatility  they can calmly and intelligently ignore volatile market actions  This is a great and powerful advantage Furthermore  the accomplished dividend growth investor also attempts to position their dividend paying portfolio in stocks that can provide them an increasing dividend each year  Consequently  the income component of their dividend paying stocks offers a built in inflation hedge  With a well designed dividend growth stock portfolio the retiree is no longer subjugated to living on a fixed income  Dividend growth stocks with a long legacy of increasing their dividend every year offer the retiree the benefit of a raise in pay each year With Quality Dividend Growth Stocks  Dividend Income Is Stable But Prices Are NotMost investors are fixated on  and some even obsessed  with the price movements of their common stock holdings  If the price of a stock they buy drops after they buy it  it is immediately categorized as a dog  and vice versa  The problem with this line of thinking is that a price rise  or drop  can actually be quite irrational  and therefore misleading to the extent that it can cause the opposite reaction to what it should  In other words  it often incites people to buy when they should be selling and sell when they should be buying Consequently  investors are often conned into making the classic mistake of buying high and selling low  Peter Lynch tried to point out the error in this line of thinking when he said  Just because you buy a stock and it goes up does not mean you are right  Just because you buy a stock and it goes down does not mean you are wrong   Peter Lynch  One Up On Wall Street I believe that investors in common stocks  dividend paying or not  need to recognize that price volatility is a fact of investing life  and cannot be avoided  The stock market is an auction  where people are continuously buying and selling stocks  Therefore  like any auction  prices can be quite volatile and often emotionally charged  In the short run  it s all about how many buyers show up today versus how many sellers  Business results take a back seat  but longer term they matter most The Truth About RecessionsMuch of what this article is all about  is my recommendation to do all you can to keep emotions in check when making investment decisions  It is very easy to get caught up in the hype and hysteria  especially when mainstream media bombards us with endless tales of doom and gloom  And nothing seems to strike more fear in the hearts and minds of the everyday investor than the  R  word  Just the mere mention of the word  recession  can cause the bravest investor to go weak in their knees As I previously mentioned  I believe that the Great Recession of 2008 has had a lasting negative impact on the attitudes of many investors towards common stocks  The old adage that  Wall Street climbs a wall of worry  comes to mind  Since the stock market bottomed in February of 2009  we have had four years of exceptional stock price appreciation  Yet through it all  there s been an endless barrage of negative prognosticators warning us of the pending collapse  These dire forecasts continue today Therefore  I thought it would be valuable to put recessions into perspective  First of all  they simply represent a temporary interruption in the long term upward business cycle of growth  And as it pertains to the stock market  recessions normally bring with them a bear market  However  it s important to remember how all bear markets have ended  Following every bear market in history has been an extended bull market  When thought of in this way  it becomes apparent that recessions are more about great buying opportunities than they are catastrophe Please do not take what I m saying to imply that I do not recognize the pain  suffering and angst that recessions cause  Instead  my goal is to simply put a recession into its proper perspective in order to help investors relieve some of the anxiety that they bring  The most important message is that recessions do end  and that we should fear the fear of a recession more than we do the recession itself  I offer the following hypothetical dividend growth portfolio to illuminate the veracity of my major positions about dividend growth investing and recessions  First  I want to show that a portfolio of high quality dividend growth stocks can fall in market value during a recession  while simultaneously continuing to increase their dividend income stream  Secondly  I want to illustrate that these recessionary price drops most often represent extraordinary opportunities at best  and at worst simply embody a valley that shrewd investors are willing to walk through A Hypothetical Dividend Growth PortfolioI offer the following 10 dividend growth stocks as an example of a hypothetical dividend growth stock portfolio that was built one year prior to the Great Recession of 2008  Therefore  the portfolio is fully exposed to the price erosion that accompanied the Great Recession  Moreover  this portfolio will illustrate how this price volatility affected annual capital appreciation  but also how dividend income continued to steadily increase in spite of price volatility As a few points of clarification  I m only utilizing 10 examples so that I can provide detail on each without asking the reader to endure too much redundancy  In the real world  I would build a dividend growth portfolio comprised of 20 to 25 stocks for investors in the accumulation phase  and 30 to 50 stocks for retired investors in the distribution phase  My logic is simple  I prefer more concentration when attempting to generate a higher total return  and more diversification when there is not enough time to overcome the risk of loss Furthermore  I chose the specific 10 examples for various reasons  I wanted to include companies that were able to go through the recession with little or no damage to their business results  Colgate Palmolive  Family Dollar Stores  VF Corp  and Kimberly Clark represent companies that showed little stress with their earnings growth in 2008  Consolidated Edison  Air Products   Chemicals and W W  Grainger had a more severe earnings drop in 2008  but yet all three remained very profitable ongoing enterprises Illinois Tool Works and Stanley Black   Decker are two examples of companies whose earnings decreases extended beyond one year  Nevertheless  both companies remained profitable and increased their dividends  albeit at a lower than typical rate of growth  Finally  I included Franklin Resources as an example of a financial that suffered more recessionary damage than the other nine  but was still able to increase their regular dividend  and even made several special dividend distributions that rewarded their shareholders above their historical norms Hypothetical Dividend Growth Portfolio ReviewPerformance Prior  During and After the Great RecessionThe following table illustrates several important attributes and benefits of how this quality dividend growth stock portfolio comprised of Dividend Champions or Aristocrats performed through the Great Recession of 2008  The first column shows the capital appreciation depreciation effects of stock price volatility  Here we discover that capital depreciation of just under  25 000  24   in 2008 represented a lack of liquidity more than a loss As long as the investor did not panic and turn an unrealized loss into a realized loss  there was no permanent damage to their net worth  But more importantly  we see from the Dividend Income column that their cash flow increased from  2 313 in 2007 to  2 530 in 2008  Accomplished dividend growth investors primarily focused on their income  were happy to receive a raise in pay during the throes of the Great Recession What is really interesting about this portfolio is how quickly it recovered from the losses of 2008  By year end 2009  the portfolio s value had recovered to its previous high valuation  and capital appreciation and the growing dividend income stream both continued their strong ascent thereafter Hypothetical Portfolio Performance  Capital Appreciation   Dividend Income 2007 2012The Angel is in the DetailsAt this point  I would like to turn to the F A S T  Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  in order to illustrate how benign a recession  even a doozy like we had in 2008  can really be longer term  I would utilize the specific examples of the 10 companies in my portfolio to alter the adage  the devil is in the details  to turn it into the angel is in the details  In other words  a picture is worth 1000 words towards bringing a clearer perspective to what a recession really means to investors long term  I tend to let the graphs speak for themselves  However  a few tips on interpreting what the Earnings and Price Correlated graphs and performance tables are depicting should prove useful  The orange line on the graph plots earnings  the light blue shaded area represents dividends  the dark blue line represents a calculation of how the market has normally valued the business over the time frame graphed  and the black line is monthly closing stock prices Therefore  as each graph is reviewed  notice what happens to earnings  the orange line   how stock prices react and look to the bottom of the graph  or the dividend cash flow table  to see how the dividend grows each year  I have placed a red circle around the price action during the Great Recession for focus  Notice how seeing the price action in graphic form diminishes the fear and anxiety that the price drops generated as they occurred  In other words  even though the price drops were huge  they don t appear so frightening when a longer term perspective is taken Colgate Palmolive Co   CL Colgate Palmolive  the business  went through the Great Recession almost as if it never occurred  Both earnings and dividend growth showed strong growth  Price dropped  but quickly recovered  Finally  notice that Colgate Palmolive is routinely awarded a premium valuation by the market Family Dollar Stores  FDO Although Family Dollar Stores experienced a slight weakness in their earnings during the Great Recession  note how profits and dividends both accelerated as the recession came to a close VF Corp   VFC VF Corp  experienced very mild stress and interruption of their earnings during and one year after the recession  but also experienced rapid acceleration as the recession ended  Notice how stock price closely correlated to VF Corp  s earnings Kimberly Clark  KMB Kimberly Clark is not the fastest growing company in this group  but their record since 2007 shows that they may be the most consistent business  Other than a temporary drop in stock price  Kimberly Clark shareholders might not have noticed that a recession occurred Air Products   Chemicals Inc   APD Although Air Products   Chemicals experienced a severe price drop during the Great Recession  there are two factors that should be considered  First of all  the company was overpriced in the early part of 2008  Also  even though earnings did fall 22  during the Great Recession  stock price dramatically overacted  Consolidated Edison  ED Consolidated Edison is a slow growth utility that experienced a drop in earnings and stock price during the Great Recession  However  notice the long term correlation between price and earnings  W W  Grainger Inc  GWW W W  Grainger Inc experienced a moderated interruption in earnings during the Great Recession followed by a strong acceleration of earnings growth in 2010 and 2011  Consequently  performance over the time frame 2007 to current has been extraordinary despite going through the recession Illinois Tool Works  ITW Illnois Tool Works did experience two consecutive years of falling earnings during the throes of the Great Recession   However  stock price and earnings both have recovered nicely  and the dividend was increased every year Stanley Black   Decker Inc  SWK Stanley Black   Decker Inc also had two years of down earnings during the recession  but was still able to raise their dividend both years Franklin Resources Inc  BEN Franklin Resources Inc is in the financial services industry  but the company was not nearly as exposed to the credit markets like the money center banks were  Nevertheless  they did experience a severe earnings drop in calendar year 2009  However  the company did continue to raise their regular dividend and pay special dividends following the Great Recession  Therefore  their shareholders  income component was actually better than normal since the Great Recession  Two Examples Where Business Results Created More Permanent Price DamageFor the sake of balance  I did want to illustrate with the following two examples that not every company was able to navigate the Great Recession with as little damage as my 10 portfolio sample companies did  The Great Recession did have a lasting impact on many companies  especially those with major exposure to financial lending  General Electric is a conglomerate that greatly expanded their financial lending segments in order to participate in the large level of profitability that lenient lending practices were generating  Of course Citigroup was a major player whose business model is highly exposed to the reckless and leveraged lending practices of most financials A quick review of their Earnings and Price Correlated graphs reveals that price drops  in conjunction with permanent or at least more lasting impairments of capital  are more serious than temporary interruptions  These examples illustrate the importance of comprehensive monitoring and due diligence on each company that an investor holds in their portfolio  Even then it would be impossible to be correct in every case  However  appropriate diversification  coupled with research can keep any damage to a minimum General Electric Co  GE Citigroup Inc  C Summary and ConclusionsBuilding a portfolio comprised of high quality dividend paying companies  especially Dividend Champions  can be an excellent way for retirees to fund their retirement  Moreover  and in contrast to the widely promoted 4  rule where retirees are actually liquidating portions of their portfolio to make distributions  a well designed dividend growth portfolio can avoid this problem  There is more than one way to accomplish this feat  If you build a diversified portfolio of dividend growth stocks where your average yield is 4  or greater  then you can meet the suggested 4  distribution requirement without ever having to touch any of your principal  Even better  mix in enough Dividend Champions or Aristocrats  and you can expect to receive a raise in pay each year For those that may be years away from retirement  the portfolio could be constructed with a greater focus on growth than on yield with the idea that growth yield  yield on cost  could fund your retirement needs when retirement actually comes  Additionally  there are several iterations and variances of these two themes that can be initiated depending on the unique situation of each individual  Finally  in order for a dividend growth portfolio to succeed  investors must accept and recognize that continuous due diligence and monitoring is an absolute necessity  However  there are many sources and tools that can provide investors an edge and or make it easier for these objectives to be accomplished  FAST Graphs  is one  and websites such as Seeking Alpha  GuruFocus  Forbes  Morningstar  Value Line  Google Finance  Yahoo Finance  MSN Money  TheStreet com  and

Factors Likely at PlayWhile volumes will improve driven by price initiatives and improved demand environment  the bottom line is likely to face the brunt of elevated expenses  Expenses in the fourth quarter will be higher due to normal seasonality and also due to the incremental investments in the single channel online business and digital marketing The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  2 6 billion indicates 2  growth from the prior year quarter  However  growth in the top line will not translate to growth in earnings due to higher expenses as evident from drop of 11  in earnings projected by the Zacks Consensus model  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at  2 18 compared with  2 45 reported in fourth quarter 2016 Even though the company remains focused on improving gross margins and reducing cost structure in Canada  the segment continues to be challenged due to higher expenses  Further  given that oil and gas and energy exposure in Canada is very high  the segment remains affected by fluctuation oil and gas prices  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates  net sales in the Canada segment will rise 6  to around  191 million in the fourth quarter  However  due to the abovementioned reasons  the segment will likely report an adjusted operating loss of  11 4 million  wider than the operating loss of  10 7 million in fourth quarter 2016 Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  net sales in the Unites States will increase 2  year over year to  1 935 million  The segment will report 12  drop in adjusted operating income to  263 million due to higher expenses Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Deere   Company   NYSE DE    with an Earnings ESP of  5 64  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Briggs   Stratton Corporation   NYSE BGG   with an Earnings ESP of  5 64  and a Zacks Rank  1 Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT    with an Earnings ESP of  8 62  and a Zacks Rank  2 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research  It s not the one you think ",2018-01-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/grainger-gww-to-report-q4-earnings-whats-in-store-200281759,200281759

capped  In fact  more uncertainty is lurking as Trump is set to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore  Amid such ambiguity  investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent  as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility No Breakthrough at G7 SummitTrump s stinging attack on Canada jeopardized the G7 s efforts to maintain free and fair trade relationships  He

26417,247932,GWW,A Global Investor s Equities Playbook for Rising Bond Yields,news," Bloomberg     How can stock investors profit from the increasingly striking movements in global bond yields 
It s the question brought into focus by last week s equity market rout  partly sparked by the recent sharp move upward in U S  government bond yields  and reiterated Wednesday after U S  consumer prices data pushed them higher again  As equity traders around the globe wake up to the prospect of higher inflation and interest rates    and adjust to a higher yield range    many are seeking the best trades to capitalize on movements in the bond market 
 We have clearly seen a shift in expectations on monetary policy and global rates over recent months   said Mahmood Noorani  the founder of Quant Insight  whose past experience includes roles at BlueCrest Capital Management and  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN    The challenge for equity investors is to identify stocks that are sensitive to these macro shifts  
Advice is starting to trickle in  What follows represents the views of strategists and analysts on which specific companies and sectors stand to benefit    or lose out    in an environment where moves in bond yields are becoming more important for the direction of stocks

RBC
Strategists at RBC Capital Markets note that since the financial crisis  value stocks have outperformed when the 10 year yield is on the rise  while growth has won when yields are falling  That relationship has broken down in recent months  but may return  according to RBC s Lori Calvasina  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Co  and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   are among banks predicting a rebound in the value style 
Energy  materials and financials shares are positively correlated with 10 year yields and inflation expectations  suggesting they should lead in a rising rate environment  RBC says 
HSBC
While equity traders are scrambling to find ways of benefiting from rising yields  HSBC strategists are looking to do the opposite  The bank is recommending that European investors consider buying equities poised to benefit from falling bond yields  based on its view that the 10 year U S  Treasury yield will peak around the end of the first quarter and weaken to 2 3 percent by year end 
Sectors that stand to gain from falling yields are growth shares such as luxury goods and ones with higher dividend yields like utilities and energy  HSBC has an overweight position on those in Europe  while it s been cutting its position in financials  where it still holds a modest overweight  but says the yields environment will be a headwind 
UBS
U K  grocer  Tesco   LON TSCO  Plc is among UBS s top single stock picks  as it s relatively low beta and has historically demonstrated limited exposure to 10 year U S  Treasury yields  the bank s strategists wrote in a note  Overall  UBS s wealth management unit does not believe yields will rise to levels that will prevent equities moving higher in the next six months ",2018-02-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/a-global-investors-equities-playbook-for-rising-bond-yields-1250645,1250645

The flight to safety trade continued on Wall Street  as investors mulled over geopolitical tensions in North Korea  Syria and Russia while UK Prime Minister Theresa May surprised the markets  after she announced her decision to call an early election 
Although UK opinion polls suggested PM Theresa May would significantly increase her parliamentary majority of 17 during the election  the decision to call a snap election  after she said that the next general election would be held as scheduled in 2020  represents an element of risk 
Meanwhile corporate earnings failed to offset the flight to safety trade  as shares of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  sank more than 5   after the investment bank reported first quarter earnings that missed on the top and bottom lines 
Goldman Sachs posted earnings per share  EPS  of  5 15 on  8 026 billion of revenue against analysts  expectations of EPS of  5 31 on  8 446 billion of revenue  This was the first time in 15 months that Goldman failed to beat earnings expectations

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGreetings  welcome to the W W  Grainger Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions I will now turn the conference over to our host  Irene Holman  Vice President  Investor Relations  Thank you  You may begin Irene Holman    Vice President  Investor RelationsGood morning  Welcome to Grainger s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call  With me are D G  Macpherson  Chairman and CEO  and Tom Okray  SVP and CFO As a reminder  some of our comments today may be forward looking  Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties  including those detailed in our SEC filings  Reconciliations of any non GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q4 press release  both of which are available on our IR website This morning s call will focus on adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019  which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings press release  Now  I ll turn it over to D G D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Irene  Good morning  Thank you for joining us  On today s call  I ll talk about our 2019 performance and key accomplishments and discuss our growth priorities for 2020  Tom  will then cover our financial performance for the quarter and the year in detail  as well as our 2020 guidance Late last year  we introduced our team members to the Grainger Edge  our new strategic framework that defines who we are  why we exist and how we ll work together to achieve our objectives  At Grainger  our purpose is to keep the world working  whether that means helping a hospital focus on patient care  a manufacturing plant focus on building great product  or a school focus on teaching  the work we do in the background helps keep facilities running  so our customers can focus on what they do best  It s a purpose that we are all very proud of as an organization  The framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors we expect from our team members working with each other  our customers and our supplier partners  We are holding ourselves accountable to these principles and believe they will help us execute our strategy and create value for our shareholders  These are not just words on a page  We are committed to making these principles come to life in everything that we do The Grainger Edge provides a foundational framework for our strategies we work to consistently serve our customers and gain share  We gain share through two distinct business models that allow us to leverage our scale and supply chain to support customers with different needs  Our high touch solution model serves customers that have complex needs and are looking for more tailored solutions  Through this model  we develop powerful customer solutions  deliver a great customer experience and develop deep customer relationships  This all starts with what we call advantaged MRO solutions  That means being able to get a customer the exact product they need to solve a problem quickly  and it means understanding more about our products and customers than anyone in order to help them solve problems and to create value for our customers  This takes the form of intuitive digital solutions  segment specific solutions and value added services  We then leverage these solutions to our talented sales and services teams to build deep customer relationships  based on an exceptional customer experience  Our Grainger US  Canada and Mexico operations  as well as our Cromwell and Fabory businesses fit within this model In our endless assortment model  we provide less complex customers with an expansive product assortment and easy to use website  This business is based on acquiring customers  leveraging our simple and efficient customer experience  to develop and maintain strong customer relationships  Our MonotaRO and Zoro businesses fit within this model  When we execute against these two models  we consistently gain share  we grow profitably and we deliver strong shareholder value  That s our commitment Flipping to Slide 5  and before I jump into 2019 highlights  I wanted to touch briefly on what we have done over the last few years to strengthen the business and to position Grainger for success  This work has ensured that both our high touch solution model and our endless assortment model had the capabilities to win in the marketplace  Most of you are familiar with the pricing reset of our US business back in 2017  This change has allowed us to grow with customer groups we ve been losing share with for years  most notably midsize customers  But beyond the pricing actions  we have made important moves  We have verticalized our sales force  Our customers today demand more expertise from our interactions  and this change enables our sales teams to develop domain knowledge and deepen customer relationships  We have added an inside sales group focused on high value midsize customers  We have centralized our call centers to improve service and scale and help manage cost  We have restructured our KeepStock inventory management program  and we now have begun expanding capabilities for our customers  We have added capacity to our US supply chain  We have made significant improvements to grainger com to make search easier for our customers  And we ve done all this while realizing significant leverage on our cost structure  These changes let us set the stage for what we accomplished in 2019 and will accomplish moving forward Outside of the U S  business  we have reset the foundation for our Canadian operations for what we believe will become a consistently profitable and growing business  We have shed non core international businesses over the last few years and are now focusing our efforts on places where we can create a meaningful  profitable and competitively advantaged position  Our attention and focus moving forward will be on our high touch solutions model  primarily in North America  as well as our growing endless assortment model  We continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure our time  energy and investment is spent where we can add the most value for the long term  Our execution on these efforts over the last few years have laid a strong foundation for profitable growth for the new decade Moving to Slide 6  as you ve heard from our competitors  suppliers and customers  our market was certainly challenging in 2019 with market growth declining as the year progressed  In the phase of these challenges  the Grainger team delivered solid results for the year  mainly in line with the expectations we outlined back in January 2019  To be clear  we aren t thrilled with the absolute performance in the year  but it was solid on a comparable basis  For the total Company  we drove 3  daily sales growth across the Company on a constant currency basis  From a profitability perspective  we expanded total Company operating margin by 10 basis points in 2019  driven by continued success in leveraging our SG A  The team did a nice job managing spend in 2019  and we achieved our goal to minimize SG A growth to less than half the rate of our sales growth  We expect to continue driving leverage as we prudently managed costs  while also growing the business  We generated over  1 billion of cash in 2019 and returned roughly the same amount to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends While the absolute numbers were decent  in many ways  2019 was a strong year on the execution front that  we believe  sets us up well going forward  In the US  we outgrew the MRO market by 150 basis points to 200 basis points in 2019  and our outperformance to the market gained momentum throughout the year  We exited the fourth quarter growing about 300 basis points faster than the market  This performance is driven by our ongoing investments in growth initiatives which support our strategy  We remerchandised  1 2 billion of products in 2019  more than double any time in our history  and we are on track to complete another  1 6 billion in 2020  These category reviews  along with marketing activities  are driving incremental revenue  We ve been testing new strategies and are happy with the results thus far Return on ad spend steadily increased over the course of the year  We saw nice improvements in the focus of our sales and services team  particularly around embedding Grainger at our customers through KeepStock and value added services  We reenergized our large corporate account efforts and won some significant contracts in the second half  Our high touch offer is unmatched in the market  We believe we will continue to gain share with these important strategic customers In our endless assortment model  we grew revenue 19  in 2019  driven by strong growth at both MonotaRO and Zoro  We invested to enhance our Zoro offering in 2019  including the addition of roughly 1 5 million SKUs to the assortment  pushing the total SKU count to about 3 5 million products  We made significant enhancements to Zoro s technology capabilities  including the launch of a new product information system and a customer analytics platform  allowing Zoro to be less reliant on Grainger s infrastructure  We also improved our marketing capabilities in Zoro  which should help us gain share profitably moving forward In our Grainger Canada business  we saw revenue stabilize and customer feedback improve significantly throughout 2019  We expect to return to growth in the business in the back half of 2020 and are confident the platform we have in Canada will prove to be sustainable and profitable in the future  Even when our results were poor  we made progress Specifically  our Cromwell business in the UK had a very challenging financial year  For context  adjusted total Company operating margin in 2019 would have been 12 7  without Cromwell  or a 60 basis point improvement  Further  we took a non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to write off substantially all of the intangible assets  including trade names and customer list  That said  the business made great strides in service  and our customers are now talking about growing with Cromwell moving forward  We also took action in the fourth quarter to take GBP10 million of administration costs out of the business  This team has great clarity and understands the urgency required to improve the performance of the business going forward So  while 2019 was certainly challenging  we are proud of the work we completed to position us for success moving forward Turning to 2020  we plan to continue investing to support our strategy  Our expectation is that we will consistently outgrow the market  including a target of 300 basis points to 400 basis points of outperformance in our core high touch business in the US  Historically  we ve grown approximately 150 basis points faster than the market  Our actions and investments over the last several years provide confidence that we can grow at a more accelerated rate  In 2020  we are focused on several initiatives to support that growth We will continue to work    the work we began in 2019 to remerchandise our assortment to ensure we have the right products to serve the needs of our customers  For 2020  this includes remerchandising  1 6 billion of product  including selective SKU additions to enhance our assortment  We expect to continue to learn and improve upon the way we execute our marketing activities  We learned a lot over the last couple of years  including analytics focused evaluations around our investments in search and display  radio  catalog and direct marketing  We expect improved share gain from both incremental marketing investments and from more effective marketing in 2020  We remain focused on bolstering our expertise in digital and technology solutions in order to serve a more sophisticated and tech enabled customer base  We recently went live with the first version of our new product information system and have made great improvements with our customer information  Both support our merchandising and marketing efforts We will invest to enhance our customer experience and strengthen our world class customer service backbone through network capacity and utilization investments  With our Louisville DC coming online soon  we are at a point where focused investments in DC capacity will add  Phonetic  significant service benefits without as much capital outlays we ve seen in the recent past  We re also planning to selectively add sellers to be more relevant in certain segments and geographies  And we will equip our sales organization with the right tool set to ensure they can serve our customers most effectively  We have developed improved processes with large multi site customers and continue to be aggressive in helping these customers consolidate with Grainger  We will continue to embed our solutions with our more complex customers through our inventory management offerings Finally  we remain committed to the ongoing turnaround efforts in Canada and with our Cromwell business in the UK  In Canada  the business was slightly profitable in 2019  And as Tom will explain  we expect to roughly break even again in 2020  This business is now structured to run as an extension of our core US operations  This will help us make the needed strides to return the business to meaningful profitability over the course of the next couple of years by demonstrating a consistent uptick in revenue and margins  For Cromwell  I mentioned our struggles in 2019  This is a business that is at a crossroads right now  We need to start seeing progress over the next 12 to 18 months to assess whether the business can run profitably  We ve made great improvements in service  which are expected to translate into revenue and profitability  Our team will be evaluating this closely in 2020  Successful execution of these initiatives will position us to consistently and profitably outperform the market in 2020 and beyond Now  let s talk about our endless assortment business  First and foremost  we are pleased to have announced earlier this morning that Masaya Suzuki  the current CEO of MonotaRO  will now lead the combined endless assortment business across Grainger  I am personally very excited about this  Masaya was part of the founding team at MonotaRO and has been instrumental in the tremendously profitable growth of this business since we first launched 20 years ago  He has also played a critical role in the launch of Zoro in 2011  Under Masaya s leadership  we expect to continue the strong growth and profitability of our endless assortment businesses In the US  we plan to accelerate Zoro s adoption of the MonotaRO playbook in order to capture growth and implement best practices  Specifically  we plan to continue to rapidly expand Zoro s assortment beyond the  130 billion industrial MRO market  This will allow us to tap into markets and customers that aren t served through other Grainger channels  Our goal is to have 10 million SKUs in the Zoro portfolio in the next three to five years  utilizing third party suppliers with direct fulfillment capabilities  This has worked well for MonotaRO  which has 20 million SKUs  and we are confident it will work for Zoro as well  We re also continuing to develop and improve our marketing and customer segmentation tools at Zoro  We made most of these investments in 2019 and expect to start to see the results here in 2020 For Zoro UK  we will continue to leverage the Cromwell supply chain and execute our strategy to grow the business and drive profitability  These efforts include expanding assortments  enhancing website functionality and launching effective marketing and customer acquisition campaigns to create a vibrant marketplace  The Zoro UK business continues to grow very quickly  and the economics of this business look to be quite attractive  We expect this business to be profitable in 2021 And for MonotaRO  Masaya and his team will continue to execute their successful growth strategy  including additions to the assortment and network enhancements to improve reliability and speed  This business has produced impressive and profitable growth year in and year out  and we expect that to continue  Our endless assortment business has been a great asset for Grainger and we see the opportunity for tremendous growth moving forward With that  I ll turn it over to Tom for detail on our 2019 performance and 2020 guidance Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks D G  I ll start with a recap of our 2019 total Company adjusted results  then move forward to the fourth quarter results by segment  Overall  we are pleased with our 2019 performance  despite a challenging environment  Sales were up 3  on a constant currency basis  driven by 2 5  from volume and price favorability of 0 5   FX had a negative 0 5  impact  It should be noted that our core US and endless assortment business combined grew at 5  in the full year Consistent with our guide  our gross profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior year  The decline was primarily driven by our lower margin endless assortment business  which is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the Company  Contributing to the decline  both MonotaRO and Zoro had lower gross margin  MonotaRO faced freight headwinds in Japan  and Zoro s lower gross margin was driven by unfavorable product mix and promotional activities  Elsewhere  slightly lower gross profit margins in the US were offset by higher gross margins in Canada  driven by supply chain favorability Despite meaningful investments in advertising  technology and Zoro  we drove SG A leverage  driven by continued cost management actions  SG A as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points year over year as our SG A spend remained flat to 2018  As a result  total Company operating margin for the year increased 10 basis points  with a 20 basis point improvement in the US  Incremental margin for the total Company was 17   aided by 22  US incremental margin We generated operating cash flow of over  1 billion  which we used to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders  returning north of  1 billion through dividends and share repurchases  We did this while maintaining a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1 4 times  Operating cash flow was 116  of net earnings  Our return on invested capital was 29 3   or 80 basis points favorable to the prior year  All in  considering the choppy market  we are pleased with the results Looking at the quarter  daily sales increased 3   including 3 5  from volume  partially offset by 0 5  unfavorable price  Gross profit margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points due to business unit mix  as well as mix shift headwinds within our large customer group in the US  These impacts were partially offset by favorable supply chain improvements in Canada SG A cost increased 3  but slightly less than sales growth  driven by marketing and technology spend in the US segment and investments to support Zoro s growth  We could have dialed back spend in the quarter to achieve a better short term profitability outcome  but we are focused on driving sustainable value over the long term  and continued investment in the business supports this effort  Operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as SG A leverage was more than offset by the decline in gross profit margin versus the prior year  Earnings per share decreased 2  in the quarter due to a higher tax rate  as we lap the prior year benefit from our clean energy investments Looking at our performance in the US  I ll start with sales for our large and midsize customers  The US MRO market  in line with macroeconomic indicators  declined throughout the year  We estimate that the US MRO market was flat to down 1  in the fourth quarter and was up 0 5  to 1  for the full year  In the fourth quarter  our US large customer business grew 3   or 350 basis points faster than the market  Outperformance to the market for our large customers accelerated sequentially as our growth initiatives began to take hold  Our US midsize customer business grew 5   or approximately 550 basis points faster than the market  It s important to note that our growth with these two customer groups remained stable despite slower market conditions in the quarter  Overall  US segment daily sales grew 2 5  in the quarter  or about 300 basis points faster than the market  Sales growth in the quarter included 3  from volume  partially offset by unfavorable price of 1   Inter Company sales provided a 0 5  positive impact in the quarter As noted in our last call  balancing market based pricing with cost inflation and share gain led to a choppy result    choppy price result throughout the year  Having said that  we finished the full year with favorable price of 0 5   While gross profit margin was up 50 basis points sequentially  we were down 100 basis points year over year  driven by a few factors  including the growth of inter Company sales and lower margins  the lapping of prior year supplier rebates  and a mix shift within our large customer subgroup  We ve gotten more aggressive in helping large multi site customers consolidate spend with Grainger  This includes pursuing new customers  where we won a few significant contracts in the second half of 2019  as well as deepening and broadening relationships with our current customers  This large customer growth can create a drag on gross margins in the short to medium term  while we demonstrate our value proposition and expand share of wallet with these customers  However  this is absolutely the right strategy to drive long term profitable growth  As we add and expand customer relationships  we are gaining share and more deeply embedding Grainger into what our customers do each and every day Given the lumpiness of our pricing actions in 2019  we think looking at gross margin on the full year is more meaningful  In this regard  our full year margins were down 30 basis points  reflecting the remaining impact of contract renegotiations and large customer mix headwinds  Ultimately  we remain confident in our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases SG A costs were flat on 2  sales growth  and was favorable 60 basis points to the prior year  Operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as the decline in gross profit margin was only partially offset by strong SG A leverage  Looking at op margin for the full year  the US segment operating margin was 15 8   which is in line with the guidance we set in January of last year  and represents an expansion of 20 basis points Moving on to other businesses  daily sales increased 9 5   including 7 5  from volume and 2  from favorable FX  Growth was driven by continued expansion of our endless assortment business  which is up a combined 18  between Zoro and MonotaRO  Gross profit margin declined 10 basis points in the quarter  driven by negative mix resulting from faster growth in endless assortment  Operating margin declined 140 basis points  driven primarily by investments in Zoro and performance at Cromwell  Cromwell generated an operating loss of  35 million for the full year  Further  while not reflected in our adjusted results  we took an impairment charge in the quarter to write off substantially all of the remaining intangible assets in our Cromwell business Turning to Slide 16  daily sales decreased 11 5   including 10  related to volume decline and 1 5  related to unfavorable price  Price was driven by discounts and mix as we began to win back large customer business  As we finished the year  daily sales stabilized and we are beginning to see volume growth from new and existing customers  Gross profit margin increased 595 basis points over the prior year  primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies  While a sizable portion of this benefit is non recurring  we expect some benefit will continue moving forward  SG A dollars were 10  lower than prior year  but the rate was unfavorable 50 basis points due to volume  Operating margin increased 545 basis points over the prior year  driven by the increase in gross margin Now  let s take a look at 2020 guidance  Consistent with last year  we will provide guidance at the beginning of the year and only plan to make updates if we expect results to fall materially outside the guided range  With that  we expect to deliver another year of solid growth for the Company in 2020  as we execute upon our growth priorities and continue to support our customers  For the total Company  we expect top line growth of 3 5  to 6 5   driven by outperformance to the market in the US and continued expansion of our endless assortment business In the US  we expect the MRO market will remain consistent with where we exited 2019  hovering around flat to slightly negative  Even with this static market  we remain confident that our industry know how  deep customer relationships and scale  coupled with our growth priorities  position us to continue to capture share  For 2020  we expect to outgrow the broader MRO market by approximately 300 basis points  This is a step toward our stated long term target to consistently achieve 300 basis points to 400 basis points of outgrowth each and every year  We expect to continue growing our endless assortment business at around 20  in 2020  as the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add SKUs and leverage our 2019 investments at Zoro From a profitability perspective  total Company gross profit margin is expected to be down roughly 110 basis points to 50 basis points in 2020  This is driven by business unit mix with the higher growth of our lower margin endless assortment business  as well as mixed headwinds within our US large multi site customer subgroup as we focus on consolidating MRO spend for large corporate customers  As it relates to price  our intention is to remain market competitive  while growing share and offsetting cost inflation  Having said that  price is difficult to predict  given the muted and uncertain economic environment  We will stay nimble  As it relates to tariffs  our guidance assumes a status quo environment  Any changes will be evaluated if and when they occur Total Company operating margins are expected to remain consistent at the midpoint  as we anticipate significant SG A leverage as we grow the top line  while remaining prudent on cost  These top line and profitability targets  as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program  are expected to produce earnings per share of  17 75 to  19 25  or 3  to 11  growth From a quarterly timing perspective  we do anticipate that both top and bottom line performance will improve in the back half of the year as our growth priorities take hold and we lap tougher comps at the GP level in the first half  Recall that we increased prices in Q1 2019  which were subsequently dialed back in the second and third quarters  In addition  the full impact of tariff cost increases were not realized until later in 2019 Continuing with guidance on Slide 20  at a segment level  we expect operating profit margins in each of our business units to remain relatively stable  In the US  operating margin is expected to be between 15 6  to 16  with the midpoint in line with 2019 performance  As discussed  gross profit margins in the US are facing headwinds  primarily related to our pursuit of large customer contracts to help grow share and deepen relationships in this choppy market environment  We expect these GP headwinds will be offset by continued SG A leverage For other businesses  we expect 4  to 6  operating margin  After a year of significant investments in our endless assortment model and lower than expected results at Cromwell  we expect our actions in 2019 to produce improved 2020 results  As we have discussed throughout 2019  we expect operating margin at Zoro will trend favorably in 2020 and return to mid single digit profitability by 2021 In Canada  we expect to roughly break even again in 2020  as revenue growth builds sequentially in response to our improved service level and profitability begins to reflect our cost base reset  As noted earlier  we will lap some non recurring supply chain efficiencies in the fourth quarter  which will be a headwind to operating margins in the new year From a cash flow perspective  we expect operating cash flow to be between  1 1 billion and  1 2 billion  We plan capital expenditures of about  250 million  The large majority of investment this year will center around our US segment and endless assortment business in order to continue our growth in these areas  We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and continue executing against our share repurchase authorization  For 2020  we are expecting between  600 million to  700 million of repurchases  which continues to reflect our confidence to successfully execute our strategy and growth priorities With that  I will turn it back to D G  for closing remarks D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Tom  As I look forward to 2020 and beyond  I m excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us  and I want to thank the Grainger team for their hard work and dedication  We are well positioned to continue to gain share in the US  to continue to drive 20  growth profitably in the endless assortment model and to improve the rest of our portfolio  I m confident in our ability to drive long term value for all stakeholders  and I m confident that we re going to continue to extend our lead in the industry So with that  I will open it up for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair  Please state your question Ryan Merkel    William Blair   Company  LLC    AnalystHey  thanks  So first off  I m a little surprised by the 2020 gross margin guide  down about 80 basis points at the midpoint  I have thought that after the price reset  you were thinking that gross margins would start to stabilize  So I m trying to figure out for 2020  is the big change the focus on the large account  Or what s really changing Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  Ryan  there s really two things happening  One  it s just the algebra  Phonetic  of our endless assortment business unit getting much larger and growing at 20  and the gross profit profile that that business has  So that s a very big portion of it  which is getting bigger  obviously  And then one of our key growth initiatives is going after the large customers  And maybe just to unpack that with a little example  right now  we ve been heavily focused on a location by location basis  As we ve stated  as part of our growth initiatives  we re working more with the C suite to try to get a broader range of locations in terms of going after a bigger piece of the Company s pie  And with that  initially  you ll have to do some sort of writedown usually to gross margin  as it relates to product mix  as it relates to your offer  But then over time  there s plenty of levers to increase that gross margin  whether it d be with product substitution  standardization  reducing overall buy  So we re confident over time that we will improve the gross margin with those customers  But for 2020  we re being prudent in putting that in the guide Ryan Merkel    William Blair   Company  LLC    AnalystOkay  It makes sense  I guess for my follow up  sort of related  I m thinking about the long term growth algorithm  And so maybe you can help us    should we be assuming that gross margins are down sort of 50 basis points  60 basis points structurally because of this mix  but then you offset that with SG A  So should we think about EBIT growth equaling sales growth  And then  if you do better than mid single digits  you probably do EBIT growth a little bit better  is that about right D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Ryan  I guess    this is D G  So  in the US business  let s start there  our assumption is that we gain share 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the markets  So if the market grows 2  through recycle  we d be at 5  to 6   At that    so what you see this coming year is a projection of market down 0 5   At that  you see operating margins flat for the US business year over year  so 2 5  growth  flat operating margins  At 5  through cycle  we d expect to get a little more leverage than the slight pressure on GP over time and see some expanding margins in the US  So  I think it s a good    this is a good sort of guide on the economics of the business  At 2   2 5   3   you re probably flat on operating margin in the US  If you get more growth  then you re probably positive OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird  Please state your question David Manthey    Robert W  Baird    AnalystHi  good morning  everyone  First question  when I look at Slide 5  you clearly made many meaningful upgrades here  And I m trying to figure out  how many of these were defensive versus offensive in nature  And essentially  how will we measure the success of all of these changes over the next three to five years  It looks like maybe a little bit of sales outgrowth  But are there other metrics you ll be tracking to see the success of these initiatives D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think  these are    to be clear  these initiatives  on the left hand side  in the US are mostly rearview mirror initiatives in the sense that centralizing the call centers has gotten us improve service and lower costs  and we expect to continue to get lower cost  So that s one that you ll see in the SG A line  If I looked at our order to cash process and customer feedback in the US right now  it is at an all time high  It got better this year significantly relative to the competition  So some of these moves have been around continue to improve service  and you see that in supply chain capacity  Verticalizing the sales force  we think you re going to see in terms of part  Phonetic  contributing to that 300 basis points to 400 basis point growth faster than the market  And so it s a mix  A lot of these are    have been done already When we go forward  we re going to start talking about some of the initiatives that are on Page 7  remerchandising the assortment  I mentioned we remerchandised  1 2 billion this last year  That s far more than we ve ever done in a single year  We ll do  1 6 billion this year  We see that directly leading to sales growth  and we measure that very tightly  Marketing    both effectiveness of marketing and increased marketing budget  we measure that very  very tightly  We know how much that contributes to growth  The large customer initiatives that Tom talked about  we know how much that s leading to growth and what impact that has  So we are tracking everything  We wanted to put Page 5 together to say there s been a lot of change in the business and we feel like we re in a good position to really drive the growth initiatives we re talking about David Manthey    Robert W  Baird    AnalystOkay  Yeah  that makes sense  As a follow up  then    and you partially answered this in your answer to the last question  Over the last couple of years  you ve clearly grown SG A at a rate slower than sales growth or even gross profit dollar growth  and your guidance seems to imply more of the same  in line with your targets  As a distributor  there is obviously inherent inflation in some of the areas of your cost stack  Can you talk about the other major areas of expenses that you re keeping flat or reducing in order to keep SG A in check so well in this lackluster environment  I m just looking for the big two or three buckets that you think are really the drivers of that performance D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So if you look at the cost structure  and I ll focus on the US gain  there s    there are some big buckets of cost  where our expectation is that we will get productivity on a consistent basis  So  in our distribution centers  we continue to automate  we continue to get process improvements to drive dollars  cost per line down  In our contact centers  we continue to get productivity  We continue to productivity in sales force through revenue per seller increases  Our expectation is that the cost increases that you talk about will be covered by productivity in those areas  and we basically have developed a process and an expectation and a philosophy that we will continue to drive productivity in each of those areas  mostly through continuous improvement  that basically offset those cost increases David Manthey    Robert W  Baird    AnalystAll right  Appreciate it  Thanks D G D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Dave OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets  Please state your question Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  I just upfront want to say I appreciate your level of clarity and context in describing some of the changes here on gross margin  That s really helpful  And just to clarify  in Tom s answer  when you talk about the mix shift to large customers that you ll sacrifice  over the short and medium term  the gross margin  But once you build share with these customers  longer term  you re better positioned for profitable growth  What s the time frame on this  I know you say longer term  but are we talking multiple years  I don t think you mean it takes that long because if you re moving to standardization    OK  so just share with us more of the timing of this because it does make sense  I just    the short term  long term seems a little vague Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  First of all  you ve got to remember that we ve got a ton of customers  So this initiative is in various stages of development by individual customers  So it s not like you snap the chalk line and you start everything at one time  So  when we re talking about short to medium term  we re certainly talking about    lot of it will happen within 2021 time frame  It s really building the trust  embedding with the different large customers  so we can rich  Phonetic  in mix  so we can have products to substitution  so we can have standardization  those types of things  So  I guess  we would look at this as a transition year from 2020 for this initiative D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Deane  I guess I would add that when we look at large customers  we track what we call economic earnings  which is a more sort of holistic view of the profitability of customers  And our goal is to make sure that we drive growth and profitable growth through that metric as opposed to just gross profit  So at times  we will take gross profit hit in the short term if we re improving the cost structure elsewhere to provide the ability to consolidate customers and provide value for those customers Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think another thing  important part to note is  these are really large multi site customers  So this is really hitting home runs versus hitting singles and doubles  So this is a very attractive business to get  And just launching off of D G  s comments  we can lever our SG A at about 2 5  growth  so we can afford to take the time to develop these very important customers Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  And then just on a follow up  could you put this negative price in context  Because what we re hearing elsewhere in the industrial distributors is that not only are there    some of it is delays in getting supplier price increases through  but there is heightened competition within the distributors  How much of that is at play in the negative price that we re seeing Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think the important thing when you talk about price is to look at it on a full year basis  As we said in our prepared remarks  our pricing was very lumpy  You ll recall from previous calls  we were quite aggressive in Q1 and then we dialed that back in Q2 and Q3  We made a conscious decision not to raise price in the back half of the year as to not be disruptive to our customers  When you look at it on an entire basis of the full year  our price cost was roughly neutral  and we re happy with that OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer  Please state your question Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer   Company    AnalystThanks  good morning  And just kind of following up on Deane s question  is there any defensive component to how are pricing with the large customers  Or is that really all emanating from your tactical execution by customer just for share independent of market dynamics Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI guess  there s always some tactical  but I would say the majority is the latter  Some of it s product mix within a given customer  Some of it s customer specific mix D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI guess  Chris  I think maybe your question underneath the question is  has the competitive environment heightened with large customers  I think it s always been competitive  and we will always be in a situation where we have to be effective in navigating that competitive environment  It doesn t feel like it s changed dramatically  but certainly it s competitive Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer   Company    AnalystOkay  And then also  I think you talked about how it kind of phases in by customer  Did you suggest that this would be a 2021 process  and then you might open up some gross margin headroom after 2021 Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt s difficult enough to predict 2020  to try to predict 2021  Ideally  2021  we would get back to a more    a lesser decline in gross margin on a year over year basis D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say  Chris  that we have a lot of confidence in the value proposition that we have  Our service is exceptional  Our customers want to do business with us  Over time  we think that we should be in a position to get price as much as anybody and to be able to continue to have very strong operating margins with our customers  So we are confident in what we are doing  In the short term  with trade and with the environment  it s been a little bit lumpy  clearly  But we re pretty confident in the long term ability to improve our margin Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer   Company    AnalystYeah  I appreciate the offense component of it  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Patrick Baumann with J P  Morgan  Please state your question Patrick Baumann    J P  Morgan    AnalystWell  thanks  Good morning  D G  Good morning  Tom  Maybe just start off on the midsize versus large customers  Just wondering  into next year    I guess this year  in 2020  if you d expect midsize customers to still outpace large  Or does that flip with some of the share gain initiatives you ve been talking about for large  And then  somewhat related to that  you described US outgrowth in the quarter as 300 basis points  And then you said large was 350 basis points and midsize was 550 basis points  So I m just wondering what dragged down the total segment Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Taking the first part of the question first  yes  definitely  we would expect medium customers to grow faster than large  I guess the way we look at it is  large at about 300 bps faster than the market  midsize about 500 bps faster than the market on the low end  As it relates to the chart that shows large and midsize  there is a service revenue component that is included in the those charts for large and medium  not to get too technical on you  but that is a very important part of our business  That is really embedding with the customer  On the US segment  that is reflected on a net basis  meaning we adjust cost out  So that s the difference between the two numbers  where you re always going to have large and medium be higher than the US segment Patrick Baumann    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  I d like to follow up on that  After    just one more for me  Just if you could talk about the path forward at Cromwell and what s embedded in your other businesses guidance there in terms of losses for 2020  and then on the same topic  for other businesses  the magnitude of Zoro investments made in 2019 and whether you still expect most of that spending to fall off in 2020 D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so let me focus on Zoro and Cromwell  which I think    other than Zoro and Cromwell  we expect continued improvement in the businesses and we see a nice path  Cromwell  we would expect this year to cut the losses roughly in half for this year  That s our expectation  And I would say  there s a couple of things going at Cromwell  One is  certainly  the market has not been great and a portion of it has been related to that  A lot of it has been some service issues we had that we have completely worked through  We are hearing much better things from the marketplace  Our net promoter score has gone from not very good to quite good actually  and the team is pretty excited about what we re doing  We have a new team over there  We re comfortable with the actions that they re taking  Cromwell is interesting  If you remember why we bought Cromwell  it was as a platform for the online business and because we thought it was a good business  Zoro UK is actually doing quite well  and we would expect it to be profitable in 2021  So  really by the end of the year  we should have a view as to whether or not both of those businesses can be successful and profitable  And that s when we ll really sort of evaluate what we think we need to do  As I mentioned in the prepared remarks  we have taken a bunch of cost out of that business  We have seen great service improvement  We have won a few contracts with customers recently that gives us some confidence that things are coming back  But it s still a steep climb to get better The investments in Zoro most    a lot of those investments start to come off this year  We made significant investments in the fourth quarter  some systems investments that had a few glitches  but we are through them  We expect improvement this year and then significant improvement again in 2021 with that business  And as I mentioned  we re excited to have Masaya Suzuki lead that business  He has been through this at the same point with MonotaRO  and really feel like he is going to help that business accelerate performance going forward Patrick Baumann    J P  Morgan    AnalystThanks a lot Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThere is no reason we can t see the margin profile longer term for Zoro will be consistent with MonotaRO OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research Company  Please state your question Adam Uhlman    Cleveland Research Company    AnalystHey guys  good morning  Hey Tom  I guess  could you expand a little bit more about your comments earlier about the cadence of earnings for the year  I m just wondering  the fourth quarter costs for Zoro were higher than expected  Does that carry into the first quarter here as things were ironed out  And then  are there other moving pieces we should keep in mind like the customer show  other investment spending for Louisville  I m just trying to get a sense of should we be bracing for larger earnings declines in the first quarter and into the second and then recover in the second half of the year Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  if you re talking specifically about SG A  I ll go back to D G  s answer on Zoro  2019 was an investment year for Zoro where we spent heavily in SG A related to adding people  technology and advertising  That will be reduced significantly beginning in Q1  So that will be a material impact  The way I would think about SG A is the way we ve talked about it  We plan on growing SG A at half the rate of sales  We ll continue with the productivity that D G  talked about in a previous answer  As it relates to gross profit  we see no difference than our normal seasonality  We expect Q1 to be greater gross margin than Q4 of this year  and then we expect it to decline throughout the year with Q4 being a relative uptick to Q3  Does that get at your question Adam Uhlman    Cleveland Research Company    AnalystYeah  that helps  And then secondly  could you expand a little bit more about what you guys are seeing in the near term from a customer spending and general environment perspective  It looked like most of the end markets    or the sales growth by end market was relatively similar to last quarter  I guess  did anything stand out to you as notable  And then  as we think about the investments that are being made into the sales force and the verticalization efforts from this past year  are there any vertical markets that we should look to see accelerating growth next year as evidence of a paying off on those investments D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Adam  So what I would say is that we are privileged to see a very wide swath of the economy with our customers  We have not seen much change over the last eight months  really  I would say  We continue to see a market that is slow growth but not trailing off and anything worse at this point  And the customer end market results that we ve seen in the last two quarters  our expectation is that they won t be dissimilar to start the year and that they re likely to get a little better as the year goes along  That would be our expectation at this point  not much better  a little bit better as the year goes along  So I don t    we don t see anything all that unusual in our end markets right now  we haven t over the last couple of quarters Adam Uhlman    Cleveland Research Company    AnalystOkay  Thanks OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research  Please state your question Chris Dankert    Longbow Research    AnalystOne question from me  Thanks so much for the update on large customer approach  kind of swinging for the fences on volume there  I guess  if you could give  Phonetic  a brief update on kind of the medium customer strategy  There is still some concern about this being more price competitive piece of the business  Just how are you balancing digital versus high touch and what does the go to market look like in medium customer in 2020 here D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so midsize customers are actually less price sensitive  and we continue to see much higher margins with midsize customers  We re trying to build the growth so that can become a more meaningful portion of portfolio  We continue to see the ability under the Grainger brand to acquire new customers  We continue to see growth with our existing customers through our inside sales team and through fairly simple pricing actions  Our service model really sings to midsize customers  We continue to get very loyal customers in through the funnel  We re digital first in the sense that most of our midsize customer acquisition comes through a digital first touch  And then we do a lot of work to understand who the customer is  what the profile is  and move them through the cycle in some cases to get them to comforts that makes sense for them  That has proven to be fairly successful  And we    as Tom said  we expect to continue to grow faster with midsize customers at higher gross profit than we will with large Chris Dankert    Longbow Research    AnalystGot it  I guess just one sort of follow up on that  the 400 basis points to 500 basis points of above market in medium customer  anything that helps us get our arms around what informs that or why that s kind of sustainable longer term D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think the most obvious is  we lost a lot of that business  If you remember  we were kind of  1 6 billion in that business  went down to 800 something million something  and now we re up over  1 billion again  There is a lot of customers that we continue to reengage  And a lot of our marketing efforts are proving to be very successful with these customers  And once we get customers back and they realize that we are not    that we re reasonably priced  very high service solution  they are coming back and working with Grainger again Chris Dankert    Longbow Research    AnalystYeah  Thanks so much for the color  guys D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett  Please state your question Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystHi  good morning  This is Karen Lau dialing in for John  Thanks for taking the question  So D G   I think in the past two  Phonetic  years  you had mentioned that given    after the price reset  pricing pressure from large accounts has kind of diminished because your prices are more competitive  It sounded like that is maybe changing a little bit into 2020  Obviously  there is the defense versus often components  But the whole thing is now a little reminiscent of what happened before you did the pricing reset  So  my question is  can you compare the customers  behavior today versus and how they were three years ago and then compare your ability to respond to that versus three years ago before the pricing reset D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so I don t think the situation is at all analogous  Back then  we were losing share dramatically with higher margin customers  We are not doing that now  Large customer business  even back then  was very competitive  Most of it was on custom pricing contracts  That is still the same today  The large customer pricing    the advantage we got through the price change was that some of the tail spend was easier to get large customers to sign up for because if they weren t buying this frequently  then our prices then made sense  That is still the case  We have simpler pricing discussions with our customers now  They are still competitive  They were competitive back then  They are still competitive now Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystOkay  Maybe looking at it at sort of a different angle  so midsize obviously has been a focus in the past two years and has been very successful for you guys  I guess  the shift to large accounts and  I guess  de facto  Phonetic   that s kind of de emphasizing midsize account a little bit  Is it just a function of you have been very successful and done what you could do with those accounts  so it s hard to do more to further accelerate the outgrowth in that market  How are you thinking about that D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say  we are not de emphasizing midsize customers at all  We still think they will grow faster than large  We are making sure that we are competitive with our large customers  And that s important  obviously  given the size of that customer group for us  That is a bigger lever on growth at this point  And so we need to make sure that we are growing with both  but we are not emphasizing anything  We still think there s a long runway ahead for midsize customer OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research  Please state your question Robert Barry    Buckingham Research Group    AnalystHey  everyone  Good morning D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Robert Robert Barry    Buckingham Research Group    AnalystGood morning  Good afternoon here from the East Coast  Yeah  just a few follow ups  actually  It looks like price is assumed neutral in the guide  Is that right Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  basically  we re looking at price cost to be relatively neutral  As we said in the prepared remarks  we ve got the three variables that we re trying to balance  share growth  market competitiveness in terms of pricing  as well as passing on inflationary cost  Similar to this year  we re going to balance those three  and we think we will end up somewhere flattish from a price cost perspective Robert Barry    Buckingham Research Group    AnalystGot it  And I think when you first did the price reset  the goal was to narrow what had become a very large premium to market but to still maintained some modest premium to go to market as the premium provider and to price that way  Is that still true  Or it almost sounds like  kind of alluding to the earlier question  that maybe you are getting a little more aggressive  more happy to err actually on the side of under versus over pricing the market D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe still have a premium with our list prices  We will continue to do that  It s a modest premium  and we ll continue to have that  And then  I think the comment earlier was when you re going after large contracts  on a portion of the volume  you can get pretty aggressive  and we ve always done that and we just have to continue to do that Robert Barry    Buckingham Research Group    AnalystGot it Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think you re making too much about price as it relates to large customers versus just a normal business dynamic where you re going from individual locations to a much bigger piece of the total Company  That s just    there s going to be part of    as D G  says that you re going to have a certain part of the offer that s going to be priced aggressively to get your foot in the door Robert Barry    Buckingham Research Group    AnalystGot it  And just lastly  Tom  on the gross margin cadence through the year  I understand  in absolute terms  higher in 1Q and then down through the year  But had you alluded earlier to the year over year decline in gross margin being larger in 1Q and then moderating as the year progressed  Or did I miss to hear that Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  No  you heard it correctly  The front half of the year is definitely going to be a larger year over year decline than the back half  And that just is a lapping consideration where  again  we were heavy on price at the beginning of the year in 2019  The cost didn t kick in until the back half of the year  So  yeah  that s the correct way to model OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies  Please state your question Mario Cortellacci    Jefferies    AnalystHi  this is  Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah  I know you guys already touched on the Zoro business and the roll off of the investments  And just curious  I guess  as margins build in that business  do you think that you ll break out Zoro and MonotaRO as a separate segment  Some could argue that your multiple doesn t really represent that business at all  given where other online marketplace assets trade at D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhat I would say is that with Masaya now running this  we think we have a couple of years of real hard work to make sure that we are performing on a path like the MonotaRO business has been in the US and in the UK  That s our entire attention on  We are fully aware of the question  But right now  we re really focused on making sure we get the business to be as successful as possible Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd as it relates to reportable segments  obviously  will follow all SEC regulations in terms of doing that Mario Cortellacci    Jefferies    AnalystGot you  Okay  And then just one quick follow up  I think your working capital has been a cash flow drag in 2018 and 2019  I just want to know what your assumptions were for 2020 and maybe just a little color on the reason for the headwind  Is it mostly the endless assortment portion Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  You rightly point out that it has been a little bit of a drag in  18 and  19  I would be disappointed if it didn t become more of a tailwind in 2020 Mario Cortellacci    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  Thank you so much Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo  Please state your question Michael McGinn    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThanks  If I could lean in on the Zoro and MonotaRO discussion  as your model continues to shift more toward a reseller base  what does the business look like today in terms of sourcing  And along those lines  what kind of ballpark service fee are you targeting relative to similar BDC e commerce peers  Is it something similar like Alibaba in Europe  around mid single digits  or higher something like Amazon is charging D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSorry  could you    I m not sure I fully understand the question  So let me just tell you what we re doing and maybe that will help you    help me answer it  We are not creating a marketplace a la Alibaba or a la Amazon  We actually will have supplier relationships that we have    some of them direct ship to customers for Zoro  That s what we ve done with MonotaRO  And so the GPs tend to be slightly less there  but not dramatically less when you do that because we don t have big package ship  But it s not like    it s a fee  that s all we re getting  So I think it s a different model than you re describing Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd it s definitely a win win for the suppliers that are drop shipping and certainly for us Michael McGinn    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  Asked a different way  is MonotaRO currently getting a service fee from Zoro  And does that go up over time as the business expands Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  That s a different question  Yes  there is a variable service fee that Zoro does pay to MonotaRO  and it s based on their profitability Michael McGinn    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystSorry  It s based on Zoro s profitability Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes Michael McGinn    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  And what is that currently and what do you expect that to trend to as you build to 10 million SKUs Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I m not going to go into those types of details D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt will get bigger  As they re successful  it will get bigger because it s based on profitability Michael McGinn    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystAll right D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a very small portion OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli   Company  Please state your question Justin Bergner    Gabelli   Company    AnalystGood morning  D G  Good morning  Tom D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Justin Bergner    Gabelli   Company    AnalystTwo quick ones here  Most have been answered  With respect to the Canadian gross margin improvement  is that sustainable  Or was there anything sort of onetime that benefited the fourth quarter Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  As we said in our prepared remarks  some of that was  Indecipherable  related to supply chain efficiencies  I guess  if I were to score it roughly  I d say half of it will continue  half of it will fall off Justin Bergner    Gabelli   Company    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then the retail customer segment improved dramatically in the quarter  I guess  to mid teens growth  Just curious if that s sort of idiosyncratic  Or if there s initiatives there  some underlying backdrop that s favorable D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust to be clear  retail for us typically does not mean retail stores  It means warehouses attached to retail  And as you would guess  that has continued to be a growing business in the US  as more stuff shows up at your door  So that s what s driving that growth  That is a growing segment Justin Bergner    Gabelli   Company    AnalystOkay  Thanks so much D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Thomas B  Okray    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you D G  Macpherson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  thanks  I appreciate everybody being on the call  I would just reiterate  we are really confident in our path  We feel good about share gain and profitability in the US  We feel really good about the online model  excited to have Masaya lead that and drive strong growth and profitability there  And we will get Canada and Cromwell right  But generally  I would say  we re very excited about where we re going  And I appreciate you listening to the call today  Thanks Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  68 minutesCall participants Irene Holman    Vice President  Investor
