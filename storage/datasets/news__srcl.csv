8056,229571,SRCL,Earnings Preview  Stericycle  SRCL  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Stericycle  NASDAQ SRCL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical waste management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 83 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 1  
Revenues are expected to be  843 45 million  down 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 54  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stericycle 
For Stericycle  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stericycle will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Stericycle would post earnings of  0 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 57  delivering a surprise of  34 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Stericycle doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-stericycle-srcl-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200444950,200444950
8065,229580,SRCL,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Stericycle,opinion,Stericycle  Inc    NASDAQ SRCL   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for SRCL broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 0 6  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for SRCL stock If that wasn t enough  SRCL isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come Consider that in the last 30 days  3 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for SRCL  You can see  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert-stericycle-200443724,200443724

What s Next for Stericycle 
While Stericycle has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

With an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 7 7  and a market cap of  4 1 billion  Stericycle seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio for now 

 
Factors That Bode Well
Stericycle is progressing well with its comprehensive multiyear business transformation  aimed at improving long term operational and financial performance  Initiated in 2017  the five key initiatives of the program include portfolio rationalization  operational optimization  organizational excellence and efficiency  commercial excellence and strategic sourcing 
The company s main focus for 2019 is to build  test and train phases of enterprise resource planning  ERP  implementation  It has completed the build phase and is currently in the test phase which will be followed by the train phase  The company expects to witness  850 million to  1 billion of adjusted EBITDA benefits over the tenure of the program 
Stericycle s acquisition pool remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business  thereby helping it increase its market share and expand geographically 
Last Words
Despite riding on significant growth prospects  Stericycle is not free from overhangs  The company s communication and related services have been weak for quite some time due to decline in recall events and lower call volumes in communication solutions  It has a debt laden balance sheet and faces pricing pressure due to high competition  Nevertheless  we believe that the multiyear business transformation initiative and acquisitions bode well in the long term

8081,229596,SRCL,Is Stericycle  SRCL  Stock A Worthy Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Stericycle  Inc    NASDAQ SRCL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Stericycle has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 57  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 21  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Stericycle s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 18 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Business Services Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 7  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Stericycle has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 41  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Stericycle has a P S ratio of 1 27  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Stericycle currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Stericycle a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Stericycle might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D  This gives SRCL a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen one upward and six downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the current year estimates have seen no upward revisions and seven downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate dipped 4 6  over the past two months  while the current year estimate has decreased 5 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Stericycle  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such bearish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineStericycle is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 41  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  despite a satisfactory industry performance  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this

8088,229603,SRCL,Jupiter Green Investment Trust  Growing Opportunity Set Drives Higher Income,opinion,"Jupiter Green Investment Trust  LON JGC  is continuing to benefit from the greater public interest in green issues  which is driving demand growth for companies delivering solutions to environmental challenges  Manager Charlie Thomas and his team run a globally diversified portfolio of c 60 companies  invested across a wide variety of areas  broadly grouped into themes of resource efficiency  demographics and infrastructure  The growing maturity of the investment universe is leading to a larger number of companies paying attractive dividends  enabling JGC to enhance its own dividend policy  with a higher yield  now c 1 3   from c 0 7   and semi annual payouts  As the highest yielding  closed ended  green  equity fund  JGC could see greater demand for its shares  which could help to narrow the currently wider than average discount to NAV 

The market opportunity
In recent years there has been much greater public focus on environmental issues  from the need to reduce plastic waste to how we address climate change via a shift to zero carbon energy sources  This has fed into an expanded investment universe for JGC  as larger companies transition their business models to meet environmental challenges  as well as leading to greater demand for the products and services of companies for which this has always been a core focus  This should underpin future growth in the sector  although investors must remain mindful of valuations 
Why consider investing in Jupiter Green IT 
Enhanced dividend policy makes JGC the highest yielding fund of its type 
Higher demand for sustainable technologies drives underlying company growth 
Strong medium term absolute returns but wider than average discount to NAV 
JGC s small size opens up opportunities in IPOs and smaller companies where larger funds would be unable to make meaningful investments 
Well established team at fund house that pioneered  green  investing in the UK 
Board made up of leading experts in sustainability and sustainable investing 
Higher dividends could help close widening discount
JGC s current 5 8  share price discount to cum income NAV  at 13 March 2019  is wider than the average discounts over one  three and five years  which range from 4 4  to 5 5   The discount widened from a 0 9  premium in October 2018 as JGC s share price fell amid market volatility  and has remained wider than the medium term average as the NAV has outperformed the recovering share price  The introduction of a higher  semi annual dividend may help boost demand for JGC s shares 






Fund profile  Greater income focus for green specialist
Jupiter Green Investment Trust  JGC  was launched in 2006 by Jupiter Asset Management  which pioneered  green  investment in the UK with the launch of the open ended Jupiter Ecology Fund in 1986  JGC was a successor to Jupiter Global Green Investment Trust  itself set up in 2001 as a follow on vehicle for the Jupiter International Green Investment Trust  which began life in 1989  It is managed by Charlie Thomas  head of strategy  environment and sustainability at Jupiter  assisted by other members of the environment and sustainability team  including analyst Jon Wallace 
JGC has a diversified global portfolio of c 60 companies that are providing solutions  often technologically based  to environmental challenges  It has recently amended its investment objective to focus on income as well as capital growth  reflecting the greater maturity of  and therefore dividend payments from  the companies in its investment universe  It has also adopted a new performance benchmark  the FTSE Environmental Technology 100  ET100  index  which its board and managers see as providing a better reference point than the previous MSCI World Small Cap benchmark  which has no specific environmental focus  Prior to 2010  when the MSCI index was adopted   JGC s portfolio was managed in two parts  with US stock picking outsourced to Winslow Asset Management  and the benchmark was a composite of the FTSE Global Small Cap ex US index and the Russell 2000  in proportions equal to the share of the portfolio managed by Jupiter and Winslow  respectively  The trust is a member of the Association of Investment Companies  Sector Specialist  Environmental sector 
Because of its small size  net assets of c  40m   JGC is able to make meaningful investments in smaller companies  including at the initial public offering  IPO  stage   It may also invest up to 5  of its assets at the time of investment in unlisted companies  Gearing is available via a  3m flexible loan  although this has not historically been used   and JGC may also use derivatives and short positions for risk management purposes 
The fund managers  Charlie Thomas and team
The managers  view  Waste and energy remain high on agenda
Thomas says the increased global awareness of the need to respond to environmental challenges is driving investment opportunities in a multitude of areas  giving the team a greater diversity of companies to choose from  He gives the example of Eaton  NYSE ETN   an established US industrial company that has a diversified portfolio but an underlying thematic focus on energy efficiency  through products and services in areas such as metering and power management  Eaton is a reasonably large company  market capitalisation of c  34bn   and typifies the development of JGC s opportunity set  which in turn is feeding into the trust s ability and desire to pay higher dividends  Thomas says that in the past  when the investment universe was lower yielding and less mature  JGC had more of a focus on capital growth   But there have always been companies with a yield  and their yield is becoming more prominent as they mature and have capacity to deliver more income   he adds 
In terms of investment themes  Thomas says waste management  particularly plastic  but also other areas such as food waste  continues to command a lot of attention  The global agenda is quickly accelerating  having previously imported c 60  of G7 countries  plastic waste  China has banned such imports  and other Asian countries such as Thailand and Malaysia are following suit   Countries need to start dealing with their own waste   says Thomas  adding that policies such as China s import ban are significant for the waste sector globally  and the increased focus on recycling is advantageous for holdings in the JGC portfolio  such as  reverse vending machine  maker Tomra Systems  and household and industrial waste management firm Casella Waste Systems  Thomas points out that the EU  including the UK  at least for the present  has ambitions towards the  circular economy   including a target of 90  collection and recycling of plastic bottles by 2030  but that one of the barriers to this is a lack of alignment in waste management  with major divergences in how different municipalities collect  sort and dispose of waste  Both Tomra and Casella offer advanced waste sorting solutions that can help increase recycling rates  which means demand for their services is strong  however  Thomas cautions that investors should be mindful of whether valuations for these companies already reflect the sizeable opportunity 
While the public focus on plastic waste   exemplified by a consumer campaign to post back Walkers  non recyclable crisp packets to the company   can translate into real change  Walkers has said its packaging will be fully recyclable by 2022   Thomas says it is important to understand the context of plastic use  and to focus on better ways of reducing or replacing  as well as recycling it   It is a balance   plastic extends shelf life  so it reduces food waste  and it is a lightweight material  so it cuts the cost and environmental impact of distribution   he argues   You have to think about the long term implications of the shift from plastic to non plastic  
Climate change also remains an important theme  both in environmental and investment terms  Thomas says that the increased take up of renewable energy is driving a need for more investment in the distribution and storage of power from such sources  as well as a focus on energy efficiency to reduce overall power consumption   We are looking at how core technologies interact with each other  such as Siemens  focus on how to deploy sustainably generated power within grids  as well as helping to generate the power through its wind turbine division   he explains 
Looking ahead  key short  to medium term macro issues for the trust include the resolution  or not  of trade tensions between the US and China  and how much the Chinese economy is slowing  While slower economic growth in China is not directly an environmental issue  Thomas points out that it would have a broad impact on the industrial sector  for which automation in China has been a key source of growth   and industrial companies  are the heartland of environmental solutions   However  the manager adds that a more important question is whether factors such as slower growth in China and the impact of trade tariffs are short term issues  or if they disturb the long term opportunity for JGC   We think they do not   in the long term  the right company with the right product or service and the right calibre of management will deliver   he concludes 
Given recent market volatility  the team is not currently considering making its first use of JGC s gearing facility    in this market  it could be quite treacherous   says Thomas  However  the portfolio is effectively fully invested  with a low net cash position of c 1 5  
Asset allocation
Investment process  Seeking sustainable solutions
JGC s management team is part of the wider environmental and sustainability team at Jupiter  which sees its investment universe as comprising three interlinked areas   resource efficiency  infrastructure  and demographics   where environmental and economic issues meet  see Exhibit 2   Within these areas  JGC focuses particularly on companies that are providing lasting solutions to environmental challenges 
The team classifies these companies into two types  transitional and transformational  JGC manager Charlie Thomas illustrates the distinction using the example of the challenge of plastic waste  transitional companies would be those facilitating the increased reuse or recycling of plastics  such as Tomra Systems  with its reverse vending machines   while transformational companies would be those providing environmentally sustainable yet commercially viable alternatives to plastics  allowing plastic use to be reduced or eliminated  As the need for solutions to environmental challenges has become more widely accepted  the JGC team says its global investable universe has expanded to c 1 200 companies  from only c 100 at the trust s launch in 2006 

Meeting c 200 300 companies each year allows the team to monitor developments in the environmental space  they also use financial screens  keep up with technological developments  leverage broker networks and attend industry conferences  to assist them in identifying investable themes and trends  These inputs feed into a list of potential investee companies  all of which must have appropriate balance sheets and cash flows  high quality  experienced management teams  and proven technologies  The JGC team rigorously analyses these companies using a range of financial and valuation metrics  as well as focusing on end market dynamics  sustainability and governance  and political and regulatory risks  The aim is to arrive at a relatively focused list of well run  innovative companies with the ability to generate sustainable profits and return on equity  While yield is not a primary consideration  the managers note that as their investment universe has matured  it has become increasingly possible to find companies generating a reliable dividend stream  which has been an important factor in the JGC board s decision to pay a higher  more regular income to investors 
New positions typically come into the portfolio at less than 1  of NAV  and rarely exceed 5  over the life of the holding  Positions will be increased as the team s investment thesis is validated  and may be sold if valuations look overstretched  or if a change in the outlook for the business or industry area calls the original thesis into question  Portfolio turnover is typically low  at less than 15  a year  implying an average holding period of around seven years 
Current portfolio positioning
At end H119  30 September 2018  the latest date at which the full portfolio listing is available   there were 66 holdings in JGC s portfolio  an increase from 62 at end FY18  31 March   The top 10 stocks at 28 February 2019 made up 28 9  of the total  broadly unchanged on 30 1  a year earlier  although only three of the names were common to the top 10 in both periods  Exhibit 1  

While the US makes up more than half of the global stock market capitalisation  JGC s exposure to the country tends to be lower  as the managers say the investment universe of companies providing environmental solutions is relatively less prevalent there than in other regions  The portfolio weighting in both the US and UK fell in the 12 months to 28 February 2019  Exhibit 3   while some other areas saw increases 
In sector terms  Exhibit 4   there is a natural bias towards industrial companies  a group that includes industrial engineering  electronic and electrical equipment  support services  general industrials  and construction   materials  which together made up 55 9  of the portfolio at 28 February 2019   Recent new purchases in this area include Siemens  which JGC team member Jon Wallace says has entered the trust s investment universe as a result of growth in its environmental division  with energy efficiency solutions and renewable energy now accounting for c 50  of revenues  In terms of broad sustainability themes  including its health and environmental services businesses   the share of revenues rises to around two thirds  Wallace says large corporations such as Siemens  which merged its wind turbine business with Spain s Gamesa in 2016  and  rsted  formerly DONG Energy  itself formerly Danish Oil   Natural Gas  see renewable energy as an area of long term growth  and are angling their business models to capture this opportunity  Also recently added to the portfolio is Knorr Bremse  another German engineering company  which is a world leader in braking systems for rail and trucks  The stock was bought at its IPO in October 2018  since when its share price has risen by c 6  in euro terms 

The trust has recently made investments in several funds that pay attractive yields  including US based NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  Partners  which owns wind and solar power assets and has a 4  yield   Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital  a US real estate investment trust with a c 5  yield  and Ireland focused Greencoat Renewables  However  the managers are keen to stress that they are also seeing good yields from a number of conventional companies  such as ferry operator Fjord1  yielding c 6   and salmon farmer SalMar  c 5    both listed in Norway 
Recent sales include German energy utility Innogy and US food company United Natural Foods  both as a result of planned corporate actions that would have diluted their environmental credentials  The holding in power storage specialist Varta was reduced and waste management firm Augean sold after strong performance meant their valuations had begun to look extended  while JGC exited from US medical waste company Stericycle  NASDAQ SRCL  and UK listed transport operator FirstGroup  which the managers felt both faced structural challenges and offered little or no yield 


Having experienced price and NAV declines in the stock market volatility of the last quarter of 2018  JGC has begun the year positively  buoyed by strong gains at a number of its larger holdings  However  the trust has lagged its blended benchmark  see note to Exhibit 5   partly owing to its relative lack of exposure to the US  which has performed strongly  In the six months to 30 September 2018  stocks including Tomra Systems  Clean Harbors  Xylem  and recent purchases SalMar and Brambles contributed positively to performance  while AO Smith detracted  So far in H219  year ending 31 March   most of the trust s top 10 holdings have seen significant share price gains in local currency terms  particularly since the start of the calendar year  with double digit gains for companies including Johnson Matthey  LON JMAT   Sensata Technologies  Brambles and National Express 
Looking over the longer term  JGC has produced creditable share price and NAV total returns of c 10 11  a year over three and 10 years  although performance over five years has been relatively weaker  with returns of c 5  pa  As shown in Exhibit 6  performance relative to a range of indices has been mixed  with JGC lagging broad based global indices  whose performance has arguably been driven largely by US technology stocks  over periods of one year and longer in sterling terms  but outperforming in recent months 

Discount  Market volatility sees more volatile discount
At 13 March 2019  JGC s shares traded at a 5 8  discount to cum income NAV  This was wider than the average discounts over one  three and five years  4 4   5 5  and 4 4   respectively   but narrower than the 10 year average of 8 0   Having traded in a relatively narrow range between par and a 6  discount from late 2016  discount volatility has picked up in the past six months  in line with the increase in stock market volatility   with the shares trading in a range broadly between a premium of c 1  and a discount of c 10   In line with the board s policy of ensuring the share price and NAV do not materially diverge  the number and magnitude of share buybacks has also increased in recent months 

Capital structure and fees
Structured as a conventional investment trust with one class of share  JGC had 19 1m shares in issue at 13 March 2019  An annual subscription rights opportunity gives investors the option to purchase one new share for each 10 shares held on 31 March each year  at a price equivalent to the undiluted NAV per share at the previous 31 March year end  In 2018  130 998 new shares were issued at 184 33p following the exercise of subscription rights  However  given JGC s share price  at 13 March 2019  is currently c 8  lower than the 191 31p NAV at 31 March 2018  it seems unlikely that this year s subscription opportunity will be taken up by investors  unless the shares rally significantly in the short term  JGC has a premium discount management programme  under which shares may be issued or repurchased to ensure that the share price and NAV do not materially diverge from one another  So far in FY19  1 97m shares have been bought back  9 4  of the total  at a cost of  3 5m   the great majority of them since November 2018  Gearing is permitted up to 25  of net assets  and is available through the trust s  3m revolving credit facility with Scotiabank  equivalent to 8 4  of net assets at 13 March 2019   However  this has not been used to date  and JGC currently has a small  1 5   net cash position 
With effect from 1 June 2018  JGC has reduced the annual management fee it pays to Jupiter  from a flat 0 75  of net assets  to 0 70  of net assets up to  150m  0 60  between  150m and  250m  and 0 50  above  250m  This brings JGC s management fees more into line with those of the open ended Jupiter Ecology Fund  institutional share class   The performance fee structure has also been removed with effect from 1 April 2018  Management fees and financing costs are now charged 75  to capital and 25  to revenue  previously 90  and 10    Ongoing charges were 1 41  at end H119  with the new 0 70  management fee in place for four of the six months   down from 1 48  at end FY18 
Dividend policy and record
JGC has changed its dividend policy with effect from FY19  in light of the growing element of its investment universe that is providing a sustainable stream of dividend income  Previously  dividends were paid in line with the requirement for investment trusts to retain no more than 15  of their net income  Under the new policy  two dividends will be paid each year  with the payout in FY19 anticipated to be roughly twice the 1 3p paid in FY18  The first interim dividend of 1 0p for FY19 was declared at the beginning of March  and was fully covered by the net revenue return per share of 1 28p in H119  Following approval at the 2018 AGM  dividends may now be financed from a combination of current year income and available capital and revenue reserves  although JGC s managers say their intention is that the dividend will be fully covered by income over a market cycle  Based on the current share price and the last 12 months  dividends  including the FY18 and H119 payouts   JGC yields 1 3   which is significantly above the average of its open  and closed ended peers  see Exhibit 9  
Peer group comparison
JGC is a member of the AIC Sector Specialist  Environmental sector  a small peer group of three funds that invest broadly across environmental sectors  Below in Exhibit 9  we also include two open ended funds managed by the Jupiter team  JGC is the smallest of the three closed ended funds  Its one year NAV total returns are below those of the closed ended peers but a little better than its Jupiter stablemates  performance  Over three years JGC ranks second of the three closed end funds and ahead of the open ended funds  with a broadly similar picture over 10 years  over five years its NAV total returns are below the average of both the closed  and open ended funds  JGC s ongoing charges are the second lowest across both groups of funds  with no performance fee  and it has the highest dividend yield  following the change in its dividend policy with effect from FY19  The fund is currently ungeared  JGC s shares trade at a modest discount to NAV  in contrast with its closed ended peers  one of which is trading at a small premium  while the other is at a discount of more than 20  

The board
There are four directors on JGC s board  all non executive and independent of the manager  The number of directors was increased from three  with the appointment in December 2018 of Jaz Bains  group risk and investment director at Renewables Energy Systems  which manages operations for UK listed renewable energy infrastructure fund The Renewables Infrastructure Group  JGC s managers say Bains s skills are highly complementary to their own  and will add expertise on the investment side  The other directors are Michael Naylor  appointed to the board in 2009  and chairman since 2015   whose background is as a private equity investor in sustainable assets  Dame Polly Courtice  appointed at JGC s launch in 2016   a leading academic and director of the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership  CISL   and Simon Baker  appointed in 2015   former head of Jupiter s green investment department from 2002 to 2006 ",2019-03-15,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jupiter-green-investment-trust-growing-opportunity-set-drives-higher-income-200397994,200397994

8100,229615,SRCL,U S  hospitals unprepared to handle Ebola waste,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  hospitals may be unprepared to safely dispose of the infectious waste generated by any Ebola virus disease patient to arrive unannounced in the country  potentially putting the wider community at risk  biosafety experts said 
Waste management companies are refusing to haul away the soiled sheets and virus spattered protective gear associated with treating the disease  citing federal guidelines that require Ebola related waste to be handled in special packaging by people with hazardous materials training  infectious disease and biosafety experts told Reuters 
Many U S  hospitals are unaware of the regulatory snafu  which experts say could threaten their ability to treat any person who develops Ebola in the U S  after coming from an infected region  It can take as long as 21 days to develop Ebola symptoms after exposure 
The issue created problems for Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  the first institution to care for Ebola patients here  As Emory was treating two U S  missionaries who were evacuated from West Africa in August  their waste hauler  Stericycle  initially refused to handle it  Stericycle declined comment 
Ebola symptoms can include copious amounts of vomiting and diarrhoea  and nurses and doctors at Emory donned full hazmat suits to protect themselves  Bags of waste quickly began to pile up 
 At its peak  we were up to 40 bags a day of medical waste  which took a huge tax on our waste management system   Emory s Dr  Aneesh Mehta told colleagues at a medical meeting earlier this month 
Emory sent staff to Home Depot to buy as many 32 gallon rubber waste containers with lids that they could get their hands on  Emory kept the waste in a special containment area for six days until its Atlanta neighbor  the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  helped broker an agreement with Stericycle 
While U S  hospitals may be prepared clinically to care for a patient with Ebola  Emory s experience shows that logistically they are far from ready  biosafety experts said 
 Our waste management obstacles and the logistics we had to put in place were amazing   Patricia Olinger  director of environmental health and safety at Emory  said in an interview 
 
NOT IF  BUT WHEN
The worst Ebola outbreak on record is now projected to infect as many as 20 000 people in West Africa by November  while U S  officials have said that number could rise above 550 000 by mid January without an international intervention to contain its spread  Experts say it is only a matter of time before at least some infected patients are diagnosed in U S  hospitals  most likely walking into the emergency department seeking treatment 
Already there have been several scares  As of Sept  8  as many as 10 patients have been tested by U S  hospitals for suspected Ebola cases  Dr  Barbara Knust  team leader for the CDC s Ebola response  said at a medical meeting this month  All tested negative 
The CDC has issued detailed guidelines on how hospitals can care for such patients  but their recommendations for handling Ebola waste differs from the U S  Department of Transportation  which regulates the transportation of infectious waste 
CDC advises hospitals to place Ebola infected items in leak proof containers and discard them as they would other biohazards that fall into the category of  regulated medical waste   According to DOT guidelines  items in this category can t be in a form that can cause human harm  The DOT classifies Ebola as a Category A agent  or one that is potentially life threatening 
DOT regulations say transporting Category A items requires special packaging and hazmat training 
CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency isn t aware of any packaging that is approved for handling Ebola waste 
As a result  conventional waste management contractors believe they can t legally haul Ebola waste  said Thomas Metzger  communication director for the National Waste   Recycling Association trade group 
 
A TEMPORARY FIX
Part of Emory s solution was to bring in one of the university s large capacity sterilizers called an autoclave  which uses pressurized steam to neutralize infectious agents  before handing the waste off to its disposal contractor for incineration 
Few hospitals have the ability to autoclave medical waste from Ebola patients on site 
 For this reason  it would be very difficult for a hospital to agree to care for Ebola cases   this desperately needs a fix   said Dr Jeffrey Duchin  chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America s Public Health Committee 
Dr  Gavin Macgregor Skinner  an expert on public health preparedness at Pennsylvania State University  said there s  no way in the world  that U S  hospitals are ready to treat patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola 
 Where they come undone every time is the management of their liquid and solid waste   said Macgregor Skinner  who recently trained healthcare workers in Nigeria on behalf of the Elizabeth R  Griffin Research Foundation 
Skinner said the CDC is working with DOT to resolve the issue  He said the CDC views its disposal guidelines as appropriate  and that they have been proven to prevent infection in the handling of waste from HIV  hepatitis  and tuberculosis patients 
Joe Delcambre  a spokesman for DOT s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  could not say whether requiring hospitals to first sterilize Ebola waste would resolve the issue for waste haulers  He did confirm that DOT is meeting with CDC 
Metzger said his members are also meeting with officials from the DOT  the CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency to sort out the issue 
Until the matter is resolved  however   We re bound by those regulations   he said

8101,229616,SRCL,Automakers Issued 2 2 Recalls A Day In 2014,news,"By    

Would you continue to drive a car you knew was the subject of a safety related recall  For as many as half of Americans  the answer is yes  The U S  government s auto safety watchdog released final numbers on Thursday showing an average of 2 2 automotive recalls were issued every day in 2014  Problems ranging from incorrect spare tire labels to air bag inflators explode like fragmentation grenades were identified in 63 95 million vehicles in 803 recalls in 2014  an all time high for both the number of recalls and the number of vehicles affected  But between a third and half of all auto recall notice letters are ignored by their recipients  according to John Holloran  vice president of global automotive strategy at Stericycle ExpertSolutions  a firm that helps companies handle product recalls   We find that the principal reason for consumers not acting on a recall notices continues to be that they didn t perceive the issue as important  or it hasn t been convenient for them to get the repairs done   he said  The auto recall response rate varies depending on the age of the car and how much press the problem gets  A 2012 Society of Automotive Engineers report showed that the newer the car  the higher the recall response rate  possibly because owners of older cars are more likely to think older cars are less likely to have safety flaws that originated on the assembly line    This has been a persistent and complicated problem in the industry  Even after a car owner is found  it can take months or even years before a flawed vehicle is fixed  If it changes ownership multiple times and ends up in the used car market  it may never get repaired  This problem led the U S  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year to require new mandatory labeling of recall notices  to give the envelopes the noticed are mailed in a splash of red and official government logos  Realizing that the mail system might not be adequate  NHTSA also released a smartphone app in September that allows users to plug in their vehicle information to automatically receive safety information to their devices  Companies like Stericycle are commissioned to follow up with emails and phone calls  So far the most effective method to get car owners to fix vehicles is to be relentless   The solution is consistent and frequent outreach communications to consumers using multiple methods  in addition to letters  using emails  phone calls   said Holloran   The communication has to be consistent and frequent   Other solutions that have been proffered include  sending letters by FedEx rather than ordinary mail  or making phone calls to car owners  preferably before letters are mailed to them  Part of the problem is that consumers and automakers generally don t differentiate among levels of risk in these flaws  A recall for a mislabeled spare tire that could lead to over inflation is a less risky danger than  say  unintended brake failure that could happen at any time  And some flaws are easily fixed by owners themselves  A floor mat that causes acceleration pedals to stick  as was seen in millions of Toyota vehicles in 2009  is a problems car owners might simply choose to fix themselves  But those problems are treated by automakers the same as significantly more dangerous flaws that require professional treatment  like exploding air bag systems  Michelle Krebs  senior autos analyst at AutoTrader com  says there should be a better system by which car owners can be made aware of levels of risk   There should be some kind of system that helps consumers know how urgent the problem is  like a red light  icon  indicating the problem is serious and needs immediate attention  and a different color if it s something that should be fixed the next time the car is taken in for maintenance   she said   I received a recall notice for a floor mat  Brake and air bag problems are much more urgent   One thing might help car owners to be more proactive on this issue  If you ve received multiple recall notices in the mail  an automaker can use that as a legal defense if you re injured because of a vehicle s flaw  A court can rule that you assumed the risk of a manufacturing flaw by ignoring multiple efforts by a car company to get you into the dealership for necessary repairs ",2015-02-13,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/automakers-issued-2.2-recalls-a-day-in-2014-328043,328043

8109,229624,SRCL,Analysts Estimate Stericycle  SRCL  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Stericycle  NASDAQ SRCL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical waste management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  848 75 million  down 4 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 19  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stericycle 
For Stericycle  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 04  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stericycle will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Stericycle would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of  1 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Stericycle doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-stericycle-srcl-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200390882,200390882

8114,229629,SRCL,6 Health Services Stocks Offering Growth At A Reasonable Price  Part 10 ,opinion,"Introduction
The Health Services Sector is one of the smallest sectors as presented by FactSet as it only contains 137 companies out of more than 19 000 in the US and Canadian universe  Furthermore  since I was also screening for quality based on investment grade S P Credit Ratings of BBB  or better  I was additionally surprised that only 11 companies met that benchmark  Additionally  since I was also screening for valuation  I only found 6 companies with P E ratios below 17  There were a few well known names  Anthem  NYSE ANTM   Humana  NYSE HUM   and United Health Group  that missed the cut because their P E ratios were moderately above 17  that otherwise could have also been featured 
Nevertheless  despite what was stated above  one characteristic that is shared by each of the research candidates on this list  is an above average rate of earnings growth  On the other hand  only 2 out of the 6 pay a dividend which suggests that this sector is most appropriate for investors interested in capital appreciation or growth  This growth orientation is also consistent with the fact that these best of breed companies in this sector have outperformed the S P 500 over the long run despite the lack of dividend income 
Another characteristic that I found common  but not universal  with companies in the Health Services Sector was a penchant for the market providing premium valuations to their shares  However  ironically  these premium valuations were awarded to the non dividend paying research candidates more so than the dividend paying ones  This seemed somewhat counter intuitive to me since I would ve expected dividend paying stocks in this sector to be more popular  On the other hand  the non dividend paying research candidates have tended to experience significantly more severe price drops over recent market history  To me this suggests that their high valuations were more vulnerable when sentiment turned negative 
Regarding the two research candidates that do pay a dividend  I found it interesting that they both outperformed the S P 500 on growth and on total dividend income  These results are clearly a function of above average earnings growth that also translated into above average dividend growth 
A Sector By Sector Review
This is part 10 of a series where I have conducted a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems  Inc In part 1 found here I covered the Consumer Services Sector  In part 2 found here I covered the Communication Sector  In part 3 found here I covered the Consumer Durables Sector and its many diverse subsectors  In part 4 found here I covered Consumer Nondurables  In part 5 found here I covered companies in the Consumer Services Sector  In part 6 found here I covered the Distribution Services Sector  In part 7 found here I covered the Electronic Technology Sector  In part 8 found here I covered the Energy Minerals Sector  In part 9 found here I covered the Finance Sector 
In this part 10 I will be covering the Health Services Sector 
In each article in this series  I will be providing a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors  the sector I m covering in this article is marked in green 

A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds

Summary and Conclusions
Although the Health Services Sector is one of the smaller sectors in the FactSet universe  it does offer some very interesting research candidates  The 6 research candidates presented in this article all appear to be attractively valued relative to their future growth expectations  Consequently  they all theoretically offer above average future rates of return 
Furthermore  this sector might appeal more to the total return investor than it would the dividend growth investor  Nevertheless  the few candidates that do pay a dividend also appear attractive for their future dividend growth potential  Although their current yields are not large  their growth yields  potential yield on cost  might be attractive to those dividend growth investors interested in total return

8128,229643,SRCL,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Stericycle  SRCL ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Stericycle  NASDAQ SRCL   which belongs to the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry 
This medical waste management company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 76  
For the most recent quarter  Stericycle was expected to post earnings of  1 01 per share  but it reported  1 03 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 98   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 13 per share  while it actually produced  1 17 per share  a surprise of 3 54  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Stericycle lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Stericycle has an Earnings ESP of  3 04  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 28  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric

long term earnings per share growth rate of 9 6   Its earnings are expected to register 6 7  and 3 4  growth  respectively  in 2018 and 2019 The company has outperformed its  in the past three months  The stock has soared 2 1  against the industry s gain of 1 1   We believe the stock has the potential to continue the bull run  The reasons behind our optimism include the company s strategic acquisitions  organic growth coupled with similar prudent business moves Let s discuss them in detail Strategic Acquisitions Stericycle continues to grow on the back of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets  In 2017 and 2016  Stericycle completed 30 and 31 acquisitions  respectively   Further  acquisitions contributed 570 1 million to 2016 revenues and  32 2 million to 2017 revenues  For first quarter 2018  the contribution from buyouts was  7 1 million Stericycle is highly optimistic about  tuck in  acquisition opportunities  which are expected to create value for shareholders and widen its services suite  In first quarter 2018  Stericycle closed nine tuck in acquisitions  all in the domestic market  with eight in Secure Information Destruction and one in

customers  In 2017 and 2016 organic growth contributed  20 1 million and  94 6 million to total revenues  respectively Other Strategic Business MovesBy providing business to business services in highly regulated areas  Stericycle intends to help customers and businesses comply with tough regulatory policies  It mainly targets smaller businesses with high demand for regulatory assistance compared to larger businesses due to the lack of specialized staff   To this end  Stericycle is offering services  depending on the varying customer needs  We believe this business strategy will help the company earn profits as well as expand into additional service offerings like hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management  communication services and secure information destruction Moreover  government regulatory bodies require proper and immediate implementation of rules and regulations  trying to protect the overall health environment  This is a major positive for Stericycle  which is

8159,229674,SRCL,Is Stericycle  SRCL  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Stericycle  Inc    NASDAQ SRCL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Stericycle has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 07  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 19  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Stericycle s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 29 59 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands significantly lower than the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a superb entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 60  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Stericycle has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 82  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Stericycle stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Stericycle has a P S ratio of about 1 95  This is way lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 4 16 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is close to the lows for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  SRCL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Stericycle currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Stericycle a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Stericycle is just 1 96  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 17  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  SRCL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Stericycle might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives SRCL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat mixed  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and two down in the same time period This has had a slightly negative impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has slipped by 0 9  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has been unchanged  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Stericycle  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineStericycle is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 34   which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  Further  over the past two years  the Zacks categorized Waste Management Services industry s performance has outperformed the broader market  as you

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Berkshire Hathaway  BRK B   PepsiCo  PEP  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today

Buy rated Berkshire Hathaway s shares have gained  20 2  in the last year  outperforming the Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry which increased  16 6  during the same period  Berkshire s fourth quarter 2017 earnings of  32 6 billion increased more than fivefold year over year  benefiting from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act  
The Zacks analyst thinks its inorganic story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions  A strong cash position allows it to make earnings accretive bolt on acquisitions  Demand for utilities is expected to rise in the future and drive earnings growth  Continued insurance business growth also fuels increase in float  A sturdy capital level further adds impetus to the company  
However  the insurance business generates maximum return on equity but its exposure to catastrophe loss remains a concern  Huge capital expenses due to railroad operations are also headwinds  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings moving north in the last 60 days 
 You can   
Shares of PepsiCo have gained  0 6  in the last year  underperforming the Zacks Soft Beverages industry  which has increased  17 4  over the same period  PepsiCo s fourth quarter 2017 earnings and revenues beat expectations  Notably  this is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise  Improvement in the snack business helped offset continued weakness at its beverage business amid rapidly shifting consumer landscape  
Core earnings grew 7  but revenues remained unchanged year over year  Organic revenue growth improved to 2 3  from 1 7  in the prior quarter  led by the emerging and developing markets  which saw revenue increase by 7   Notably  Frito Lay North America organic revenues grew 5   
On the flip side  NAB division reported dismal results with revenues and operating profit decreasing 6  and 29   respectively  Again  overall gross margin contracted 50 bps owing to weakness in the NAB segment  Shifting consumer preferences toward healthier options is a potent headwind 
 You can   
Broadcom s shares have handily beaten the Zacks Electronics   Semiconductors industry over the past year  gaining  21 1  vs   14   Broadcom reported impressive first quarter results  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is benefiting from strong demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio  which makes it well positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G  The company also has strong ties with leading OEMs across multiple target markets that will help it to gain key insights into the requirements of customers  
Moreover  the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment  However  customer concentration  intensifying competition  integration risks due to frequent acquisitions and leverage balance sheet are key headwinds  
Further  President Trump recently released an order asking Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  to immediately and permanently abandon its proposed takeover by Broadcom on grounds of national security concerns  This doesn t bode well for the company

8164,229679,SRCL,WM Or SRCL  Which Waste Removal Stock Is Better Placed ,opinion,The Waste Management industry mainly deals with all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal  It s a multi billion dollar industry and major services include waste collection  waste treatment and disposal  and remediation The industry is highly dependent on industrial  commercial and construction business activities  Growth in these sectors results in higher waste production  thereby increasing demand for industry services  The waste management industry is thus firmly tied to the health of the broader economy  which is currently quite favorable A rise in GDP  an improving employment scenario  easing of the U S  dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement of the U S  economy  Meanwhile  manufacturing and non manufacturing activities are currently benefiting from all round strength in the economy  The Trump administration s business friendly policies  including tax cuts and the repeal of regulations  are additional tailwinds Furthermore  increasing demand for renewable energy and solid waste recycling has opened up revenue generation opportunities for this industry Given this backdrop  it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Waste Removal Services stock   Waste Management  Inc    NYSE WM   and Stericycle  Inc    NASDAQ SRCL    Both the stocks are part of the broader  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  While Waste Management has a market capitalization of  35 72 billion  Stericycle s market cap is  5 41 billion  Currently  both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and have a of B  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  You can see  Since both the companies carry the same Zacks Rank   Style Score  we have tried to assess them on the basis of certain other parameters Price PerformanceWaste Management clearly scores over Stericycle in terms of price performance  Waste Management has gained 15 4  in a year s time  outperforming the S P 500 s and  s rally of 12 8  and 7 6   respectively  Stericycle has declined 23 2   underperforming both the S P 500 and the industry  Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company s strong prospects Waste Management s current quarter earnings are projected to grow 25 9  while that of Stericycle are expected to decline 1 7    Looking at the full year 2018 picture  Waste Management s earnings are projected to grow 24 8  while that of Stericycle are expected to increase 6 7  For 2019  Waste Management s earnings are expected to register 8 9  growth compared with 3 4  for Stericycle  Moreover  the long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 12 1  for Waste Management is higher than Stericycle s growth rate of 9 6  Thus  Waste Management has an edge over Stericyle in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock  Based on full year earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days  Stericycle is better placed  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings increased 1 1  for Stericycle against a decrease of 0 5  for Waste Management Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock s performance in the previous quarters Waste Management has performed better than Stericycle  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters  resulting in an average beat of 3 6   Stericycle has delivered positive surprises in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 0 8  Valuation We have tried to evaluate Waste Management and Stericycle in terms of price to earnings Ratio  P E   This metric is used to measure a company s

8173,229688,SRCL,Stericycle  SRCL  Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates,opinion,"Stericycle  NASDAQ SRCL  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 56 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 17 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Stericycle shares have added about 25 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for Stericycle 
While Stericycle has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Stericycle was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 92 on  857 20 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 29 on  3 39 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

You can see 
Royal Dutch Shell s shares have outperformed the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry in the year to date period  losing  1 7  vs  2 3   Notwithstanding the second quarter earnings miss  the recommendation for Royal Dutch Shell is maintained at  Neutral   While the oil company could not match profit expectations due to lower commodity prices and depressed refining margins  cash flows surged during the most recent quarter  allowing it to cut debt while performing share buybacks and cash dividend distribution  The Zacks analyst thinks the Anglo Dutch company s position as a key supplier of liquefied natural gas should benefit its long term cash flow growth on the back of attractive growth opportunities  However  there are worries over the drop in its downstream earnings  The company s poor reserve replacement ratio is another concern  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point

Shares of Occidental Petroleum have underperformed the Zacks U S  Integrated Oil industry over the past year  declining  41 4  vs   39 6   Occidental Petroleum s second quarter earnings and revenues were better than expected  courtesy of strong production from Permian Resources  The company is benefiting from increasing oil production from Permian resources  Its decision to acquire Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  will further expand operations in the Permian Basin  The strategy to divest lower margin oil and gas assets will be productive for the company over the long run  However  like other oil and gas companies  Occidental faces the risk of cost overruns and interruptions due to delays in drilling and other approvals  A highly competitive industry and ongoing fluctuation in commodity prices are adversely impacting operations of the company  Increasing debt level is another concern

Williams Companies  shares have underperformed the Zacks Oil Production and Pipeline industry over the past three months  losing  21  vs   18 4   The Zacks analyst thinks that Williams is well positioned to capitalize on the projected increase in U S  natural gas demand owing to its impressive portfolio of large scale value creating projects  The firm s existing and expansionary projects on the Transco pipeline helped the company deliver an earnings beat in the second quarter  Williams  buyout of its midstream arm and JV deals with Brazos Midstream and Canadian Fund bode well for future growth  However  the company s high leverage restricts its financial flexibility  Regulatory setback suffered by the Constitution Pipeline project is also a cause for concern  Further  Williams  extensive natural gas exposure raises sensitivity to the commodity s weak price

8188,229703,SRCL,3 Factors Define Q4 Earnings Season  So Far ,opinion,"The story of the unfolding Q4 earnings season is essentially a commentary on three inter related factors   oil  the U S  dollar and global economic growth  Oil aside  the other two factors have been at play in other recent quarters as well  But all three have really come into their own in pushing down corporate profitability 
We are seeing this in play in the Q4 results and in the estimates for the current and following quarters  In fact  estimates for 2015 Q1 and Q2 have fallen so sharply in recent days that earnings growth in the first half of 2015 has effectively evaporated under the combined weight of these factors   And then you have Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  which seems to be totally immune from all these headwinds  with top and bottom line growth rates that would be the envy of any company  let alone an operator this big  Apple s revenue and earnings numbers are so big that they have a material bearing on the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index as well  You have to isolate the  Apple Effect  to get a true sense of the earnings growth pace at this stage in reporting cycle for the index as well as the Tech sector   With results from more than half of the market cap of the S P 500 index already out  the broad trends established already are unlikely to change in any meaningful way in the coming days  But the earnings season is far from over  with a super busy reporting docket this week comprised of almost 500 companies  including 95 S P 500 members 
The Q4 Scorecard  as of 1 30 2015 
We have seen Q4 results from 228 S P 500 members that combined account for 60 3  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up  5 5  from the same period last year  with 72 4  beating EPS estimates  Total revenues are up  1 7  from the same period last year and 53 1  of them are coming ahead with top line estimates  The table below shows the current scorecard for the S P 500 index

There aren t that many surprises with respect to earnings and revenue  surprises   with beat ratios broadly tracking in line with other recent periods even though revenue beat ratios are a tad on the low side  But the growth rates  particularly on the revenue side  are decidedly on the weak side relative to other recent periods  The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of companies in 2014 Q3 and the average for the preceding four quarters 

The  Apple Effect 
Apple s outsized weight in the results thus far was referred to earlier  The charts below show a side by side comparison of how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates look with and without the iPhone maker s contribution  Please note that the left side chart shows the growth rates for the 228 S P 500 companies that have reported results already while the right side shows the growth rates for those companies without Apple 

As you can see in the chart above  the aggregate Q4 growth rate at this stage drops from  5 5  earnings growth on  1 7  higher revenues with Apple to  2 8  earnings growth on  0 5  higher revenues without Apple 
The Finance Drag
In fairness to the aggregate growth picture  Apple isn t the only outsized influence in the results   there is plenty more on the negative side that is dragging the growth rate down  Finance was an early drag  with tough comparisons at Citigroup  NYSE C and J P  Morgan  NYSE JPM  restricting the sector s earnings growth to a decline of  2 8  on  1 1  lower revenues  Excluding the drag from the Finance sector  total earnings for the remaining S P 500 companies would be up  7 8  on  2 2  higher revenues  The  7 8  ex Finance earnings growth rate is about in line with what we have been seeing from these companies in other recent quarters  though the revenue growth rate is on the low side  The chart below compares the earnings and revenue growth rates thus far on an ex Finance basis

Oil   The Biggest Drag
We don t have Exxon s  NYSE XOM  numbers yet  but the oil giant isn t expected to do much better than what we have seen from Chevron  NYSE CVX   Shell  NYSE RDSa   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and others already  The expectation is that Exxon s Q4 earnings would be more than  2 5 billion lower than what it earned in the year earlier quarter  The negative Q4 earnings comparisons at ConocoPhillips and Chevron were almost  1 billion and  1 5 billion  respectively  In a way  one could say that Apple s  5 billion year over year earnings gain essentially made up for the combined shortfall at these three oil giants 

Perhaps the true growth picture is the one that excludes the effect of both oil and Apple  The chart below does exactly that   it excludes Apple and the Energy sector from the results thus far 

Any way you look at it  the revenue growth rate is weak relative to what we have seen comparable periods in the recent past 
The Composite Q4 Picture
Combining the actual results for the 228 S P 500 companies that have reported with the 272 still to come reports  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  4 3  on 0 5  higher revenues 
Six sectors   Transportation  Medical  Utilities  Construction  Technology  and Aerospace  are expected to have double digit earnings growth in Q4  while five sectors are expected to have lower total earnings this quarter relative to the year earlier period  The Energy sector has the weakest growth profile for understandable reasons  with total earnings for the sector expected to be down  21 7  on  14 2  lower revenues 
The table below presents the summary picture for Q4 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the Q3 earnings season 

Falling Estimates
Estimates for the current period  2015 Q1  have started coming down at an accelerated pace  with total earnings for the quarter now expected to be down  1 1  from the same period last year  down from the  10 8  growth rate expected in early October  As was the case in Q4  Energy is the biggest driver of this negative revisions trend 
While total Q1 earnings for the Energy sector were expected to be down  only   35 6  in mid December  they are now expected to be down  58 9  year over year  Given the persistently weak oil prices  there is likely more room for downward adjustments to these estimates  Estimates for Q4 went through an even sharper negative revision process  though almost half of the drop in estimates was due to developments in the Energy sector 
The chart below plots the evolution of current and following quarter estimates over the last 3 plus months  As you can see  the first half 2015 growth rate has effectively fallen victim to developments in the oil patch 

The best way to understand these falling first half 2015 estimates is to go back to the three factors we outlined at the top of this write up   oil  U S  dollar and global growth worries  With no respite on any of those fronts  estimates likely have more to go before stabilizing Here is a list of the 488 companies reporting this week  including 95 S P 500 members ",2015-02-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-factors-define-q4-earnings-season-(so-far)-240344,240344

You can see 
Caterpillar s shares have outperformed the Zacks Construction and Mining industry  0 2  vs  0 1   in the year to date period  The Zacks analyst thinks that Caterpillar s global machine sales growth rate has been on a downward spiral over the past few months  which is concerning 
Notably  the company s July global retail sales growth of 4  was marked as the lowest so far this year  The company anticipates earnings per share on the lower end of its guidance of  12 06  13 06 and sales growth to be modest for 2019  In the Construction Industries segment  North America will likely aid growth while China will be a headwind 
Improving commodity prices will support capital expenditure in the mining sector  which will drive the Resource Industries segment  Investments in expanded offerings and services  and digital initiatives like e commerce will also fuel growth  Its cost reduction efforts will help sustain margins despite material cost inflation owing to tariffs 
 You can   
Shares of General Motors have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry over the past six months  gaining 2 5  vs  2   The Zacks analyst believes that strong demand for profitable trucks and SUVs is aiding General Motors  revenues 
The company s hot selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado  Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line  The firm is increasing capacity investment in emerging markets to enhance global sales  and is undertaking several initiatives to make its vehicles more advanced  safer and fuel efficient 
However  high cost of raw materials and rising tariffs amid heightening U S  Sino trade tiff may put pressure on the firm s profitability  As it is  the company s negative free cash flows and high debt load are causes of worry  Further  frequent recalls act as a headwind  As such  investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point 
 You can   
Citigroup s shares have gained 10 4  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry  which has gained 2 6  over the same period 
The Zacks analyst believes that Citigroup s streamlining efforts  along with strategic investments in core business  bode well for the long term  Also  a declining cost base supports its bottom line improvement 
Steady capital deployment activities are also commendable  However  pending litigation issues might keep legal expenses elevated  Further  decline in fee income is a concern for the company  Recently  at an investors  conference  chief financial officer Mark Mason commented that trading and investment banking revenues are expected to decline in third quarter 2019  Further  NII outlook has also been lowered amid more Fed rate cut expectations

What s Next for Stericycle 
While Stericycle has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Stericycle was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here
