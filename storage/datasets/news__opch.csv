111096,332611,OPCH,Novartis loses new bid to dismiss U S  lawsuit over kickbacks,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday said the U S  Department of Justice may pursue most of its lawsuit accusing Novartis AG  VX NOVN  of civil fraud for allegedly using kickbacks to boost sales of drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid 
U S  District Judge Colleen McMahon allowed the government to continue its False Claims Act case against the Swiss drugmaker over claims submitted to Medicare and some state Medicaid programs for Myfortic  used by patients with kidney transplants  and Exjade  for patients who get blood transfusions 
She also dismissed a part of the case covering claims submitted to state Medicaid programs other than New York s prior to March 23  2010  when the Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  was enacted 
Novartis  which has offices in East Hanover  New Jersey  had objected to what it called the government s  potentially limitless  theory that any claims submitted by pharmacists who got kickbacks were tainted 
It said the government  to pursue its case  instead must show a kickback scheme actually caused pharmacists to sell Myfortic or Exjade 
Julie Masow  a Novartis spokeswoman  did not immediately respond to requests for comment  A spokeswoman for U S  Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan declined to comment 
The government accused Novartis of providing discounts and rebates from 2005 to 2013 to induce at least 20 pharmacies to switch thousands of patients to Myfortic  an immunosuppressant 
It also said that from 2007 to 2012  Novartis offered patient referrals and rebates to BioScrip Inc  O BIOS  so that pharmacy would recommend refills of Exjade  which is meant to reduce iron levels in patients 
The government alleged that these activities caused Medicare and Medicaid to pay tens of millions of dollars of improper reimbursements  and violated a federal anti kickback law  Eleven U S  states are co plaintiffs  BioScrip settled for  11 7 million in January 
McMahon had on May 29 allowed the case to proceed  but said she wanted to further review the legal issues 
In her decision on Thursday  she said Congress  gave absolutely no indication  that it intended to limit the reach of the False Claims Act where kickbacks were concerned 
 Where a party falsely certifies compliance with the  anti kickback law  in connection with a claim  the claim is  false  as a matter of law  and so is not eligible for reimbursement   she wrote 

McMahon gave the government 21 days to again plead claims she dismissed 
The lawsuit stemmed from a whistleblower case by David Kester  a former Novartis respiratory account manager from Raleigh  North Carolina  He is also pursuing separate claims against Novartis and other companies regarding other drugs 
The case is U S  v  Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp  U S  District Court  Southern District of New York  No  11 08196 ",2014-08-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/novartis-loses-new-bid-to-dismiss-u.s.-lawsuit-over-kickbacks-302100,302100

111102,332617,OPCH,Moving Average Crossover Alert  BioScrip,opinion,"BioScrip  Inc    NASDAQ BIOS   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for BIOS broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 22 2  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for BIOS stock 
If that wasn t enough  BIOS isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  2 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for BIOS  You can see

Reported revenues for the second quarter inched down 1  year over year to  1 91 billion  while it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 90 billion  The year over year decline in the reported revenues were due to the company s strategic divestitures in order to refocus on core diagnostic information services  However  excluding the 2015 clinical trials testing business contribution and Celera products revenue  and Focus Diagnostics products revenues  sales increased 3 6  year over year 
Volume  measured by the number of requisitions  increased 1 9  year over year  Revenue per requisition inched up 0 2  from the year ago quarter  Diagnostic information services revenues in the quarter grew 2 2  on a year over year basis

 QUEST DIAGNOSTC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   
Outlook
Quest Diagnostics has lowered its earlier 2016 revenue guidance  The company currently expects full year revenues in the range of  7 47  7 54 billion  from earlier range of  7 52  7 59   reflecting flat to 1  increase over 2015 revenues  growth of 1 5  2 5    The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  7 53 billion  within the guidance range  Revenues on an equivalent basis are expected to increase of 2  to 3  over 2015 
In addition  the company s 2016 adjusted EPS expectation remains in the range of  5 02  5 17  unchanged from the previous expectation   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 10 remains within the guided range 
Adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 is expected to reach  1 billion  The current estimate for capital expenditure has also been reiterated in the range of  250  300 million 
Our Take
Quest Diagnostics duly exceeded our earnings as well as revenue expectations for the second quarter 2016  The company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on delivering disciplined capital deployment 
We are also highly optimistic about the company s focus on continued execution of its five point strategy  According to Quest Diagnostics  its planned divestiture of sale of the company s Focus Diagnostics products business is part of this broader strategy to refocus the business on diagnostic information services   In addition  several new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks were the other growth drivers 
However  over the past several quarters  the overall soft industry trends  leading to a low volume environment  have acted as a dampener for the company

111170,332685,OPCH,Quest Diagnostics  Strong Q2  Strategic Initiatives Add Value,opinion,"On Jul 22  2016  we issued an updated research report on Quest Diagnostics  Inc    NYSE DGX     a major commercial laboratory services provider 
Quest Diagnostics surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings as well as revenues for the second quarter 2016 
Quest Diagnostics has successfully complied with its five point strategy that focuses on areas with high potential such as gene based esoteric testing for cancer  cardiovascular disease  infectious disease and neurological disorders  Although during the second quarter  revenues declined 1  on a reported basis  this was mainly due to the company s efforts to refocus on the core business 
Consequently  revenues grew 2 4  on an equivalent basis and once again the company is optimistic about its performance for the rest of 2016  second quarter 2016 Diagnostic Information Service revenues grew by 2 2  on a year over year basis  
In the last couple of months  the company has made a number of strategic product launches and forged new partnerships 
This includes three new cancer test services that will provide clinically actionable insight into an individual s risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer  These tests will remain part of the company s newly branded Quest Vantage cancer test menu 
We are also looking forward to the company s recently formed alliance with HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare   NYSE HCA   to improve the quality and value of diagnostic services  Per the agreement  Quest Diagnostics will manage in patient laboratory operations for six Denver area hospitals in the HealthONE system 
We are also optimistic about the current favorable demographic trends along with Quest Diagnostics  mergers and acquisitions activity which is on track with its strategy  The company s recent acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Services business of Clinical Laboratory Partners  CLP  as well as the Professional Lab Services Agreements from Barnabas Health  are aiding in delivering continued implementation of an accelerated growth plan 
However  through the past several quarters  the overall soft industry trends  responsible for low volume growth  have been a major concern for the company  Furthermore  Quest Diagnostics is highly disappointed with the recent CMS proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act  PAMA   While CMS  has once again decided to further delay the execution of the new payment system until Jan 1  2018  Quest Diagnostics is apprehensive about the effect of the final rule  taking into consideration the clinical lab fee schedule representing approximately 12  of its revenues 
Moreover  lower healthcare utilization continues to be a major drag  Although the company has witnessed signs of modest increase in utilization  sustainability is still a concern 
The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

BioScrip posted a better than expected second quarter with net loss narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues ahead of the same  BioScrip has recently acquired Home Solutions   the home infusion and nursing products business of HS Infusion Holdings  The combined company is anticipated to generate revenues of more than  1 billion 
We are encouraged by BioSrip s progress with its multi faceted strategic plan  which was adopted to improve its financial position and position itself as a pure play infusion services company focused on high growth services 
In fact  we are encouraged to note that in the second quarter  BioScrip delivered its strongest adjusted EBITDA results since 2013  and the quarter s performance exhibits significant progress it has made since the implementation of the financial improvement plan a year back  Operating workflow efficiency has improved  there was increase in cash collections as well as reductions in bad debt and overhead costs 
With the new initiatives likely to enhance the company s overall business  we expect the company to overcome its loss scenario as well  on the account of these steps  Meanwhile  management has authorized a process to concurrently explore a range of strategic alternatives  including transitioning chronic therapies to alliance partners or a potential sale or merger of the company 
On Aug 27  2015  BioScrip divested its entire PBM Services segment to ProCare Pharmacy Benefit Manager Inc  for a total cash consideration of approximately  24 6 million  including an adjustment for estimated closing date net working capital  Following the divestment of PBM Services  Infusion Services remains as the only operating segment at the company 
We also note  BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in its core Infusion Services business  the sole operating segment at the company  The company has been building a strong core Infusion platform through organic growth and acquisitions  Management forecasts BioScrip s focus on the higher growth core Infusion business will drive increased profitability 
On the flip side  reimbursement issues continue to strain BioScrip s performance  Over the last several years  increased Medicaid spending  combined with slow state revenue growth  led many states to institute measures aimed at control in spending  subsequently taking a toll on operating performances of companies like BioScrip  Besides  the competitive landscape also remains as overhang headwind

111175,332690,OPCH,Why BioScrip  BIOS  Could Be Positioned For A Slump,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is BioScrip  Inc    NASDAQ BIOS    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further confirms weakness in BIOS A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from loss of 29 cents a share a month ago to its current level of loss of 43 cents per share Also  for the current quarter  BioScrip has seen 3 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to loss of 8 cents a share from loss of 2 cents over the past 30 days   BIOSCRIP INC Price and Consensus   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 55 7  in the past month So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Medical sector  you may instead consider a better ranked stock Galena Biopharma  Inc    NASDAQ GALE    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see  Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-11-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-bioscrip-(bios)-could-be-positioned-for-a-slump-200166641,200166641
111176,332691,OPCH,Moving Average Crossover Alert  BioScrip  BIOS ,opinion,"BioScrip  Inc    NASDAQ BIOS   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for BIOS broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 56 8  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for BIOS stock 
If that wasn t enough  BioScrip isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  3 estimates have been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for BIOS  You can see
