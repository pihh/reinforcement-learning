116675,338190,BECN,Can Home Depot s  HD  Integrated Strategy Help Win Laurels ,opinion,Home Depot Inc  s   NYSE HD   growth story has been robust over the years  owing to its efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience to customers  with innovative products and improved productivity  Further  its efforts to simplify the Pro shopping experience and improve engagement through services like tool rental  delivery and the new B2B online experience have been aiding sales over the past several quarters These efforts are well reflected in the company s record of positive earnings surprises for more than five years  with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share  Apart from progress on investments  a favorable U S  consumer backdrop and a steady housing market are supporting its growth trajectory  Consequently  the company is nearing financial goals outlined in December 2017 Factors Supporting GrowthHome Depot is witnessing significant benefits from the execution of the  One Home Depot  investment plan  focused on delivering an interconnected shopping experience to customers  In store investments under the plan mainly focus on easy customer navigation through the store aisles and increased speed to checkout  The company enhanced navigation through the introduction of a way finding sign and store refresh package in more than 1 400 U S  stores  These along with front end store investments to optimize labor and merchandise space productivity led to improved customer satisfaction scores and conversion rates in stores Further  the introduction of digital price labels in the appliance department has enhanced store shopping experience as customers can now view the online ratings and reviews in the stores as well  Though physical stores are the keys to its business  the company identifies that many of in store purchases are the result of online visits Additionally  nearly 50  of online orders in the United States are picked up from stores  reflecting the relevance of stores amid the growing popularity of e commerce  The blended customer engagement across both channels forms the basis for the company s integrated retail strategy that connects offline and online channels On the digital front  it is investing in its website and other applications to further enhance online customer experience  It is witnessing higher traffic  better conversion and continued sales growth in the digital business through improved search capabilities  site functionality  category presentation and product content Moreover  the company continues to roll out automated lockers in stores to make picking up of online orders easier and convenient  Currently  automated lockers are available in about 1 100 stores  Notably  stores with these lockers witnessed an increase of 250 basis points  bps  in checkout scores compared with stores without lockers The company is also making efforts to leverage the digital business to boost sales for new categories like HD Home pool and workwear  The investments across the digital and physical assets are likely to drive its productivity growth apart from boosting customer experience Furthermore  Home Depot s Pro segment is a key growth driver  with Pro sales outpacing DIY  do it yourself  sales for the past several quarters  Strength in this business also places it in an advantageous position amid other home improvement peers like Lowe s Companies Inc    NYSE LOW    Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc    NYSE LL   and Beacon Roofing Supply  Inc    NASDAQ BECN   The company s Pro segment is benefiting from its efforts to enhance service capabilities for the Pros  It is focused on simplifying the Pro shopping experience and expanding engagement through services like tool rental  delivery and the new B2B website  The B2B platform brings a more personalized experience to Pro customers based on customer feedback  The company expects to roll out the new Pro online experience to more than a million Pros by 2019 Additionally  the company equipped store personnel with several tools to better understand Pro customers  The latest among these tools is the My View system  which enables associates to access customer data  allowing them to work proactively to better serve Pro customers Near Term HurdlesThough the company s long term growth prospects remain intact  we note that lumber prices have declined significantly in the past year  which partly hurt sales and comparable sales  comps  in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  Notably  lumber price deflation hurt comp growth by nearly  340 million  or more than 100 bps  in the fiscal second quarter  Moreover  the company expects lumber deflation to continue remaining a drag on the top line in the quarters ahead Moreover  it fears that potential impacts of the recently enacted tariffs on U S  consumers might hurt sales performance  Considering these factors  the company slashed its sales and comps view for fiscal 2019  It now expects sales growth to be nearly 2 3  in fiscal 2019 compared with 3 3  rise stated earlier  Comps  for the comparable 52 week period  are now anticipated to rise 4  compared with 5  growth mentioned previously Further  the company s margins look troubled  with gross margin contracting 20 bps in second quarter fiscal 2019 due to impacts of changes in the mix of products sold and higher supply chain costs  The increase in supply chain costs mainly resulted from startup costs linked with the company s One Home Depot supply chain initiative  Additionally  operating expenses were nearly flat as impacts of the strategic investment plan related costs were nearly offset by efficient expense management initiatives  Moreover  operating margin declined 20 bps mostly due to soft gross margin Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over

portfolios  which have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the to be reported quarter  This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation Investors after all  while shelling out their hard earned money in the stock market  are governed by the sole objective of generating handsome returns on their portfolio  However  the task of designing one s portfolio with potential outperformers is not an easy one  In fact  equity market tricks are not easy to master with a plethora of stocks flooding the space at any point of time  The task becomes even more difficult when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance Time for Some Broker Advice In view of the aforementioned constraints  it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by the experts in the field  The concerned experts are brokers  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them They have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors   To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Direction of Earnings Estimates Serves as a Proper GuideSince brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Naturally  their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings outperformance by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving broker recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Do Not Ignore the Top LineDesigning a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to result in a winning approach  Actually  according to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds  To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

116734,338249,BECN,Add These 6 Low P B Stocks To Your Portfolio In March,opinion,Though value investors have tried various ways to identify stocks that are trading at a discount to their actual value  spotting a discounted stock is quite difficult You are a growth investor when you buy a share with a tremendous growth potential  However  value investing is different and involves picking stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value  Ironically  it requires investors to embrace stocks that are under the radar  Price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratios are favorite tools of value investors Though P E is a more popular financial metric  P B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low priced stocks that have high growth prospects  The ratio is used to compare a stock s market value price to its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareNow let us understand the concept of book value Understanding Book ValueThere are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1 PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock

116736,338251,BECN,Design A Balanced Portfolio With These 4 Low P CF Stocks,opinion,Warren Buffett once said   It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price    The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which  in turn  lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a

116741,338256,BECN,Buy These 6 Low Price to Book Value Stocks For Solid Returns,opinion,Value investors prefer price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  ratios for identifying low priced stocks

its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareP B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share  So  if the share price is  10 and book value of equity is  5  investors are ready to pay two times the book value  Ideally  a P B value under 1 0 is considered good  indicating a potentially

116773,338288,BECN,Add These 5 Low P CF Stocks For Optimum Portfolio Returns,opinion,Warren Buffett once said   It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price   The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings  Inc    NYSE AXL    which designs  engineers  validates  and manufactures driveline  metal forming  powertrain and casting products  sports a Zacks Rank  1  It has an expected EPS growth rate of 8 1  for 3 5 years and delivered an

score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  The VGM Score of B  along with some other key metrics  makes the company a solid choice for investors Higher Inventory Turnover RatioOver the trailing 12 months  the inventory turnover ratio for Beacon Roofing has been 5 5  compared with the industry s level of 4 6   A higher inventory turnover than the industry average means that inventory is sold at a faster rate  suggesting inventory management effectiveness Cheap ValuationBeacon Roofing s trailing 12 month P E ratio is 18 9  while the industry s average trailing 12 month P E is at 23 3  Consequently  the stock is cheaper at this point based on this ratio Growth Drivers in PlaceBeacon Roofing is moving forward with the ongoing integration of the Allied Building Products acquisition  The company raised its previous synergy expectations from  110 million to an updated  120 million target due to the early integration progress  It also raised the fiscal 2018 synergy expectations from around  35 million to  40 million  Regarding the specific synergy components  Beacon Roofing has begun consolidating procurement programs to secure the best supply arrangement from vendors on a market by market basis Beacon Roofing witnessed cold temperatures throughout second quarter fiscal 2018  a rain filled February month  and snow wind disruptions during March  However  the harsh weather conditions created a solid demand backdrop for the remainder of fiscal 2018  Thus  the company s third quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to improve as the critical weather situation witnessed in the fiscal second quarter will not repeat Notably  Beacon Roofing remains optimistic about a strong macroeconomic backdrop for new constructions and home improvement  and company initiatives  The company continues to have an encouraging outlook for non residential construction and believes the impact of winter weather on northern markets will drive re

increases are occurring across a wide range of key items  including asphalt  steel and gypsum  as well as for inbound flatbed rates and for outbound costs  including diesel and other delivery expenses  Additionally  elevated prices might impact demand for these products  resulting in lower sales volumes In addition to the above  the commercial roofing market has been experiencing heightened competitive pricing pressures  of late  Moreover  even though repair remodel represents the majority product demand for Beacon Roofing  the timing of these replacement decisions can vary due to economic factors and weather conditions Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed the  it belongs to in the past year  The stock has lost around 18   while the industry recorded growth of 15

PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementRising material costs have been impacting the company s overall performance  As a distributor of residential roofing supplies  it is sensitive to asphalt prices  which are highly volatile and often linked to oil prices  This is because oil is a significant input in asphalt production  Shingle prices have been volatile in the recent years  partly due to volatility in asphalt prices Also  its commercial roofing market has been experiencing highly competitive pricing pressures  The maintenance  repair   operations   MRO   supply market is highly fragmented  with many smaller local players competing directly on pricing issues The impact of these headwinds was seen in the operating results of the first nine months of fiscal 2018  During the period  the company recorded operating margins of 2 2   down 200 basis points  bps  from a year ago  Also  its existing markets gross margin declined 40 bps due to raw material cost increase of approximately 3  in the same time frame Considering the above mentioned headwinds  Beacon Roofing has lowered its adjusted EBITDA view from  555  585 million to  510  520 million for fiscal 2018  Adjusted EPS is now expected in the  3 00  3 10 range compared with  3 35  3 55 projected earlier  Its full year revenues are

million targeted earlier  Also  for full year fiscal 2018  the company raised its synergy guidance from around  35 million to  40 million  With these acquisition strategies in place  Beacon Roofing is

116812,338327,BECN,Is Now The Time To Buy ,opinion,"Most investors are confused by sell offs  Sharp declines are scary and result in further panic selling  This is especially so when most of the investors one hears in the media believe that markets forecast economic activity  In reality  it is economic fundamentals which drive market prices  but with few paying close attention  the former is accepted and taught in our business schools  Truly  the greatest misperception of markets embedded by continuous repetition for hundreds of years is the belief  markets lead   That markets forecast economic trends or even determine them has been the foundation of much investment perception its earliest days  Detailed examination of 70 years of modern financial history that markets follow economics  Market prices are established after economic trends become widely recognized  Markets follow they do not lead  This is the basis of investment opportunity for fundamentally focused investors 
Computer driven algorithms  created by Momentum Investors  are not fundamental indicators  The designers of algorithms incorporate past price correlations such as falling oil prices  rising U S  dollar and a narrowing of the 2 year  10 year Treasury yield spread to recessions with the goal of out trading other investors  Algorithms are for short term trading and are based on price trends  Fundamental analysis is ignored  Price trends are used by Momentum Investors and are believed to carry all the necessary information required  Financially impacting headlines are a significant factor in setting short term price direction  Periodically conditions ripen to the point that algorithms signal a trend inconsistent with fundamentals  Today s market pessimism is one such period  This has  in turn  captured the media s focus on comparing today with the 1930 s Great Depression  which has exaggerated today s period of market pessimism  It is periods such as today when the trader s panic drives prices widely from economic fundamentals and becomes a buying opportunity for investors who recognize it  How does one identify when a short term panic is a buying opportunity 
Telling when a trader s panic is a buying opportunity for fundamental investors requires insight that comes from the comparison of previous panics using reliable data sources  I use a combination of sentiment and fundamental valuation measures both  Top Down  and  Bottom Up   The greatest mistake investors become prey to is the media perception that markets are homogeneous  The media theme today is that the price trends of the F A N G type stocks are all you need to know  This is not the case 
Markets are a composite of thousands of companies  In every cycle  a few issues become trader s favorites which become the media focus  The media has always identified these few as deserving of nearly daily  sometimes even hourly focus  The common phrase   as goes XXXXXX  so goes the market   and the assumption is   so goes the economy   occurs every market cycle  It is these heavily touted issues which enter and come to dominate the indices over a cycle  The volatility of these few issues  because of the combination of media attention and so much Momentum driven capital chasing their price trends  comes to dominate the volatility of the indices and in turn dominate the consensus perception of the economy  Momentum Investor domination of the F A N G issues is why there is little connection with their fundamental valuations  Each cycle has its own version of  F A N G issues   Ignored are the thousands of other companies of every composite index which provide valuable detail as a basis of fundamental analysis  It is through the fundamental detail on which there is little media focus that one identifies when a Momentum Investor s panic is a Value Investor s buying opportunity 
The body of fundamental sentiment data is detailed and more voluminous than a single note can provide  A few key sources  fundamental and market sentiment measures are helpful  The Chemical Activity Barometer  CAB and the S P 500 Value Investor Index are reliable fundamental indicators  The CAB is a measure of U S  general economic activity developed using chemical industry inputs  Chemistry is a vital aspect of every nook and cranny in the U S  economy which has reliably identified economic peaks and lows  The S P 500 Investor Value Index  VII  is based on Knut Wicksell s  Natural Rate   The VII is unique to the long term S P 500 earnings and the U S  GDP growth and is a measure of S P 500 valuation  CAB indicates that we continue solidly in an economic uptrend while the VII indicates the S P 500 is under priced relative to previous cycles  With the S P 500 at a 3  premium to the VII  it remains well below peak premiums of 60  100   The VII is only used to identify  Top Down  Value investor buying levels such as we see today  Today s S P 500 is a level of market pessimism which attracts Value Investor buying  The AAII is an investor sentiment measure  AAII Bullish Sentiment is today at the lowest levels since 2009 and coincides with previous periods of relatively high insider buying  Insider Buying is both a fundamental and a sentiment indicator  Corporate insiders are the most knowledgeable Value Investors  They are in the best position for identifying when their own shares are under valued versus economic context  Historically  insider buying never occurs in  high fliers  in any market cycle and the same is true today 


Markets are composites of thousands of unique companies
Markets are composites of thousands of unique companies  Beacon Roofing Supply Inc  NASDAQ BECN  is one example of many available in the current environment  By analyzing numerous well managed issues which have suffered price declines  one comes to the realization that many well managed businesses remain solid and shares are undervalued  One determines this through detailed analysis which assesses management s performance history  how the market has priced the shares in the past  insider activity and finally analyze the broader economic context in which management operates  BECN s data speaks for itself  The current rise in the Mortgage Credit Availability Index  MCAI  indicates improved mortgage credit should spur housing activity and be a strong positive for BECN  Note that the MCAI stalled 2 years ago  but recently accelerated as FDIC Chair Jelena McWilliams as eased Dodd Frank regulations for smaller banks 
There are many well managed companies with price declines today which have increased insider buying activity  Together  these companies form the composite for today s period of Insider Buying exceeding Insider Selling  Insider Buying has always been a reliable indicator at market lows  very much like the VII 


Time to Buy  This is how do you know 
Most investors feel spooked today with the media flood of negative information  During periods such as today  it is difficult to sort fact from fiction  It is always helpful to be reminded that the goal of the media is to garner attention  After all  it is about gaining and holding viewership on which advertising revenue is dependent  The bad news is what creates viewership  It is how humans are wired  Stress those issues which raise investors fears and viewership rises along with ad revenue  When the consensus is spooked  emotions can overwhelm reason and a herd mentality kicks in  especially when one s friends are spooked  This makes it very difficult to hold a contrarian perspective and locate specific opportunities  In such an environment the power of suggestion can take hold  be amplified through algorithms and further amplified by the media 
In such an environment  we need to be reminded that markets follow  they do not lead  If we can sort fact from emotionally driven thinking  then we remain on track for sound investment decisions  One accomplishes this by working through the detailed analysis as discussed  Through this process the buying opportunities in many BECN like examples become apparent  In simple terms  it is a composite of buy signals produced by many separate issues with the right blend of  Top Down  and  Bottom Up  factors  None of the F A N G issues qualify nor have they had the characteristics to qualify as good fundamental investments   That F A N G issues do not sport attractive management fundamental metrics is one reason it permits them to be driven by Momentum investors who invest with headlines holding little substance  
By performing fundamental analyses several hundreds of times throughout a market cycle  one comes to know that the current environment is a Time to Buy

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Beacon Roofing Supply  Inc    NASDAQ BECN    D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI    Deere   Company   NYSE DE   and Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Construction Industry Set to Boom in 2018  4 Top PicksThe construction industry in the United States is expected to grow by leaps and bounds in 2018  Also  a ratio which measures the optimism surrounding the sector s growth hit a record high recently  Further  hiring in the sector has been unusually high over the last one year  Meanwhile  a leaked draft of Trump s infrastructure spending plans indicates that the GOP will prioritize improving the existing roads and highways as well as non federally funded utilities in the country Lastly  strong economic growth and recent tax reforms continue to boost the industry s growth  Such a scenario quite naturally calls for investing in construction stocks  Construction Spending Hits a Record HighIn November 2017  construction spending increased  surpassing expectations  The figure came in at  1 26 trillion  logging an annual growth rate of 2 4   Such strength in spending was the result of increased investments across real estate  commercial and residential projects  Further  spending on private construction remained high and invited gains to the industry To top it all  firms operating in the space are also looking to expand their workforce as evident from unusually high hiring even under dire circumstances  Per the latest data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the construction industry added as many as 30 000 jobs to the U S  economy in December  when parts of the country were ravaged by harsh winters In 2017 alone  the sector added 210 000 jobs  which represented a surge of 35  from 2016  Economists have already stated that such figures are indicative of excellent performance by the space in 2018 Moreover  the ratio which measures the industry optimism over business growth hit a record high  Such optimism is backed primarily by business friendly economic conditions and overall growth  Also  economists have stated that construction in the office market  transportation and retail will see a boom this year Infrastructure Spending to be Beefed UpOptimism regarding growth of the construction industry surged post President Trump s victory as one of his key priorities was infrastructure investment  Although spending on government projects have declined 3 4  year to date  the figure is still close to an increase of 3     the highest monthly gain in three years   that it hit in October 2017  This is courtesy of higher spending at the federal  state and local levels Increased infrastructure spending was the cornerstone of Trump s pesidential campaign  As a matter of fact  he had proposed a  1 trillion infrastructure spending financed by new tax credits to encourage private equity investors  He plans to deploy  200 billion in federal money over the next decade to  incentivize another  800 billion in spending from state and local authorities and private entities  That said  the question on investors  mind is  Will infrastructure spending be increased at all  One can roughly gauge that this might be possible  Efforts made by members of the GOP to push through tax reforms are indicative of their legislative intent  More than anything  it is the repute and the goodwill that President Trump and his team would like to maintain A leaked draft of Trump s infrastructure policy  published on  on Jan 23  2018  clearly mentions that the administration is not keen on building new roads or highways and taking up  unsustainable projects   The administration instead focuses on improving the conditions of the existing roads and highways  The plan also hints at protecting non federally funded utilities within the country  Such statements give a clear indication that the citizens will soon witness the passing of the Infrastructure Spending Bill Fall in Starts a Momentary HiccupThe year started with a disappointing reading for housing starts  Per the Department of Commerce  housing starts declined 8 2  in December   its largest percentage drop since November 2016  However  analysts see such a downturn as temporary  Further  housing possibly felt the chill from December s brutally low temperatures Also  the 2 4  increase in homebuilding to 1 202 million units in 2017 is one important point to be noted  This is the highest level recorded in a decade  Strong economic growth  a robust labor market and tax cuts are continuing to bolster the housing industry Future demand is also likely to remain strong given the shortage in supply of existing homes  Also  homebuilders are not planning more speculative homes  These are units which still do not have a buyer  And this phenomenon has not been witnessed since the last housing boom  which preceded the recession of 2008    4 Best Stocks to

projected to grow 3 2  to 3 8  in 2018  The linchpin to the strong near and long term retail industry outlook is a strong labor market and rising consumer income Retail sales in the United States

and several bankruptcy filings shaped the retail industry in 2017  Retailers who failed to strategize in a highly competitive space phased out  In fact  if they do not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains  store closures and bankruptcies might continue Digital innovation  focus on continual product customization and launch and delivering of seamless consumer experience are expected help retailers make the most of the recent recovery in the space  In fact  clothing stores  restaurants and bars that have employed distinguished facilities are already

116880,338395,BECN,Dollar Tree  DLTR  In Investors  Good Books  Time To Hold ,opinion,Dollar Tree   NASDAQ DLTR   has been gaining from its robust surprise trend accompanied by strong comparable store sales  comps  and improved margins  Also  the company is benefiting from the integration of Family Dollar  However  volatile consumer environment  intense competition and significant global exposure remain impediments Shares of the company gained 24 9  in the past three months  outperforming the  s growth of 21 4   Let s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company Robust Surprise Trend and Solid Q3 Result  Outlook RaisedDollar Tree has been posting robust earnings and sales surprise trends in the recent quarters  The company s top and bottom line results for third quarter fiscal 2017 marked its second straight earnings and sales beat  Results were fueled by significant comps growth and improved margins  Comps improved for the 39th straight quarter while reduced merchandise costs  lower markdowns and occupancy expenses aided margins  Also  positive impact from Canadian currency fluctuations aided results Driven by the robust third quarter and progress on Family Dollar integration  the company raised guidance for fiscal 2017  Also  it provided a bullish view for the fourth quarter  Management is anticipating earnings per share to be in range of  4 64  4 73  Also  consolidated sales are projected to lie within the band of  6 32  6 43 billion  driven by comps growth in a low single digit rise range for the combined entity Remarkable Comps GrowthDollar Tree s comps have been benefiting from strategic store expansion plans  including remodeling and relocations and competitive pricing  The company continues with the positive trend as is evident from consolidated comps growth of 3 2  in the third quarter fiscal 2017 and 3 3  in constant currency Comps growth in the quarter can be attributed to improved customer count and average ticket  While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 5   in constant currency   the same at the Family Dollar banner increased 1 5  Store Expansion Bodes WellCurrently  Dollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements  During third quarter fiscal 2017  the company opened 169 new stores and expanded or relocated 23 stores  Consequently  it ended the quarter with 14 744 stores including 6 604 Dollar Tree and 8 140 Family Dollar outlets  Further  the company remains on track to operate over 10 000 Dollar Tree and over 15 000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States Integration With Family DollarDollar Tree is also gaining from the integration of Family Dollar  which was acquired in July 2015  Notably  sales from the Family Dollar banner represented nearly 50  of the company s consolidated sales in the third quarter Additionally  Dollar Tree is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers  Consequently  the company has renovated 191 Family Dollar stores in the third quarter and intends to complete 350 renovations in fiscal 2017 While increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re banner process are expected to weigh on the company results for some time  it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth at least  300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition  The combined chain  on the completion of the integration  will be positioned to reach out to more value seeking consumers through a network spanning across vast geographies Bottom LineWhile all seems well  Dollar Tree has been facing problems regarding highly competitive market and volatile consumer behavior  Also  significant global exposure poses serious threats toward the company performance  However  we believe the company s strategies will be able to offset these headwinds Do Retail Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention  Check TheseInvestors

Liquidators Holdings  Inc    NYSE LL   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  5 Amazing Housing Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 EarningsThe U S  housing industry has just come off a great year  A last minute boost was the icing on the cake  with homebuilding optimism hitting a record level on the tax cuts announcement  In the first month of 2018  buyer demand and homebuilder optimism look strong  And these factors remain in place despite a disappointing read for housing starts for December In fact  cumulative housing numbers for 2017 are quite impressive and indicate that another strong year for the industry is in the offing  Investing in stocks from the sector looks like an increasingly profitable option at this point U S  Housing Had a Great 2017According to real estate database firm Zillow  the value of U S  housing stock as a whole increased by 6 5  or  2 trillion in 2017  This takes the total value of all homes located within the United States to  31 8 trillion  This increase in cumulative housing value was the fastest recorded since 2013  a time when the sector was still recovering from the Great Recession As of now  Los Angeles is the most valuable housing market in the country  accounting for a total value of  2 7 trillion  Data from Zillow also reveals that New York comes in second with a cumulative value of  2 6 trillion   In fact  the 10 most highly valued metro areas make up around 36  of the cumulative value of U S  housing This increase was primarily due to a spike in prices and a concurrent shortage in housing supply  According to real estate data provider Redfin  U S  home prices increased by 7  over 2017 to a median sales price of  284 500 Meanwhile  sales registered a 1 7  increase over 2016 while only 2 6 months of supply was reported in December  Such a state of supplies indicates that the market is heavily skewed in favor of sellers Prospects Remain Strong Although Starts DeclineMeanwhile  the year started with a disappointing reading for housing starts numbers  According to the Department of Commerce  housing starts declined by 8 2  in December  the largest percentage drop recorded since Nov 2016  However  industry watchers believe that the downturn experienced in December is likely to be temporary  Further  housing possibly felt the chill from December s brutally low temperatures Optimists point toward the 2 4  increase in homebuilding to 1 202 million units in 2017  This is the highest level recorded in a decade  Strong economic growth  a robust labor market and tax cuts are continuing to bolster the housing industry Future demand is also likely to remain strong given the shortage in supply of existing homes  Also  homebuilders are not planning more speculative homes  These are units which still do not have a buyer  And this phenomenon has not been witnessed since the last housing boom which preceded the recession of 2008   Our ChoicesIt would be best to ignore the recent poor reading of housing starts given that several positives remain in place for the sector  Homebuilding sentiment continues to linger near the 18 year high hit in December  Further  buyer demand remains high even as supplies constraints continue to exist  skewing the market heavily in favor of sellers  Taken together  these factors ensure that housing stocks remain a strong investment option in 2018  is our

116889,338404,BECN,Construction Industry Set To Boom In 2018  4 Top Picks,opinion,The construction industry in the United States is expected to grow by leaps and bounds in 2018  Also  a ratio which measures the optimism surrounding the sector s growth hit a record high recently  Further  hiring in the sector has been unusually high over the last one year  Meanwhile  a leaked draft of Trump s infrastructure spending plans indicates that the GOP will prioritize improving the existing roads and highways as well as non federally funded utilities in the country Lastly  strong economic growth and recent tax reforms continue to boost the industry s growth  Such a scenario quite naturally calls for investing in construction stocks  Construction Spending Hits a Record HighIn November 2017  construction spending increased  surpassing expectations  The figure came in at  1 26 trillion  logging an annual growth rate of 2 4   Such strength in spending was the result of increased investments across real estate  commercial and residential projects  Further  spending on private construction remained high and invited gains to the industry To top it all  firms operating in the space are also looking to expand their workforce as evident from unusually high hiring even under dire circumstances  Per the latest data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the construction industry added as many as 30 000 jobs to the U S  economy in December  when parts of the country were ravaged by harsh winters In 2017 alone  the sector added 210 000 jobs  which represented a surge of 35  from 2016  Economists have already stated that such figures are indicative of excellent performance by the space in 2018 Moreover  the ratio which measures the industry optimism over business growth hit a record high  Such optimism is backed primarily by business friendly economic conditions and overall growth  Also  economists have stated that construction in the office market  transportation and retail will see a boom this year Infrastructure Spending to be Beefed UpOptimism regarding growth of the construction industry surged post President Trump s victory as one of his key priorities was infrastructure investment  Although spending on government projects have declined 3 4  year to date  the figure is still close to an increase of 3     the highest monthly gain in three years   that it hit in October 2017  This is courtesy of higher spending at the federal  state and local levels Increased infrastructure spending was the cornerstone of Trump s pesidential campaign  As a matter of fact  he had proposed a  1 trillion infrastructure spending financed by new tax credits to encourage private equity investors  He plans to deploy  200 billion in federal money over the next decade to  incentivize another  800 billion in spending from state and local authorities and private entities  That said  the question on investors  mind is  Will infrastructure spending be increased at all  One can roughly gauge that this might be possible  Efforts made by members of the GOP to push through tax reforms are indicative of their legislative intent  More than anything  it is the repute and the goodwill that President Trump and his team would like to maintain A leaked draft of Trump s infrastructure policy  published on  on Jan 23  2018  clearly mentions that the administration is not keen on building new roads or highways and taking up  unsustainable projects   The administration instead focuses on improving the conditions of the existing roads and highways  The plan also hints at protecting non federally funded utilities within the country  Such statements give a clear indication that the citizens will soon witness the passing of the Infrastructure Spending Bill Fall in Starts a Momentary HiccupThe year started with a disappointing reading for housing starts  Per the Department of Commerce  housing starts declined 8 2  in December   its largest percentage drop since November 2016  However  analysts see such a downturn as temporary  Further  housing possibly felt the chill from December s brutally low temperatures Also  the 2 4  increase in homebuilding to 1 202 million units in 2017 is one important point to be noted  This is the highest level recorded in a decade  Strong economic growth  a robust labor market and tax cuts are continuing to bolster the housing industry Future demand is also likely to remain strong given the shortage in supply of existing homes  Also  homebuilders are not planning more speculative homes  These are units which still do not have a

 5 3   and complementary product sales improved by  20 7    The recent need for roofing repair in the southern states  due to the hurricanes   and increase in both housing starts  and building permits acted as strong tailwinds for the company   To add to the impressive results  management also reported that existing markets same day sales were up by  8 2  in the quarter   Further management announced a 5  to 8  price increase across all product categories due to the swelling demand Management s TakePaul Isabella  President and CEO  commented on the quarterly results  and 2018 outlook by stating   Fiscal 2017 produced a second consecutive year of record sales  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS  In addition  we saw robust operating cash flow generation of approximately  315 million  which is almost a threefold improvement over the prior year  We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance  and even more excited about the future  as monthly sales trends accelerated throughout the quarter and early 2018 visibility is supported by solid re roofing trends and two meaningful storm events  Our residential roofing product line posted its 14th consecutive quarter of sales growth

its options regarding Qdoba restaurants  which included selling the chain outright  Just before the last earnings report it was rumored that JACK had found a buyer  Apollo Global Management LLC  for a price of  300 million   But the poor earnings data  and management writing down the value of Qdoba  put the deal in limbo   Further  after the earnings announcement  management commented that that they would not give guidance for FY 18 until they figured out its plan for Qdoba   This created uncertainty for investors  which caused the stock price to drop Management s TakeAccording to Lenny Comma  Chairman and CEO   Our fourth quarter operating results concluded a challenging year for both brands  Our key initiatives in 2018 will be focused on regaining momentum in a highly competitive environment   We continue to make significant progress on our Jack in the Box refranchising initiative  with the sale of 60 restaurants in the fourth quarter and 178 during the fiscal year  We currently have signed non binding letters of intent with franchisees to sell 32 additional restaurants  and now anticipate the Jack in the Box franchise mix to approach the high end of our previous

2018  reflecting an increase from 2 4  for 2017 and 2 1  for 2018  projected earlier  However  inflation is expected to remain below 2  through the next year  The same is estimated to be approximately

NYSE FCAU   and Xcerra Corporation   NASDAQ XCRA   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 GARP Picks for Investors Based on Discounted PEG RatioA pure play value investor always misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  The same way  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks  In order to make a long term investment more effective  the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP  growth at a reasonable price  approach  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  And here lies the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the growth element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

116918,338433,BECN,Bet On These 4 Retail Stocks For Value   Earnings Growth,opinion," It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price     Warren Buffett 
The strategy is quite simple  find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth  An investment decision based on the intrinsic value of stocks seems feasible in an economy  which recently witnessed a hike in the benchmark interest rate  experienced a massive overhaul in the U S  tax code  registered robust corporate earnings and saw major indexes scaling new highs 
In today s discussion  we are focusing on the  sector  which currently occupies the top 25   4 out of 16  position in the list  But before zeroing on a strategy and looking for lucrative counters to place your bets  let s take a sneak peek into what s going on in the sector 
Changing Retail Dynamics
Retail is no more restricted to brick   mortar  The scenario has drastically changed with the advancement of technology and digital transformation that are playing key roles in changing consumer shopping pattern  Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another  Retailers who have responded quickly to it by staying ahead technologically stand in good stead 
Retailers are now efficiently allocating a large chunk of capital toward multi channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings  and developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers  Further  the retailers are renovating stores  developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery  implementing an enterprise wide inventory management system along with improving relationship with customers 
Retail stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts  The sector has advanced over 30  in a year and has comfortably outperformed the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
The rebound in oil prices from all time lows  fall in the unemployment rate to 17 year low  and improving housing and manufacturing sectors signal that the economy is on a recovery mode  These factors are favorable for retailers  Steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration boost consumer confidence  Although consumer confidence dipped to 122 1 in December from November s revised reading of 128 6  analysts believe that consumers remain optimistic about the economy 
Consequently  adding a few stocks from the space would be a prudent decision at the current juncture  We suggest investing in top ranked stocks with a good Value Score and solid earnings growth potential 
Here s the Ideal Strategy
Investment in stocks based on a diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  Thus  for long term investors  a look at the intrinsic value of a stock is always warranted  So what are the criteria to identify value stocks 
A value stock may have a high dividend yield  low price to book ratio  low price to earnings ratio or a low price to sales ratio  However  it might be difficult for one to look at each parameter and compare with the peer group for an analysis on whether the stock is attractive from the value perspective  To make the task easier  Zacks has designed the new  
The attractiveness of a stock as an investment option is confirmed by its Value Style Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential  Further  we have selected value stocks that have estimated earnings per share growth rate of 10  or more for the current fiscal year

117047,338562,BECN,Fastenal  FAST  Misses Q2 Earnings   Sales  Margins Down,opinion,"Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   reported lower than expected results in the second quarter of 2016  missing estimates for both earnings and sales  Shares declined almost 4  in pre market trading 
Earnings Miss
Adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share in the second quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents by 6 25   Earnings also declined 6 3  year over year due to weak sales and margins Sales Remain Weak
Net sales of  1 01 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 02 billion by 0 8   Sales increased 1 6  year over year 
Net sales at the Canadian business increased about 4  in local currency during the quarter while it was less than 7  increase in the previous quarter  Fires in Western Canada in the month of May hurt sales in the country 
Fastenal s total average daily sales increased 1 6  in the second quarter of 2016  much lower than a 5  increase in the prior year quarter  It was also softer than 1 9  increase reported in the first quarter  Foreign exchange dragged down daily sales growth rate in the quarter by 0 4  while acquisitions added 0 6  to sales 
Fastenal s sales  in the past few quarters  have been affected by price deflation of fastener products  currency headwinds and lack of new products and services  The top line has been adversely impacted by lower sales to manufacturing and construction customers due to overall weakness in the industrial economy 
On a monthly basis  daily sales remained flat in June but increased 3 8  in April and 1 1  in May  The growth rates fell short of 6 1   5 3  and 3 7   respectively  in April  May and June of 2015 
This industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor serves customers in the manufacturing and non residential construction markets 
Daily sales to manufacturing customers  representing almost 50  of revenues  rose 0 7   down from growth of 3 8  in the prior year quarter and 0 9  in the previous quarter 
The daily sales growth rate of fastener products  used mainly for industrial production and accounting for nearly 40  of the company s business  declined 2 4  in the quarter  compared to flat in the year ago quarter and a 1 7  decline recorded in the previous quarter 
Price deflation of fasteners and lower demand from the heavy machinery manufacturing customer base    due to lower production requirements    has been hurting fastener sales 
Non fastener product sales  used mainly for maintenance  increased 4 7   same as last quarter but much less than an increase of 9  in the prior year quarter  Though the non fastener business is doing better than fasteners driven by strong vending trends  it has nonetheless weakened in the last eight quarters due to prevailing weakness in the industrial environment 
In the non residential construction market  daily sales to non residential construction customers  representing 20  to 25  of revenues  declined 1 7  as against a 1 6  increase in the prior year quarter and a decline of 0 4  in the previous quarter  Volatility and softer energy prices impacted sales in this market 
Vending Trends Continue to Improve
As of Jun 30  2016  Fastenal operated 58 346 vending machines  up 15 3  year over year  During the quarter  the company signed 4 869 machine contracts  up 4 8  from the last quarter  The daily sales to customers with industrial vending grew 2 7  year over year  Vending machines now account for 44 6  of the company s sales  higher than 44 5  in the prior quarter 
After remaining soft in 2013  vending trends improved through 2014 and 2015 as well as the first half of 2016  as the management s efforts on enhancing the quality of signings installs paid off
