nothing at all   Investors heading into Tuesday s U S  congressional elections are trying to fathom how best to predict the outcome and profit from it   After two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington  the Democratic Party faces a strong chance of winning control of the U S  House of Representatives in next week s election  with Republicans likely to keep the Senate  These are some of the ideas that analysts  strategists and traders have     BUY ANY DOLLAR DIP  If the greenback drops against other currencies on the election result   Citigroup   NYSE C  says it should be bought   Midterms are less likely to mark a major turning point for USD than some investors fear   Citi analyst Todd Elmer said in a report   There is no strong historical relationship between midterms and the path of the U S  currency  making a Democratic House victory unlikely to thwart the dollar s rally  Citi said     FAANGs COULD FALL ON DIVIDED CONGRESS  One policy initiative that looks viable under a divided Congress is increased regulation of social media companies  said Oliver Pursche  chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York   That is an area where both the Trump administration and Democrats agree   he said   We expect that to occur in 2019   If that happens  shares of Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   which have come under increased pressure this year  could have more downside    BUY CONSTRUCTION STOCKS  Dryden Pence  chief investment officer of Pence Wealth Management in Newport Beach  California  is looking to buy construction related stocks  as he anticipates that an infrastructure bill  one of Trump s agenda items  will come to pass regardless of which party controls Congress   For infrastructure  the most important thing about the election is that it will be over   he said  Among the stocks Pence likes are  United Rentals  Inc  N URI   AECOM  N ACM   Jacobs Engineering Group Inc  N JEC  and Vulcan Materials Co  N VMC     BUY REITS ON DEMOCRATIC WIN  Scott Crowe  chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management  a manager of real assets  said if the Democrats win the House  it likely signals the end of tax cuts or an infrastructure bill for Trump ahead of the 2020 presidential election  If this happens  it would be good news for the 10 year bond yield  and  a lower 10 year bond yield is good news for REITs     BUY MACHINERY STOCKS  Analysts at Stifel see Trump quickly proposing a  Highway Bill  when the House takes office if Democrats win control of the lower chamber That may lead to increased political rancor and Trump may take the high road of  the people s business  by proposing a transportation bill  benefiting  Caterpillar   N CAT  and Deere   Co  N DE     CUT EM FOR RED REPEAT  Those positioning for a further poll shift toward Republicans should be prepared for emerging market weakness  wrote Michael Zezas at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in a research note    The potential for a stronger USD and increased leeway for further trade escalation would likely weigh on emerging markets risk appetite  Already cheap valuations would likely protect parts of

  EXPECT VOLATILITY TO FALL  Some investment strategists are expecting volatility to ease after the U S  midterm elections as the elimination of at least one uncertainty the market is facing right now will give traders less reason to worry regardless of what the outcome is   Parag Thatte  equities strategist at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  in New York says   Our trading desk thinks betting on volatility reducing after the election would be a good trade right now     EXPECT BIOTECH TO FALL      If Democrats take control of the House and Republicans continue to have an edge in the Senate  UBS Wealth Management analysts say that among the areas where the president and Congress could find common ground are drug price controls and infrastructure spending  the former could pressure large

analysts Jon Hill  Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery wrote in a recent note that many of their clients are skeptical of political polls on the congressional elections  That skepticism suggests that current valuations do not fully reflect the polls  expectations and Treasury yields may still move down if Democrats take control of the House of Representatives  The analysts also wrote that a potential error in the polls might not necessarily skew toward Republicans  allowing for the possibility of a bigger Democratic win than is currently projected    DO NOTHING  In our view  investors should avoid

13856,235371,VMC,U S  political gridlock may create investment opportunity,news,"By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors hope the split between Republicans and Democrats controlling the U S  Congress will open up opportunities to pick new winners and losers because some government policies will be harder to predict   Correlations between stocks and sectors were high in the run up to Tuesday s congressional elections  meaning investors have been either dumping or buying all kinds of unrelated stocks at once  Some funds have been damaged in what is a tough market to be a stock picker  Now  with voters giving Democrats control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retaining their Senate majority  fund managers can take opposite sides of various policy bets  These might include whether financials will benefit from deregulation even with stricter House oversight  if healthcare will face more policy proposals aimed at restraining costs  and whether military spending will get caught in a tussle between the two parties   If we are in a generally volatile environment but one that s not overly negative  in other words a choppy market as opposed to a bear market  I think that s an environment where correlations can fall   said Evan Brown  head of macro asset allocation strategy at UBS AG s asset management business   There s potential for sector out performance and under performance as a result of the election   President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was willing to work with Democrats on some policy priorities  Issues that could gather bipartisan support include a package to improve infrastructure  protections against prescription drug price increases and a push to rebalance trade with China  Stocks rallied on Wednesday  but one Cboe S P 500 Implied Correlation Index  ICJ  was down more than 9 percent and another  was flat  Correlations between stocks and sectors bottomed in September but spiked in October  Even more damaging  bonds and stocks moved in tandem  with both down for the month for only the 12th time since the March 2009 dawn of the U S  bull market  MACRO VS MICRO  The October selloff was driven by macroeconomic concerns tied to the U S  Federal Reserve  tariffs and inflation and hit active fund managers badly  U S  large cap active mutual fund managers posted their worst results versus their benchmark since September 2011  according to Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC  data  More conflict in policy decisions could mean those factors drive stocks more than macroeconomic developments   For instance  investors are bidding up sand and gravel suppliers  Martin Marietta Materials Inc   N MLM  and Vulcan Materials Co  N VMC  on the hope that bipartisan support for infrastructure spending can move forward  But ValueWorks LLC founder Charles Lemonides said he is trimming his stake in the stocks as they begin to reflect too much optimism   We think there is a lot of opportunity for people who are willing to do the hard work of investing  which is find individual investments that make sense   said Lemonides  Macro forces might be less relevant than assumed in the short run  The meeting expected at the end of the month between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could yield hopeful words but no firm commitments to resolve trade issues   The U S  Federal Reserve could raise rates as expected in December while striking a tone that keeps markets calm  Both concerns   trade war and monetary policy tightening   may end up being left until 2019  So long as markets focus on more parochial issues instead of trade and monetary policy the implications for stocks could be positive going into next year  investors said   Low correlations between stocks typically also mean lower volatility for the market overall  It was such a benign scenario that helped stocks weather the uncertainty of a new Trump administration in 2017  Of course headlines on trade  monetary policy or an unexpected macro issue could upset the rosy outlook  keeping correlations high  Global earnings and economic growth could peak  Policymakers  even those in the same party  could be so at odds that they make no policy changes  Republicans who have controlled the White House and Congress since January 2017 surprised investors by failing to replace the Affordable Care Act even though it was a campaign promise  That makes oddsmaking hard now on a range of issues  from repealing a medical device tax to passing a budget or loosening regulations on banks  Each event could matter at the sector level  but are not likely to determine the course of the market overall  U S  tariffs in place will start to bite companies and industries  adding new relevance to stock and sector picks  And the aggressive monetary policy response to the 2007 2009 global financial crisis is wearing off  prompting differences between countries and allowing more defensive shares to gain in the United States  where they had once been eclipsed by technology names  Liz Ann Sonders  chief investment strategist for  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW    Co Inc  said a market driven a broader range of stocks could help

13857,235372,VMC,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Trade related headlines are likely to be the main driver of sentiment this week  as markets focus on the next round of trade talks between the U S  and China to see if any more news materializes 
A 90 day trade truce between Washington and Beijing is due to expire on March 1  If the deadline passes without a deal  President Donald Trump has said he could follow through on his threat to increase tariffs on as much as  200 billion worth of Chinese goods 
The week ahead is also peppered with a handful of appearances from Federal Reserve officials  most importantly Chairman Jerome Powell  as investors look for further hints into the outlook for monetary policy in the months ahead 
There is also important U S  consumer price inflation and retail sales data to pay attention to as investors look for further hints on the strength of the economy 
The Fed recently signaled that its three year drive to tighten monetary policy is close to an end due to rising headwinds to the economy 
In earnings  about 60 S P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week  in what will be one of the last big waves of the fourth quarter earnings season 
Meanwhile  political headlines will remain in focus as Trump and congressional lawmakers have until Friday to agree on a budget deal to avert another partial shutdown of the federal government 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  U S  China Trade Talks
A new round of U S  China trade talks begins in Beijing  after the most recent set of negotiations concluded in Washington last week without a deal 
Lower level officials will kick off the meetings on Monday  led on the American side by Deputy U S  Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish 
Higher principal level talks will then take place Thursday and Friday with U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin 
A White House official said on Friday that U S  negotiators are preparing to press China on longstanding demands  including stealing intellectual property and forcing U S  companies to share their technology with Chinese firms 
The two sides are trying to hammer out a deal ahead of the March 1 deadline when U S  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25  from 10  
U S  President Donald Trump said last week he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before that deadline  dampening hopes that a trade pact could be reached quickly 
2  Fed Speakers
A number of Fed speeches will get market attention in the week ahead  as traders watch for further clues on interest rates 
Topping the agenda will be remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell  who will be speaking Tuesday at the Hope Enterprise Corporation Rural Policy Forum  in Mississippi  at 5 45PM ET  22 45 GMT  
Speeches from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman  Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  Kansas City Fed President Esther George  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic  and Philly Fed boss Patrick Harker will also be in focus 
Market expectations for a Fed rate hike this year are hanging by a thread  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  after the U S  central bank last month pledged to be patient with further rate hikes 
3  U S  Inflation
The Commerce Department will publish January CPI figures at 8 30AM ET  13 30 GMT  Wednesday  which should give clearer signs on the pace of inflation 
Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0 1  last month  according to estimates  compared to December s drop of 0 1   On a yearly base  CPI is projected to climb 1 5   down from 1 9  a month earlier 
Excluding the cost of food and fuel  core inflation prices are forecast to have gained 0 2  last month and 2 1  over the prior year 
Weakening inflation will likely add to expectations that the Federal Reserve will need to slow its pace of rate hikes next year 
4  U S  Retail Sales
The Commerce Department will release data on retail sales for December at 8 30AM ET  13 30 GMT  on Thursday  which investors will be eyeing for further signs on the strength of the American consumer 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0 1   after a 0 2  increase in November  Excluding the automobile sector  sales are expected to post a flat reading 
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth  while weaker sales signal a declining economy  Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70  of U S  economic growth 
Also on the economic calendar this week will be producer price inflation figures  a preliminary reading on Michigan consumer sentiment  as well as the latest JOLTS report

13862,235377,VMC,FORTERRA INC  FRTA  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Shares of FORTERRA INC  FRTA  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 23 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  8 79 in the previous session  FORTERRA INC has gained 126 6  since the start of the year compared to the 38 5  move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 34 6  return for the Zacks Building Products   Concrete and Aggregates industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 4  2019  FORTERRA INC reported EPS of  0 34 versus consensus estimate of  0 11 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4 62  
For the current fiscal year  FORTERRA INC is expected to post earnings of   0 42 per share on  1 5 billion in revenues  This represents a 4 55  change in EPS on a 1 51  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn   0 03 per share on  1 55 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 92 86  and 3 2   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
FORTERRA INC may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
FORTERRA INC has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  FORTERRA INC currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if FORTERRA INC passes the test  Thus  it seems as though FORTERRA INC shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does FORTERRA INC Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of FORTERRA INC have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Anhui Conch Cement  AHCHY   Eagle Materials  EXP   and Vulcan Materials  VMC   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 34  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for FORTERRA INC  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-11-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/forterra-inc-frta-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200482273,200482273

13879,235394,VMC,Concrete   Aggregates Industry Appears To Be In Good Shape,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of manufacturers  distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates  concrete  and other such items  The materials also include gypsum wallboard  recycled paperboard  concrete blocks  ready mix concrete and oil and gas proppants Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is poised to benefit from robust construction spending on government projects  The industry is also likely to benefit from growth in public sector construction activity   mainly in large transportation projects and contract work for highways   as well as strong pricing  Public outlays of total U S  construction spending totaled  214 3 billion in the first eight months of 2019  reflecting an increase of 5 7  year over year  Notable gains in commercial  amusement and recreation  and conservation and development have also been the bright spots  Meanwhile  the housing market  which has borne the brunt of rising interests mortgage rates and higher raw material costs since the end of 2017  has regained its momentum  buoyed by declining mortgage rates trend  The industry players are expected to reap the benefits of solid household formation attributable to declining mortgage interest rates  steady economic growth and favorable demographics  The housing market rebound and Trump s impetus to enhance the country s infrastructure by upgrading highways  railroads  bridges and broadband are expected to be key catalysts for the industry  The industry participants follow a well chalked out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios  Meanwhile  companies are increasingly focusing on the pricing of products to offset higher input and freight expenses  The focus is also on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flow  However  the industry players are plagued with shortage of skilled laborers  rising wage costs and increasing material and transportation expenses  The companies use electricity  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based resources  Hence  supply related woes and significant fluctuation in prices of these resources affect operating results  The businesses are also exposed to weather related risks that affect production schedules and hence profitability  Excessive rainfall  flooding or severe drought jeopardize shipments and production  The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter  Again  hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are the most active during the third and fourth quarters  These impediments may continue to bump up costs and mar profits of the industry participants Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates industry is a 12 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  37  which places it in the top 15  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s Zacks Industry Rank  which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outperforms Sector   S P 500The Zacks Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 7 3  versus the broader sector s growth of 5 7   Meanwhile  the S P 500 has lost 0 9  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates stocks  the industry is currently trading at 20 5X versus the S P 500 s 16 3X and the sector s 14 3X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 39 4X  as low as 12 9X and at the median of 20 5X  as the chart below shows Industry s P E Ratio  Forward 12 Month  Versus S P 500 Bottom LineIndeed  weather related woes  higher labor  freight and material costs are eating into margins of industry players  Nonetheless  a significant boost in infrastructural and construction spending should continue to favor the industry Below we present two stocks from the Zacks Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates space that carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see the complete

13896,235411,VMC,Winning Stock Strategies For 2H ,opinion,"The first half of the year 2019 may have been great for Wall Street  but volatility is looming none the less  First  a permanent solution to the ongoing U S  China trade crisis is not in sight right now  Then  global growth worries are there to unsettle the market s momentum  Finally  geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are lurking to rattle investors  mood occasionally 
Shoving such concerns aside  the S P 500 posted the best first half in 22 years  logging 17 3  gains  No wonder  U S  stocks are pricey  So  one has to hone in on value  dividends and quality in order to rule in the second half  However  on the positive side  we have the resumption of U S  China trade talks and the extension of the OPEC output cut deal  A dovish Fed as well as accommodative ECB and the Bank of Japan could also propel a rally 
Against this backdrop  below we highlight a few stock strategies that are likely to win in the second half 
Bet Big on Quality Stocks
Quality ETFs are relatively safe and can help investors fight the looming economic slowdown  To find out the top players in this space  we have picked stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   return on equity  ROE  of at least 10   debt to equity ratio of less than 1  positive five year historical EPS growth  double digit  current year EPS growth and P E less than 18  Based on the above mentioned criteria  one can rely on Shoe Carnival  NYSE CCL  Inc    NASDAQ SCVL    Herman Miller Inc    SYNNEX Corporation   NYSE SNX   and Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO   
Delve Into Dividend Yields
Dividends or regular current income could save investors even if there is any capital loss  So  one can bank on these high momentum dividend oriented stocks  For that  one can bet on Southern Company   NYSE SO    yields 4 50  annually   BHP Billiton  LON BHPB  Limited   NYSE BHP    yields 4 14    Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB    yields 5 15   and Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB    yields 5    These top ranked stocks added at least 3  in the past 12 weeks 
Dividend Growth Stocks  Another Winning Proposition 
Dividend aristocrats are the dividend paying companies  which have a long history of raising dividend payments year over year  These provide hedge against economic uncertainty and are high quality in nature  In this regard  investors may choose to place their bets on stocks that have a solid dividend growth history 
Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC    last 5 year dividend growth rate of 45 69    Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN    growth rate is 45 16    Children s Place Inc    growth rate of 41 91   and CoreSite Realty Corporation   growth rate 31 59   could hit your Wishlist  All these stocks have a top Zacks Rank    
Most Sectors to Reel in Q2 Earnings Season  Bet on Exceptions
Second quarter earnings season is going to start in two weeks and the S P 500 earnings is expecting a 3  year over year decline on 4 3  gains in revenues  Among the struggling sectors  a few show promises 
Consumer Discretionary sector is expected to post 0 9  gains in earnings on a 12 8  revenue jump  Also  the second half of the year is loaded with celebrations like Thanksgiving and Christmas  which give discretionary stocks a boost  Guess Inc    Weight Watchers International Inc   Rent A Center Inc    NASDAQ RCII   and Crocs Inc     are the picks here 
Business Services sector is expected to log 2 9  earnings growth on 2 8  revenue expansion  Tessera Holding Corporation   NASDAQ XPER   is a good top ranked pick here 
Trade War or Not  Play Large Cap Stocks 
Small caps are reeling under pressure  Despite renewed tariff tensions in the second quarter  the benchmark Russell 2000 index of small companies underperformed the S P 500  the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq 
The Russell 2000 is up about 17  year to date  still more than 8  below the record highs it reached in August 2018  On the other hand  the large cap S P 500 is hovering around record highs  Margin pressure is weighing on the small cap segment   that small caps will post EBITDA growth of 2  this year  down from its estimate of 5 5  growth earlier this year 
Against this backdrop  investors can tap large cap stocks like United Continental Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ UAL    D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   and Cummins Inc    NYSE CMI    These stocks are top ranked and also boast lower P E than the S P 500 
Looking to Low Priced Stocks  Here are Your Top Options
As investors poured in a lot of money to make the most of the first half rally  they may have run out of cash  Obviously  many must be on the lookout for stocks that are still trading below  20 but have reasons to outperform in the days ahead 
Here are your picks  JetBlue Airways    last traded price  18 79   Myers Industries Inc    last traded price  19 00   and Builders FirstSource Inc    NASDAQ BLDR    last traded price  16 98

13897,235412,VMC,Vulcan Materials  VMC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Vulcan Materials  VMC  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 31 billion  up 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 41  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vulcan 
For Vulcan  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vulcan will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vulcan would post earnings of  0 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 46  delivering a surprise of  39 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Vulcan doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vulcan-materials-vmc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200441350,200441350
13898,235413,VMC,Operational Efficiencies To Aid Vulcan s  VMC  Q2 Earnings,opinion,Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC   is slated to release second quarter 2019 results on Jul 25  before the opening bell  In the last reported quarter  the company reported adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share and revenues of  996 5 million  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 39 4  and 9 5   respectively Not only its top and bottom lines surpassed analysts  expectation  but also the metrics increased year over year on the back of broad based shipment growth  price improvements and operating efficiencies in the aggregates business  Robust growth in public construction demand and continued improvement in private demand added to the positives  We believe that these factors are likely to aid the company s second quarter results as well Notably  the stock has a strong record of earnings surprises  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the trailing seven quarters How are Estimates Faring in Q2 Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter to be reported has been revised downward by 2  to  1 45 over the past seven days  Nonetheless  this indicates an increase of 17 9  from the year ago quarter  The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 31 billion  up 8 8  year over year Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS Surprise   Factors That Might Influence Upcoming ResultsDuring the quarter  Vulcan is likely to have benefitted from ongoing efforts to enhance operational excellence  The company s earnings in second quarter 2019 are likely to gain from improvement in gross profit  Also  it expects top line improvement in the quarter  given significant growth in demand and shipment Vulcan s Aggregates business  including crushed stone  sand and gravel  and sand and other aggregates   which contributed 83 8  to total first quarter 2019 revenues  is one of the major growth drivers  The company s strong aggregate shipments and pricing  underpinned by growing public demand and operational discipline  will aid the company to post higher revenues in the second quarter In addition to strong demand  public sector spending   which is less affected by general economic cycles and is deemed much more stable than private sector spending   plays a significant role in Vulcan s overall business  These tailwinds are likely to help the company post improved results in the to be reported quarter Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aggregates segment sales is pegged at  1 040 million  suggesting an increase from  956 million a year ago and a surge from  835 million in the last reported quarter  Aggregate shipments are expected to be 57 041 units  indicating an increase from 54 957 units reported in the prior year quarter  Also  freight adjusted average sales price for aggregates is likely to be  14 04  up from  13 77 sequentially and  13 29 year over year However  Vulcan may bear the brunt of unfavorable weather in second quarter 2019  This may in turn have a negative impact on the company s overall performance  Difficult weather conditions in geographies like West  i e  California  and Midwest are likely to affect the company s top line growth  as its business is reliant on outdoor construction activity  Also  higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs have been a pressing concern Nevertheless  its focus on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency is supposed to have more than offset the negative factors  In the past year  the company managed to exhibit solid performances even when diesel costs increased 25  and liquid asphalt expenses rose 32  year over year  This trend is likely to continue in the to be reported quarter Projections of Other SegmentsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues for the asphalt segment is pegged  233 million  which implies 9  year over year growth  The  Concrete segment revenues are projected to improve 7  year over year to  115 million in the to be reported quarter  Calcium segment revenues are likely to increase to  2 34 million from  2 28 million a year ago Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model does not show that Vulcan is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to be reported quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can see  The company has an Earnings ESP of  1 73  and a Zacks Rank  3  which does not make us confident of an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  It is to be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a few construction stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases Arcosa  Inc    NYSE ACA   has an Earnings ESP of  15 22  and a Zacks Rank  2 M D C  Holdings  Inc    NYSE MDC   has an Earnings ESP of  2 68  and holds a Zacks Rank  1

13900,235415,VMC,Martin Marietta  MLM  Gains From Higher Shipments   Pricing,opinion,Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM   has been benefiting from higher shipments  acquisitions  strong pricing and cost management efforts Shares of this leading supplier of construction aggregates in the United States have outperformed its industry in the year to date period  The stock  which shares space with Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC    Eagle Materials Inc    NYSE EXP   and Summit Materials  Inc    NYSE SUM   in the Zacks  industry  has gained 34 2  compared with its industry s 24 8  growth in the said period  The price performance is backed by the company s earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 38 7  Earnings estimates for 2019 have increased 3 1  over the past 60 days  reflecting analysts  optimism surrounding its bottom line growth prospects  Let s delve deeper into the factors that substantiate its Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can also see  Key Growth DriversMartin Marietta has been benefiting from higher aggregate shipments  Precisely  aggregate shipments to the non residential market  representing 37  of first quarter 2019 aggregate shipments  increased 33  from the year ago level  driven by both commercial and heavy industrial construction activity  The Architectural Billings Index and Dodge Momentum Index suggest commercial and institutional construction activity to remain healthy throughout 2019  The company expects large energy sector projects  particularly along the Gulf Coast  to continue driving growth and boosting aggregates demand over the next several years Residential construction  which accounted for 23  of first quarter heritage aggregate shipments  should continue to grow within its geographic footprint  particularly now  as mortgage rates have been stabilizing  Despite the recent slowdown in housing unit starts at the national level  the residential outlook across Martin Marietta s geographic footprint remains positive  backed by favorable demographics  job growth  land availability  steady interest rates and deficient permitting Given robust construction activity scenario  the company s shipment volume and pricing have been improving across the majority of the building materials business  In the first quarter of 2019  Martin Marietta s heritage aggregates  pricing and shipments improved 4  and 12 5   respectively  from the prior year period  Moreover  pricing and shipments  including acquisitions and divestitures  increased 2 3  and 24 2   respectively  on a year over year basis  Also  consolidated gross margin improved 140 basis points  bps  to 15 2   Its earnings from operations and adjusted EBITDA jumped 77 1  and 28 2   respectively  from the year ago level To bolster the company s strong presence across the world  it keeps on investing in new businesses to expand geographic footprint and market share  The company completed more than 90 smaller acquisitions since its Initial Public Offering in 1994 till 2018  which allowed it to enhance and expand aggregates led presence in the building materials marketplace  The most recent and notable one is the Bluegrass acquisition in April 2018  The addition of Bluegrass strengthened Martin Marietta s aggregates position in high growth regions of Southeastern and Mid Atlantic Overall  the company s string of acquisitions  and an uptick in private and public construction activity will drive Martin Marietta s growth  The company has solid growth prospects  as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings of  9 26 per share  which indicates 14 5  year over year improvement on 8 4  revenue growth  Moreover  its earnings are expected to increase 14 9  on 7 1  top line growth in 2020 That said  weather related challenges in many markets are affecting Martin Marietta  All of the company s businesses are subjected to weather related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability  Within downstream businesses  ready mix concrete shipments decreased 4  year over year in the first quarter of 2019 as Colorado s harsh winter hindered early construction activity  The Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days due to extreme winter weather that

13918,235433,VMC,RPM International  RPM  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s Up ,opinion,RPM International Inc    NYSE RPM   is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2019 results on Apr 4  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21 2  and 2 2   respectively  In fact  RPM International missed the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters  with average negative earnings surprise of 22 7  Not only its earnings lagged the consensus mark  but also the bottom line declined 8 8  year over year  However  net sales increased 3 6   mainly attributable to strong organic growth of 3  and acquisition growth of 2 6   However  strong sales growth continues to be offset by rising raw material costs  In addition  freight  labor and energy costs  along with the adverse effect of transactional foreign exchange added to the woes How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at 11 cents  remaining unchanged over the past 60 days  This reflects a decrease of 47 6  from the year ago earnings of 21 cents per share  Revenues  however  are expected to be  1 14 billion  up 3 2  year over year Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key FactorsA challenging raw material environment has been pressurizing the company s margins and eventually the bottom line over the last few quarters  Gross and operating margins contracted 210 basis points  bps  and 410 bps  respectively  during first half fiscal 2019  owing to the above mentioned headwind  Particularly  the cost of silicones  asphalt  epoxy and acrylic resins is increasing significantly Resultantly  the company s adjusted earnings declined 10 5  year over year during the said period  In addition  freight  labor and energy costs  along with the adverse effects of foreign currency translation added to the woes RPM International anticipates these trends to persist in the fiscal third quarter as well  It anticipates lower earnings for the fiscal third quarter due to raw material cost challenges and three non operating items  To be more precise  the company projects tax rate of approximately 26   a negative impact from unrealized gains  losses on equity securities of  5  6 million and the absence of long term incentive compensation during the said quarter  Resultantly  for the fiscal third quarter  its earnings are expected in the range of 10 12 cents per share  lower than the year ago level of 21 cents That said  the company has been aggressively pursuing price increases to offset the increasing material prices and protect gross profit margins  Price increases introduced late first quarter 2019 helped the company mitigate margin erosion in the consumer segment in the fiscal second quarter  The company anticipates a slow improvement between its raw material costs and pricing and product mix for the rest of fiscal 2019 Meanwhile  RPM International s cost saving initiatives bode well for bottom line performance  Notably  the company s multi year restructuring plan  the 2020 Margin Acceleration Plan   2020 MAP to Growth    helped it maintain a balance between its segments  performance and drive growth During fiscal second quarter 2019  the company reduced 149 positions and announced the closure of five manufacturing facilities  It aims to realign some of its global brands and make changes to its leadership structure  These efforts are expected to significantly boost operating margin  It remains focused on its previously set target of 540 bps improvement in operating margin  All activities under the company s 2020 MAP to Growth plan are anticipated to be completed by the end of the calendar year 2020 Segment wise  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial segment revenues  accounting for more than 52 7  of its total revenues  is pegged at  578 million  indicating an uptick from  569 million recorded in the year ago period but a decline from  718 million in the last reported quarter The consensus estimate for Specialty segment s revenues is pegged at  176 million  reflecting a year over year improvement of 3 5  but a sequential decline of 17  Consumer segment revenues are estimated to be  379 million  reflecting an increase from  363 million in the year ago period but a decline from  433 million in the last reported quarter RPM International Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not suggest that RPM International is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for the company is 0 00  as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 11 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  RPM International currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Note that we

13919,235434,VMC,Analysts Estimate Vulcan Materials  VMC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Vulcan Materials  VMC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  909 97 million  up 6 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 11  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vulcan 
For Vulcan  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 29  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vulcan will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vulcan would post earnings of  0 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 99  delivering a surprise of  13 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

13922,235437,VMC,Acuity Brands  AYI  To Post Q2 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Acuity Brands  Inc    NYSE AYI   is slated to announce second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Apr 3  before the opening bell The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7 4  in the last reported quarter  In fact  the company reported positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters  with the average beat being 1 9  In the last reported quarter  earnings increased 19 6  on a year over year basis  backed by solid top line growth  up 10 7   of the company  The positive results were mainly driven by higher demand for small and medium sized lighting solutions  along with growth of its building management solutions How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been downwardly revised by 1 1  over the past seven days to  1 79 per share  This reflects a decrease of 5 3  from year ago earnings of  1 89 per share  Revenues  however  are expected to increase 5 5  year over year to  878 2 million Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayHigher input cost of electronic and certain oil based components  along with freight and commodity related items  particularly steel prices  will likely impact the company s margins in the to be reported quarter  Higher level of employee related costs further added to the woes  The company s gross and operating margins have suffered in fiscal first quarter 2019  owing to the above mentioned headwinds  Adjusted gross margin declined nearly 200 basis points  bps  and adjusted operating margin contracted 170 bps in the said quarter The fiscal second quarter is seasonally the weakest revenue quarter for Acuity Brands  The lighting industry is witnessing weak demand in the North American market over the last few quarters  Management does not expect a meaningful rebound in the demand for luminaries in the near term  Despite reporting better than expected results in first quarter fiscal 2019  the company remains  cautiously optimistic for fiscal 2019  as it has been a little apprehensive about the overall growth rate of the construction market for the fiscal year  Further  continued product substitutions to lower priced alternatives and labor shortages in certain markets added to the woes That said  Acuity Brands is poised to benefit from its diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy efficient luminaries  Notably  net sales growth of 11  in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was robust and primarily driven by volume growth in its Contractor Select portfolio  Atrius enabled luminaires  and Holophane solutions Again  its inorganic moves bode well  Acuity Brands is expanding its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures  Acquisitions  net of divestitures  added 1  to its total revenues in the fiscal first quarter What Our Model IndicatesAcuity Brands does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   to increase the odds of an earnings beat Earnings ESP  The company s Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 60   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Currently  Acuity Brands carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which further decreases the predictive power of ESP Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions You can see  Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the construction sector  which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarterly reports KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR   has an Earnings ESP of  5 59  and carries a Zacks Rank  3 Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM   has an Earnings ESP of  53 94  and holds a Zacks Rank  3 Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC   has an Earnings ESP of  0 80  and carries a Zacks Rank  3 Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the

13939,235454,VMC,Vulcan  VMC  Rides On Strong Aggregates Demand  Costs Rise,opinion,Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC   is riding on higher aggregate shipments  strong pricing  cost saving initiatives and strategic acquisitions However  rising diesel and liquid asphalt costs  along with seasonal influences on construction activity are likely to weigh on the company s performance Meanwhile  shares of Vulcan have outperformed its  and the S P 500 composite in the past three months  Its shares have gained 23 6  compared with the industry s 17 1  growth and the S P 500 s 17 7  rally in the same time frame Let s delve deeper into the factors substantiating its Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Catalysts Driving GrowthBased in New Jersey  Vulcan is one of the nation s largest producers of construction aggregates  The company s Aggregates business  including crushed stone  sand and gravel  and sand and other aggregates   contributing 80 2  to total revenues in 2018  is one of the major growth drivers for the company Over the past few quarters  the company has been experiencing strong aggregate shipments and pricing  backed by growing public demand and operational discipline  In 2018  its aggregate sales increased 13  from a year ago to  3 513 6 million  Shipments  volumes  were up 10  year over year  6  on a same store basis  and mix adjusted price increased 3 5   led by double digit growth in Alabama  Arizona  Florida  Illinois  Tennessee and Texas  Notably  total revenues grew 13  on a year over year basis to  4 382 9 million in 2018 Vulcan projects aggregate shipments to rise 3 5  year over year in 2019  Also  aggregates freight adjusted price is expected to increase 5 7  from a year ago Meanwhile  increased construction spending in the United States in recent times is a pure bliss for Vulcan  Precisely  public sector construction spending  representing 45 55  of total aggregate shipments  is quite stable compared with the private sector  as it is less affected by general economic cycles  The company is witnessing strong public sector demand  courtesy of Trump s impetus to fix America s infrastructure over the next 10 years Again  the company focuses on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across the organization in order to generate higher earnings and cash flow  Strong local operating disciplines  production efficiency and a commitment to improve on a regular basis have led to considerable cost savings for Vulcan  Notably  in 2018  its selling  administrative and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  improved 75 basis points  Adjusted EBITDA increased 15 3  from a year ago in the same period Notably  the company anticipates double digit earnings growth in 2019  backed by continued strength in public and private construction demand  Per the consensus estimate  adjusted earnings is currently pegged at  4 78 per share for 2019  reflecting 18  year over year growth Vulcan followed a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt on acquisitions that significantly contributed to growth  In 2018  the company closed four acquisitions for a total consideration of  219 9 million Factors Affecting Vulcan s ProfitabilityVulcan is experiencing higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs over the last few quarters  Diesel expenses increased 25  and liquid asphalt costs grew 32  year over year in 2018  Asphalt gross profit declined 38 5  year over year  as higher liquid asphalt costs negatively affected segmental earnings by  54 million  The company uses large amounts of electricity  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based resources  subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation  Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could weigh on its operating costs and profitability going forward Moreover  the company is prone to bad weather conditions  as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry  Also  the company s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors  Inclement weather affects its ability to produce and distribute products  in turn impacting demand Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector include Arcosa  Inc    NYSE ACA    Armstrong World Industries  Inc    NYSE AWI   and Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST

13942,235457,VMC,Bleak Near Term Prospects For Concrete   Aggregates Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of manufacturer  distributer and seller of construction materials like aggregates  concrete  and other construction materials  The materials also include gypsum wallboard  recycled paperboard  concrete blocks  ready mix concrete and oil and gas proppants Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is poised to benefit from increased construction activity backed by robust construction spending  Construction spending in the United States has ramped up lately  supported by a steady increase in outlays on private as well as public construction projects  Total U S  construction spending advanced 5 1  in the first 10 months of 2018  Precisely  the industry is poised to benefit from the growth in public sector construction activity as well as strong pricing  Large transportation projects and growth in contract work for highways have steadily increased demand  Trump s  1 5 trillion infrastructure plan appears to be the key catalyst to the industry s growth  The industry participants strongly follow a systematic acquisition strategy to enhance domestic and international portfolios  Meanwhile  companies are increasingly focusing on the pricing of products to offset higher input and freight expenses  The focus is also on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flow  However  the industry players are plagued with shortage of skilled laborers  rising wage costs and flaring up material and transportation expenses  The companies use electricity  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based resources  Hence  any supply related woes and significant price fluctuation of these resources affect operating results and profitability  Meanwhile  the companies  businesses are subjected to weather related risks that significantly affect production schedules and profitability  Excessive rainfall  flooding or severe drought jeopardize shipments  production and profitability in the markets served by the companies  The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter  Again  hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast is most active during the third and fourth quarters  These impediments may continue to aggravate costs and mar profits of the industry participants in the near future Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates industry is an eight stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  236  which places it at the bottom 9  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group s earnings growth potential  Since June 2018  the industry s earnings estimate for 2018 and 2019 has gone down approximately 17 4  and 16   respectively Despite the bleak near term industry prospects  we present a few stocks that you can keep an eye on or continue to hold if they are already in your portfolio  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates industry has lagged the broader Zacks Construction Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 31 6  over this period compared with the S P 500 s decline of 6 7  and the broader sector s decrease of 27  One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing heavy construction stocks  the industry is currently trading at 14 2X versus the S P 500 s 15 7X and the sector s 11 4X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 64 7X  as low as 13 4X and at the median of 23 1X  as the chart below shows Industry s P E Ratio  Forward 12 Month  Versus S P 500BottomlineA significant boost in infrastructural and construction spending should continue to

expansion efforts and cost saving initiatives  In fact  earnings estimates have been revised upward over the past few weeks  suggesting that sentiments on Vulcan Materials are moving in the right direction  Earnings estimates for the current year have increased by 0 5  over the past 30 days  reflecting analysts  optimism surrounding the stock s earnings prospects  Shares of the company have also outperformed its industry in the past three months On the flipside  bad weather and higher costs remain threats  Although shares of the company outperformed its  it declined 14  in the past three months   Let s delve deeper into the factors that are likely to drive growth Factors Driving GrowthVulcan Materials  the nation s largest producer of construction aggregates  has been witnessing strong aggregate shipments and pricing underpinned by growing public demand and operational discipline  Notably  aggregate shipments  volumes  were up 10  year over year  6  on a same store basis  in third quarter 2018  The company projects mid single digit aggregates volume price growth in 2019  Thus  we are optimistic about pricing and volume growth in the months ahead  Total revenues of  1 24 billion in the third quarter increased 13  from the prior year quarter  The bottom line also increased about 34 6  on a year over year basis in the quarter Moreover  public sector construction is

construction demand while private consumer demand in Vulcan served markets has been recovering steadily Meanwhile  the company follows a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt on acquisitions that contributed significantly to its growth  Notably  it closed acquisitions totaling  226 million in 2017  During the first nine months of 2018  the company closed three acquisitions  including aggregates and asphalt operations  complementing its existing positions in Alabama and Texas Moreover  the company s focus on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across the organization is likely to generate higher earnings and cash flow  In fact  strong local operating disciplines  production efficiency and a commitment to continuous improvement led to considerable cost savings for the company ConcernsVulcan Materials  susceptibility to bad weather  trimmed guidance and higher costs are the major concerns affecting the company s performance Since its products are used outdoors in public or private construction work  demand gets affected due to extreme weather  Moreover  the company s production and distribution facilities are located outdoor  which affect its ability to produce and distribute products In fact  many of the company s markets  North Carolina and Virginia  were impacted by Hurricane Florence along with extremely wet weather in September  in most Texas markets  during the third quarter of 2018  These weather related woes impacted quarterly earnings by approximately  27 million Reflective of these  the company trimmed its EPS guidance for 2018 to  3 85  3 95 from  4 00  4 65 mentioned earlier  Although the company has stated that this extreme bad weather is a short term disruption and not expected to have a long term impact on its underlying demand and pricing  we wait for better visibility Moreover  the company is experiencing higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs  During the third quarter of 2018  margin improvement was dampened by a 28  increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel and weather related operating inefficiencies Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderVulcan Materials

13945,235460,VMC,Vulcan Materials  VMC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Vulcan Materials  VMC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction materials company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 08 billion  up 10 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vulcan 
For Vulcan  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 63  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vulcan will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vulcan would post earnings of  1 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 40  delivering a surprise of  2 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Vulcan doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vulcan-materials-vmc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200385046,200385046
13946,235461,VMC,Vulcan  VMC  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC   is set to release fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 14  before the opening bell  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 9  and 1 5   respectively  In fact  the stock has a strong record of earnings surprises  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing seven quarters Meanwhile  in the third quarter  the nation s largest producer of construction aggregates  top and bottom lines grew 14 6  and 34 6   respectively  given above average increase in demand across the markets served by the company How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 87 cents  trending downward from 92 cents over the past 60 days  Nonetheless  this reflects a gain of 17 6  from 74 cents reported in the year ago quarter  Revenues are expected to be  1 08 billion  up 10 2  year over year Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS Surprise    Factors That Might Influence Upcoming ResultsExtreme weather conditions have been an issue for the most part of 2018 and are likely to have remained a headwind in the fourth quarter as well  Texas experienced abnormally wet weather in 2018  which is likely to impact the upcoming results  Subsequently  the company reduced 2018 adjusted EBITDA and EPS expectations Meanwhile  slow housing market as a result of rising mortgage rates and higher home prices is expected to impact the company s top line to some extent That said  this recent housing slowdown is expected to be insulated with higher public infrastructure  The company has been witnessing strong aggregate shipments and pricing  underpinned by growing public demand and operational discipline  Notably  publicly funded construction accounts for significant part  approximately 45 55   of Vulcan s total aggregate shipments Its systematic inorganic strategy for expansion bodes well  The company strengthened its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures  which are expected to drive growth in the quarter to be reported Aggregate shipments  volumes  were up 10  year over year  6  on a same store basis  in the third quarter  reflecting solid underlying demand  except in a few markets that were impacted by severe weather  Despite weather related woes in key markets and a 28  increase in diesel cost per gallon  Aggregates segment s gross profit was up 18  year over year in the quarter For the fourth quarter  Vulcan anticipates shipment growth to be in line with the third quarter level along with an increase in pricing  It also expects aggregates  unit profitability to continue improving Coming to its segments  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aggregates segment sales  accounting for 73  of the total revenues  is pegged at  869 million  reflecting an increase from  770 million a year ago but a decrease from  984 million in the last reported quarter  Also  for the fourth quarter  revenues are likely to grow 14 3  year over year but decline 20 7  sequentially to  184 million for the asphalt segment  Concrete segment revenues are projected to rise 4 6  year over year and 10 8  sequentially to  113 million in the to be reported quarter  Also  Calcium segment revenues are likely to be up 7 8  year over year and 8 4  sequentially to  2 07 million Meanwhile  the company uses large amounts of electricity  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based resources as raw materials  Currently  apart from rising transportation costs  the company is experiencing higher diesel and liquid asphalt expenses  During the third quarter of 2018  margin improvement was dampened by a 28  increase in the unit cost of diesel fuel and weather related operating inefficiencies  Again  asphalt gross profit margin declined 390 basis points year over year  as a 29  increase in unit cost of liquid asphalt more than offset the benefits of favorable pricing and volumes Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model does not show that Vulcan is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to be reported quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 63  and a Zacks Rank  3  which does not make us confident of an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter  It is to be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a few construction stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM   has an Earnings ESP of  2

13955,235470,VMC,Bright Near Term Outlook For Concrete   Aggregates Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of manufacturers  distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates  concrete  and other such items  The materials also include gypsum wallboard  recycled paperboard  concrete blocks  ready mix concrete and oil and gas proppants Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is poised to benefit from increased construction activity backed by robust construction spending  Spending on construction in the United States has ramped up lately on a steady increase in outlays on private as well as public construction projects  Public outlays of total U S  construction spending totaled  62 2 billion in the first three months of 2019  reflecting an increase of 9 2  year over year  Meanwhile  total construction spending during the period was almost unchanged year over year  Precisely  the industry is poised to benefit from growth in public sector construction activity as well as strong pricing  Large transportation projects and increased contract work for highways have boosted demand  Recently  Trump agreed to pursue a  2 trillion infrastructure plan to upgrade the nation s highways  railroads  bridges and broadband  This is expected to prove as a key catalyst for the industry  The industry participants strongly follow a well chalked out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios  Meanwhile  companies are increasingly focusing on the pricing of products to offset higher input and freight expenses  The focus is also on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flow  However  the industry players are plagued with shortage of skilled laborers  rising wage costs and increasing material and transportation expenses  The companies use electricity  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based resources  Hence  supply related woes and significant fluctuation in prices of these resources affect operating results  The businesses are also exposed to weather related risks that affect production schedules and hence profitability  Excessive rainfall  flooding or severe drought jeopardize shipments and production  The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter  Again  hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are the most active during the third and fourth quarters  These impediments may continue to bump up costs and mar profits of the industry participants Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates industry is a 11 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  83  which places it at the top 32  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates industry has lagged the broader Zacks Construction sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 13 1  versus the broader sector s decline of 10 6   Meanwhile  the S P 500 has gained 4 3  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products   Concrete   Aggregates stocks  the industry is currently trading at 17 6X versus the S P 500 s 16 5X and the sector s 13 4X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 52 9X  as low as 13 4X and at the median of 21 9X  as the chart below shows Industry s P E Ratio  Forward 12 Month  Versus S P 500  Bottom LineIndeed  weather related woes  higher labor  freight and material costs are eating into margins of the industry players  Nonetheless  a significant boost in infrastructural and construction spending should continue to favor the industry Below we

13966,235481,VMC,Midterm Elections  Gridlock Was Best Outcome For Stocks,opinion,"Celebrated value investor Benjamin Graham  who mentored a young Warren Buffett  liked to say that the market is a voting machine in the short term  a weighing machine in the long term  Last week the market voted to reward stocks in the aftermath of the midterm elections  which gave Democrats control of the House and left the Senate in the hands of Republicans  This all but guarantees that gridlock will be the status quo in Washington  at least for the next two years 
A divided Congress might very well be the only time gridlock is a positive  Corporate gridlock can hold a company back from growing  and there s not a soul alive who enjoys sitting in bumper to bumper traffic  The congestion in Austin  just north of our headquarters  is legendary  costing commuters as much as 43 hours a year   This congestion could be improved with better infrastructure  which I ll get to in a second  
The truth is that markets favor divided government  Both Republican and Democratic presidents have had the greatest effects on stocks when Congress was split and gridlock prevailed  according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  data  Granted  such leadership makeups are rare  occurring for only a combined 11 years in the past 90  so I ll be curious to see if the trend holds true 

But in the short term  markets showed a lot of enthusiasm  The S P 500 Index advanced more than 2 percent on Wednesday  marking the best post midterm rally since 1982  Stocks got slammed only after the Federal Reserve announced more rate hikes were forthcoming 
I want to remind you that we ve already entered the three most bullish quarters for stocks in the four year presidential cycle  Average returns in the fourth quarter of year two have historically been 4 percent  followed by 5 2 percent in the first quarter of year three and 3 6 percent in the second quarter 
Record Votes  Record Campaign Spending
Voter turnout was abnormally high for a midterm election  Here in Texas  nearly 53 percent of registered voters cast ballots a very strong showing thanks in large part to the much publicized and heavily funded Senate race between Senator Ted Cruz and Congressman Beto O Rourke 
Indeed  a whole lot of cash passed hands this cycle  For the first time in U S  history  more than  5 billion was spent during a midterm election by candidates  political parties and other groups  according to the Center for Responsive Politics  CRP   That s up almost 40 percent from spending levels in 2014  The biggest independent donor was billionaire Sheldon Adelson  founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands  and wife Miriam  who shelled out more than  113 million in support of Republican candidates 

Because it s such a massive amount  it might help to put  5 2 billion into perspective  An estimated 113 million Americans participated in the midterm election  a new record  meaning roughly  46 was spent on each voter 
Here s another way to look at it  Between the House and Senate  470 seats were up for grabs  That comes out to an incredible  11 million per seat 
Big Winners  Infrastructure And Cannabis
Like every election cycle  this one is sure to have some huge consequences not least of which is House Democrats  pledge to turn up the heat on President Donald Trump  Representatives Maxine Waters  Adam Schiff  Elijah Cummings and other staunch critics of the president are expected to lead key oversight and intelligence committees that could open investigations into Trump s finances and handling of White House personnel changes as soon as this January 
My hope is that Democrats and the president can agree to come together on areas of common interest  That includes infrastructure  Remember the  1 trillion infrastructure plan  Remember  Infrastructure Week   It s possible we could finally see a spending bill of some kind  as both the Democrats and Trump support the idea  This would be a massive tailwind for raw materials  commodities and energy 
Materials and construction services stocks including Vulcan Materials  NYSE VMC   Martin Marietta Materials  NYSE MLM   Quanta Services  NYSE PWR  and AECOM jumped in response to the election outcome 

As I ve shared with you before  U S  infrastructure is badly in need of a spit shine  Last year  the American Society of Civil Engineers  ASCE  gave the country s roads  bridges and waterways a D  while noting that there s a  2 trillion infrastructure funding gap between now and 2025  Because this affects all Americans  it shouldn t be turned into a partisan issue 
Another winner last week was the U S  cannabis industry  which is expected to be worth some  75 billion by 2030  according to Cowen   Co   Michigan voted to legalize recreational marijuana  the 10th state to do so  while Missouri and Utah voters approved medical marijuana  Pot stocks  led by Canadian grower and distributor Tilray  surged on the news 
Tilray jumped nearly 6 percent last Tuesday  another 30 percent on Wednesday following the ouster of now former Attorney General Jeff Sessions  As the head of the Department of Justice  Sessions strongly opposed legalization  Industry advocates hope the next permanent AG will be more open to relaxing federal law 
Oil Notched A 10th Straight Day Of Losses
As recently as last month  it didn t look as if anything could stop oil from heading even higher  Friday  however  marked the 10th straight day of losses for West Texas Intermediate  WTI   as inventories continue to build and the U S   Russia and Saudi Arabia produce at record or near record levels 

Down more than 20 percent from its recent high of  76 in early October  oil was trading below  60 a barrel friday and is now considered to be in a bear market 
Although bad news for producers and refiners  lower oil prices are good for nearly everyone else  including net importer countries and airlines  As I told CNBC Asia s Akiko Fuijita last week  when oil prices have fallen below their 50  and 200 day moving averages  quant traders especially have poured money into airlines 
It s important to note  too  that demand remains very strong  outpacing capacity growth  According to a report by the International Air Transport Association  IATA  dated October 19  airline passenger load factor climbed to a 28 year high in August  Global load factor  a measure of an airline s capacity usage  rose to 85 3 percent for the first time since 1990

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  8  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
Currently  Vulcan has a great Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Vulcan has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-11-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vulcan-vmc-up-67-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200363557,200363557
13968,235483,VMC,5 Dividend Doublers That Run Laps Around The Market,opinion,"If you want to figure out how long it will take to double your money in an investment  you use the  Rule of 72   But income investors can put this rule to work  too  to figure out just how quickly their dividends will pile up 
I ll show you how   and I ll show you five dividend stocks that are on pace to double their dividends in just seven years 
The Rule of 72 is just a simple equation you can use to project the amount of time it would take to double your investment money  The equation 
72   compound annual interest rate     of years to double your investment 
So let s say the S P 500 returns an average of 8  a year  72   8   9  That means it should take about nine years for someone holding a market fund such as the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  or Vanguard S P 500  NYSE VOO  to double their money 
Obviously  I aim to do better 
But you can also use this equation to figure out how quickly your dividends should grow over time  which will help you figure out your eventual yield on cost 
For instance  say a stock yields just 3  now  but is on pace to double its dividend in just five years  you can essentially plan for a much healthier 6  yield on cost in a short amount of time  That would be an income play you and I could get behind 
Let s use the S P 500 as an example again  The index has grown its dividend at an average of 8 2  per year over the past five years  The math isn t much different   it ll take just under a decade for the S P 500 to double the dividends it pays out 
That s a little sluggish for my tastes  especially considering there are numerous dividend payers that are acting with a lot more urgency  Today  I m going to point you in the direction of five stocks whose payouts are booming  These firms have been boosting their payouts by an average of at least 10  every single year  and in many cases more    putting them on pace to double their dividends in just seven years or less 
Booz Allen Hamilton Holding  NYSE BAH 
Dividend Yield  1 4 
5 Year Average Dividend Growth  13 7 
American information technology and management firm Booz Allen Hamilton  BAH  isn t the first  second or hundredth stock on most investors  lists  But it s worth a look  both for its array of business arms and the stellar results they re driving 
Booz Allen Hamilton is perhaps best known for its consulting business  which has been used historically for tasks ranging from World War II preparations to the merger of the National Football League with the AFL  BAH also deals in analytics  digital solutions  cybersecurity and even engineering 
All told  Booz Allen has more than 25 000 employees working across 400 plus locations in more than 20 countries  Nearly 70  of which hold security clearances  which speaks to its heavy ties to the government   in fact  the federal government was responsible for 97  of the company s  6 2 billion in fiscal 2018 revenues 
This has fueled a general uptrend in both revenues and net income since its 2010 IPO  which in turn have powered a very consistently growing dividend 
Booz Allen Hamilton  BAH   An Unheralded Growth and Dividend Growth Play

The company improved its payout by a pair of pennies to 19 cents quarterly this year   a 12  improvement that s not far off its five year average dividend growth of roughly 14   And that dividend isn t even 30  of this year s projected  2 64 in profits  which means the company has oodles of room to write larger checks for years to come 
Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA 
Dividend Yield  0 5 
5 Year Average Dividend Growth  17 8 
Credit card use isn t new to you and me  In fact  plastic has been around so long that you probably think almost everyone uses a credit or debit card and that there s not much market left to grow into 
Wrong  Strategic research and consulting firm RBR s  Global Payment Cards Data and Forecasts to 2022  report shows that global payment card use grew 8  worldwide to 14 billion in 2016  and that number is expected to balloon by 22  to 17 billion by the year 2022 
That s fantastic news for MasterCard  MA    the No  2 player not just in the U S   but in Europe  in Africa and in Latin America 
The important thing to remember about Mastercard  NYSE MA  and rival Visa  NYSE V  is that while they seem like financial stocks  they re really closer to being technology stocks   they re not lenders  just payment processors  That means they need to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the game  which Mastercard has been doing via its recently announced Digital Commerce Solutions  which includes a plan to make all its cards support token authentication within two years  and a partnership with Southeast Asia s Grab to offer virtual prepaid solutions for the ride hailing company s 110 million customers 
MasterCard pulls in roughly  12 5 billion annually across its worldwide payments network  The company did nearly  1 5 trillion in gross dollar volume around the globe in the third quarter alone  across some 2 5 billion cards   up 4  year over year  MA has produced steady growth for years  which has translated into explosive growth in the dividend   to the tune of roughly 18  annually over the past half decade 
And its 25 cent quarterly dividend  That comes out to a mere 15  of this year s projected earnings  which means MasterCard could triple its payout overnight and still have more payout headroom than most established dividend paying blue chips

Vail is split into three divisions 
Mountain  This entails the company s premier mountain resorts  including the namesake Vail  as well as Breckenridge  Colorado   Northstar  Lake Tahoe  California   Perisher  Australia  and Whistler Blackcomb  Canada   among others

Real Estate Development  Lastly  Vail Resorts Development Company helps plan  market and otherwise develop property around the resorts  including communities and private clubs 
One of Vail s biggest sources of growth is its  Season Pass   which allows guests to use its various resorts  rather than tethering customers to one particular resort  Pass sales have grown at 13  annually on average since fiscal 2012  to more than 78 000 in FY2018 
The result has been steady growth pretty much across the board  including free cash flow  which has improved every year since 2012   from  57 1 million then to  338 6 million in FY2017 
Vail has been generous with that cash  too  growing its dividend by nearly half every year on average over the past five years  Its current  1 47 quarterly dividend comes out to 75  of this year s profits  but just 65  of next year s  Don t expect nearly 50  dividend expansion going forward  but as long as MTN s earnings swell like they re expected to  Vail Resorts should be a dividend growth machine

Southwest Airlines  LUV  is  as I ve said before  a  breath of fresh air  in the airline industry  In a business that seems to pride itself on kicking puppies and pushing down old ladies  Southwest has set itself apart on the most bizarre of concepts  Treating humans like humans 
This year alone  Southwest has topped J D  Power s study for customer service among low cost airlines in North America  took home four TripAdvisor Travelers  Choice awards and was No  2 on Indeed s top rated workplaces 
Of course  being nice isn t everything  You have to make money  And Southwest makes money  The airline has been profitable for 45 consecutive years despite its strong price competitiveness  In the third quarter  LUV brought in  615 million in earnings   its best Q3 in company history 
That same quarter  the company returned  591 million to shareholders via share repurchases and buybacks  The majority of that   500 million  was repurchases  but LUV is far  far  far from a distribution slouch  Southwest has pumped up its payout from a mere penny per share at the beginning of 2013 to 16 cents as of this year s distribution   itself a hefty 28  improvement 
And at a mere 15  of this year s projected profits  the sky s the limit on future payout hikes

5 Year Average Dividend Growth  94 7

Vulcan Materials produces the stuff construction is made of  crushed stone  sand  gravel  asphalt and ready mixed concrete 
Vulcan is the king of what it does   it s the largest aggregates producer in the U S  And the company says that  75  of the U S  population growth from 2010 to 2020 is projected to occur in Vulcan served states   meaning it s perfectly positioned to capture the lions  share of building projects as time goes on 
The company s third quarter report showed just what kinds of tailwinds VMC has been riding to turn the business around from its struggles in the Great Recession  Vulcan s daily shipping rates were up 6  year over year  pricing momentum improved by 3  and unit cost of sales actually declined 2  despite a 28  spike in the cost of diesel  Best of all  cash gross profits per ton improved 6  year over year 
Vulcan Materials  VMC  Is Fully Recovered From the Financial Crisis 

That money is going straight into investors  pockets  The company has electrified its payout from a penny per share back in 2013 to a current 28 cents per share   and even then  the company isn t even doling out 30  of its profits in dividends 
Vulcan isn t your typical dividend play  but then again  we don t want typical   we want extraordinary

13969,235484,VMC,Fed In Focus Tomorrow As Investors Lick Wounds,opinion," Monday Market Open  Still no sign of Santa yet on Wall Street this holiday season 
Instead  investors enter the new week licking their wounds after days of struggles  Friday s sharp plunge amid growing concerns about world economic weakness didn t offer much hope for any sort of  Santa Claus  rally  though we still have a couple weeks left in the year 
Despite the fast approach of Christmas and what s usually a relatively quiet period  this looks like it might be a busy week as markets struggle through the worst quarterly performance for major indices since 2011  Front and center is a key Fed meeting starting tomorrow as debate heats up about the next rate move  With the U S  economy still looking pretty impressive despite eight month lows for the S P 500 index  futures trading indicates a 76  chance that the Fed will execute its fourth hike of the year Wednesday 
There s also a batch of key earnings reports looming  along with a fresh look at Q3 GDP and U S  inflation  Some of the major companies due to report ahead of the holiday include Nike  NYSE NKE   FedEx  NYSE FDX   Micron  NASDAQ MU  and Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  
This little mini earnings season gets underway after today s close when Oracle  NYSE ORCL  reports  Over the last few years  ORCL has been transitioning to more cloud based services meaning its earnings might help investors get a sense of current trends in that area of the tech industry  The company has a track record of regularly beating Wall Street analysts  earnings expectations in recent quarters  so we ll see if that holds up 
Washington drama could affect trading  too  this week  as Congress and the White House spar over what appear to be growing chances of a possible government shutdown  Historically  shutdowns haven t often had a huge impact on the market  but in these volatile times  the political finger pointing might add to what s already a pretty full basket of factors outside of investors  control 
Global stocks were mostly lower to start the final full trading week of the year  and the dollar index is down a little after approaching its 2018 highs late last week  Investors might want to consider watching the dollar this week  Lately  strength in the dollar has often corresponded with weakness in stocks 
Fed Meeting Looms Large

With a Fed rate hike this week likely already baked into the cake  investors are probably more focused on Fed comments accompanying the announcement as they try to glean any fresh tidbits about where policymakers think the economy and inflation could be headed  Fed Chair Jerome Powell s post meeting press conference could provide clues about next steps with the futures market projecting just 50 50 chances of another rate hike in 2019 
As of September  the Fed projected about three hikes next year  but the updated  dot plot  from the Fed on Wednesday could help investors glean whether they should still expect such an aggressive tightening strategy 
Combing Through The Data
Investors also are scheduled to get another clue about inflation later in the week when the government reports November personal consumption expenditure  PCE  data  According to the Fed  core PCE numbers are the central bank s preferred inflation gauge  A similar number  the core consumer price index  showed prices rose an as expected 0 2  in November even while headline consumer prices were flat month over month 
One economic uncertainty that s been percolating  perhaps a bit under the radar  is the state of the U S  housing market and its effect on the broader economy  Recent numbers have been mixed  but overall it seems that higher mortgage rates have been eating into home affordability even as input prices for steel and lumber also rise 
So investors may want to pay attention to reports on November building permits and housing starts on Tuesday and existing home sales for last month on Thursday 
Investors are also scheduled to see the government s third estimate for Q3 gross domestic product  arguably the mother of all economic reports because it includes the total value of the goods and services produced in the country  The last estimate was 3 5  
Meanwhile  a fresh reading Friday from the Atlanta Fed s GDPNow model estimated that Q4 GDP would come in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3   The estimate rose from 2 4  on Dec  7 after the U S  retail sales report helped boost Q4 PCE growth expectations along with a stronger than expected showing for U S  industrial production in November 
Other notable economic reports in coming days include November data on leading indicators  durable goods orders  and personal income and spending  As with the other report  a stronger than expected data point  while good for the economy  can spark worries on Wall Street that the Fed might tighten rates too quickly and put an artificial damper on economic and corporate growth  Weaker than forecast readings can boost the market  while as expected figures can be non events 
Friday Follies
All three major U S  indices fell around 2  Friday after retail sales data from China showed slower than expected growth and the weakest reading in five years  Industrial output there grew the slowest in three years  a potential sign of the effects of the ongoing trade war with the United States  Meanwhile  private sector business activity in Europe also fell  news that came just one day after the European Central Bank sliced its growth and inflation forecasts  European and Asian shares fell across the board 
The data from China contrasted with retail sales and industrial figures from the United States  where November U S  retail sales growth of 0 2  that matched Wall Street analysts  expectations and U S  industrial production in November increased by 0 6   ahead of the 0 3  forecast in a Briefing com consensus 
That wasn t enough to outweigh the concerns about economic growth abroad  Perhaps that s because the overseas data come amid a backdrop of continued worry about global economic growth prospects as the trade war between the United States and China drags on  All three major U S  indices are off 5 5  or more so far this month  making this the worst December open since 1980  The SPX and SPX are in correction  down more than 10  from their September highs 
JNJ Hit Healthcare Sector On Friday
Corporate news also weighed on the market late last week  with Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI  component Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  dropping more than 10  after a Reuters report said the company s Baby Powder product was sometimes tainted with carcinogenic asbestos and the company kept the information from regulators and the public  JNJ issued a statement saying the Reuters article is  one sided  false and inflammatory  
JNJ helped weigh on the S P 500  SPX  healthcare sector  which was the worst performer of the day  but other healthcare names were also markedly lower  Some of the other selling could be coming as traders look toward  quadruple witching hour  next Friday  which refers to the last hour of the trading day when market index futures and options expire along with stock options and stock futures  This can result in volatility as traders unwind positions 
The energy sector was also a loser as oil prices plummeted as market participants eschewed riskier assets and seemed to worry about demand for black gold amid concerns about global economic strength  A stronger dollar also seemed to help pressure dollar denominated oil  making it more expensive for buyers using foreign currencies 
The strength in the dollar might have been one sign that investors were flocking to perceived  safe haven  assets  though no investment is truly safe  Market participants were also buying up U S  government debt  pushing yields lower  Wall Street s main fear gauge  the CBOE Volatility Index jumped after days of being on the decline 

Figure 1  Health Stocks Take A Powder  The health sector  which had been  well  pretty healthy lately  took a dive Friday along with the S P 500 Index  purple line   hurt in part by shares of key component Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   which dived after a negative media report  Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Not an Immaterial Selloff in 2018   When looking at the various stock sectors  a few of them tend to grab a lot of the headlines  especially in 2018  Info tech  for example  has been the belle of the ball over the last few years  but lately has been dancing to a dismal tune  Crude oil s massive downturn has dragged energy shares down over 12  on the year  Financials  also down over 12  have been worth watching as a bellwether to not only the overall business climate  but also as sort of a proxy for the future of interest rates  But when you look at 2018 sector performance  it s Materials that has led the charge lower down about 15  on the year 
It seems the sector has been dragged down by some of the same fundamentals pressuring energy and financials  namely concerns of a global economic slowdown  But pressure at a few individual names have certainly added fuel to the flame  DowDuPont  NYSE DWDP   which at 19  has the highest weighting in the S P 500 materials sector index  has been the target of a number of analyst downgrades as it continues its plan to split into 3 companies  and likely loses its standing as a Dow component   according to media reports  Shares are down over 20  on the year  Other big names down over 20  include International Paper Company  NYSE IP   Vulcan Materials Company  NYSE VMC  and  the biggest laggard of all  mining giant Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX   down over 40  since the start of the year 
Cheap for A Reason  There s a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson that says   Never buy what you do not want  because it is cheap  it will be dear to you   He could have been talking about European equities  According to research firm CFRA  European stocks are cheaper when compared to historical averages  But just because something is cheap doesn t mean it s a good deal  In this column  we ve often touched on problems facing Europe and weighing on investor s minds  But with much of the geopolitical headlines these days dominated by news of the progress  or lack thereof  on the China U S  trade front  we thought it would be a good time to dig deeper into some of the headwinds that investors in Europe could face 
Various economic indicators have shown signs of slowing growth in Europe  according to the research firm  Even so  the European Central Bank announced recently that it will end its bond buying program  And  although it may be easy to forget with all the tariff issues surrounding the U S  and China  the United States still has tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union  Meanwhile  France is facing violent protests  and Italy s budget remains an overhang  Even as Britain is enmeshed in trying to work out a negotiated exit from the European Union  Spain continues to face separatist pressure from people who want Catalonia to secede  While it may be tempting to chase what seems like a bargain  caution is always in order   All told  a significant amount of uncertainty remains in Europe   CFRA said   Even though valuation is attractive with the S P Euro 350 trading at 6  discount to its long term average price to  earnings ratio  CFRA remains on the sideline  
Tech Time  From a technical perspective  it s arguably bearish that the S P 500 Index  SPX  closed just a smidgen below psychological support at the 2600 level on Friday  It was the first close under 2600 since last spring  and could potentially help set up a test of support near the year s lows in a range between 2530 and 2550  Consider tracking the SPX closely today to see if it can claw its way back above 2600 by the close  which would possibly be a sign of underlying support at these levels

13972,235487,VMC,CPAC Vs  VMC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Building Products   Concrete and Aggregates stocks have likely encountered both Pacasmayo  CPAC  and Vulcan Materials  VMC   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Pacasmayo and Vulcan Materials are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CPAC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
CPAC currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 34  while VMC has a forward P E of 29 19  We also note that CPAC has a PEG ratio of 0 71  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  VMC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 39 
Another notable valuation metric for CPAC is its P B ratio of 2 10  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  VMC has a P B of 3 50 
These metrics  and several others  help CPAC earn a Value grade of B  while VMC has been given a Value grade of D 
CPAC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that CPAC is likely the superior value option right now ",2018-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cpac-vs-vmc-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200327109,200327109

13975,235490,VMC, Top 5 things to know in the market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  August 2 
1  Apple soars 6  on earnings beat
Shares in Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  soared more than 6  in pre market trade on Wednesday after the tech giant reported strong fiscal third quarter earnings after the prior session s close and said its upcoming iPhone release dates were on track 
Sales of iPhones also appeared to impress investors as the firm sold 41 03 million of its smartphone in its most recent quarter  topping analyst estimates and surpassing the milestone of 1 2 billion iPhones sold 
That was despite the fact that chief executive Tim Cook kept a lid on details about the upcoming release of its 10th anniversary iPhone 
 We have no comment on anything that s not announced   Cook said 
Among yet another deluge of earnings set for Wednesday  including highly anticipated numbers from the likes of Groupon  NASDAQ GRPN   Time Warner  NYSE TWX   Apollo Global Management  NYSE APO   Humana  NYSE HUM   Molson Coors Brewing  NYSE TAP   Amarin  NASDAQ AMRN   Sodastream   NASDAQ SODA   Vulcan Materials  NYSE VMC   Kemet  NYSE KEM  or Nova  NASDAQ NVMI   the main focus apart from reactions to Apple s own report would likely focus on numbers from Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  out after the market close as market players fix to focus on what chief executive Elon Musk quoted as a  production hell  for the new Model 3 
Fitbit  NYSE FIT   Marathon Oil  NYSE MRO   T2 Biosystms  NASDAQ TTOO   Exelixis  NASDAQ EXEL   Square  NYSE SQ   Oclaro  NASDAQ OCLR   3D Systems  NYSE DDD   Immune Design  NASDAQ IMDZ  or Chemours  NYSE CC  will also among firms reporting after Wednesday s close 
2  Dow set to face off against 22 000
With Apple set to lead the charge on Wednesday  Dow futures pointed to a break out from 22 000 points 
The index itself hit yet another record high on Tuesday  following up on what in July had been its strongest monthly performance since February 
The Dow has shown a strong track record recently busting through psychological milestones with the benchmark hitting 19 000 for the first time on November 22  2016 
January 25 of this year  the Dow finished at 20 000 and closed at 21 000 for the first time as recently as March 1 
A close at or above 22 000 points on Wednesday would represent the seventh fastest 1 000 point move between milestones  having taken just 109 trading days 
That places it just behind the move from 17 000 to 18 000 points reached in December 2014 that took only 108 trading days 
At 5 59AM ET  9 59GMT   the blue chip Dow futures rose 0 21   S P 500 futures inched up 0 07  while the Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0 78  
European shares failed to follow Wall Street euphoria on Wednesday as financials  mining firms and oil stocks weighed on sentiment  At 6 00AM ET  10 00GMT   the European benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 lost 0 35   Germany s DAX fell 0 22   while London s FTSE 100 traded down 0 46  
Earlier  Asian tech stocks celebrated Apple s success  hitting a 17 year peak 
3  Euro hits fresh 2 1 2 year highs against dollar
The euro rose to fresh two and a half year highs against the broadly weaker dollar on Wednesday as deepening political turmoil in Washington continued to weigh on the greenback 
EUR USD hit highs of 1 1868  the most since December 2014  It pulled back to 1 1833 by 6 01AM ET  10 01GMT  
The dollar came under renewed selling pressure as political risks in the U S  continued to weigh 
The White House on Tuesday confirmed that U S  President Donald Trump played a role in drafting a statement about his son s meeting with a Russian lawyer during last year s election campaign  which was later shown to be misleading 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  slipped 0 09  to 92 84 by 6 01AM ET  10 01GMT   after falling to 92 64 on Tuesday  its lowest since May 2016 
4  Employment data  Fed speakers to determine dollar s fate
As the dollar hovered near a 15 month low against major rivals  investors looked ahead to the ADP employment report out at 8 15AM ET  12 15GMT  Wednesday 
Although not considered a reliable indicator for the official nonfarm payrolls report out Friday  markets still watch the data from the private payroll processor as an indicator of the health of the U S  labor market 
The dollar had been supported by the Federal Reserve s  Fed  gradual policy tightening since late 2015 but the prospect that other major central banks may join it in the removal of accommodative policy have weighed 
With experts widely expecting the U S  central bank to embark on balance sheet normalization in September and follow up with an additional rate hike at the end of the year  market players will also pay attention Wednesday to appearances by Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester and San Francisco Fed chief John Williams later in the session 
5  Oil slips on inventory surprise ahead of official data
Oil prices declined for a second consecutive session on Wednesday as investors fretted over increasing U S  crude inventories 
Late Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute s  API  said that U S  crude stocks rose by 1 8 million barrels in the week ending July 28 to 488 8 million  missing forecasts for a draw of 2 9 million and denting hopes that recent inventory draws were a sign of a tightening U S  market 
Official storage figures are due to be published by the U S  Energy Information Administration at 10 30AM ET  14 30GMT  on Wednesday 
U S  crude oil futures fell 0 28  to  49 02 at 6 02AM ET  10 02GMT   while Brent oil traded down 0 12  to  51 72 ",2017-08-02,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-513307,513307
13976,235491,VMC,Low Lumber   OSB Prices To Hurt Weyerhaeuser  WY  Q2 Earnings,opinion,Weyerhaeuser Company   NYSE WY   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 26  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  this wood based building products manufacturer s adjusted earnings of 11 cents met the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net sales of  1 643 million missed the same by 5 2   On a year over year basis  both the top and bottom lines declined 11 9  and 69 4   respectively  owing to unfavorable average sales realizations for oriented strand board  OSB   domestic and export logs  as well as lower volumes  The trend is likely to continue in the to be reported quarter as well Also  it is to be noted that the company missed the consensus estimate in two of the last four quarters  with the average negative surprise being 7 5  Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s earnings per share has declined 9 1  over the past 30 days to 10 cents  This is indicative of a decrease of 77 3  from the year ago earnings of 44 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  1 73 billion  down 16 3  year over year Weyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS Surprise   Let s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementWeyerhaeuser s second quarter earnings are likely to be affected by continuous deterioration in OSB and lumber prices  Despite focusing on operational excellence  which entails merchandising for value  harvest and transportation efficiency  and flexing harvest to capture seasonal and short term opportunities  the company s exposure to raw material price fluctuations is likely to dent profits in the to be reported quarter Also  important housing market indicators like new and existing home sales  building permits  as well as housing starts have been lagging  supposedly dampening the company s second quarter overall performance Although the company expects the Wood Products unit  accounting for 66 6  of first quarter total net sales  to generate significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA sequentially in the quarter to be reported  the metrics will likely be lower than the year ago period  However  the sequential increase would primarily be backed by seasonally higher volumes and operating rates across its product lines Weyerhaeuser anticipates earnings and adjusted EBITDA from Timberlands  the second largest contributing segment  to be sequentially lower in the quarter to be reported In the West  the company anticipates export sales volumes  due to the timing of vessel sailings  to be partly offset by favorable domestic log sales realizations  In the North  it expects fee harvest volumes to decrease significantly due to spring break up  While average Southern  NYSE SO  log sales realizations are likely to be in line with the first quarter  Western and Southern silviculture activity  as well as related costs are expected to increase seasonally For the Real Estate  Energy and Natural Resources segment  the company projects sequentially lower but annually higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter  The downside is mainly due to the timing of favorable Real Estate transactions Overall  the company has been highly focused on reducing costs by improving reliability  enhancing product margins and maximizing benefits from focused capital investment  which is a positive for the upcoming results What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Weyerhaeuser is likely to beat estimates in the to be reported quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can see  Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  30 00   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Weyerhaeuser currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Notably  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks Worth a LookHere are some stocks in the Zacks  sector  which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarters to be reported Vulcan Materials

What s Next for Vulcan 
While Vulcan has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Vulcan was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 70 on  1 38 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 83 on  4 87 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

13983,235498,VMC,Will Higher Housing Demand Aid Lennar s  LEN  Q2 Earnings  ,opinion,Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   is slated to report results for second quarter fiscal 2018  ended May 31  before the opening bell on Jun 26 In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20 7   This Miami based homebuilder surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  with the average being 7 1  Notably  Lennar s diversified line of home offerings for first time  move up and active adult homebuyers  and positive housing market fundamentals prove favorable for this leading homebuilder in the United States Factors at PlayAlthough higher prices  mortgage rates and supply shortages are taking a toll on the housing industry of late  Lennar has been reporting solid top line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon to be reported quarter as well  owing to strong demand for homes  favorable job market and impressive economic conditions According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the company s Homebuilding segment revenues  comprising almost 89 3  of total revenues  of  4 7 billion are likely to increase from  2 9 billion in the year ago period and  2 7 billion recorded in the prior reported quarter  This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog  The company s new order trend  in units  also remained solid  growing 30  in the last reported quarter and 11  in fiscal 2017 The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and innovation of new products such as recently announced creative student loan program  The company expects the segment s second quarter profit to be between  45 million and  48 million for the to be reported quarter  Meanwhile  the consensus estimate for the segment s revenues is pegged at  288 million  reflecting 68 4  sequential growth While Lennar s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near term revenues and earnings  its ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi Family provide diversification as well as complementary long term growth opportunities On the flip side  Lennar  like other renowned homebuilding companies  has been under considerable pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins  While labor shortages are resulting in higher wages  land prices are increasing due to limited availability Lennar s gross margin on home sales expanded 50 basis points  bps  in the fiscal first quarter but decreased 90 bps year over year in fiscal 2017  The decline was primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home  For the second quarter  the company expects gross margin to be in the 21 0 21 6  range compared with 21 1  in the year ago period  Gross margins are expected to be impacted by 750 800 bps in the second quarter related to the CalAtlantic acquisition Overall  Lennar s diligent efforts to improve operating efficiency via digital marketing efforts  dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds  thereby driving growth for this homebuilder  In this regard  the company is working hard to improve its SG A expenses via operating leverage and investments in technology  As a percentage of revenues from home sales  SG A expenses contracted 60 bps to 9 7  in the fiscal first quarter  due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries  However  the impact of purchase accounting related to CalAtlantic acquisition is expected to hurt margins and thereby the bottom line of the company The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings is pegged at 45 cents  reflecting a decrease of 50 6  year over year  That said  the same for revenues is pegged at  5 23 billion  implying 60 4  growth Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    What Does the Zacks Model

13991,235506,VMC,Why Steven Cohen Increased His US Concrete Stake By 64 ,opinion,"A  filing with the SEC on Friday evening revealed that Steven Cohen increased his stake in   Nasdaq  USCR  by  20 7 million  With the stock down  16 4  in the last month  it s worth taking a closer look at the company 
Point72 Adds To Its US Concrete Stake
On February 14th  Steven Cohen s firm  filed its quarterly Form 13F with the SEC  The filing showed that the investment firm held 529 956 shares of US Concrete worth  44 3 million as of December 31st 
However  a new filing on Friday revealed that Point72 Asset Management purchased an additional 337 927 shares bringing the hedge fund s total ownership stake to 867 883 shares worth roughly  53 1 million  This also represents 5 2  of US Concrete s total equity 
The company s shares last traded at  61 15 as of Monday afternoon  down  16 4  over the last month  Could the recent buying activity signal a promising road ahead while the stock trades near its 52 week low source  Potential Reasons For Adding Shares
US Concrete produces and sells ready mixed concrete  aggregates  and concrete related products and services to the construction industry in the United States and Canada  It primarily serves concrete sub contractors  general contractors  governmental agencies  property owners and developers  architects  engineers  and home builders  Wall Street analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Eagle Materials Inc  NYSE EXP   Vulcan Materials Company  NYSE VMC   Summit Materials Inc  NYSE SUM  and Martin Marietta Materials Inc  NYSE MLM   Analyzing US Concrete s valuation metrics and ratios relative to peers provides further insight into why Point72 Asset Management purchased shares 
A company s  is the average annual growth rate of EBITDA over a five year period  It s calculated as follows 
5yr CAGR     EBITDA FY 5   EBITDA FY      1 5 years    1
The chart below plots the five year EBITDA compounded annual growth rate for US Concrete and its peers source  finbox io
The company s projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR of 16 9  is above all of its selected comparable public companies  EXP  10 1    VMC  12 4    SUM  9 0   and MLM  7 9    In addition  US Concrete s 1 year projected EBITDA growth of 63 6  is also well above all of its peers 
A company s  is calculated by dividing its  by  and is often used to benchmark the fair market value of a company  Its key benefit over the  is that it s capital structure neutral  and  therefore  better at comparing companies with different levels of debt 
High growth stocks typically trade at higher valuation multiples  However  this does not appear to be the case as illustrated in the chart below source  US Concrete s LTM EBITDA multiple of 11 7x is below all of its selected comparable public companies  Furthermore  its forward EBITDA multiple of 7 1x is also below the entire peer group  This make s the company s shares highly attractive purely on a relative valuation approach 
In addition  finbox io s average fair value estimate of  85 19 implies 40 3  upside and is calculated from 4 valuation models as shown in the table below  Each analysis uses consensus Wall Street estimates for the projections when available US Concrete shares have traded lower over the last month and the stock now appears to be trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value  This could be a reason why Steven Cohen s hedge fund is adding to his stake in the company 
However  it is important to note that investors should never blindly copy the trading activity of illustrious money managers such as Mr  Cohen  However  keeping an eye on their buying and selling activity will help in making a more informed investment decision 
I recommend investors continue their research on US Concrete to get a more comprehensive view of the company

13992,235507,VMC,Materials Build On A Bearish Breakdown,opinion,"This picture is exactly what I do not want to see as the stock market struggles to hold critical technical supports  a major index of economically sensitive stocks confirming a breakdown of support at its 200 day moving average  DMA   The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLB  lost 1 3  on a day when the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   only lost 0 3   XLB also closed at a 5  month low which added more confirmation to its bearish breakdown below its 200DMA  This picture is particularly troubling on a day when  for U S  fourth quarter annual GDP growth UPWARD from 2 5  to 2 9   Investors did not seem to care and instead looked ahead to some future troubles 

The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLB  has declined 11 out of the last 13 days after confirming resistance at its 50DMA  The new 5  month low further confirms a bearish 200DMA breakdown 

This trading action forced me out of a position in Vulcan Materials  NYSE VMC   For too long I watched profits evaporate in this sell off  VMC broke down twice below its 200DMA and for good measure confirmed its 200DMA as resistance 

Vulcan Materials  VMC  lost 3 0   The stock has not closed this low since October  2016 

For good measure  I sold a long standing holding in infrastructure play Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR   The stock made a fantastic recovery since an 8 year low in August of last year  I am glad I accumulated shares in the sell off  However  the bearishness in materials made me eager to lock in profits on a company that helps move a LOT of materials 

Fluor  FLR  topped out with the market in late January and is trying to hold support around the February low  For now  50DMA resistance is the more dominant theme 

Allegheny Technologies Incorporated  NYSE ATI  deals in specialty materials  At an   I think of this stock as a very cheap play on a strong global economy  I was looking to buy the stock here around its 200DMA  but the further breakdown in XLB put a pause on my plans  I am now staying on the sidelines to watch some more 

Allegheny Technologies Incorporated  ATI  ducked under its 200DMA with a 2 4  loss on the day  The stock looks vulnerable enough to challenge November s low 
U S Concrete Inc  NASDAQ USCR  is a stock where materials  infrastructure  and a strong economy all converge in one place  I want to use the current sell off as a buying opportunity  but the stock s weakness has been relentless  On Wednesday  USCR lost a whopping 4 1   The stock is well below its 50 and 200DMAs and looks ready to test the bottom of a trading channel from the first half of 2017  I interviewed CEO Bill Sandbrook last August and received some great insight on the bullish story supporting USCR  I hope to talk to him again soon to get a better understanding of the current weakness  especially since earnings on March 1st

13993,235508,VMC,U S  Concrete  An Attractively Priced Bet On A Strong U S  Economy,opinion,"Two weeks ago I expressed concern about the poor performance of the materials sector  The sector was under performing the general market which seemed particularly ominous given the generally strong outlook for the economy  At the time  I expressed my hope that another interview with Bill Sandbrook  CEO of U S  Concrete  NASDAQ USCR   would clear the air and provide some reassuring data points  I talked to Mr  Sandbrook on April 9th  and he did not disappoint 
I noted that since we last talked  USCR had lost about 22  in value  including a sharp pullback after   The current sell off is USCR s steepest and longest in duration since a similar pullback in 2016  weekly chart below  


U S  Concrete  USCR  has enjoyed tremendous success since bottoming at the end of 2011  The current 30  sell off from all time highs is the longest and steepest pullback since a similar downdraft in 2016 
Earnings and Expectations
The post earnings sell off was puzzling given the company reported  new highs in volumes  revenue and profit  and   a sixth straight year of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion   earnings call quotes from   
Sandbrook responded that the entire materials sector has been  soft and weak  and has pulled its constituent stocks down toward 52 week lows  USCR experienced a very strong run up going into its recent highs so the drive to 52 week lows meant a large percentage drop for the stock  For example  Vulcan Materials Company  NYSE VMC  is bouncing off 52 week lows  To get there from recent highs  it dropped 21   Eagle Materials Inc  NYSE EXP  fell by a similar amount which took it to a 7 month low and a bottom  Martin Marietta Materials  NYSE MLM  flirted with 52 week lows and dropped about 18  to get there from recent highs  USCR s relatively dramatic decline meant a reversal of extremely high expectations 
These high expectations were not adjusted for the likely impact of very bad weather conditions in two of USCR s core markets  The Dallas Ft  Worth area experienced its wettest year in 100 years  The poor weather in February caused a decrease in shipments  The Northeast suffered from four extremely heavy snowstorms  Nor easters  in a row  Sandbrook depicted a NY centric investor base that looks   out the window  sees the poor weather  and makes the connections  to reduced cement business  In other words  there is a lot of short term sentiment trading in the stock  From the earnings call 

  during the fourth quarter of 2017  results in the Northeast and Texas markets were significantly impacted by weather  In the last two weeks of the year alone  we estimate we lost approximately 100 000 yards of concrete sales  which would have generated an estimated  12 million of incremental revenue and  2 million of incremental EBITDA for the quarter  

Sandbrook was also not able to give as much color on the financial impact of  on November 17  2017  This is how Sandbrook described the deal at the time 

 This acquisition will enable us to self supply a majority of our current Northern California aggregate requirements and to further expand our footprint into other supply constrained markets along the West Coast  including Southern California The addition of Polaris to the U S  Concrete family is further evidence of our commitment to increased vertical integration into aggregates to capitalize on attractive long term growth opportunities for our shareholders  

And from the last earnings report  Seeking Alpha transcript  

 Everybody has to think about Polaris as the California quarry basically  The dynamics that go along with California quarries on the commercial side would be definitely in play for that asset  And as California aggregate pricing and inflationary pressures creep in  we will obviously be able to partake in that  

Sandbrook indicated to me that in the next earnings report he will more completely describe the new opportunity delivered by Polaris  In the last earnings call he could only reference Polaris s own earnings report as a baseline and say he was  optimistic from there   Given California is a supply constrained market  this acquisition IS a big deal for USCR  Polaris is the largest acquisition in the company s history  Sandbrook further explained that Polaris assets contain more than 80 years of reserves  Note well that USCR is trading 21  lower than where it traded when USCR first announced the deal in late September 
Sandbrook noted that the company  lives and dies  by the expectations of 6 or 7 analysts  If they miss the weather impact  the company gets punished  The stock chart above shows several years since 2012 where USCR pulled back in the wake of severe of weather periods  each seasonal episode was a buying opportunity 
Infrastructure Spending
I next asked Sandbrook whether changing expectations on infrastructure spending could help explain the weakness in the stock  Sandbrook noted that his heavy aggregate peers have been waiting for a robust federal infrastructure bill  like highway programs  However  the  Trump bump optimism  for a massive infrastructure bill has faded significantly  The effort was first pushed back because of the fight over health care and then tax cuts  Moreover  Trump s main two infrastructure proponents have left the administration  Increasingly  it appears an infrastructure bill will get punted to post 2018 mid term elections  Fortunately  USCR has not baked into its business any expectations for an infrastructure bill  Sandbrook has delivered this message for two years  and he mentioned it in our last discussion as well 
The most critical driver for USCR is a strong economy  GDP growth of 3  is more important than infrastructure bills 
Inflationary Pressures
Finally  I referenced the frequent discussion of inflation pressures in the last earnings report  I asked Sandbrook for more specifics on the drivers of inflation in diesel and labor 
Diesel prices are simply going up alongside the increase in gasoline prices 
The higher cost of labor comes from a shortage of qualified truck drivers   This shortage has become chronic  Nightly Business Report covered this shortage in 2014  2015  and in 2018 a piece on the rising demand for trucking   Sandbrook explained that truck drivers tend to leave for a better pay package  and competitors are willing to pay up  The labor shortage extends to the trades  like drywall contractors and electricians  Hurricane related recovery efforts are adding to strains on the supply of labor  Wages for white collar workers are not going up as much as those of the hourly wages 
I pressed for more details wondering whether the labor shortage is more than a cyclical issue  I was wondering about structural factors  Sandbrook offered some observations on the nature of work in today s America  He lamented that there are more able bodied people NOT working than at any other time our history  A lot of people are finding it unattractive to work and thus creating a shrinking pool of available workers  He also noted that construction sites that relied on immigrant labor are suffering from immigration reform  they have difficulties in attracting replacement laborers  USCR is impacted indirectly by the labor shortages on construction sites  For some background on one way to look at the structural forces reducing the supply of willing workers see  Edward Glaeser on Joblessness and the War on Work  on EconTalk  March 26  2018 
Conclusion I ended my interview with Mr  Sandbrook with a renewed sense of opportunity  I liked USCR last summer  and I like it even more here  I wrote in other posts about the technical factors weighing on the market that ever so subtly seem to be lifting  Once that tide recedes  I think it will reveal pearls like USCR  The industry itself remains highly optimistic  once again from the earnings conference call 

 The U S  Chamber of Congress Commercial Construction Index increased once again in the fourth quarter showing continued strength in overall backlog levels  new business opportunities and revenue forecast with a reported 99  of contractors feeling confident in the demand for new commercial construction over the next 12 months

14014,235529,VMC,3 Trump Initiatives Beyond Tax Reform That Could Move Markets,opinion,"by Jason Martin
Even as the U S  Congress and White House rush to put the final rubber stamp on tax reform before the end of the year  and even with a potential government shutdown looming on December 22  House Republicans introduced a temporary stop gap spending bill on Monday to fund the government to push back what was initially a December 8 deadline  the measure is expected to be passed by the end of the week   there remain other issues on President Donald Trump s plate that  though still hovering in the background  could well affect the future path of the American economy and  consequently  stocks 

1  NAFTA Still Unresolved
The North America Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   adopted in 1994  was intended to create a North American market where goods could move across borders between the U S   Canada and Mexico tariff free  As part of his presidential campaign  Trump threatened to withdraw from the accord unless it was made  fairer  for the U S   claiming that it had dented American manufacturing and caused a  60 billion trade deficit with Mexico 
One of the major sticking points in negotiations has been the U S  insistence on the rules of origin for the auto industry  The U S  wants to raise the minimum threshold for sourcing auto production to be 85  from NAFTA members and 50  of the total from the U S  itself  compared to the current agreement for 62 5  to be sourced from the member countries 
U S  automakers are actually lobbying against the plan  In a November 27 meeting with Vice President Mike Pence  executives from Ford  NYSE F   General Motors  NYSE GM  and Fiat Chrysler  NYSE FCAU  asked for the idea to be scrapped  arguing that it would add thousands of dollars to car costs in the U S 
Regardless  ending NAFTA without a deal would imply the return of the World Trade Organization rules on free trade  hiking tariffs between the three countries  There is further speculation that Trump s  America First  agenda would lead to a hike in tariffs even beyond WTO guidelines  which could be mirrored by retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico 
A November 27 report from the Bank of Montreal calculated that a failure to renegotiate terms would lead to a 0 2 net reduction in real U S  gross domestic product over the next five years  while Canada would see a 1  decline 
The report further indicated that the U S  industries to be hardest hit by the lack of a deal would be automotive  as prevailing agreements currently straddle all three economies  followed by textiles with Canada and Mexico accounting for 15  of U S  manufacturers  sales 
After negotiations in November failed to resolve any issues  so called inter sessional talks are scheduled for the week of December 11 in Washington  Those results would be reported to chief negotiators before a January 23 28 meeting in Montreal  Canada 

2   1 Trillion in Infrastructure Policies on Tap
Infrastructure policies have been a part of Trump s plans since day one of his presidency and his election caused an immediate furor in construction and materials firms  including United States Steel  NYSE X   Vulcan Materials  NYSE VMC   Fluor  NYSE FLR   AECOM  NYSE ACM   Chicago Bridge   Iron  NYSE CBI   Jacobs Engineering  NYSE JEC   and Martin Marietta Materials  NYSE MLM  on the back of increased proposals and funds for the sector 


As can be seen in the graph above  the aforementioned companies all received a boost in the run up to the elections through the end of 2016  U S  Steel saw the most dramatic rally though enthusiasm appeared to taper off as time moved on and policy promises had yet to materialize  Fluor and Chicago Bridge   Iron have also been unable to hold post election peaks 
From a wider perspective  only the gains of 42   36  and 33  in U S  Steel  AECOM and Jacobs Engineering beat the 23 35  return in the S P 500 since the election  while all the other firms underperformed by more than half 
It was back in April of this year that President Trump renewed his promise for a  very big infrastructure plan   tagged at being around no less than  1 trillion  As political battles have raged over other issues  none of those big tag policies have actually materialized  Trump did note on November 20 that he planned to unveil the massive plan after Congress pushes through tax reform   We ll be submitting plans on infrastructure  soon after taxes   Trump declared from the White House 
To the President s credit  he has moved forward with the Keystone pipeline and also streamlined regulations to speed up the permitting process for builders 
One of the major sticking points for the passage of infrastructure policy is interwoven with tax reform and the budget  Many Republicans are wary of the pricing for the  1 trillion dollar package  Originally  Trump hoped to achieve about  200 billion in federal seed money to incentivize private investment in the projects 
However  it is currently unclear not only whether politicians will give the green light on the government spending  but whether the tax bill already passed by the House  which eliminated the deduction for firms using tax exempt private activity bonds  will form part of the final law  These are often used in public private relationships to help build roads  highways  hospitals  airports  housing and other crucial projects  The elimination of the tax deduction  if included in the final compromise  may well disincentivize private company participation 
China s own infrastructure policy  known as the Belt and Road Initiative  BRI   may serve to provide clues for the possible outcome of Trump s planned investments  although the  America First  ideology is diametrically opposed to the BRI s attempt to promote development and  economic cooperation  along five corridors out of China  land routes through Central Asia to Europe  to the Middle East  and Southeast Asia  and sea routes connecting Chinese ports to Europe and to the South Pacific 
The Belt and Road Initiative will benefit China  as well as other countries across the globe  In the first three quarters of this year  trade between China and economies along the route amounted to  786 billion  an increase of 15  year on year  according to a China Daily interview with Joao Mendes De Faria  president of the multinational mining firm Vale China 
Mendes calculated that Chinese businesses had increased their investment in the economies along the BRI by 29 7  to  9 6 billion  while those participating economies had upped their investment in China by 34 4  to  4 24 billion  He further noted that Chinese businesses had helped build 75 economic and trade cooperation zones in 24 markets along the Belt and Road  generating more than 209 000 jobs 
Pointing to number of BRI and Public Private Partnerships as the major factors supporting the Chinese economy  Mendes emphasized that the infrastructure project  has greatly fueled economic growth  
Markets are still awaiting the details of Trump s massive plan  not to mention how it will be funded  but it appears clear that  1 trillion in infrastructure spending  if approved  would give a big boost to not only the American economy but to stocks that would reap the benefits 
3  Immigration Beyond the Wall
While most thoughts regarding Trump s immigration policy naturally turn to his promise to build a wall between the borders of the U S  and Mexico to stop illegal immigration  yet another topic intertwined with tax reform and spending policies as estimates range from Trump s own  12 billion projection to price tags as high as  70 billion without including maintenance   many of the President s first attempts at wider measures  such as the travel ban  have faced judicial resistance 
Just this last Monday  the Trump administration did win a small victory as the Supreme Court allowed a third version of its travel ban to go into effect while legal challenges continued  Despite two dissents from Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor who preferred to deny the request for the ban to go into effect  the Supreme Court approved the move  urging appeals courts to move more swiftly to decide on its lawfulness 
This allowance for the third ban means that the U S  will be allowed to fully enforce restrictions on entry into the country from eight nations  Iran  Libya  Syria  Yemen  Somalia  Chad and North Korea  In essence  citizens of those countries will be denied entry to the U S  although details vary on the restrictions  Many will be unable to emigrate permanently to the U S  while others will be barred from working  studying or even vacationing in the United States 
To avoid drawn out legal battles on other immigration topics  the Trump Administration has concentrated this year on tightening current legislation  In the fight against what Trump considers to be unneeded competition for Americans from legal foreign workers  a Wall Street Journal article  that the administration is more closely scrutinizing applications for the high skilled visa program known as H 1B  According to the financial paper  more than one in four applicants between January and August received  requests for further evidence  compared to a year earlier under the Obama Administration when those requests were fewer than one in five 
The article suggests that the tactic was being used to purposely slow the process  thus reducing legal immigration via an increase in bureaucracy  rather than embarking on new legislative measures that could face political opposition 
According to the report  other methods to slow down the process have included ignoring past approvals for the same person forcing renewals to take longer requiring more applicant interviews which bog down the system  along with the suspension of premium processing which provided the opportunity to fast track an application for a fee 
Further changes to regulations could also include the elimination of the right for the spouses of H 1B holders to work in the U S  or allowing foreign graduates in science and technology from U S  universities to work for an additional two years 
H 1B visas are used to a large degree by tech companies who argue that these workers are needed to fill critical jobs  while opponents claim that they simply displace American workers  generally at cheaper compensation levels 
Tech firms initially took a hit following the presidential elections as market participants postulated that Trump policies would hinder their business  Obviously  those worries were not solely based on immigration  but also on overseas operations and other issues such as attacks from Trump when Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  refused to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernadino shooters 
Still  what appeared post election to be the start of a full on feud between the President and Silicon Valley seems to have faded into the background  In fact  since the election  tech shares have led the Wall Street rally 

Unlike the materials and construction companies mentioned earlier whose returns have shown a mixed reading as they wait for policy follow through  the graph above shows how top tech firms have skyrocketed  Apple has returned 53  since the elections  Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  48   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  around 44   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  38   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  34  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  26   compared to gains of 34 2  for the NASDAQ Composite and  just  23 35  for the S P 500 
Still ahead will be the outcome of Trump policies on tech stocks  whether he further clamps down on the firms  ability to access top tech talent outside of U S  borders and whether he makes good on threats to force manufacturing back to the States

14020,235535,VMC,NVIDIA  Vulcan Materials And Alibaba Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Jan 03  2018    highlights NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   as the Bull of the Day  Vulcan Materials   NYSE VMC   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alibaba   NYSE BABA   Here is a synopsis of all three stocks   I last wrote about NVIDIA as the Bull of the Day in mid November after another strong quarterly report  Instead of sustaining new highs above  210  shares fell nearly 15  to support under  190 as the Semiconductor group acquiesced to extremely overbought conditions And this despite analysts raising NVDA s EPS estimates from a consensus  3 95 to  4 67  with several high end projections near  5 00 Still  at  200  that would make NVDA trade at 40 times the most optimistic forward estimates  And so nervous holders with any profits are quick to run on any excuse We saw that excuse as a great opportunity in early December to add more NVDA shares in my  portfolio  Here s what I told my members on December 27 about a potentially fading opportunity to still buy NVDA near  190   As I ve written numerous times  this is the one to own for AI engines and advanced HPC  high performance computing  applications  NVIDIA builds systems on a chip  SoC  that are fueling so many different bleeding edge industries from autonomous driving  robotics and big data mining to cancer genomic research  medical diagnosis and cyber security that all require massively parallel architecture  MPA  And as the NVIDIA press page reminds us this week   the year in tech wakes up early  with the annual International Consumer Electronics Show  CES  in Las Vegas on Sunday  January 7  at 8pm  when NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage to talk about the company s automotive platforms As always  we can also expect a flurry of related surprises from NVIDIA To explain the long tail of NVIDIA s growth and dominance within and connected to several technology industries  let s review what I wrote in mid November   Is NVDA Too Expensive at 50X But many investors wonder if the stock is still a buy as it now trades for 53 times trailing 12 month earnings As an NVDA investor  I have a bias that says  Yes  I would still be a buyer near  200  And  after this most recent quarterly report  as I go over the growth profile in all its different business segments and customers  I find multiple reasons to reinforce this view In sum  as long as the leading provider of gaming processors  High Performance Computing in data centers  and emerging AI technologies keeps delivering solid double digit sales and earnings growth  along with upside surprises each quarter  then paying 48 times the current projection for next year s profits isn t a bad proposition So  two important questions follow   1  Will the market demand for HPC AI solutions in data center  gaming  and automotive segments continue to grow at high double digits 2  Can NVIDIA maintain their dominant position  even as Intel  NASDAQ INTC  buys Mobileye  OTC MBBYF  for a foothold in driverless cars and forges a renewed alliance with old arch enemy Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  to establish a front in GPU processor markets To help you decide whether the current 50X multiple is too expensive for NVIDIA s growth  this article will go over the current and forecast leadership of NVIDIA and why some Wall Street investment banks believe the company is on its way to earning  8 per share in 2020  which would equate to a 31X multiple at high Street targets near  250 Every Major Dude Will Tell YouIn early November  I was reviewing all the big announcements at the Beijing GPU Tech Conference in late September  in particular that the giants of China e commerce Alibaba  Baidu  and Tencent were all new cloud datacenter customers  I came away with the insight that  everybody is their customer now  Then on Monday November 13  from the SuperComputing Conference in Denver  NVIDIA issued a press release highlighting the exact thing   NVIDIA Chosen by Every Major Computer Maker  Every Major CloudDENVER  Nov  13  2017  GLOBE NEWSWIRE     NVIDIA today announced the world s most advanced data center GPU   the NVIDIA Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   V100 GPU based on NVIDIA s Volta architecture   is available through every major computer maker and chosen by every major cloud to deliver artificial intelligence and high performance computing Dell EMC  NYSE EMC   Hewlett Packard Enterprise  Huawei  IBM  NYSE IBM  and Lenovo have all announced Volta based offerings for their customers  Providers such as Alibaba Cloud  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  Baidu Cloud  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  Azure  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  Cloud and Tencent Cloud have also announced Volta based cloud services Building on this breadth of offerings  NVIDIA has introduced new software and tools on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud  NGC  container registry that make it easy for scientists to deploy NVIDIA s accelerated computing platform for compute intensive research  end of NVIDIA press release excerpt While I really like the fact that some of my favorite cloud builders and AI innovators like Alibaba and Baidu are NVIDIA customers  I am even more impressed that Amazon and Microsoft are  Let s explore why   Volta is NVIDIA s latest advance in HPC architecture  It delivers over 100 Teraflops per second  TFLOPS  of deep learning performance  over a 5X increase compared to the prior generation NVIDIA Pascal architecture It s important to understand that NVIDIA doesn t just make HPC parallel processing chips for gaming  datacenter  AI  and other applications  The GPU chips with thousands of  cores  come embedded in some version of an overall platform known as CUDA  Compute Unified Device Architecture  which allows developers to immediately begin programming in a common language  say C    what they want the machine learning system to do So the NVIDIA GPU Cloud  NGC  container registry adds a new level of service and ease of use for corporations applying the technology  In short  NVIDIA has just outdone themselves again in winning over the developer and enterprise communities by creating an extended platform which simplifies software integrations Deep Learning is NVIDIA s BusinessStick with me on mapping who NVIDIA s customers are and  just as importantly  why they are  If you understand this end demand for the technology from the  who s who  of big tech companies  you will better appreciate the potential value of NVIDIA s growth segments and the coming explosion of AI applications that I am going to describe for you in the last two sections So  how does NVIDIA speak to both individual developers and massive enterprises  After they build a CUDA architecture  they make sure that data scientists  entrepreneurs  and organizations can use it In May  the company announced that their Deep Learning Institute was expanding the number and availability of programming courses at little or no cost with the goal of training 100 000 developers by the end of 2018 And on October 25  NVIDIA announced immediate availability of the NVIDIA  GPU Cloud  NGC  container registry for AI developers worldwide  Here was the word from that PR   In just a few steps  NGC helps developers get started with deep learning development through no cost access to a comprehensive  easy to use  fully optimized deep learning software stack The cloud based service is available immediately to users of the just announced Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  Amazon EC2  P3 instances featuring NVIDIA Tesla  V100 GPUs  NVIDIA plans to expand support to other cloud platforms soon After signing up for an NGC account  developers can download a containerized software stack that integrates and optimizes a wide range of deep learning frameworks  NVIDIA libraries and CUDA  runtime versions   which are kept up to date and run seamlessly in the cloud or on NVIDIA DGX  systems  The NVIDIA GPU Cloud democratizes AI for a rapidly expanding global base of users   said Jim McHugh  vice president and general manager of Enterprise Systems at NVIDIA   NGC frees developers from the complexity of integration  allowing them to move quickly to create sophisticated neural networks that deliver the transformative powers of AI   end of NVDA PR excerpt from Oct 25 Also at the SC17 Supercomputing Conference in Denver  where dozens of computer makers and cloud service providers launched a wide range of Volta based products and services  CEO and NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang proudly described what he must regard as their greatest  overall achievement    Volta is the world s most powerful platform for AI and HPC  and will allow the world s top minds in scientific research to push the limit on what s possible in areas like drug discovery  alternative fuel sources and predicting natural disasters  With Volta now in data centers and clouds around the world  a new wave of innovation is underway that will have an incredible impact across society  With  every major  computer and cloud provider adopting NVIDIA technology  the runway appears clear for continued 30  sales growth over the next 1 3 years How Far Will 50  Segment Growth Fly Before I break down NVIDIA s segment growth  let me share a few important notes on terminology   Inference  is the term used to describe the next level of machine learning after  training  Inference is sometimes referred to as deep learning  After scientists have  trained  a system on data  then they can have it apply the data set and knowledge to learn new things  Think of the initial training as establishing  weights  for data  baselines  and inference as advanced pattern recognition Gaming is still NVIDIA s biggest end market  claiming nearly 55  of the company s projected  9 4 billion in sales this year and still growing at over 25  annually  And gaming is still the largest global entertainment industry at over  100 billion in annual sales In September  I read several investment bank research reports which indicated that NVIDIA could continue to grow their cloud datacenter business at over 50  annually for the next 3 years  with sales projections ranging from  7 to  10 billion in 2020 just for this segment Q3 results delivered confirmation of that optimism with Volta adoption driving datacenter segment sales to  501 million  representing 20  sequential  quarter over quarter  and 109  annual  year over year  growth NVDA noted that there are now more than 1 200 companies using its Volta based inference platform  and this is why many Wall Street analysts are so enthusiastic about the continued growth in the datacenter space  especially since the total addressable market  TAM  is expected to push over  30 billion in the next 3 to 5 years Automotive is currently a small sales contributor for NVIDIA  at just under 10  of total revenues  But the segment is growing at nearly 50  as NVIDIA forms key partnerships in Europe  with Bosch and PACCAR  NASDAQ PCAR   and in China  with Baidu  to deliver autonomous driving technology Even cryptocurrency mining is a growth category for NVIDIA  although it may never contribute more than 10  of total sales The Biggest Market Yet for AI GPU parallel processing architectures will continue to sweep business away from old line CPU serial processing architectures in the computing market  Since gaming  datacenter  automotive and crypto mining are all parallel applications growing strong double digits  NVIDIA has a clear path to double revenues in the next 3 to 5 years But there are advanced computing markets on the horizon that many investors haven t thought much about yet  and probably some analysts haven t even incorporated these markets into their models To highlight one of them  I ve been in a surreal state of shock since I read a recent Bank of America  NYSE BAC  research report about Augmented Reality  In it  the BofA ML analysts calculate that last year s total market revenues tied to AR were  5 billion In 2020  they are forecasting this market to grow to  160 billion  That s a 3200  increase over 4 years  That s a CAGR  compound annual growth rate  of 138  I don t know what they see  but I like it Bottom line As artificial intelligence applications become embedded in so many industries and facets of life  so too will NVIDIA technology Disclosure  I own shares of NVDA  BABA  and BIDU for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think  Vulcan Materials is a construction sector stock I ve been talking and writing about    and trading    for many years since I grew up in a rural county that was rich in gravel and they were the primary excavator of aggregate for roads and cement Growing up in Crystal Lake  Illinois  we swam and fished in the  gravel pits  that other states might call a quarry While shares have soared 10  in the past 7 trading sessions    even surging on the first day of 2018 to a new 6 month high    analysts continue to lower earnings estimates  keeping VMC in the cellar of the Zacks Rank To give you an idea of the EPS slide  over two months ago the consensus for 2018 earnings slipped from  4 72 to  4 19 While that estimate drop was clearly absorbed in a strong economy expecting government infrastructure stimulus at some point  in the past 30 days  the Zacks consensus dropped again from  4 08 to  3 99  pushing VMC back down to a Zacks  5 Rank Strong Sell Clearly  the analysts see something that is less optimistic about the business and they continue to grow softer on the outlook And trading over 32 times that forward EPS estimate    as if it were a Tech stock    shares may have trouble getting over the big weekly resistance level around  135 Digging for the Aggregate PictureVulcan may have an earnings turn around in 2018  but right now we have no evidence of that coming down the pike  Estimates seem to always start out overly optimistic and then get lowered as the quarters pass and reality sets in And maybe a federal infrastructure bill is already priced in  We have no reason to believe otherwise given analyst sentiment Until we have more evidence  best to stay on the side of the road with Vulcan The Zacks Rank will let you know when the potholes are getting repaired in the VMC outlook Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like

Since Donald Trump s election there has been a sharp divergence in the performance of S P equities relative to Commodity prices  Traditionally  profitable companies sell more goods and services and enjoy higher equity prices  increased production of goods and services drive higher commodity prices as demand on finite resources increases  However  commodity prices have struggled to return to levels 20 years ago despite the S P trading at new multi year highs and at multiples it traded at 20 years ago  The divergence between commodity and equity prices since Trump s election has be driven by the removal and weakening of environmental standards by the current Administration following the appointment of climate change sceptic and industrial fave  Scott Pruit  to the EPA  But as with any legislative change  real change comes slowly and it s unlikely the current commodity discount and divergence can continue without some form of re alignment ",2018-01-07,Declan Fallon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/three-materials-stocks-for-2018-200278104,200278104

14040,235555,VMC,Why Is Caterpillar  CAT  Gaining Ahead Of Its Earning Report,opinion,"Shares of Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   rose on Monday after a BMO Capital Markets analyst upgraded the construction equipment giant  just one day before it reports its second quarter financial results 
BMO s Joel Tiss said in a note to clients on Monday that he expects Caterpillar will be positively impacted by a surge in global construction  among other optimistic factors  Tiss raised his price target from  110 to  125 per share 
Caterpillar s stock is up 1 43  through afternoon trading  and it peaked just  1 50 below its 52 week high earlier today  The company is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and scored an A for Momentum in our Style Scores system 
 A strong rebound in demand is likely a 2018 occurrence at the earliest  and the stock has historically jumped in earnest 9 12 months in advance of a cyclical pickup    to clients   If this pattern repeats  the shares could trade to our upside scenario  
According to   the BMO analyst also noted that he thinks shares of Caterpillar could  trade at a valuation that yields a long term upside target for the shares in the range of  208 to  224   If Caterpillar were able to double its stock price in the relatively near future  it would be an impressive move for a company with a market cap of  62 79 billion 
Tiss noted three major reasons why he raised his Caterpillar price target  The first factor was the possibility of a global recovery in the construction industry 
On top of that  the analyst pointed to Caterpillar s push to cut cost and focus on profitability going forward  The company s new CEO Jim Umpleby  who officially took over from former CEO Doug Oberhelman on January 1  is said to be driving this new cost cutting initiative with a focus on making the company profitable for investors 
Other Construction Stocks 
Caterpillar s big upgrade on Monday has helped other companies in the infrastructure and construction industry 
Shares of infrastructure company MasTec  Inc    NYSE MTZ    which operates heavily in the telecommunications sector  rose 2 65  through afternoon trading  The company reached just  0 40 below its 52 week high earlier today 
Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC   and Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM   were both up marginally in afternoon trading  Quanta Services  Inc    NYSE PWR    which works primarily with the oil  gas  and electrical industries  climbed 1 69  
However  some of the bigger infrastructure ETFs have not felt a boost from Caterpillar s upgrade  iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   WA ITB    SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF   and PowerShares Dynamic Building   Const ETF  were all down marginally in afternoon trading

14044,235559,VMC,U S  Concrete  Don t Let This Second Chance Pass,opinion,"Getting a second opportunity at a great set up is rare in the stock market  but U S Concrete Inc  NASDAQ USCR  may be offering just such a second chance 
In early September  I lamented missing an opportunity to buy USCR when it neatly tested support at the top of its last trading range   for the surge that confirmed support was a strong revision in the Q2 U S  GDP report that showed much larger growth for non residential fixed investment  In my related post  I scrutinized the GDP driver relative to U S  Concrete and was left unconvinced  The stock market seems to agree as it completed a reversal of the post GDP surge 

U S  Concrete  USCR  revisits a critical line of support formed by the top of the last trading range  Investors and traders reversed the June breakout once again 
I checked USCR s behavior against the other infrastructure stocks pegged for post GDP rallying  Vulcan Materials Company  NYSE VMC   Martin Marietta Materials  NYSE MLM   Summit Materials Inc  NYSE SUM   and Eagle Materials Inc  NYSE EXP   VMC and MLM completed their own reversals on Wednesday and seemingly confirmed that GDP effect was misunderstood by traders  Yet  SUM and EXP are still holding on to the majority of their gains  EXP looks particularly interesting because the post GDP rally led to a breakout above resistance at its 200 day moving average  DMA   That breakout was quickly confirmed 

Eagle Materials  EXP  confirmed a bullish breakout above 200DMA resistance 
EXP has  as it serves segments across cement  concrete and aggregates  gypsum wallboard  recycled paperboard  and oil and gas proppants  So the reason for EXP s resilience may go beyond infrastructure  the persisting rally may even have roots in expectations for hurricane recovery  I will be keeping a closer watch on EXP in coming weeks and into its next earnings report on or around October 24th 
USCR s gyrations are also loosely correlated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma  USCR has small operations in both impacted areas  Houston and the U S  Virgin Islands  I have not seen any word or press release from the company providing a damage assessment  The U S  Virgin Islands is of particular concern given   from CNBC  

 Hurricane Irma  one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century  tore its away across the U S  Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm on Sept  6  mixing together a deadly combination of winds and rising water 
Government officials and local residents alike are reporting the damage as catastrophic  and saying it will be months before the islands are able to recover 
 The infrastructure is destroyed  The roads are impassable  the power grid is completely gone  and there is a lot of looting and robbing It s just rubble in most of the areas   it almost looks like a bomb had exploded in the area   rebuilding the islands will start  from scratch   

With these kinds of descriptions it is hard to imagine that USCR escaped unscathed in the U S  Virgin Islands  Still  the revenues there represent a small fraction of USCR s overall business  So  I do not want to let this second test of support pass by me  The next milestone from here would be a test of uptrending support from the 200DMA around  69  A breach of that support would indicate to me the possibility that there is yet more to the story to explain the recent wild gyrations in the stock 
Be careful out there

14050,235565,VMC,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Vulcan  VMC ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Vulcan Materials  VMC   which belongs to the Zacks Building Products   Concrete and Aggregates industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This construction materials company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 20 73  
For the last reported quarter  Vulcan came out with earnings of  1 48 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 45 per share  representing a surprise of 2 07   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 33 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 46 per share  delivering a surprise of 39 39  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Vulcan lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Vulcan has an Earnings ESP of  8 24  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

ago period Also  the Decorative Architectural Products segment s revenues   which are expected to have benefited from Kichler Lighting and its propane initiative   are likely to increase 2 4  from the

meet the escalated demand for new homes and apartments What s Behind the Reasonable Pricing A tightening labor market driven by rise in income levels made new homes reasonablefor many Americans who had restrained from purchasing in the wake of the Great Recession  The U S  Department of Labor said that the average hourly earnings increased by 10 cents or 0 4  to  25 92 in October  which was

114158,335673,VMC,Vulcan Materials Aggregates Demand Rising    Time To Invest ,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC   on Jun 9  2016 
After a solid performance in 2015  Vulcan Materials started 2016 on a strong note wherein both its first quarter earnings and sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate amid strong demand trends in the construction end markets 
The company posted adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share  improving significantly year over year on the back of higher revenues and robust margins  Sales surged 20  year over year  backed by strong volumes as well as consistent pricing momentum in the Aggregates segment  
Despite weather related headwinds in California and Texas  aggregates shipments  volumes  rose 17  year over year driven by demand growth as a result of improving construction trends 
Backed by the strong first quarter results  the company raised its adjusted EBITDA and aggregates shipments guidance for 2016 
The company is witnessing a sharp increase in aggregates demand  backed by improvement in private construction demand   both residential and non residential  Moreover  large transportation projects and growth in contract work for highways has steadily increased the demand for Vulcan s products in the public construction market 
Construction activity and demand for aggregates continue to recover across all the markets in both private and public sector which  coupled with robust pricing momentum  should drive revenues for this construction aggregates company as the year progresses 
However  construction labor shortages and other bottlenecks are partially hurting demand growth  Moreover  Vulcan Materials is witnessing some below normal demand trends in some markets of Texas  like Houston  Nonetheless  the company enjoys strong fundamentals and should be able to withstand these short term headwinds and do well in 2016

from April New home inventory for sale was 244 000 units at the end of May  up 1 2  from end April  This is a 5 3 month supply at the current sales pace  up from the preceding month Though new home sales slowed down slightly  the rest of the housing data has been fairly upbeat  clearly indicating that the overall housing market remains intact  The number of building permits   a gauge of future

start this year amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals  The spring selling season in 2016 was better than last year  The springtime weather boosts construction activity and traffic trends Positives like an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance for the second half of 2016 This increase in home construction not only benefits homebuilders

Vitae Pharmaceuticals gapped higher in March in strong volume  It consolidated that move for 2 months in a wide range before racing higher  closing the gap down from March in the process  Since then it has been consolidating in a very tight range under the 200 day SMA  The RSI is in the bullish range and has reset from an overbought condition  The MACD has also reset lower  Look for a move over resistance to participate to the upside   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which saw the week marked by the Cavaliers winning the NBA title  and the Summer solstice ushering in the new season  with all well early in the week  then the Brexit vote changed all that as the equity markets  and all other markets dumped Friday  Leave it to the Brits to screw up a great week  just kidding   With a one day turn now equities look weak 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue higher while crude oil consolidates with a pullback in the uptrend  The US Dollar Index remains stuck in a sideways consolidation while US Treasuries are moving back higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are stuck in consolidative ranges with the Chinese market biased to break the range to the upside while Emerging Markets are biased to break theirs lower 
Volatility looks to remain elevated in the coming week keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs SPY  NYSE SPY   NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts all look better to the downside in the short term  with the QQQ at intermediate support and the SPY breaking its intermediate support  All 3 printed possible reversal candles though so stay nimble  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

114163,335678,VMC,Vulcan Materials  VMC  Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 1  before the opening bell 
Last quarter  Vulcan Materials posted a massive 333 3  positive earnings surprise 
In fact  the producer of constructionaggregates and other construction materials surpassed earnings estimates in all the last four quarters with an average surprise of 89 17  VULCAN MATLS CO Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Strong volumes as well as continued pricing momentum in the Aggregates segment drove strong sales and profits for Vulcan Materials in the first quarter  Backed by robust first quarter results  the company raised its adjusted EBITDA and aggregates shipments guidance for 2016at the first quarter conference call 
Construction activity and demand for aggregates continue to recover across all the markets in both private and public sector which coupled with strong pricing momentum  should support revenues further in the second quarter and forward 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Vulcan Materials is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  4 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 96 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at  1 00   
Zacks Rank  Vulcan Materials  carries a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the construction sector that can be considered as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
CalAtlantic Group  Inc    NYSE CAA    with an Earnings ESP of  9 21  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Louisiana Pacific Corp    NYSE LPX    with an Earnings ESP of  4 00  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Owens Corning   NYSE OC    with an Earnings ESP of  9 41  and a Zacks Rank  1 ",2016-07-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vulcan-materials-(vmc)-q2-earnings:-what's-in-the-cards-200144494,200144494
114192,335707,VMC,Martin Marietta  MLM  Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"We expect Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM   to beat expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the market opens 
Last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14 18  
The construction company posted negative earnings surprises in the past four quarters with the average being  16 55  

Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Martin Marietta is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate  38 cents per share  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  31 cents   stands at  22 58  for Martin Marietta  This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Martin Marietta has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings 
Conversely  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Martin Marietta s Zacks Rank  3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat 
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Martin Marietta performed below expectations in 2015 due to unfavorable weather conditions as well as the downturn in energy sector which offset the underlying momentum in the construction market 
Nevertheless  management remains quite optimistic about witnessing underlying demand growth and strong pricing in the first quarter and through the rest of the year  The company expects better volume growth in its key end markets   infrastructure and non residential construction markets 
An improving economy and job growth are expected to boost private construction activity in the U S  In non residential construction market  management expects increase in shipments across both light and heavy construction sectors 
Moreover  a multi year highway bill  five year   305 billion FAST Act  was enacted in Dec 2015  which increases funding certainty for state transportation programs  This  coupled with state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects  should result in increased aggregate intensive infrastructure activity in 2016 
In addition  robust pricing gains  synergies from the Texas Industries acquisition and higher infrastructure shipment volumes should support growth in the first quarter and beyond 
However  aggregate volume trends in the Texas market due to weakness in the oil gas industry could be somewhat slow

3 Construction Earnings to Watch This Week  VMC  MLM   WY

Spring 2016 has been really good for the construction stocks  Of the homebuilders  Lennar Corporation    and KB Home     were the first to report this earnings season with positive sales and earnings surprises 

PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2016  for the second quarter in a row  D R  Horton also displayed robust performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 with both earnings and sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
	Higher home sales drove the upside for both the companies  Both the companies are optimistic about the upcoming quarters of 2016  which they expect will be marked by strong housing demand 
	Though 2016 started on a shaky note for the construction sector  amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the housing fundamentals seem to be positive for the rest of the year  The construction stocks are expected to benefit from strong demand and traffic trends in the ongoing spring selling season  Most companies also seem quite optimistic about continued momentum through the rest of the year 
	However  some markets like Houston are dependent on the oil complex and the volatility in the energy sector is hurting the region s overall economic growth and in turn  home sales 
	An increase in home construction activity not only benefits homebuilders but also spurs demand for homebuilding materials  This  in turn  boosts the growth prospects of companies manufacturing these products 
	Three companies from the construction sector  Vulcan Materials  Martin Marietta Materials and Weyerhaeuser Company are set to report their quarterly results this week Vulcan Materials Company   
	Birmingham based construction materials company  Vulcan Materials Company is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 3  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company had posted a positive surprise of 23 33   Moreover  the company surpassed estimates in two out of the past four quarters  with in line earnings in the other two  resulting in an average positive surprise of 7 30  

The company has an  of  16 67  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 6 cents 
	After severe wet weather disrupted Vulcan s shipments in the first half of 2015  volumes improved in the latter half backed by increasing demand for construction materials  Moreover  pricing momentum remains robust  translating into expanding profit margins  The momentum is expected to continue in 2016 and drive revenues in the soon to be reported quarter as well 
	However  skilled labor shortages and a slight slowdown in demand trends in Texas can act as headwinds  Also management expects the effect of El Nino related rainfall to hurt aggregate shipments in early 2016 in California  Arizona and New Mexico  We may witness the said impact in the soon to be reported quarter   Read more    Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    
	Raleigh  NC based construction materials company Martin Marietta Materials is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14 18   The construction company posted negative earnings surprises in the past four quarters with the average being  16 55   The company has an Earnings ESP of  22 58  and a Zacks Rank  3  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 31 cents 

Martin Marietta Materials expects to witness underlying demand growth and strong pricing in the to be reported quarter and through the rest of the year  The company expects better volume growth in its key end markets   infrastructure and non residential construction markets 
	In addition  robust pricing gains  synergies from the Texas Industries acquisition and higher infrastructure shipment volumes should support growth in the first quarter and beyond

Weyerhaeuser expects its Timberlands and Wood Products segments to benefit from the ongoing recovery of the U S housing market  Also  its cost reduction initiatives will help it reduce controllable costs and improve earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization contributions from various businesses  In addition  the company s focus on improving its engineered lumber products and distribution businesses will act as tailwinds 
	However  Weyerhaeuser is exposed to risks arising from near term headwinds  including stiff competition  adverse currency translation and geopolitical issues  The Cellulose Fibers business is expected to remain weak in first quarter 2016  Also  the performance of the Timberlands segment will likely be in line with the preceding quarter   Read more

114200,335715,VMC,4 Housing Stocks To Buy On Soaring New Home Sales ,opinion,"New home sales hit a more than eight year high in April  crushing market expectations  Moreover  home prices surged to record levels  suggesting strong demand in the all important spring selling season 
Data released by the U S  Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development on May 24 showed that sales of new single family homes rose 16 6  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 19 000 units in April from an upwardly revised March  rate of 5 31 000  The number also represents a 23 8  increase year over year 
Moreover  the median sales price jumped 9 7  year over year to  321 100 in the month   the highest since 2014  The average sales price climbed 6  to  379 800   the highest rate so far this year 
However  inventory levels have been tightening  New home inventory for sale was 243 000 units at the end of April  down 0 4  from end March  This is a 4 7 month supply at the current sales pace  down from the March level 
Shares of major homebuilders rose on robust data  Toll Brothers  Inc    NYSE TOL   gained 8 7   PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM   was up 5 1   D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   went up by 4 2   KB Home   NYSE KBH   appreciated 7 5  and Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   rose 3 9  
A flurry of other housing data released so far this month has also been fairly upbeat  U S  housing starts rose 6 6  from a revised March number to an annual rate of 1 172 000 in April  surpassing market expectations  The number of building permits   a gauge of future construction   rose 3 6  in April  according to data released on May 17 
Further  the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  reported that the home builder sentiment index  HMI  remained flat at 58 in May for the fourth consecutive month  Moreover  existing home sales rose for the second straight month in April  per data released by the National Association of Realtors on May 20 
And to top it all  the Q1 performance across the broader construction sector was more or less better than expected  Leading homebuilders  Lennar and KB Home   the early birds   set the tempo for the season with positive sales and earnings surprises  Other industry bigwigs like Pulte and D R  Horton also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales on the back of higher home sales  Toll Brothers  which reported its second quarter fiscal 2016 results on Tuesday  also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales 
Almost all homebuilders agree that the spring selling season was off to a good start with strong demand and traffic trends  The companies are also optimistic that the growth momentum will be sustained through the rest of the year 
Despite a weak start this year amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals  Positives like an improving economy  rising wages  favorable job outlook and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance for the rest of 2016 
This increase in home construction not only benefits homebuilders but also spurs demand for homebuilding materials  home decoration products and other related businesses  This  in turn  boosts the growth prospects of companies manufacturing these products like Vulcan Materials Co    NYSE VMC    Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM    Masco Corp    NYSE MAS   Headwaters Inc    NYSE HW   and many others  They too performed generally well in Q1

Conclusion
Land and labor shortage is a valid concern for homebuilders and so are tedious underwriting standards  And you can t wish away competition that can at times get fierce and ignore cost inflation  Nonetheless  homebuilders in general are on a high at the moment given the rising demand trends

114239,335754,VMC,The Week Ahead  Will Economic News Alter Fed Policy ,opinion,"The economic calendar includes an avalanche of important data in the coming week  The daily economic news  culminating in the jobs report on Friday  will dominate the market discussion  The popularity of parsing everything through the lens of Fed policy creates a special situation  Pundits will ask 
Will the economic data alter Fed policy  
Prior Theme Recap
In last week s WTWA I predicted that the punditry would focus on housing data and economic impacts with a brief diversion for the Yellen testimony  That was as good call  since the housing debate bracketed the testimony and still followed our themes at week s end  especially on CNBC programming  Josh Brown s excellent article    captures the spirit of the discussion  Regular readers know that I have long recommended viewing pent up demand  reason  2  along with shadow inventory  All ten reasons are interesting 
Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
The upcoming week is loaded with interesting data  more than we often see in two weeks and including the most important reports  With Fed Chair Yellen s testimony fresh in our minds  it will be natural to combine questions about the Fed with interpretation of the data 
Will the Economic Data Alter the Fed s plan  
The Viewpoints 
Here are the key viewpoints on the economy and Fed policy 
The Fed is on course to raise interest rates this year   that the current balance sheet effect  without any more buying  is 110 bps on the 10 Year yield  This leaves room to normalize rates 
The Fed will remain data dependent  with a possible delay until next year    
The Fed will be forced to initiate more QE   Critics fearing deflation  
The Fed has undermined all data  It is hopelessly  behind the curve  from a failure to raise rates earlier   Critics fearing hyperinflation  
Critics of all flavors were represented during Chair Yellen s Congressional testimony  The same economic data will be viewed quite differently depending upon the viewing lens  Bob Dieli emphasizes the inflation test as especially important and provides an interesting chart to consider the timing of the first rate hike 

As always  I have some additional ideas in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was some good news last week 
Progress in Greece  The four month delay was agreed upon 
Inflation is still subdued  And no  it is not a deflationary threat   
Weekly jobless claims dipped  Back below 300K  Calculated Risk  and charts the significance 
Q4 GDP was revised lower  but beat expectations at 2 2   While the market sold off later in the day  this did not seem to be a major factor  Some were encouraged at the reasons for the revisions  including a lower inventory effect  Doug Short has  of the effect of each component 

Durable goods orders beat expectations   has a complete analysis  including a longer trend and some caveats 
Earnings reports strengthened  The blended growth rate is 3 7   Companies beating estimates are seeing solid stock price increases       is pretty optimistic about the picture for 2015 focusing on increases in the bottom up estimates 
The chemical activity index  We always appreciate updates from  Davidson    The correlation suggests  a rise in equity prices for the next 12 months or so  

Michigan sentiment rebounded to 95 4  This is slightly off the recent high  but still very strong 
Pending home sales hit 18 month highs     This is a forward looking indicator  but Bill remains concerned about NAR sales estimates  He has an  noting major revisions in seasonal adjustments for the West region 
The Bad
There was also some discouraging economic news 
Fund managers are bullish  This is negative on a contrarian basis     Contra from   tracking financial bloggers  Both sources have interesting charts  so make up your own mind  I am scoring this with the standard contrarian interpretation 
Jobless claims rose dramatically to 313K  the most since December  2013  This is an important series  but difficult to track with moving holidays like President s Day    
Ukraine cease fire is in jeopardy  hanging by a  hair trigger      This is a continuing human tragedy and a major drag on the world economy 
Existing home sales disappointed  the lowest level since May  2014   that the best investment properties have traded and the baton must now be passed to first time buyers   a crucial shift  Other observers blame low inventory    
The Ugly 
Congress is back in action  Or inaction  With minutes to spare before funding would end for the Department of Homeland Security  Congress managed a one week funding extension  This means that we get to watch the entire story again next week  Groundhog Day was a month ago  Even Greece and the Germans managed a four month extension 
And following up from a prior  Ugly  the  gets worse 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger 
This week s award goes to  of Convergex  Cola takes on the oft cited Jeff Gundlach slide deck on the 2015 outlook  Gundlach states that equities have never risen for seven years in a row since 1871  The Convergex analysis  while quite deferential  demonstrates that Gundlach is inaccurate in several respects  The points are all nicely documented and   The conclusion is that several more years of rally would not be a surprise 
 Note more discussion of bull markets and old age in today s final thought  
Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  For more information on each source   

Recent Expert Commentary on Recession Odds and Market Trends
  A variety of strong quantitative indicators for both economic and market analysis  While we feature the recession analysis  Dwaine also has a number of interesting market indicators  This week he notes an   although the levels are still not yet worrisome 
  An update of the regular ECRI analysis with a good history  commentary  detailed analysis and charts  If you are still listening to the ECRI  three years after their recession call   you should be reading this carefully  Doug has the latest interviews as well as discussion  Also see Doug s  summary of key indicators 
  has developed an array of interesting systems  Check out his site for the full story  We especially like his   confirming that there is no recession signal  Georg continues to develop new tools for market analysis and timing  including a  to and from the S P 500  I am following his results and methods with great interest  You should  too 
Bob Dieli does a   subscription required  after the employment report and also a monthly overview analysis  He follows many concurrent indicators to supplement our featured  C Score  
This week s report is chock full of insights and ideas  Here is Bob s take on last week s theme  housing 

James Picerno  a leading business cycle expert   on too few  cherry picked  indicators  He cites a statement that the housing recovery is faltering  His thoughtful article has several great examples  leading him to conclude as follows 

On that note  recession risk is still quite low  based on a broad review of the published numbers  Yes  the housing market may be an early sign of trouble  ditto the weak trend in commodity prices  But there are many positives one could point to as well  But it s ridiculous to get into a tit for tat debate my indicators are better than yours  The emphasis should be on developing superior multi factor business cycle benchmarks  Fortunately  there s no shortage of efforts on this crucial work  The bad news is that you re not likely to read about it unless you re looking beyond the usual suspects 

Sad  but true  The story that  all is well  does not get much attention 
The Week Ahead
It will be a big week for economic data 
The  A List  includes the following 
Employment report  F   The most watched economic indicator  despite the wide error band and revisions 
ISM Index  M   Important concurrent economic read with some leading qualities 
Personal income and spending  M   Will the bonus from lower gas prices show up 
PCE prices  M   Favorite Fed inflation indicator 
Auto sales  T   Good non government verification of spending  Weather effects last month 
Initial jobless claims  Th   The best concurrent news on employment trends  with emphasis on job losses 
ADP private employment  W   Deserved recognition as a solid independent measurement of job growth 
The  B List  includes the following 
ISM services index  W   Less history than the manufacturing index  but now covering more of the economy 
Beige book  W   Anecdotal economic evidence that the FOMC will use at the next meeting  If you are a veteran of the Art Cashin era you may call this the  tan book  
Trade balance  F   Impact of oil prices should be evident 
Construction spending  M   January data  but an important growth measure 
Factory orders  Th   January data for this volatile series 
Crude oil inventories  W   Maintains recent interest and importance 
There is not much FedSpeak  but plenty on the international affairs front 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Felix has continued a  bullish  posture for the three week market forecast  The data have improved a bit  but are only slight better than the recent neutral readings  There is reduced uncertainty  reflected by the falling percentage of sectors in the penalty box  Our current position is still fully invested in three leading sectors  and we remain aggressive  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com 
This week s special advice for traders comes from two of my favorite sources    The basic idea is the importance of not over fitting your trading models  The important technique is to resist temptation to add many variables for slight theoretical improvements in performance  My partner Vince calls this  pruning   It is the key to what he calls a  robust  model  When you are looking at a new trading system it is one of the key things to consider  Less is more 
As I have noted for seven weeks  Felix continues to feature selected energy holdings  The focus has shifted from refiners  to producers  to natural gas during this time  Solar stocks have also earned a high rating 
Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links 
We also have a new page summarizing many of the   If you read something scary  this is a good place to do some fact checking 
My bold and contrarian prediction for 2015   that the leading sectors would lose and the laggards would win   still looks promising  I also see plenty of time left in this economic and stock cycle 
Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
Personal Finance 
The Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa BRKb   is a must read for investors  If you cannot spare the time to read all 42 pages  see pp  18 19 for an explanation about why to prefer stocks to bonds in the long run  The risk often comes from our own behavior 

Investors  of course  can by their own behavior  make stock ownership highly risky  And many do  Active trading  attempts to  time  market movements  inadequate diversification  the payment of high and unnecessary fees to managers and advisors  and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life long owner of equities would otherwise enjoy  Indeed  borrowed money has


No place in the investor s tool kit  Anything can happen anytime in markets  And no advisor  economist  or TV commentator   and definitely not Charlie nor I   can tell you when chaos will occur  Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet 

And also see page 34 35  Mr  Buffett advises at least a five year time horizon for those buying his stock  He also explains the reason for keeping adequate cash reserves  counting Treasuries  

The reason for our conservatism  which may impress some people as extreme  is that it is entirely predictable that people will occasionally panic  but not at all predictable when this will happen  Though practically all days are relatively uneventful  tomorrow is always uncertain   I felt no special apprehension on December 6  1941 or September 10  2001   And if you can t predict what tomorrow will bring  you must be prepared for whatever it does 


A CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have only a tiny chance of happening in a given year  He may  in fact  be  right  99  of the time  Those odds  however  hold no appeal for us  We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you ve entrusted to us  even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet  In our view  it is madness to risk losing what you need in pursuing what you simply desire 

 is on the same theme 

The noise box in your den  and on the wall of your trading room  has been tallying a catalog of potential crises and hazards  That parade of terribles seems to be getting longer each day  Although none of them are new  it is as if all of them have suddenly risen in unison  a chorus of noise  funk and angst  Markets are expensive  the Federal Reserve s stimulus of quantitative easing and zero interest rates is ending  the euro is collapsing  deflation is a threat  rates are rising  residential real estate is a mess  biotech is a bubble  oil prices are plunging  Grexit will arrive any day

Market Outlook 
 has another great column  this time on the forecasting failures of Wall Street analysts  He cites the chart below from Birinyi Associates concludes as follows 

Finance is much closer to something like sociology  It s barely a science  and driven by irrational  uninformed  emotional  vengeful  gullible  and hormonal human brains 


If you think of finance as being akin to physics when it s actually closer to sociology  forecasting becomes a nightmare The most important thing to know to accurately forecast future stock prices is what mood investors will be in in the future  Will people be optimistic  and willing to pay a high price for stocks  Or will they be bummed out  panicked about some crisis  pissed off at politicians  and not willing to pay much for stocks  You have to know that  It s the most important variable when predicating future stock returns  And it s unknowable  There is no way to predict what mood I ll be in 12 months from now  because no matter what you measure today  I can ignore it a year from now  That s why strategists have such a bad record 


Worse than a Blind Forecaster 


No wonder Mr  Buffett recommends a five year horizon 
 weighs in on the same theme using a great success story 
Perception and Psychology 
You probably get involved in the debate over  the dress  and what color it is  For the full story   Market Watch s  with his  Need to Know  column  Perhaps more than anyone I appreciate how difficult this is   something like a daily WTWA  He also contribute other pieces like  on the Internet debate over the dress  Mrs  OldProf and I disagreed on this one  as did our team at the office  If you managed to miss it  take a look and decide for yourself  There are some important investment lessons 
No matter how simple the question  people see things differently 
We do not understand the foundation for our perceptions   not even recognizing why they differ from those of others 
No wonder people see the same chart  or the same balance sheet  and draw different conclusions 
Buyers and sellers at the same price

Consistent with our Silver Bullet award is this excellent article from   warning about extreme viewpoints and stubborn adherence thereto  He suggests that the bull market has another  816 million to go 
Final Thought
One of my regular themes is the difference in time frames between traders and investors 
Traders parse everything through the lens of Fed policy  HFT algorithms look for key words and front run the humans  Human traders do the same thing   but more slowly  The blog posts hit   explaining  why the Fed will change course 
If you are a trader  you have a tough job competing in this game 
Investors are free to ignore the immediate psychological reaction and to consider the fundamentals  Here are the most important two points 
The exact timing of the first Fed rate increase does not matter  There is a difference between tight monetary policy and slightly less accommodative policy  Markets do quite well in the early stages of rising rates  especially when starting from a low initial point  This will be ignored by many who will invoke  Don t fight the Fed   This will be the fundamental battleground between traders and investors  bears and bulls  and various political types   perhaps lasting for years 
The end of the business or stock market cycle is not imminent  Bull markets do not die of old age  Investors should understand that this one might run for many years  There are many famous and successful investors who have explained this  but I especially like this year old analysis from   It happened just as a famous technical analyst noted that markets were at  an inflection point  not unlike the 1929 crash   See also  ",2015-03-01,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-will-the-economic-news-alter-fed-policy-243405,243405

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week the thermometer is getting hotter and the so are the equity markets with the QQQ leading the charge 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower along with crude oil next week  The US Dollar Index is breaking out higher and US Treasuries may be ready to reverse higher as well  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both reversing higher and the coming week could determine if it is Dead Cat Bounces or the real deal 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and with a bias lower build a tailwind behind the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  The QQQ looks very strong as it approaches the all time highs of 2000 while the SPY is also strong and on the edge of a break out  The IWM looks the weakest as it moves sideways in a new consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
