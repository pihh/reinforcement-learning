214511,436027,VZ,Cable Companies Could Be a Threat to Verizon s Wireless Business,news,"At the time it probably seemed like a great idea  Verizon  NYSE VZ  has unused capacity built into its wireless network  and it can t convert every single person in the United States into a Verizon Wireless customer  It may as well monetize its network s excess by letting cable giants Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  and Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  use it as the backbone for their fledgling wireless services 
But in retrospect  maybe it wasn t the best idea after all  Although the two companies  wireless businesses combined still don t hold a candle to Tracfone  Verizon s biggest third party user of its network   it only took the two newcomers a couple of years to catch up with the nation s second biggest reseller of cellphone service  That s Consumer Cellular  with its three million customers  give or take 
If nothing else  the sheer pace of Comcast s and Charter s growth should prompt Verizon to consider that it s feeding what will become serious competitors 
Wholesale wireless service
They re called a mobile virtual network operator  or MVNO for short  The term simply refers to cellular service providers that don t actually own the network they plug their customers into 
Rather  these small providers lease access to wireless networks operated by bigger names like Verizon and AT T  and take care of their own billing  selling  and customer service  Tracfone  Net10  Boom Mobile  Straight Talk  and Expo Mobile are just some of the MVNOs that utilize Verizon s network 

It also includes Comcast s Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile  both of which launched using Verizon s infrastructure  and both of which still appear to be exclusively using Verizon s network 
Most importantly  both are making inroads with consumers very rapidly  Charter began offering cell phone service in the third quarter of 2018  and now serves a little more than one million subscribers  Comcast s service started in the second quarter of 2017  and it s signed up more than two million customers 

That s only a fraction of Verizon s 94 5 million wireless customers reported as of the end of 2019  which boasts numbers similar to rival AT T s  But the pace is the concern  particularly in light of the advantage cable names stumbled into 
New wireless connectivity isn t totally wireless
The technology of combining WiFi connectivity and physical wires to keep cellphones linked to a network is something most major wireless carriers have tinkered with  as the number of connected devices has exploded and put a strain on spectrum  But the switch  or  handoff  from one connection type or hub to another  has proven tricky and expensive 
Surprisingly  cable companies have had the solution all along  The physical lines they own running down the street to your house can be readily adapted to serve as WiFi antennas called strand mounted small cells  And Comcast s and Charter s broadband customers may not even realize they re actually utilizing their home wifi when using their smartphones while at home  This mixed connection approach is a far more economical one to operate  letting cable companies into the mobile phone business without complete reliance on others  networks 
And yes  Comcast and Charter have every intention of extracting the benefits of scaling up this hybrid approach  As Charter CEO Tom Rutledge plainly stated during the company s third quarter earnings call   We re uniquely positioned to take advantage of wireline and wireless network convergence over time with our fully distributed wireline network  
Moffett Nathanson s analysts believe the cable giants may be thinking in more mercenary terms  though  In October  the firm suggested that Charter may choose to buy citizens broadband radio service  CBRS  spectrum to develop a partial wireless network in places where doing so would yield a strong return on the investment  Yet  the company would continue to utilize Verizon s network in areas where the return on an investment in a home grown network would be weak 
Exactly what sort of savings this hybrid approach might produce depends on several factors  But Moffett Nathanson s report puts things in perspective  stating that  We suspect that Altice is already assuming they can offload as much as half of their traffic onto strand mounted small cells  allowing them to sell unlimited plans for just  20 per month  
The same report went on to say  Even without core network control under the Verizon MVNO contract  Charter  and Comcast  look poised to pursue the same strategy by leveraging eSIMS and  in their case  their own strand mounted small cells   jibing with Rutledge s comment 
If Comcast or Charter can get anywhere close to selling a mobile service for  20 per month  even if it s just to existing internet customers   even the most loyal Verizon customers will have something to think about 
Put it on your radar
It s not an existential threat to Verizon  at least not yet  But it eventually could be 
The MVNO wholesale industry took shape at a time when the only way to make a mobile phone work was with a direct connection to a tower with a licensed radio frequency  That limitation is no longer in place  and cable companies  infrastructure leaves them well positioned to offer cheap wireless service 
Verizon is in a particularly difficult situation  as Comcast and Charter are content to let Verizon tackle the difficult  less rewarding part of their job just so they can poach its customers ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptr9f,2081631

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning  and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions  If you have any objections  you may disconnect at this time  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host  Mr  Brady Connor  Senior Vice President  Investor Relations Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor Relation Technical Issues  As a reminder  our earnings release  financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website  A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website  Before we get started  I d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement on slide two  Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties  Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon s filings with the SEC  which are available on our website  This presentation contains certain non GAAP financial measures  Reconciliations of these non GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year over year basis  unless otherwise noted  as sequential  In addition to our comments today  on February 13  Verizon will be hosting an Investor Day in New York City and will be webcasting presentations by Hans and the leadership team  More information about the event will be posted on our IR website  As a reminder  we re in the middle of a millimeter wave spectrum auction  so we will not be able to comment on our current millimeter wave spectrum holdings or strategy  Now let s take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year  In the fourth quarter  we reported earnings of  1 23 per share  resulting in full year earnings of  4 65 per share on a GAAP basis Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pre tax loss from special items of approximately  2 4 billion  including an early debt extinguishment charge of  2 1 billion  an impairment charge of  236 million  primarily related to the writedown of goodwill within our media business  and a net charge related to severance and annual mark to market for our pension and OPEB liabilities of  135 million  In addition  we recorded a  2 2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate  The cash impact related to the tax benefit of this sale will be realized in 2020  Excluding the effects of these special items  adjusted earnings per share was  1 13 in the fourth quarter  up 0 9  compared to  1 12 a year ago  Full year adjusted earnings per share was  4 81  up 2 1  compared to  4 71 a year ago  Let s now move to slide four and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile The impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition and ASC 842 for leases continued throughout 2019  As we illustrated in previous quarters we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of commission expense  The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year over year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share which will continue throughout 2020  The impact was  0 03 for the fourth quarter and  0 12 for the full year  For 2020  we expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately  0 09  In addition to ASC 606  accounting standard ASC 842 for leases  which was implemented at the beginning of 2019  results in a gross up on the balance sheet for all operating leases This new leasing standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain upfront lease costs  creating a headwind of  0 01 in the fourth quarter and  0 05 for the full year  We do not expect a year over year impact from the lease standard in 2020  Full year adjusted EPS growth of 2 1   illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide  reflects strong underlying performance of the business  partially offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of the leasing standard  Additional details of our quarterly performance will be covered by Matt later in this call Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Brady  and thank you  everyone  for joining this fourth quarter earnings call  Let me summarize quickly a little bit everything we have done in 2019  which is building a great fundamental for 2020  The transformation is built on a network  process changes  brand changes  go to market changes  and of course  also a lot of new talent coming into our team  All that we re doing during 2019  We ve fortified our network with new architecture  We had a lot of product changes with a voluntary program  We rebranded and put one brand for everything we re doing in the company  We made a new go to market  including new management teams  That has been a big change in the company that is solidifying our way of accessing the market an even better way in 2020  So all that s happening  we continue to actually execute well on our day to day business  Our network continues to be the best in the market We just had new confirmation from J D  Power  RootMetrics that again our network  our 4G network is clearly the best in the market  Very happy with the team that they keep up that work  The other thing that we have been very focused on is of course to continue to lead the market in wireless and for consumers  And here we re seeing Ronan Dunne and his team continue with a good pacing  Unlimited came out with new offerings seeing that our customer getting optionality  optionality when it comes to the wireless offering  but also on the cable side within mix and match that we came out with earlier this year We also added in a lot of partnership as we now have network service as a strategy  We added in the Apple Music and more lately  of course  we included with Disney   Both of them has been a win win for both our partners  for our customers  and for Verizon  And this is the strategy we want to have going forward On the business side  we also did a lot of important partnerships where we had the same model  I think about the partnership with  for example  AWS Amazon on the 5G mobile edge compute  again  a totally new way of accessing a market that we have not been into  And speaking about 5G  we had our commitment  30 cities  We made 31  We said we re going to launch 5G Home with the NR standard  We did that  and we said we re going to launch the first 5G mobile edge compute  We did that in Chicago in December  So all in all  a year with so much execution  and at the same time  continue to achieve what we want to do  And we round that up with our financials in the year end operational metrics  I m really happy to report that we had our best year since 2013 when it comes to phone net adds  a growth of 28  year over year  And again  that is how our team has been working with a new model And on the financial side  we continue to see that we had a good wireless service revenue over the year with 3 2  for the full year  which is the highest since 2014  And when it comes to our profitability  our EPS was up 2 1  within 2019 for the full year  And we continue to create strong cash flow  which is  of course  giving us the flexibility going forward to see that we can execute on our strategy  Ultimately  consumer group continued to have a very good year in 2019 with everything they re doing  The Verizon business group have  of course  the headwinds when it comes to the secular decline in the Wireline side at the same time as we re investing more in that area  We re investing in processes  tools and structures  And why is that important  It s so important because this is one of the greatest opportunities for growth for us when it comes to 5G and how we address the market And I can tell you  during 2019  I met so many large corporations that we now can actually work with because our offering is so strong when it comes to fiber and 5G  But we need to put that structure in place for the Verizon business group in order for them to actually both execute on the revenue side  but also on the cost side  And that s really what we re focused on  Ultimately  I think we have created a very strong fundamental for going into 2020  And if you think about our priorities for 2020  first of all  continue to grow on the core business  I mean  we showed this year we can continue to grow 4G and our core businesses  and that we ll continue to do in 2020 as well  including building our network to be the best network in this market  Secondly is leveraging our new assets that we re building  We re building on fiber  We re building our 5G and seeing that we can start leveraging that with our customer And I think that this year  we ll continue to have a lot of focus on our 5G build and what we re doing in 5G  and we will come back to that later on how we see the 5G market when we will have an Investor Day later in February  So the third priority in 2020 is around our financials and our discipline there  And the ambition is to accelerate the growth in revenue and EPS in 2020 and continue to create strong cash flow as we did in 2019  But it s also to continue to have the discipline and efficiency in our capex and opex spend  That s very important because this is really driving us going forward being able to execute on our strategy  And the four priorities around our customer centricity and our purpose driven company  both are very important to engage with all our stakeholders  if it s the society  our employees or customers  to have that in our genes in the company every day  Here  we will drive a lot around thinking about the customers  giving them optionality as we did in 2019 We will just continue to do that  And when it comes to our responsibility to drive a responsible business  we laid out a lot of things in 2019  what we want to do  and combine our responsibility of our society with our strategy  We think that is strengthening us  as a company  to all our stakeholders  And ultimately  that will create even more value for all our stakeholders  So all in all  I think we have a really good platform coming into 2020 We are excited for it  and we hope that all of you are excited for 2020 as well  So by that  I hand over to Matt Matthew D  Ellis    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Hans  and good morning  everyone  We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results  In the fourth quarter  consolidated operating revenue was  34 8 billion  up 1 4   Service revenue remains the primary driver of growth  driven by volumes and step ups in access  partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and secular declines in revenue from our wireline products and services predominantly in our business segment  At the beginning of the year  we provided consolidated revenue guidance of low single digit percentage revenue growth for 2019  For the year  total revenue grew 0 8   including a 3 1  decline in wireless equipment revenue Adjusted EBITDA was  11 1 billion as compared to  11 6 billion last year  The headwinds mentioned earlier from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard lowered EBITDA by  239 million  which is approximately a 70 basis point impact on EBITDA margin in the quarter  These results reflect continued strong margin performance in consumer despite a meaningful increase in volumes and secular weakness in the wireline portion of the business segment  Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled  47 2 billion  and EBITDA margin was 35 8   slightly lower than last year s margin of 36 2   Full year adjusted EBITDA included headwinds of approximately 70 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard  which overshadowed our improved operational performance in 2019  Through our Business Excellence program We have realized cumulative cash savings of  5 7 billion and are on track to achieve our goal of  10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021  The Voluntary Separation Program resulted in approximately  1 3 billion of expense savings this year  and we have been at our full run rate of savings for the last two quarters of the year  Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was  1 13  up 0 9  from  1 12 a year ago  We achieved our 2019 goal of low single digit growth by posting a full year adjusted EPS of  4 81  representing a yearly growth rate of 2 1   including the  0 17 headwind related to ASC 606 and 842 that Brady mentioned earlier  Let s now turn to cash flow results on slide eight  We had strong cash flows in 2019  which allowed us to continue our focus on investing in our networks  increasing our dividend for the 13th straight year and strengthen the balance sheet The year over year increase in CFFO was due to operational improvements and lower discretionary employee benefit contributions  partially offset by higher cash tax payments and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program  Capital expenditures for 2019 totaled  17 9 billion and well within our guided range of  17 billion to  18 billion  Capital spending for the year was driven primarily by our fiber deployment in 60 plus markets outside of our ILEC footprint and the build out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network  Additionally  we continue to support growth in data and video traffic on our industry leading 4G LTE network and the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture  Free cash flow for the year was  17 8 billion  up 0 7  year over year  Our balance sheet continued to strengthen with our net unsecured debt down  3 7 billion year over year Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio rounds down to 2 0x versus our targeted range of 1 75 to 2 0x  We remain focused on reducing our secured debt portfolio into our targeted range while continuing to actively manage our near term maturities  optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital  As part of this management of the balance sheet  we conducted liability management transactions in the quarter and throughout the year  which will reduce our interest expense going forward  Now let s review our operating segment results  starting with Consumer on slide nine  Our Consumer segment entered the fourth quarter with strong momentum  The combination of the new mix and match pricing  attractive device promotions Our award winning network and the new Disney  partnership drove continued success in the fourth quarter amid a competitive holiday season  We are extremely pleased with the early uptake on Disney  and the ability to partner with an iconic consumer brand and content company to bring even greater value to our unlimited customers  As a result  fourth quarter fund gross adds were up 9 3  year over year  and postpaid phone net adds were 588 000  up 12 6  year over year  Phone churn of 0 83  was up six basis points from a year ago  consistent with our expectations and reflecting the elevated competitive activity across the industry  A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide  Total postpaid device activations were flat from prior year at 9 5 million  including 7 9 million phones  Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 6 3  Down from 6 6  a year ago  reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle  Fios Internet net additions of 35 000 were up sequentially and down year over year  Our customers see value in our high quality broadband offering  paired with multiple choices for video  such as Fios TV  YouTube TV and Disney   Fios Video net losses for the quarter totaled 51 000  Earlier this month  we launched Mix   Match on Fios  providing customers with choice  transparency and the opportunity to only pay for the services they want  Now let s move to slide 10 to discuss the consumer financial performance  We continue to see growth in consumer operating revenues through our updated service offerings in Wireless and Fios  which were offset by modest declines in wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in copper based wireline services  Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were  24 2 billion and for the full year were  91 1 billion Which were up 2  and 1 4   respectively  We are utilizing tools such as pricing and partnerships to add to our value proposition and drive further increases in wireless service revenue and ARPA  Customers recognize the value of being connected to their best network in order to consume services or operate new devices  As customers require additional data  we seek to drive step ups to unlimited plans from meter plans  step ups within unlimited to higher tier plans and increasing connections per account  Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was  13 4 billion  a 1 9  increase and  53 8 billion for the full year  We expect to see further subscriber growth as we continue to effectively compete in the marketplace and from continued migrations to unlimited as approximately 50  of our customer base is still on meter data plans  In the fourth quarter Consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 2 1  as pressure from promotional offerings and lower upgrade volumes more than offset the increase in phone gross adds  For the full year  equipment revenue decreased 4 4   driven primarily by lower upgrade volumes  Consumer Fios revenue remained relatively flat due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings  offsetting the impact of reductions in video subscribers  Consumer segment EBITDA margin was 39 9  in the quarter  down 130 basis points from last year  including headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard  For the full year  EBITDA margins were 44 3   including headwinds of approximately 85 basis points  The consumer segment demonstrated in 2019 that it can increase customer volumes while continuing to produce strong margins Now let s move to our business segment on slide 11  Business wireless trends remained strong throughout the year  Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up 10 5  from the prior year primarily with the small and medium business and public sector  contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 202 000  which were up 54 2  from the prior year  A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide  Our continued strong customer loyalty across the business segment led to phone churn of 1  in the quarter  which was up two basis points sequentially and down seven basis points over the prior year  Total postpaid device activations in the quarter were up 7 1  over the prior year  while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5  versus 5 3  in the prior year  Let s now move to slide 12 to review our business financial performance Operating revenues for the business segment in the fourth quarter were up approximately 1  over the prior year  Wireless revenue growth of 8 4  was partially offset by wireline product revenue declines  Wireless service revenue grew 7   driven primarily by small and medium business customers  From a customer group perspective  small and medium business revenue increased 7 9  over the prior year  driven by wireless service revenue growth of more than 11  and double digit Fios growth  partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services  Global enterprise revenues declined 1 6   driven by legacy wireline pricing pressure and technology shifts  Public sector and other revenue decreased 1 6  as growth in wireless products and services was offset by wireline declines Wholesale revenues declined by 10 6   driven by price compression and volume declines in legacy wireline products  which we expect to continue  Business segment EBITDA margin was 20 7  in the quarter  down 260 basis points from last year  including headwinds of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense in the lease accounting standard  The reductions in margins year over year are due to the growth in wireless activations  reductions in wireline revenues and the investments we are making in the business  such as the launch of our business ready marketing campaign and the transformation of our go to market processes  Now let s move on to slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group  Verizon Media Group continued to make good progress in the quarter  Total revenue was  2 1 billion  which was essentially flat versus the prior year  a meaningful improvement from the decline reported at the beginning of the year While we have more work to do  we are very pleased with the results and the foundation we are building for future growth  Native advertising and our demand side platform continued to gain traction  mitigating the ongoing declines in legacy desktop search revenue streams  Let s now move to slide 14  which reconciles Verizon 2 0 results to our legacy Verizon 1 0 results  As we close out 2019  we are providing a reconciliation to legacy 1 0 results for the last time  The charts on this slide reconcile revenue and EBITDA from our consumer and business segments back to wireless and wireline  The top chart shows consumer revenues of  24 2 billion in the quarter  After removing consumer wireline and adding back business wireless  we had total wireless revenues of  25 3 billion with EBITDA margin of 41  The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from business to wireline results  starting with business revenue of  8 1 billion and arriving at total wireline revenue of  7 1 billion in the quarter  down 4 1  from the prior year  EBITDA margins were 11 9   down from 17 6  last year  The factors impacting wireline margins are largely the same as those highlighted in the business segment  most notably  the ongoing pressure from legacy wireline product revenue declines and the investments to drive future growth  You can find additional detail in our supplemental information included on our website  Let s now move to slide 15 to discuss the wireless results  Total wireless operating revenues increased 3 5  and to  25 3 billion in the fourth quarter  driven by a 2 7  increase in service revenue and benefits from the total mobile protection pricing action taken in the third quarter The fourth quarter performance was below our targeted range  primarily as a result of higher base optimization into new pricing plans  which we believe is stabilizing  and the impact of increased gross adds on our promotional expense that amortized reservice revenue  For the full year  wireless service revenue grew 3 2   driven by retail postpaid ARPU growth of 2 5  and a 27 8  increase in phone net adds  Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 41   This includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points  primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard  We are proud of this result  particularly given the strong volumes driven in the quarter  Continuing the momentum from the third quarter  phone gross adds were up 9 6  to 3 1 million  Postpaid phone net adds for the quarter was 790 000 Which were up from 653 000 a year ago  marking our highest fourth quarter phone net add performance in the last six years  Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter were 969 000  up 11  from the prior year  Postpaid phone churn of 0 86  was up from 0 82  last year  while total retail postpaid churn of 1 13  was up five basis points year over year  For the quarter  we increased customer net accounts by 30 000  Total postpaid device activations were up 1 2   This was a result of a 6  increase in postpaid gross additions from the prior year to 5 1 million  offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 6  from 6 3  a year ago  Now let s focus on our outlook for 2020 on slide 16  We exited the year with great momentum  reflected by strong wireless volumes in both our consumer and business segments  which  together with our focus on execution  positions us for accelerated growth in 2020  For 2020  we expect low  to mid single digit percentage growth in consolidated revenue compared to the prior year Included in this outlook are continued growth and momentum in wireless service revenue trends within both the consumer and business segments and an expected increase in equipment revenue as we expand the availability and reach of our 5G network  For the full year  we expect to see adjusted earnings growth of 2  to 4   driven by recurring service and other revenue growth in both consumer and business as well as ongoing cost initiatives  Adjusted earnings growth includes the impact of deferred commission expense as well as investments within Verizon business group and product development  continued process improvement and new work tools that would not only drive cost savings but create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G  One Fiber and MEC We expect to see cost benefits of this work begin to materialize in the back end of 2020 and increase in 2021  with revenue benefits starting in 2022  We are excited about the future opportunities in our business segment and believe revenue and margins will expand in the future  Below the line  we expect depreciation and amortization to be similar to 2019  Interest expense is expected to decline due to lower debt balances and the impact of our liability management last year  We expect each quarter in 2020 to be below the fourth quarter 2019 expense level  Adjusted effective tax rate is guided between 23  and 25   in line with the actual results from the prior two years  We expect consolidated capital spending to be between  17 billion and  18 billion  including the expansion of our 5G network in new and existing markets  additional 4G densification to stay ahead of demand and our ongoing fiber build  our capital spending guidance results in our capital intensity continuing within our normal range  although the timing will be higher earlier in the year than last year In summary  we expect to build on our strong financial performance and are positioned for accelerated growth in 2020  Now let s take a look at capital allocation  Our capital allocation process is disciplined and focused  Priorities for the upcoming year remain investing in the business  continuing our commitment to the dividend and managing our balance sheet to achieve our targeted leverage range  With our leverage near the high end of the target range and expectations for EBITDA growth and healthy free cash flow in 2020  we are pleased to add share repurchases as a fourth priority of our capital allocation policy  Repurchases will begin after the priorities have been met  including investment in our 5G rollout  potential spectrum purchases and the increased investment in the business segment  as highlighted earlier  Our earnings growth outlook for 2020 excludes the benefit from any potential share repurchases  Summing up  in 2019  we demonstrated that we can improve service revenue and grow the company from a position of strength  which drove increased volumes throughout the year  utilizing updated unlimited offerings  effective promotional strategies and partnerships  positioning the company for sustainable growth Our 5G built right strategy offers new opportunities to drive further growth as we continue to strengthen our network leadership  Importantly  we achieved strong results while expanding our industry leading margins as adjusted for accounting impacts during a period in which additional competitors entered our industry  Though we continue to face challenges within our legacy products and services  we are making strategic investments to drive growth in the coming years  In addition  we continue to make progress in our media group  and we believe we have the necessary assets and appropriate strategy to drive further improvements  Execution is a key focus within Verizon  and we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation  delivering on our commitment to strengthen our balance sheet  In short  we entered 2020 with strong momentum  poised to deliver growth and innovation With that  I ll turn the call over to Brady  so we can get to your questions Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationThanks  Matt  Brad  ready to take questions now Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead sir Brett Feldman    Goldman Sachs     AnalystThanks for taking the question  The principal variance in your fourth quarter results versus ours and I think most people s expectations was the higher level of spending in the business P L  and it looks it s on the wireline P L  And during your remarks  you talked about a step up investments in the business Services segment to drive growth in the future  So I m assuming that we ve already started to see that in the fourth quarter run rate  I guess what I was hoping to get more clarity on is what precisely are you spending that on  I mean  if I annualize that uptick  it s well in excess of  1 billion of incremental opex  So I think there s going to be a lot of interest in where you re spending it and how we should expect that payoff to flow through And then to the flip side of that is  the annual EPS guidance you gave for this year  it looks pretty close to what most people are looking for  including us  so there must be an offset and that would imply you re getting better operating leverage somewhere in your wireless business  And so I was hoping you can maybe just walk through where the cost performance and the margin improvement is coming from on wireless as you look into 2020 Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo Brett  I can start and    so when it comes to the business group  you re right  I mean  we had already impacts in the fourth quarter on our investment that we re doing in the business group  Matt mentioned some of them  If I go deeper  I mean  as we are now approaching the market with a full portfolio for our enterprise customers  small and medium customers  we need to get all our billing system  all our tools behind CRM  etc  actually  working in a customer dimension  And this hasn t been invested in before  and we just need to invest there  And that s why you see also in the guide that you say yourself  we re staying basically on your line of expectation That means that at the end of the year  we will see impact of those sort of investments and then they re going to roll off  So part of these investments are  of course  one timers investments we re doing and then it will go away because we just need to fix a couple of things in order to address the market in the right side    on the right way  Secondly  the secular decline in wireline business  that is continuing  So that is sort of a little bit more sustainable  But that s why in the remarks on that  we said also that in  21  we ll see even more impact of the cost reductions we re doing  and then the revenue impact will start gradually coming  21   22 in this side  But all in all  we re very excited about the opportunities that Verizon business group have because that s why we started building the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network some three  four years ago in order to actually address this market in the best way  and the traction we are seeing with our customers is really good But on your first question  if there is some impact in the fourth quarter  the answer is yes  Matt  anything to add Matthew D  Ellis    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Brett  thanks for the question  So we certainly saw the uptick in spending  as Hans discussed  We feel very strongly about the opportunities in VBG even more so today than we did when we announced a new operating structure  But some parts of that business haven t been a focus of our investment over the years  so we re excited about the future ahead there  You mentioned a kind of annualized run rate of  1 billion  and that s certainly not the number that we have in mind for that investment in 2020  So I think that s significantly overstating where the 2020 number will be  But if you go back to the comments earlier  we did say that we would expect to see an impact on margins in 2020  in line with what we saw in the second half of  19 I would expect we ll start to see the benefits of the transformation activities on the cost side of the business around the back end of the year really impacting 2021 in a more significant fashion and then getting into  22 and beyond on the revenue side  But look  we    I think the underlying thing here is the level of confidence that we have that over time  by making these investments  we can grow both revenue and margins within the business segment  So that s what we re focused on  You also asked about the total margin structure of the company  If you ve got this additional cost  the earnings guide would suggest there s some other things offsetting it in the other direction  I think it starts with revenue  When you continue to have strong service revenue growth in both consumer and business on the wireless side and some of the other revenue lines that we mentioned  that gives you a good starting point for earnings growth When you combine that with our ongoing cost activities and then even with the investment we re making in VBG  I would expect to see upside to earnings through the year as a result of that Brett Feldman    Goldman Sachs     AnalystThank you Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationBrad  we re ready for the next question OperatorThank you  The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS  You may go ahead  sir John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Maybe for Matt  on service revenue growth  came in a little bit lighter than we expected here in the fourth quarter  Can you give us a little bit more detail on sort of the drivers there  especially in light of the better than expected subs  And it also looked like consumer wholesale wireless revenues were sort of flattish sequentially  Was there any kind of reset this quarter in the sort of wholesale rate  especially given the growth in subscribers in some of your MVNO customers  And then lastly  any commentary  looking out to  20  on service revenue growth year over year would be great Matthew D  Ellis    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  John  Look  for service revenue growth in the fourth quarter at 2 7  for wireless as a whole  as you say  was all below the guide that we had  A couple of reasons for that  and both of them actually speak to the value that we re creating with our customers  The first is  we actually saw the people who had the opportunity to optimize by moving to the new pricing structure that we launched in August  actually moved a little faster than we initially anticipated  And so we think that s actually now complete and behind us earlier than we expected  might see a little bit of an impact in the first half of  20  but certainly got more of it behind us in  19  And then the other piece is a little bit of accounting noise in the service revenue line A number of our    part of our handset costs from a promo standpoint get capitalized and amortized against service revenue  So when you have the increase in volumes that we had in 3Q and 4Q where we had gross adds  we re up around 10  year over year in both quarters  What that means is we re starting to see an increase in that promo amortization coming against the service revenue line  That will be a little bit of a headwind in the first half of 2020 as well until that reaches kind of a plateau level in terms of the impact  But certainly  as you think about service revenue at the end of the year  the trajectory of the business  having the net add growth that we had  we feel very strong about another good year of service revenue ahead of us  And as we mentioned  net adds  the highest number that we ve had for six years  So the wireless business is performing well in both consumer and in business and we expect that to continue Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I can only add on to Matt  that  of course  this is part of our strategy  I mean  since the launch of unlimited  we have constantly sort of developed our model to see that our customer can enjoy different type of packages in the mix and match  but we also had a very clear strategy  You see that our metered customers can be able to go up to unlimited  and that s why we made that move in August  And I mean  we see the payoffs here with the net adds  We roughly have  today  50 50  metered and unlimited  So we see that the continuation of putting more value in the packages and seeing that we can actually get the journey for our customer coming into the unlimited is extremely good And that s as a growth engine for us  and you have seen that in the second quarter    or the second half of  19  So we have more to do here  but I think that the whole team of Ronan Dunne  etc  they are thinking about this  But also  don t forget  business side with Tami that have done a really good job with the wireless customers as well  So we re really encouraged when we see what we have done in the    in our offerings and how that has responded well with the market  So we re happy with what we have seen in the last half year end and give us encouragement for 2020 John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystThank you Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationBrad  ready for the next question OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan  Please go ahead sir Philip Cusick    JP Morgan    AnalystHi guys  Thanks  You put up a big capex number at the end of the year and guided to the similar  17 billion to  18 billion  Can you talk about any shifts within the capex priorities for 2020 versus  19 in terms of either fiber versus wireless mix or any shift within the fiber build in terms of the types of locations or deployments you plan to do  And when should we think about you starting to really monetize that fiber build Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  As you saw that we had a strong capex coming into the fourth quarter  ultimately  I m really happy about it  You can see that our pace is coming up here quite dramatically in what we re investing in right now  And the interesting thing is  of course  that since we launched the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network  we have constantly found a lot of efficiency in our capex build  and that  of course  is giving us possibilities to continue to do more and more  So I think that our technology department have no constraints on what they need to do in 2020  This is what they have plans for in order for us to continue to fortify our 4G network  to continue with strong additions in the 5G as well as continue with our fiber build  And when it comes to the monetization of the fiber build  we re already starting to do that Of course  because many of the fibers right now are going to our cell sites on air because that was a part of it  Then  of course  it has come a little bit later in monetization for our small and medium businesses and enterprise business  etc  But clearly  we re already now seeing the benefits of doing that  So going into 2020  I think we have a very solid capital allocation for our capex  Matt and the team have worked with the technology team  and we are improving every year how we do this work  And of course  it s a lot of reallocation inside that  17 to  18  And if we go back three years  it s a dramatic change how we spend because of the new design on the network  but also the technology evolutions Matthew D  Ellis    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So on the monetization of the fiber  as Hans mentioned  it s a multiuse network  But you re already starting to see the impact  and I ll give an example  And I think some of our network folks have mentioned this publicly in the past few months  You go back to the first quarter of last year  and the majority of our new cell sites were going up on third party fiber  you get into the fourth quarter of last year in the 60 plus markets that    where we re adding fiber  It s now    a significant majority is going up on our own fiber  So that will have a significant beneficial    significant benefit on  you d think  our expenses going forward  And then as we continue to go  we ll add other monetization opportunities over the course of the next couple of years  So I d say  we re already starting to see the benefits of the fiber build in our income statement Philip Cusick    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks Matt Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationBrad  ready for the next question OperatorThank you  The next question from David Barden of Bank of America  Sir  you may go ahead David Barden    Bank of America    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for taking the questions  I guess  two questions  if I could  First  just with respect to kind of the back part of the year  I think that there s a degree of anxiety about the level of competition that might emerge in the market around 5G and around the possibility of a 5G iPhone launch and how the various carriers are going to market and kind of position themselves as network to go to for it  So if you could kind of give us a little color on kind of how you see the second half of the year playing out with this potential 5G iPhones  super cycle emerging  And then the second would be I just wanted to have you guys maybe address  there s an organization called Opensignal that has shared some data with the sell side and others that kind of suggests that there s a handful of markets that Verizon s stressed in terms of their spectrum allocations  And I think that  that s raised kind of questions about what Verizon spectrum strategy is a network management strategy is going to be as we kind of bump into some of these limitations  So I just want to have you guys address that  if you could Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  On the first question there  I mean  Ronan Dunne already said in the beginning of the year that we re going to have some 20 5G devices coming out in the market this year  So of course  we re going to see more 5G devices coming out  It s going to be more build in the markets in 2020 than we had last year  So of course  this is a year that there is going to be even more 5G things coming in  When it comes to any particular phones coming out in the market  we cannot really comment on it because that  we ll leave to the company to do  But in general  of course  if this is a market which has a high degree of iOS  that means that when a 5G phone will come out from Apple  that will be important for many consumers to look into what they think is a good change  In our case  I think we re building a unique 5G experience with our millimeter wave that nobody else is building and have the capability to do  So I think that s really where the difference will come I mean  we already have the best 4G network as you have seen in the latest J D  Power and RootMetrics  We re going to continue to have that  So we re going to give the best experience for customers  And we    and I m confident that how we are building the network will make a big difference  And that s why we also feel very confident if    with all these devices coming out  including if the iPhone would come out  that we will have a good chance to actually grab more customers that want to be on our network  When it comes to the spectrum and all of that  I mean  I think that I might have talked about this so many times  I mean  one thing is  of course  that we  first of all  have all the assets to deploy our 5G strategy when it comes to millimeter wave and using dynamic spectrum sharing  be available nationwide when our customers are ready So I think that s clear  I think that another thing that is very clear that spectrum is not the only thing that is needed to do a great network  Think about what I have seen  I worked with 400 carriers around the world in my life  It is a lot of carriers  have a lot of spectrum  They don t have a great network  I mean  they don t use it in the right way  I came to this company because these companies invest on the world how to deal with data  Everything from spectrum to how you densify networks and what type of software you put in  and that s a long term planning how to do that right  And I think that s something where you    or people around us go wrong when I look at us because think about how we have been performing  and many actually thought that we would never sustain an unlimited  And the more the network is growing  we re getting more and more headroom as we re continuing deploying our software and the engineering capabilities we have in the company So again  we feel good about the position we have  Of course  as we all know  there might come out  the C band  And we re  of course  encouraged about the FCC s plan of doing that  We think the C band is an important spectrum for many reasons  I mean  first of all  it s one of the global spectrums  that frequency will be global  So roaming will be done on it  and that s very important for U S  market to get into that  And it s very important for Verizon to get into that  So I think    but it s not hindering our strategy right now to deploy a great 5G network and be able to capture the market on 5G Matthew D  Ellis    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI ll just add one comment on that  David  on that piece  I mean  our engineers took a look at that report yesterday  and they said there s so much missing in terms of their planning  They have line of sight to meet our needs for many years to come  And so I think I would put money on our engineering team every day of the week  and their track record is second to none  So we re very  very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to grow the business David Barden    Bank of America    AnalystAwesome  Thanks guys Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationBrad  we re ready for the next question OperatorThe next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley  Sir  you may go ahead Simon Flannery    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  On spectrum  maybe you could just comment on CBRS  Obviously  there s an auction coming up  how do you see that fitting into your plans  And then on 5G Home  you haven t talked a whole lot about it  With the CPE coming  is that still second half of the year  What are your expectations for what we should see in 2020 Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Thank you  Good morning  On the CBRS  as you know  we have already started for quite a long time ago to do trials and see how it works  and it works fine  We think it s a good addition to the portfolio that in order to see that we get good customer expectations  So we think CBRS is an important spectrum  even though it is sort of more share than anything else  but it s going to be definitely something we re using as it comes out  Secondly  when it comes to the 5G Home  I mean  you re confirming  actually what we have in front of us  The next generation chipset that goes into the CP for 5G Home will come out  At least  the plan right now is in third quarter  which means that commercial product is probably coming out a little bit later because it takes some time from the chipset to the device  By then  we will have  of course  deployed far more millimeter wave across the country  so we will be able to start launching many more markets when that happens  So that will come back to a little bit more about that when have our Investor Day the 13th of February  talk a little bit more about it  But that s in the grand scheme  the plans for 5G Home  and that s no different from what we said half a year ago Simon Flannery    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Thank you Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationBrad  we re ready for the next question OperatorThank you  This question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson  Please go ahead  sir Craig Moffett    MoffettNathanson    AnalystCan you share any early results  I know it s very early days  but of your mix and match video offer  And it s hard to miss that with your mix and match video offer for Fios that the customer is seemingly far better off to choose the YouTube TV option to save a lot of money  Is that the intention  And why not make the step to say that s our only video offer and you really focus the business on the Fios broadband connectivity where it would seem you have a much better story to tell Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  I think when it comes to the mix and match  we want to give our customers optionality on top of the broadband  If it s the fiber broadband or if it s the 5G Home broadband  we want to give them optionality  Of course  one optionality is always to have a broadband and having over the top services  But another is  of course  giving the mix and match optionality right now to see that they use the right packages that is more fitted for them  Still  of course  it s what they can choose whatever channels you have because they come in packages  But the early    or early indication is  of course  that customers that has been on trial for a month  they clearly see what channels they re using and what package we can suggest for that  that is going to be more optimized  So I think for us  we just think about our customers and where the market is going  and we want to give them the optionality of actually having different ways they can address the market when it comes to their content consumptions  And I think it s good for our customer experience  but it s also good for our customers because all of them can do it  So as you said  it s a little bit early  but I think that our customers are very happy that we re giving them this optionality  And I think this is  of course  what everyone see where the market is going  meaning more and more over the top content is coming in and you want    you need thought  mixing and matching that  And here  we have a great opportunity given our service strategy  and we can work with all the type of optionality in the content market as we re not owning any content Craig Moffett    MoffettNathanson    AnalystThank you Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationBrad  we are ready for the next questionOperatorThank you The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi  Please go ahead  sir Michael Rollins    Citi    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks  A couple of follow up questions  First  with the revenue guidance range of low to mid single digits for 2020  Can you frame the flex points as to what would drive revenue growth to the higher end of the range relative to the lower end of the range  And then second  with respect to the fiber expansion  can you just also frame for us just the total amount of fiber you re trying to go after over a three  to five year period to help us put into context what the current deployment activity means for the company s longer term goals Matthew D  Ellis    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mike  So let me start with the revenue guide and unpack that a little bit for you  So as you think about how would you get from 0 8  this year to low to mid single digits next year  if I go through the individual pieces  they re obviously within consumer  It s a continuation of service revenue trajectory that you ve seen so far  the other revenue line as well  And then within business  again  continuation of those service revenue trends  They re very  very strong  We don t see those slowing down anytime soon  So that will be better  A little bit of improvement on the wireline side of the business  but nothing significant  And then even within media  you think about that being down 3  on a full year basis in  19  but getting back to about flat in the fourth quarter  so less of a headwind of revenue from media in  20 than  19  Within the total number  the 0 8  last year  wireless equipment was negative 3 1   We don t expect that number to be negative in 2020  But obviously  that is the biggest wildcard within the overall revenue guide as we think about it in terms of knowing exactly what we see  primarily in the second half of the year as you get into the holiday season and iconic launches and the like  So    but we feel optimistic about the revenue growth going forward here  really building on the momentum that we ve built across both consumer and business over the course of the past couple of years and feel pretty good about that guide as a result Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOn the fiber side  I mean  I think  first of all  I mean  we said it in    a couple of times during  19  We re starting to get on the level of sort of activity per month and quarter right now that we were planning from the beginning  It took us some two years to get out to that pace  The team is really good at it right now  We can get much more scalability around it than the way we re doing it  Remember also  we always do the trade off between owning and leasing or sharing with someone  and that is a very prudent or financially disciplined way of looking at our deployment  In many cases  we see it as owning it has really an advantage for us because of the multiuse of our network  Now we re doing sites all the time  We re going to create revenue for our business side  So we probably have a couple of years left on doing that  But in general  I feel good about the pace we have right now and the multiuse of the fiber we have  And I think this is one of the most critical assets in a network today    in today s world  especially as we build Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and you want actually to start delivering the 5G experience that we re expecting  We need this fiber to be there  So that s basically where we are with the fiber Michael Rollins    Citi    AnalystThank you Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationThanks  Mike  Brad  we are ready for the next question OperatorThank you  The next question from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer  Sir  please go ahead Tim Horan    Oppenheimer    AnalystThanks  With 5G  I think the coverage is going to be very important also  and I think you re using dynamic spectrum selection for that  Can you just talk about how that s going and the timing  And then just kind of further on 5G  maybe just some color on what you re thinking  how much further ahead you are than your peers  And maybe lastly  any other use cases that you re seeing talking to either enterprise customers or consumer customers for 5G for both coverage and density Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  On the DSS  the dynamic spectrum sharing  as you have seen some PR  we re done  We have already gotten this to work from the software point of view  And the majority of our baseband is ready for taking DSS  So what we have said  I m not going to give you an exact date  but I m going to tell you  we re going to be ready when we feel the market is ready and our customers need to have that coverage  And again  remember  we want to have the best network performance wise  We don t want to deploy it because it s called 5G  We want to see that we actually give a superior performance to our customers  And that s why we think that the millimeter wave  what we re doing there is extremely important because we talked about 10 to 20x  at least more throughput and speed than we have on the 4G network  and we still have the best 4G network  So I think that s what we already assessed  When we meet at the Investor Day  we re going to talk a little bit more about the technology sector We ll get a little bit more in depth around that  When it comes to the 5G and where we are  I think that you saw last year that we had a strong deployment coming in during  19  but of course  we have even higher ambitions in  20  And we will also come back and talk a little bit about    more about that  But it goes in all three directions in our multipurpose network  It s for the mobility case  for the home case  and it s also for the 5G mobile edge compute case  not forgetting that  because all three of them are using our multipurpose network  And when it comes to use cases  I can do some of them  But of course  on the mobile edge compute  we see a lot of optimization in factories  We see private    we see private 5G networks in order to keep the data and the security and the throughput in a facility  if that s a campus  whatever  that use case has come up very early on  On the consumer side  I guess  there s sort of a big event coming up here on Sunday  It s called Football  American Football  and you re going to see quite a lot on 5G experience there  What we can do with millimeter wave in the stadium  how we can use broadcasting cameras with 5G  a lot of new innovation  both with consumer  but also for the distribution of content  With our spectrum positioning  we basically are limited on the uplink when it comes to stadiums  which is the big blocker today in a stadium  So I think you re going to see quite a lot next  I d say four or five days on consumer cases as well as we will continue to give you more insights to it the next couple of weeks and when we meet in New York here Tim Horan    Oppenheimer    AnalystThank you Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationYeah  Thanks  Tim  Brad  we got time for one more question OperatorThank you The last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company  Your line is open Colby Synesael    Cowen and Company    AnalystGreat  Thank you I actually wanted to talk about the buyback  I was wondering if you could talk about providing any more color on the potential for timing  You mentioned one of the sensitivities was portent purchases of spectrum  Obviously  we had the CBRS auction  I think  in June and then C band  whether it s later this year or maybe early next year  Do those have to have first take place  and you have to have a better understanding of ultimately what you spent before you could actually start to do a buyback  Or could you actually end up doing it before  And then secondly  there s been a lot of debate around your current MVNO relationship with various cable companies and some of your competitors making some comments that they re going to try to go after that  Is there a specific date when that contract expires or anything specific about 2020 that we should be thinking about that could be a catalyst  if you will  for the money to leave  And how important is it to you to maintain that Matthew D  Ellis    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Colby  thanks for the question  So on the buyback  look  it s great to be having this conversation  We re approaching our target leverage  had good conversations with the board for quite a while now  As we get closer to the target range  what comes next  And so glad to announce that change in the capital allocation model this morning  But as you mentioned  there s a couple of key variables as we think about capital allocation going forward here  And spectrum is the largest one of those  So I don t know if we need to actually get through the auctions  but having line of sight to exactly when the auctions will be is kind of a key variable  So we re very supportive of the actions the FCC is taking to try to make as much spectrum available  And as we get a little more clarity  hopefully  in the near term future  that will also impact our decision on timing of any buybacks  But as you think about buybacks  the reason why we re having that conversation is the strong cash flow that we saw last year  Last year  we were at  35 7 billion of CFFO  And even after you back out capex and the dividend   7 8 billion left over  And with an expectation of EPS growth  working capital might be a little bit of a wild card  but I would expect to see that free cash flow after dividend number be strong again this year and expect it to be higher on a year over year basis  So it puts us in a great position where we can make some good decisions going forward here Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOn the MNO  so I can    as we re having it as Service as a Strategy  this is important relationships for us  That s how we want to get monetization better than anybody else on our capital investments and that s why we re building a network  We are managing a multitude of stakeholders and the MNOs are important  It s an ongoing relationship  And we really think it s important relationships  so that s us any sort of large enterprises  We see that we have both agile on the technology side and having good conversations with them  but it s no different from another enterprise you would have  So    and I think it s a win win for both of us  And hopefully  they see equally good value having MNO on top of the best network in the country  At the same time as we see a value over there as well  So we will continue to be there  And it s hard for me to comment what my competitors are saying about it  I m not sure what insights they have  But again  we feel good about our relationship  and we will continue to see that we are managing it as any very important customer Colby Synesael    Cowen and Company    AnalystThank you  very much Brady Connor    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationThat s all the time we have today  Before I end the call  I d like to turn it back to Hans for a couple of closing comments real quick Hans E  Vestberg    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  I will be brief on this one  I think we have talked about all the relevant things for Q4  2019 and 2020  and as I said  we have our Investor Day coming up here in February  So    but all in all  I reinforce that we did a lot of transformation in 2019  The team and the organization has really responded well to it  That goes all the way from a network change to our organization change  to our voluntary program  branding and all of that went down  and at the same time  we ve delivered a strong result  And I think we have set us up ourselves for actually continued good role  We have said that long term  we have    would like to have growth of GDP plus  I think the guide this year is an acceleration compared to  19  which means that the confidence level is going up  what we can do with the core assets we have  And we still sort of have told you where 5G will come in  which is more of 2021  So we work with assets we have right now  but we build also a great foundation on 5G going forward for the years after  So all in all  I think the whole team  the executive team and the company feel excited coming into 2020  and that s how I sum it up  Thank you very much for being on this call Operator Operator Closing

214561,436077,VZ,Verizon s Adding Subscribers  but Not Profits,news,"A lot of people signed up for Verizon s  NYSE VZ  wireless phone service in the fourth quarter  The telecom giant added another 790 000 postpaid phone subscribers  its best Q4 performance in six years  as a result of strong gross additions and best in industry churn rates 
Verizon s ability to attract subscribers seems to rely heavily on pricing and promotions  While its revenue came in above expectations  its earnings fell below the consensus  The main culprit may be Verizon s moves to lower its pricing on unlimited plans and offer its customers a free year of Disney s  NYSE DIS  Disney  streaming service  Average revenue per account fell sequentially and EBITDA margin contracted across both the consumer and business segments  EBITDA declined 1 2  in its consumer segment compared to growing EBITDA at its competitors like AT T  NYSE T  and T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS   
Verizon s lower profitability despite its strong subscriber growth is something investors need to pay attention to

Disney  may have been instrumental to Verizon s big net subscriber addition number during Q4  Given lots of pent up demand for the streaming video service combined with a new Apple iPhone release last quarter  Verizon s unlimited plan became an attractive option for customers thinking about switching  That s especially true among iPhone purchasers  as Verizon also includes an Apple Music subscription in its unlimited plans 
Q4 was also the first full quarter of its new unlimited plan pricing  which offered more for less than its previous plans 
CFO Matt Ellis noted the company was  extremely pleased  with the early uptake on the Disney  offer  but didn t provide any exact details on how many customers subscribed  Verizon previously said about 17 million customers would be eligible for the free year of Disney  between its wireless and home broadband subscribers 
The move to partner with Disney and Apple puts Verizon on a more even playing field with T Mobile and AT T  T Mobile offers its top tier unlimited subscribers a deep discount on a Netflix subscription  making it free in some instances  AT T is offering its top end unlimited subscribers free HBO Now  which it ll upgrade to HBO Max when the service launches in May  Despite the lower consumer price of Disney   consumers are drawn to the brand  as evidenced by the 10 million sign ups  which included pre sales  it saw on launch day 
Dragging down profitability
The new plans and Disney  subscriptions seems to have affected Verizon s cost of service  which climbed  90 million sequentially and grew 6 5  year over year   The terms of Verizon s contract with Disney are unknown  and Verizon s accounting for the service is unclear   That jump in cost of service is the biggest drag on profits for the company s consumer wireless business 
AT T managed to sustain EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter for its mobility segment  despite fewer net subscriber additions  Even so  its horizontal integration with HBO means it could offset higher cost of service from offering customers a free subscription with higher revenue in its WarnerMedia segment  paid by the mobility segment  
Meanwhile  T Mobile is managing to grow EBITDA because it s gaining operational efficiency from scaling its customer base  
Verizon doesn t have those advantages  as it already operates at scale and its media segment doesn t hold any valuable subscription video services  But maintaining its strong brand reputation with customers with competitive offers keeps it well positioned to return to growth in the future as it rolls out 5G services  
That growth won t come anytime soon  though  Management expects low  to mid single digit consolidated revenue growth and EPS growth of 2  to 4  for full year 2020 ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppjgu,2073234

Promotions lead to higher retail additions
First up  on the consumer side  net wireless subscriber additions of 731 000 and a 6 3  wireless upgrade rate helped push segment revenue up 2  in Q4 to  24 2 billion  Management credited its ongoing promotional activity for the increase  specifically the Disney   NYSE DIS  streaming service bundle for customers with unlimited data plans  Those gains were offset by continued weakness in the FiOS wireline business  Revenues were flat year over year  with more high speed internet customers offsetting traditional phone and TV cord cutting  

It was a similar story on the business end  with 396 000 net wireless adds getting slightly offset by wireline voice net subscriber losses of 99 000  Even so  business segment revenue of  8 07 billion in the quarter notched a 1  increase  Media Group sales of  2 1 billion were flat    not great  but better than the negative territory of early 2019  Altogether  wireless strength helped Verizon manage modest growth in the last year   

Data source  Verizon   
The business segment is old and tired  for now
Of course  much of these results are built on Verizon s 4G network  and after a decade the growth there is scant and highly susceptible to competitive forces as the company dukes it out with AT T  NYSE T  and T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS   Things could start to pick up in 2020  though  as Verizon s 5G    currently available in parts of 34 cities    rolls out in more markets   
While many consumers are excited about the prospect of near gigabit data speeds on their phones  from an investment perspective it s Verizon s business segment that is set to benefit the most from 5G  Another  17 billion to  18 billion in expected capital expenditures in the year ahead will support  among other things  the continued development of the new network  CEO Hans Vestberg said on the earnings call that many businesses are anxious to get access to the next gen wireless service  and demand should be a key driver of Verizon s growth   
Early results have thus far been promising  with 5G use cases powering things like a Corning  NYSE GLW  fiber optic cable factory and Verizon partnering with Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services  AWS  to bring early 5G access to the network edge in Chicago  More coverage should equate to more deals like this for Verizon s sleepy business segment and expanding what s possible for its mobile business   
As for 2020  management said to expect revenue growth in the low to middle single digits and adjusted earnings growth of 2  to 4   It s not setting the world ablaze  but while 5G waits in the wings  Verizon s leading network is still best in class and handily supporting the 4 1  a year dividend payout ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppv64,2073766

214565,436081,VZ,Obituary  Bernard Ebbers  convicted of orchestrating WorldCom fraud  dead at 78,news,"Bernard Ebbers  who built WorldCom Inc into a telecommunications giant and was convicted in one of the largest U S  accounting scandals  died on Sunday  his family said in a statement  He was 78 
His health had been rapidly deteriorating before a federal judge granted him a compassionate release from prison in December 2019  after he had served a little over 13 years of a 25 year sentence 
 He was hospitalized multiple times in November and December  yet there was still no diagnosis or proactive treatment plan   his son Joy Ebbers Bourne  said in the statement 
Known as Bernie  the bearded  twice divorced Ebbers spent nearly two decades transforming a small Mississippi company once known as Long Distance Discount Service into WorldCom through a slew of acquisitions  including the  37 billion takeover of the much larger MCI Communications in 1998 
That made Ebbers  company a rival for AT T  Verizon  NYSE VZ  and other long distance carriers  and made Ebbers a billionaire 
But it crashed down in 2002 in an  11 billion accounting fraud  where former employees said Ebbers had urged them to inflate WorldCom s financial results to make the company more profitable and please Wall Street analysts 
Ebbers was convicted by a Manhattan jury in March 2005 for orchestrating the fraud  and was found guilty of securities fraud  conspiracy and other crimes 
His punishment was more severe than those imposed on two other chief executives from big corporate scandals in the same period  a 24 year prison term for Enron s Jeffrey Skilling and a 15 year term for Adelphia Communications  John Rigas  Skilling s term was later shortened  and he and Rigas have been released 
Ebbers denied he was at fault  saying it was subordinates who had concealed WorldCom s skyrocketing costs 
He thought himself less a micromanager  and more the high school basketball coach he once was 
 I m not an engineer by training  I m not an accountant by training   all those types of specialized skills   he told the New York Times in 1998  which interviewed him on his 130 foot yacht  Countach 
 My job is to bring people in who do have those specific skills and then rely on them  I m the coach  I m not the point guard who shoots the ball  
WorldCom had about  103 8 billion of assets when it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in July 2002  making its bankruptcy the largest in U S  corporate history 
That title is now held by Lehman Brothers  bankruptcy in 2008  CNBC and Portfolio com in 2013 named Ebbers the fifth worst American CEO of all time  Lehman s Richard Fuld ranked first 
GOING TO CHURCH WITH A CROOK
Bernard John Ebbers was born on Aug  27  1941 in Edmonton  Alberta  He later moved to California and New Mexico  and then back to Canada  before obtaining a physical education degree in 1967 from Mississippi College  where the 6 foot 4  1 93 m  Ebbers had a basketball scholarship 
Ebbers became a businessman  and had amassed a small chain of motels by 1983  when he and other entrepreneurs came up with the idea for LDDS 
He became CEO two years later  and it changed its name to WorldCom in 1995  The name changed to MCI WorldCom after the MCI purchase  and later back to WorldCom 
Ebbers remained on the prowl  announcing a  129 billion merger with Sprint Corp in October 1999  only to have regulators block that tie up 
But as the global technology and telecommunications bubble began to burst  Ebbers became financially strained from margin calls  leading him to borrow heavily from WorldCom 
He was ousted in April 2002 amid unhappiness over more than  400 million he reportedly owed  Two months later  WorldCom revealed an accounting shortfall and said it would restate some results  The chief financial officer was fired 
With his former company on the brink  Ebbers reportedly appeared on June 30  2002 at the Easthaven Baptist Church in Brookhaven  Mississippi  where he attended services and taught Sunday school 
He reportedly told the congregation that no one would find he had knowingly committed fraud  and assured that  you aren t going to church with a crook  
Testifying in his own defense at his trial  a relatively rare move in a high profile white collar case  Ebbers invoked his coaching past to describe his management style 
 I considered myself demanding   he said   I expected results  I sometimes said things I shouldn t have said maybe  
But he maintained ignorance of details   I don t know about technology and I don t know about finance and accounting   he said  according to The New York Times 
Jurors thought otherwise 
NO SLAP ON WRIST
Ebbers  health began deteriorating rapidly in late 2019  not long after he sought early release from prison under a federal law allowing some older prisons to obtain freedom sooner 
According to court papers  he had become legally blind  had fallen several times  was easily disoriented  and needed help to walk  eat and groom himself  His cognitive skills had slid well below the level suggesting dementia  Ebbers  weight fell to 142 pounds  64 kg  in December 2019 from 200 pounds  91 kg  in July 2018 
Even Barbara Jones  the federal judge who imposed Ebbers  prison sentence  thought early release was appropriate 
U S  District Judge Valerie Caproni  who took over the case after Jones entered private practice  concluded that society had no reason to fear Ebbers would resume  fashioning fraudulent securities schemes  or pose any threat if he were released 
 Thirteen years of incarceration  up to the point of approaching death  is not a slap on the wrist   Caproni wrote in
January 2020   Ebbers has essentially served the life sentence

Last week  the group  Lawyers for Liberty  LFL  said Singapore prison officers were allegedly instructed to snap prisoners  necks by kicking them in the event of a rope breaking during hangings 
It said the report was based on information from an unidentified prison officer in Singapore 
On Wednesday  Singapore s minister for home affairs  K  Shanmugam  denied the accusations as  untrue  baseless and preposterous  and ordered the group and several websites to attach  fake news  notices to posts and articles carrying them

214615,436131,VZ,What Are the Odds Verizon Becomes the New King of Sports Betting ,news,"The acquisition of Yahoo  by Verizon  NYSE VZ  hasn t paid off quite the way the telecom giant likely hoped it would  but it may yet fuel some of its biggest growth opportunities  
In November  Verizon announced it was going to expand on the Yahoo Sports brand by making it a center for sports betting  When it debuted  only people using the app in New Jersey could place bets  but Verizon plans to expand it this year to five more states were wagering on athletic contests is legal  As more states start to allow people to bet legally on sports  Yahoo could realize a good portion of its potential 

Giving it a sporting chance
To monetize the Yahoo Sports app  Verizon is partnering with Roar Digital  a joint venture between MGM Resorts  NYSE MGM  and GVC Holdings  to funnel sports betting through the casino operator s gambling platform  BetMGM  The new venture is called Yahoo Sportsbook powered by BetMGM 
The telecom says it s an effort that builds on its  core strategy to connect content and discovery to transactions   It will also allow the online betting platform to integrate with Yahoo s fantasy sports operations and content  
New Jersey was one of the first states to authorize sports wagers after the U S  Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992  which barred states from authorizing sports gambling  The Garden State went on to become the biggest market for sports betting  quickly beating out Nevada  where that form of gambling has been legal for decades 
The place to bet on sports
Online gambling hit almost half a billion dollars in New Jersey in 2019  driven mostly by casinos as online poker remains weak  Its rise has been fueled by both FanDuel  which partnered with The Meadowlands Racetrack  and DraftKings  which has partnered with Resorts Atlantic City and just filed for an IPO  Together they control about 80  of the online market in the state  but FanDuel is the biggest sportsbook in the country  with about a 60  share  
New Jersey generated almost  4 6 billion in sports betting handle last year and revenue of nearly  300 million  In the state s gambling parlance  handle is the amount that is wagered  revenue is the amount the casinos keep 
MGM is the third largest online betting site in the state through its Borgata casino  which uses BetMGM and PartyPoker  but there are 17 sportsbook apps operating in New Jersey  and 10 retail books operating out of Atlantic City casinos and racetracks  PartyPoker is a property of Roar Digital 
Off to a roaring start
The Yahoo Sportsbook will essentially serve as an affiliate of BetMGM  steering its traffic to the platform  which will handle the betting transactions  The partners haven t said how much compensation Verizon will receive for funneling customers to the platform  but considering the telecom s desire to monetize its media outlets  and its willingness to expand the partnership to more states  the terms are likely favorable 
Earlier this month  Roar Digital gained approval from Nevada gambling regulators to operate online sports betting in the state  It will be rebranding its PlayMGM digital sportsbook to BetMGM  and it hopes to be operational by the time of the March Madness tournaments 
Verizon has been transforming its media division away from social media and user generated content  and last August sold Tumblr as part of that realignment   Making its properties money generating enterprises is the new goal 
A nationwide opportunity
Currently  14 states offer full service sports betting  and another eight have legalized it but have yet to authorize its operation  For example  Michigan just legalized it in December and expects to have its system up and running in March  but Connecticut  which legalized it in 2017 ahead of the Supreme Court s ruling  has failed to enact enabling legislation  Another half dozen states or so are considering it 
MGM Resorts has been building up a sports betting empire with professional sports league partnerships  but with this latest deal with Verizon and Yahoo Sports could turn the telecom into the power behind the throne ",2020-01-26,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pn1ol,2067955

 Reuters    Sprint Corp said on Monday it lost fewer mobile monthly postpaid phone subscribers than expected in the third quarter  benefiting from cheaper plans ahead of a merger with larger rival T Mobile US  NASDAQ TMUS  Inc  
Investors look at postpaid subscribers  or people who pay a recurring monthly bill  because they tend to stay with carriers longer and are more profitable than prepaid phone customers 
The company said it lost 115 000 postpaid phone subscribers during the quarter ended Dec 31  Analysts were expecting a net loss of 160 000 subscribers  according to research firm FactSet 
Sprint reported 1 87  postpaid phone churn  compared with 1 75  a year ago  New Street Research analysts pointed to the pace of Sprint s decline  calling the prospects of the company grim if it does not reach a merger with larger rival T Mobile US 
Sprint  the fourth largest U S  wireless carrier by subscribers  is facing a multistate lawsuit against its  26 billion proposed merger 
T Mobile and Sprint have said the merger will not lead to higher prices for consumers and would allow it to compete effectively with dominant carriers  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  and AT T Inc 
Sprint focused its 2019 efforts on aggressively deploying its network of 5G  the next generation of wireless  to nine major cities  The company has not announced any new expansion plans as it hopes to solidify the merger with T Mobile and use the combined strength of its larger competitor s 5G network 
Net loss attributable to the company fell to  120 million in the quarter ended Dec  31 from  141 million a year earlier  The current quarter included a non cash tax benefit of approximately  300 million to reduce the valuation allowance related to certain historic net operating loss carryforwards 
Sprint recorded  408 million in income tax benefit in the third quarter  compared with  8 million a year earlier

214637,436153,VZ,Verizon s New Pricing Goes After the Fastest Growing Segment of Pay TV,news,"Cord cutting reached a new peak in 2019  with millions of American consumers ditching traditional pay TV for alternatives  But one area of pay TV that saw considerable growth last year was among virtual multichannel video programming distributors  vMVPDs   Companies including Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOG   NASDAQ GOOGL  YouTube  Disney s  NYSE DIS  Hulu  AT T  NYSE T   and DISH Network  NASDAQ DISH  offer live TV packages streamed over the internet  
Consumers are drawn to vMPVDs for a couple of reasons  They typically offer smaller packages of channels that meet the entertainment needs of consumers without the bulk of typical pay TV packages  Additionally  consumers can pause their subscriptions from month to month  giving them greater control over their entertainment bill 
Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  is going after the market that wants greater control over their television bill without completely cutting the cord  It announced new pricing for its internet and pay TV packages  offering greater transparency and removing contracts that lock in customers long term  The move may help Verizon stem its pay TV subscriber losses without sacrificing profit margin 

Not all vMVPDs are created equal
It s important to note that not all virtual pay TV operators grew last year  AT T s AT T TV Now  formerly DIRECTV Now  saw a marked decline in subscribers in 2019  It lost over 700 000 of its 1 9 million subscribers over the four quarters ending last September 
AT T s struggles are linked largely to its reduction in promotional activity around the product and significant price increases  AT T s management has made it clear that it s focused on only the most profitable customers and expects to keep losing subscribers  Management believes subscriber losses for its overall pay TV business peaked in Q3  but an additional price hike for AT T TV Now last quarter could lead to faster declines for the over the top service 
Meanwhile  Hulu  YouTube  and DISH Network s Sling TV are adding hundreds of thousands of subscribers every quarter despite also raising prices last year  Sling TV added 214 000 new subscribers in the third quarter  accelerating growth  Hulu and YouTube don t publicly report subscriber numbers for their live TV services  but estimates from MoffettNathanson peg their third quarter net additions at 400 000 and 200 000  respectively 
Meanwhile  traditional pay TV providers lost around 1 7 million subscribers total in the third quarter  Verizon lost 66 000 subscribers  Being able to emulate the offerings of virtual MVPDs may be essential to retaining subscribers 
Verizon can t quite copy the competition
It s worth noting Verizon previously explored entering the vMVPD market  It discussed plans publicly in 2017  but ultimately never launched a product  It s likely been unable to lock down the necessary contracts with media companies to offer an over the top service 
While its new pricing options emulate the flexibility offered by vMVPDs  Verizon is still locked into its existing contracts with media companies  Those companies include AT T and Disney  which may be difficult to negotiate with considering they have competing distribution services  As such  Verizon may not have the rights to stream video outside of the home  or at all  for that matter  for some popular networks 
Additionally  Verizon may not be able to make a package of networks that offers the greatest appeal to consumers  Its lowest priced TV option is  62 when you include the required set top box  and that s before any DVR options  Interestingly  Verizon highlights YouTube TV s  50 per month plan  including DVR  in its list of options  So  even Verizon knows it can t compete on price  it might as well take a commission on sign ups then 
But the inability to keep channel packages small and offer relatively low prices compared to most traditional cable packages is what led AT T TV Now to lose hundreds of thousands of subscribers in 2019  Verizon s new pricing package may have limited appeal to new subscribers 
That said  it could help the company retain existing subscribers that are thinking about canceling and switching to a virtual provider instead  And Verizon can do so without sacrificing on price  So  while Verizon might not see significant gains in gross additions from the change  net losses should decline and overall subscriber losses may come back to even for the telecom ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgrzr,2057415
214638,436154,VZ,Singapore rebuts illegal hanging report  serves fake news notices,news,"SINGAPORE  Reuters    Singapore rebutted a report on Wednesday alleging illegal execution practices in the city state and ordered Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  and others to attach fake news notices on posts and articles that shared the allegations 
The report by Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Liberty last week said that Singapore prison officers were instructed to snap prisoners  necks by kicking them in the event the rope breaks during hangings  It said the report was based on information from an unnamed prison officer in Singapore 
The wealthy city state carried out 13 hangings in 2018  the latest official data shows  11 of which were for drug offences for which it has some of the strictest laws in the world  Amnesty International said it was the first year since 2003 that the number of hangings reached double digits 
 The statement   contains untrue  baseless and preposterous allegations about the use of unlawful methods in judicial executions   Singapore s ministry of home affairs said  adding that no such methods were taught or approved  and that the rope used for executions has never broken 
The ministry instructed the rights group to carry a correction notice on the article under its new fake news law  It sent similar instructions to an activist and media commentator  a blog and the local news site of U S  web services firm Yahoo 
Lawyers for Liberty founder N Surendran said he stood by the statement and would not comply with the correction order 
 Singapore has no jurisdiction to interfere with the rights of Malaysian citizens to freedom of expression    Their attempt to extend their jurisdiction upon Malaysians across the causeway is provocative and absurd   N  Surendran said 
Yahoo  owned by  Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ   said in response to an emailed request for comment that it  was looking into the matter and will respond in due course  
The fake news law  seen as one of the most far reaching of its kind  came into effect in October amid concern among rights groups and opposition politicians it could be used to silence criticism of the government 
The government has denied such suggestions saying the law  the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act  POFMA   only tackles falsehoods and that legitimate criticism and free speech would not be affected 
Since the law was first invoked in late November  most of the cases have involved political opposition figures and an opposition party 
Singapore s communications minister has said it was a coincidence that the first few cases brought under the law were against political figures and parties ",2020-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/singapore-rebuts-illegal-hanging-report-serves-fake-news-notices-2064530,2064530

214660,436176,VZ,Verizon Will Launch 4 Times More 5G Devices on Its Network This Year,news,"This year Verizon  NYSE VZ  will try to boost its 5G technology prospects by launching four times more devices    20 in total    on its new network than it did last year  Verizon CEO Ronan Dunne announced the increase in 5G devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week and added that the devices released in the first half of the year will cost around  800 each  while some released later in the year will be priced under  600 
Dunne s comments were notable because releasing 20 5G devices on its network this year will help Verizon tap into pent up consumer demand for 5G devices and services 

The demand is already there
A recent survey conducted by Counterpoint Research found that 81  of survey respondents said 5G was  very appealing  or  appealing  to them  compared to 4G services  Most importantly  59  of respondents said that they were  very interested  or  extremely interested  in buying a 5G phone 
Tom Kang  the research director at Counterpoint  said that  the study revealed there is tremendous interest in 5G and that over 30  of consumers are willing to buy a 5G device even if 5G is not yet available where they live  
This pent up demand comes as consumers want two main things from 5G services  faster speeds and increased reliability  With Verizon s 5G network  consumers will undoubtedly get the first  considering that Verizon says 5G speeds will be up to 100 times faster than 4G 
Good start  but not a win just yet
The jury is still out on whether Verizon s 5G will be more reliable than its current network  Verizon is betting on a high frequency spectrum  called millimeter wave  which allows for ultra fast cellular speeds  but it isn t great for sending signals through large buildings  
To help offset this potential problem  Verizon will use what s called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing  which will allow the company to put new 5G signals on its current 4G spectrum  In contrast  both AT T and T Mobile are focusing on the lower frequency spectrum for their 5G networks  
The top U S  wireless carriers are all fighting to build out the largest and fastest 5G networks right now  and only time will tell which company becomes the clear leader  and which one creates the truly most reliable network   
Verizon hasn t yet specified which technology companies will be releasing the new 5G devices  but notable smartphone makers  including Apple  are expected to release new 5G phones this year  Research firm Gartner estimates that the installed base of 5G smartphones will increase from just 10  of the market this year to 56  in 2023 
Verizon launching so many 5G devices on its network this year is significant because it will allow consumers who are ready to jump on the 5G bandwagon to have their pick of 5G phones  And with some of those phones expected to be priced under  600 in the second half of this year  even budget conscious buyers won t have an excuse not to upgrade ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfz9t,2056098

214700,436216,VZ,FCC chairman Pai backs public auction to free up spectrum in C band for 5G,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said on Monday he backs a public auction to free up spectrum in a key band currently used for delivering video content for next generation 5G wireless networks  an announcement that sent a major satellite company s shares down 40   The C band is a block of spectrum used by satellite company customers to deliver video and radio programming to 120 million U S  households and is seen as the most likely short term source of available spectrum for 5G use  Experts believe the C band spectrum can be divided to maintain existing service and deliver 5G service  Pai said he supports a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C band   I m confident they ll quickly conduct a public auction that will give everyone a fair chance to compete for this  5G spectrum  while preserving availability of the upper 200 MHz of the band for continued delivery of programming   he wrote on Twitter   Major satellite service providers including Intelsat SA  Telesat and SES SA  which hold the existing C band licenses  have proposed selling the spectrum privately to wireless carriers  arguing a private sale would make the spectrum available for 5G faster  But that has drawn criticism from some U S  lawmakers  Shares in Intelsat fell 40  in extremely heavy trading in New York to  8 03  The satellite firms said in a statement that Pai s proposal failed to address  the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators in executing the complex task of reconfiguring and transitioning their networks    The group added that it would  continue to work cooperatively with the FCC to develop an effective alternative plan and achieve the best outcome for the American public while protecting the interests of our users and the rights of our companies   FCC officials told reporters on a conference call Pai plans to bring his auction proposal before the commission for a vote early next year   An FCC official also confirmed that  after Republican Senator John Kennedy raised the C band issue with President Donald Trump  Trump called Pai on Oct  30  to find out what the issue was about   Because Trump did not express a view on how the spectrum should be sold  the White House did not need to file a public description of the conversation and no one at the White House ever expressed a view  the FCC official said  The White House declined to comment  Mid band spectrum is critical for 5G because it offers  both geographic coverage and the capacity to transmit large amounts of data   a combination that is appealing to entrepreneurs and wireless consumers alike   Pai said in a letter to lawmakers  He said the FCC  must make C band spectrum available for 5G quickly   adding that he proposed  preserving the availability of the upper 200 megahertz of this band for the continued delivery of programming    Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  said Monday that  any auction should include appropriate incentives and protections to ensure it could be put to use in short order   China and other countries have already provided huge blocks of mid band spectrum to carriers for 5G  and there is a risk that those countries will become the hub of 5G innovation and investment if the US fails to act promptly to do the same   Verizon said  AT T Inc  NYSE T  said earlier this month a private auction could lead to extensive legal challenges and said the FCC would have to be closely involved in developing and supervising the auction

214722,436238,VZ,WeWork begins search for a new CEO  sources,news,"By Sheila Dang and Greg Roumeliotis
 Reuters    WeWork has started a search for a new chief executive following the departure of co founder Adam Neumann  people familiar with the matter said on Monday  as the U S  office sharing start up seeks to reverse its widening losses 
WeWork s current co CEOs  Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham  have only been in place since September  but talks indicated SoftBank Group  T 9984   WeWork s majority owner  is eager for a fresh change after a botched effort to go public this year 
WeWork has been in talks with a number of potential CEO candidates  including U S  wireless carrier T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS  CEO John Legere  the sources said  The Wall Street Journal first reported on Legere s talks with WeWork about the CEO job 
WeWork and T Mobile declined to comment 
Legere is not a leading candidate for the WeWork CEO role  one of the sources said  Ongoing talks with WeWork could represent a conflict  given that Legere is seeking to renegotiate with SoftBank the  26 billion merger of T Mobile and Sprint Corp  N S  
The deal is currently awaiting regulatory approval  and Legere said last week talks were ongoing with Sprint to extend their merger agreement  He declined to rule out requesting that the  26 billion price be reduced 
SoftBank last month spent around  10 billion to take control of WeWork  rescuing the company from potential bankruptcy after it failed to complete an initial public offering  which also led to Neumann s departure 
Neumann  who attracted criticism for his erratic management style  was replaced as CEO by Minson and Gunningham  but speculation has been rife that the pair are only a stopgap solution 
Since taking control of WeWork  SoftBank has already installed its chief operating officer  Marcelo Claure  as the executive chairman of WeWork parent The We Company 
SoftBank has talked about the need to return to WeWork s core business of renting out trendy office space to freelancers and enterprises  That would pull the company back from the fringe activities Neumann had forayed into  such as education

 Reuters     Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  beat Wall Street estimates for third quarter profit and revenue on Friday  as the largest U S  wireless carrier by subscribers signed up more mobile phone customers who pay a monthly bill

In the third quarter  Verizon added 615 000 postpaid customers  above analysts  estimates of 527 000  according to research firm FactSet 
Analysts pay attention to postpaid customers  or those with a recurring bill  because they are more valuable to carriers and tend to remain with the company longer than prepaid customers

Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U S  technology firms  That makes Ireland s Data Protection Commission  DPC   headed by Helen Dixon  the lead regulator in the bloc under the EU s General Data Protection Regulation s  GDPR   One Stop Shop  regime introduced last year 
The Irish Independent newspaper quoted Dixon as saying on Friday that her office s first major GDPR decision relating to a multinational firm looked set to be one of two probes it opened into WhatsApp 
More than half of the DPC s multinational investigations relate to Facebook  NASDAQ FB   eight directly focusing on the U S  social media giant  plus the two into WhatsApp and one into Facebook owned Instagram 
 I expect that file to land on my desk in the next fortnight   Dixon told the newspaper in an interview 
 I d like to say that we could do it in 48 hours  but it has to be in the order of months  to be done in the way that it has to be done  I will have to allow them a period of time to respond  I would have to consider their responses  
The new rules give regulators the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4  of a company s global revenue or 20 million euros   22 million   whichever is higher 
Dixon said her office was  not really looking at  the record breaking  5 billion fine Facebook agreed to pay last month to resolve a U S  government probe into its privacy practices 
 One criticism of the FTC s  U S  Federal Trade Commission  decision is that it has done nothing to change Facebook s business model  or the way that Facebook will handle personal data  The decisions that we make here have to have an impact  in terms of how the GDPR must be applied   she said 
Dixon told the newspaper that the DPC had also opened its 21st investigations into a multinational technology company  relating to  Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ  Inc s media division  previously named Oath 
In a separate  embarrassing ruling for the Irish government on Friday  the DPC told the state it must delete data held on 3 2 million of the country s 4 7 million citizens  gathered as part of the roll out of a identity card for public services

214825,436341,VZ,T Mobile And Sprint Deal Approval Shakes The 5G Space,opinion,"The  26 billion T Mobile   NYSE T   and Sprint   NYSE S   deal was finally approved last night  on the brink of the 5G revolution  This would create a massive combatant to Verizon   NYSE VZ   and AT T   NYSE T    who together make up roughly 70  of the wireless subscription market  according to statista com  The merger is going to change the competitive landscape of the US telecom market 
T Mobile s shares are up over 11  following the approved acquisition of Sprint  who itself saw a share price appreciation of 70   Sprint s stock has been tumbling since the beginning of 2017 as this company struggles to compete  The approved merger appears to have revived Sprint from the dead 
T Mobile s acquisition of Sprint has been held up for the last 2 years by regulatory concerns that this merger would be anticompetitive  hurting the consumer  and inhibiting innovation  Sprint s ostensible inability to compete in the evolving telecom landscape was the catalyst for the judge s approval of this deal 
Dish s Place in the Deal
The judge had some stipulations on the deal that included setting up Dish Network   NASDAQ DISH   as a new mobile carrier  This stipulation involves selling Dish Sprint s prepaid business comprised of Boost Mobile and Virgin mobile  9 million customers  as well as allowing Dish to use Sprints network for 7 years following the deals close  Dish Network has been struggling to survive the cord cutting revolution and has been seeing a falling topline and declining profitability 
This new revenue driver may bring Dish out of the cable ashes and into the forefront of 5G  Dish will have miles to go before they are really considered a legitimate competitor in the space  but this gives investors a little more faith in this declining company with its share price jumping over 5  today following the news 
Synergies
The judge also required that the new combined company to have 97  5G coverage in the US within the next 3 years  which would market a big win for rural America  The combined efforts of T Mobile and Sprint will put them at the forefront of 5G efforts making them a competitor to be reckoned with  The combined 5G spectrums of these mobile players will give them a sizable increase in access 
T Mobile and its eccentric CEO John Legere have illustrated excellent management capabilities as it navigates the incredibly competitive telecom space  The company has been able to expand revenues and create shareholder value 
I am confident that the synergies between Sprint and T Mobile will be massive with TMUS s capable management team at the helm  The 11  boost we see from TMUS  the acquiring firm  is atypical as the price from the acquiring firm usually declines  The markets are excited about this merger and what it will mean for the race to universal 5G 

Final Thoughts
This is undoubtedly going to disrupt the telecommunication space  Verizon shares fell over 2  on this news  and AT T s shares fell marginally  These companies now have more to worry about as the new T Mobile may be able to offer the same excellent service at a discounted rate  I think that TMUS shares have more room to run once this deal is closed  and integration begins to uncover synergies  TMUS could make an excellent long term telecom growth play for your portfolio 
The deal still has one last hurdle with the approval by the California Public Utility Commission pending  but they are well on their well to closing this deal

better prepare the new company  New T Mobile  to compete with arch rivals and lead to lower prices and faster Internet speeds  The companies further said that the consolidation could speed up the

 employees than the standalone companies would have had  and 11 000 more people by 2024  Moreover  plans to build more than 600 new retail locations and five new customer experience centers will create about 12 000 jobs  The merger  which is expected to be closed as early as Apr 1  remains subject to certain closing conditions  including probable additional court proceedings  and satisfactory resolution of outstanding business issues among the parties T Mobile continues to invest in building its nationwide 4G LTE network  which covers 327 million Americans  It also continues to deploy its 600 MHz spectrum  which covers 248 million people  and is live in 8 900 cities and towns across 49 states and Puerto Rico  In December 2019  the company launched America s first nationwide 5G network

214841,436357,VZ,Verizon Communications  VZ  Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Verizon Communications  VZ  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 15 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 12 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  1 74   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  cellphone carrier would post earnings of  1 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 25  delivering a surprise of 0 81  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Verizon  which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry  posted revenues of  34 78 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 74   This compares to year ago revenues of  34 28 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Verizon shares have lost about 3 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Verizon 
While Verizon has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Verizon was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

214851,436367,VZ,Verizon Communications  VZ  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Verizon Communications  VZ  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  cellphone carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 7  
Revenues are expected to be  34 53 billion  up 0 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 97  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verizon 
For Verizon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 32  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Verizon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Verizon would post earnings of  1 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 25  delivering a surprise of  0 81  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Verizon appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-communications-vz-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200501082,200501082

214986,436502,VZ,Huawei Issue Opens Rift Between U S  and Global Carriers,news," Bloomberg     A group representing top U S  mobile service providers disagreed with European and Asian counterparts over alleged security threats from Chinese equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co  ahead of a conference that will highlight a U S  Europe divide on the issue 
A Feb  14 release from GSMA  a London based wireless industry group  urged European lawmakers not to ban Huawei as a supplier  But CTIA  a Washington based group  responded Tuesday with its own statement saying the GSMA  does not represent the views of all wireless operators or all regions  
The divergent statements underscore a fissure opening between Washington and carriers and regulators around the world  who re starting to re evaluate U S  warnings that China s largest technology corporation aids Beijing in espionage  This week  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern left the door open for Huawei to play a role in the rollout of next generation networks  while a senior Italian government official dismissed the issue 
European carriers offered to cooperate with their governments in devising steps to ward off vulnerabilities  CTIA  with members that include U S  market leaders AT T Inc  NYSE T   and  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ    has urged U S  regulators to go slow in crafting rules on equipment security 
 It looks like they re scared of the impact of European policy making on the rollout of their 5G networks  that will offer advanced speeds  said Gigi Sohn  a fellow at the Georgetown University Law Center Institute for Technology Law and Policy  said of the U S  group   It seems they re concerned that if Europe does so  it would become the de facto standard  
Beyond U S  Chinese bickering  economics plays an important role in what gear goes into future 5G networks  the advent of which are expected to galvanize everything from smart cities and self driving cars to fully automated homes  Huawei s technology is considered on par with the likes of Ericsson  BS ERICAs  or Nokia s  but more cost effective  LG Uplus  the smallest of Korea s carriers  is an open supporter and its patronage helped the country become the largest initial market for Huawei s 5G equipment 
A GSMA spokesman in an emailed comment Tuesday said its  initial statement was clearly focused on activity in Europe and does not reflect the views of all GSMA members globally   The group says it represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide  The group lists AT T and Verizon as members 
The U S  government is increasing the size of its usual delegation to the GSMA s annual industry conference  MWC Barcelona  to be held next week  Huawei is also bolstering its presence at the event  setting the scene for a showdown as both sides try to win over the chief executives of the world s biggest carriers 
The U S  and China clashed Saturday at a security conference in Munich over whether Huawei s equipment should be banned from future 5G networks  U S  Vice President Mike Pence said the company is required to turn over data to Beijing s security officials  Chinese politburo member Yang Jiechi was up next on the same stage  and said his country s law doesn t require companies to collect intelligence  Yang urged Europeans to consider whether the U S  had their interests at heart  or its own 
Shenzhen based Huawei has denied wrongdoing and long maintained it doesn t provide back doors for the Chinese government  pointing out that no one has provided evidence to support such concerns 
CTIA didn t specify what was objectionable in GSMA s 800 word statement 
 We can achieve our 5G ambitions with a secure global supply chain that reflects national security concerns   the CTIA said   We caution against a patchwork approach of different rules for different regions which would result in less competition in supply chains  
GSMA on Feb  14 said  mobile operators are ready to work with European agencies in charge of promoting certification and security requirements   It recommended that  governments and mobile operators work together to agree  on a testing and certification regime for Europe 
The FCC should  work with other expert agencies to conduct a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of the costs and benefits of various approaches before taking action  on network security  CTIA said last year in a filing at the agency  The FCC is considering whether to bar spending of U S  subsidies on companies deemed a security risk 
Jilane Rodgers Petrie  a spokeswoman for CTIA  didn t return a telephone call and email 
The Feb  14 statement from GSMA didn t mention Huawei by name  Restricting access to a network equipment maker would handicap Europe s progress in developing artificial intelligence  the  internet of things  and so called big data  the group of more than 750 companies said  The technology promises to deliver data to phones 10 times faster than 4G and to connect people  cars  factories and household objects 
The joint appeal follows individual warnings from companies such as Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn    Vodafone  Group  LON VOD  Plc and BT Group  LON BT  Plc and underscores how alarmed the companies have become that they may not be able to use one of their biggest suppliers  In Asia  carriers from South Korea to the Philippines have said they plan to continue using Huawei equipment 
The GSMA on Feb  14 said its members had found no evidence of wrongdoing even though they have been  meticulously  testing mobile infrastructure for years  The group said it would create a task force to find ways to strengthen existing security testing 
 An earlier version was corrected to say AT T  Verizon are members of the GSMA

215001,436517,VZ,T Mobile Chief Pledges He Won t Use Huawei Equipment,news," Bloomberg     T Mobile US Inc  Chief Executive Officer John Legere says his company doesn t use equipment from Huawei Technologies Co   and won t after buying Sprint Corp  to form a bigger No  3 in the U S  wireless market 
 Let me be clear    we do not use Huawei or ZTE network equipment in any area of our network  Period  And we will never use it in our 5G network   Legere said in written testimony prepared for a hearing Wednesday before the House communications subcommittee 
The statement is in response to critics who ve raised the issue of the Chinese equipment maker as a risk to national security to build opposition to the proposed  26 5 billion merger 
Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp  has  significant ties  to Huawei  as does T Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   according to Carri Bennet  general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association that represents smaller competitors to the merging parties  Huawei supplies Deutsche Telekom  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
 Allowing a Japanese influenced company and German influenced company to merge when both have significant 5G ties to Huawei appears to run counter to U S  national security concerns   Bennet said in testimony submitted for the hearing 
Lawmakers and the administration of President Donald Trump say Huawei poses a potential security threat  if only because it can t buck orders from China s government  and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo this week urged Europeans to shun the Shenzhen based company 
Huawei says it s privately held  doesn t take orders from the Beijing government  and wouldn t do so because that would ruin its business that relies on income worldwide 
The Federal Communications Commission is considering whether to effectively ban Huawei from U S  networks  already the company s gear is effectively limited to small providers attracted by low prices 
Still  critics bring up Huawei and perils that are likewise ascribed to ZTE Corp  HK 0763    another Chinese gear maker 
 T Mobile  Sprint  and their parent companies refuse to commit to the American public not to use the Chinese companies in building 5G infrastructure if allowed to merge   Protect America s Wireless  a group that has held several news conferences critical of the merger  said in a Tuesday press release  The group has refused to disclose its backers 
Legere seemed to have the group in mind 
 Opponents of the transaction have set up a shadowy group that refuses to disclose its donors  to lob allegations that this transaction will allow Huawei and ZTE into U S  networks   the T Mobile chief said in his testimony   That s false  and they know it is  
A U S  watchdog group that checks the national security implications of deals    the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U S   or Cfius    has approved the proposed merger  the companies said in December 
It s not clear how much weight the security concerns will carry in the debate  Nine U S  senators in a Tuesday letter raised other consequences as they urged the FCC and Justice Department to kill the deal  Problems include less competition  higher bills  and lost jobs  the lawmakers said 
Legere argues that the merger will produce more jobs  lower prices and competition for market leaders AT T Inc  NYSE T     Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   and even cable providers such as Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA

215027,436543,VZ,The Promise of 5G Is the Problem With Huawei in Eyes of Critics,news," Bloomberg     The new wireless technology known as 5G will do more than make mobile phones faster    it will link billions of devices  revolutionizing transportation  manufacturing and even medicine  It will also create a multitude of potential openings for bad actors to exploit 
The vulnerability helps explain the rising tension between the U S  and Huawei Technologies Co   China s largest technology company  Huawei is pushing for a global leadership role in 5G  but American officials suspect that would help Beijing spy on Western governments and companies 
 Huawei s significant presence in 5G creates a new vector for possible cyber espionage and malware   Michael Wessel  a commissioner on the U S  China Economic and Security Review Commission that advises Congress  said in an interview  By connecting whole new classes of products  5G  creates new vulnerabilities  
The technology holds great promise  Forests of gadgets will communicate instantly via millions of antennas  Cars will talk to each other to avert lethal crashes  factory foremen will monitor parts supplies and doctors can perform remote surgery as video  sound and data flow without delay  Connections will be 10 to 100 times faster than current standards    quick enough to download an entire movie in seconds 
Yet U S  national security officials see billions of opportunities for spies  hackers and cyber thieves to steal trade secrets  sabotage machinery and even order cars to crash  Citing security threats  the U S  has been pushing allies to block Huawei from telecommunications networks  The U S  Congress has banned government agencies from buying the company s gear 
The company denies that it is a threat   The fear about Huawei and 5G is misplaced   Andy Purdy  chief security officer for Huawei in the U S   said in an interview   This is a strengthened network  a more secure network  
The new technology will require an overhaul of telecommunications infrastructure  The term 5G stands for a fifth generation  to succeed the current fourth generation of mobile connectivity that has made video sharing and movie streaming commonplace 
Standards for 5G are being written  and large scale commercial deployment isn t expected until 2020  according to the U S  China review commission  Major U S  carriers AT T Inc  NYSE T   and  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   are rolling out small scale versions of the service 
In the meantime  the number of internet connected devices is growing by nearly one third each year  and will reach 25 1 billion by 2021  according to an estimate by consulting firm Gartner Inc 
As those changes unfold  Huawei is under intense scrutiny by the U S  and its allies 
Its chief financial officer  Meng Wanzhou  the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei  was arrested in Canada at the behest of the U S  in December on fraud charges linked to alleged Iran sanction violations  A sales executive was arrested last week in Poland on suspicion of espionage and fired over the weekend 
 His alleged actions have no relation to the company   Huawei said in an emailed statement  noting   The incident in question has brought Huawei into disrepute  
A federal criminal investigation of possible parts theft from T Mobile US Inc  was revealed this week  China s foreign ministry said Thursday the legal dispute between Huawei and T Mobile had already been resolved  and expressed concern about the motives behind the  reinvestigation  
The company  founded by Ren in 1987  has emerged as a premier overseas presence for China  with a projected  108 billion in annual sales and operations extending to Africa  Asia and Europe 
Ren  in a rare discussion with foreign reporters on Tuesday  denied suggestions that Huawei aids the Chinese government in espionage  saying it has no regular contact with Beijing 
 Some countries have decided not to buy equipment from Huawei   he said   Therefore  we can shift our focus to better serve countries that welcome Huawei  We can build high quality networks in those countries to prove that we are trustworthy  
Ren also called Donald Trump  a great president  and said he ll take a wait and see approach as to whether the U S  leader will intervene on behalf of his daughter  Trump in December said he would intervene if it helped win a trade deal with China 
Huawei holds an ever growing share of the world s smartphone market and it and China s government have both made it a priority to develop 5G capabilities  Already Huawei is the world s largest telecommunications equipment maker  with 28 percent of a  37 2 billion market in 2017  according to the U S  China review commission 
Huawei has said that blacklisting its equipment without proof will hurt the industry and disrupt the development of new high speed technology 
In its latest annual report  Huawei said it had conducted 5G tests with more than 30 leading carriers in more than 10 cities around the world   We have been investing heavily in 5G research since 2009   the company said 
Huawei has always maintained that it s independent and doesn t give the Chinese government access to its equipment 
Misgivings  however  continue to flourish in the West 
Retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert Spalding  a former member of the National Security Council under the Trump administration  has privately circulated a memo painting a future of communications dominated by China  Eventually  alternatives to its network technology won t exist  because other suppliers won t be able to compete with government subsidized offerings from Huawei and fellow Chinese gear maker ZTE Corp  HK 0763    Spalding said in the memo 
Once China controls the market for internet connected devices  it will be able  to weaponize cities   Spalding said in the memo   Think of self driving cars that suddenly mow down unsuspecting pedestrians  Think of drones that fly into the intakes of airliners  
Spalding left the National Security Council last year after he called for an enlarged U S  government role in communications  creating an uproar because networks in the U S  are privately owned and managed 
Chinese laws obligate the nation s telecommunications operators to provide its intelligence services unfettered access to their networks  James Mulvenon  a China expert at the SOS International intelligence consultancy  told the U S  China review commission at a March hearing 
Mulvenon called Huawei  a legitimate globally competitive  90 billion plus company  and said  it is not a front company or a platform for Chinese intelligence  
But  he said   Given the nature of the political and legal environment in China  they would not be able to refuse a request  a subsequent request  from the Chinese government for access  to a network that Huawei runs 
In the U S   telecommunications companies have also played a role in surveillance  For instance  in 2013 members of Congress confirmed they knew of a secret court order compelling Verizon Communications Inc  to turn over data about its customers  calls  In 2015  Congress voted to stop the National Security Agency from collecting bulk records on Americans  phone calls and instead get a court order for specific records 
As 5G is introduced  there s an increasing push to bar risky equipment from crucial networks  said Wessel  of the U S  China commission 
 The internet is the backbone of our economy  the backbone of our security apparatus and the workings of our government   Wessel said   And we need to take substantial steps to make sure we have confidence in the security of those networks  ",2019-01-17,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-promise-of-5g-is-the-problem-with-huawei-in-eyes-of-critics-1750552,1750552

215095,436611,VZ,Service  Don t rely on Venezuela s state telecoms firm Cantv,news,"By Angus Berwick BARINAS  Venezuela  Reuters    When Ceferino Angulo heard screams and gunshots one night last year close to his dairy farm on the western plains of Venezuela  he tried to call the police  but there was no phone signal   He was not surprised  A phone tower  built by state telecommunications firm Cantv on his land to provide coverage to his local area outside the western city of Barinas  had stopped working  The tower  set in rolling grassland on his 57 acre farm  was overgrown with vines snaking up its pylons  Its guardhouse was abandoned almost a decade ago and no Cantv employee had visited in three months  54 year old Angulo said   We ve spent four years incommunicado  A telephone signal is one of the things we most need here   he said  In the decade since the government nationalized the 88 year old firm  Cantv has cut investment in new technology  skilled staff have departed and thieves have pillaged its equipment  according to a dozen current and former Cantv employees and internal documents   Venezuelan businesses struggle to operate because phone lines have stopped working  worsening a five year economic crisis that has shrunk the Venezuelan economy  People find it difficult to access healthcare or sign up for new passports because they cannot register online   A Cantv spokeswoman declined to comment  Cantv President Manuel Fernandez did not respond to emails and text messages  Last year  Fernandez said on a government website that Cantv was a  powerful tool  to give telecoms access to people and build the socialist state  Internet use in the country had quadrupled since 2007  he said  Cellphone connections are patchy across Venezuela  however  and people are reporting ever more network outages  which the government has blamed on right wing saboteurs  Barinas  also the area where former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez lived and studied as a youth  has been one of the areas hardest hit by the deterioration in Cantv service  In some places  coverage has been completely lost   Rusting service vehicles sit abandoned outside the phone company s local headquarters  as it cannot afford new tires or batteries  the current and former employees told Reuters  Cantv s own offices there often spend days without internet  they said  Some of the rusted electrical circuits providing internet to Barinas homes have not been replaced since the early 1990s and several residents said they had gone over a year without a connection   There is a crisis of investment   said Jose Luis Machin  Barinas  former mayor  A Cantv technician taking a Reuters journalist on a tour of the company s infrastructure in Barinas said over 100 meters  328 ft  of copper cable had been stolen the night before from a bridge  severing the neighborhood s connection  Thieves melt down the copper or even sell the cables back to Cantv  the technician and two other employees said  For telecoms services  Barinas  nearly 300 000 residents now depend on network terminals built during the past few years by Chinese telecoms firms ZTE  HK 0763  and Huawei   On one block  a ZTE terminal was considered so valuable that a guard from the National Bolivarian Militia  a branch of the armed forces  said he had been posted there to protect it from vandals   FROZEN IN TIME  Cantv  founded in 1930  was re nationalized by President Chavez in 2007 as he moved to consolidate his socialist revolution  The company was once Latin America s leader in the telecommunications sector  It was majority owned by U S  firm  Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ  and traded on the New York stock exchange  In the past it invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new technology each year  attracted top talent and paid them generous salaries  the former employees said  Since its nationalization  they said  Cantv had filled thousands of vacated positions with unqualified staff  The company has stopped upgrading its servers and maintenance on its fiber optic network was halted  causing ever more frequent service disruptions  they said  Fernandez said last year that  before its nationalization  Cantv was an elitist U S  controlled company which took its profits abroad instead of investing in the country  According to the Speedtest Global index  Venezuela ranks among the worst five countries for both mobile and broadband connection speeds  Cantv had 2 45 million internet subscribers  nearly 7 million fixed line subscribers and almost 14 million mobile subscribers by the end of 2015  according to internal data seen by Reuters  The country s population is around 32 million  Average salaries at Cantv are now worth less than  8 a month and pay often arrives late  People who oppose the ruling Socialist Party do not get promotions  employees said   The company is frozen in time   Jose Maria De Viana  a former chairman of Cantv s mobile phone unit  said  Cantv publishes few financial details but a copy of its private results  seen by Reuters  for the January October 2016 period shows the company can no longer fund itself   It was short 2 72 billion bolivars  then the equivalent of  1 8 million  to meet its investment target and needed 390 million bolivars in  external funds  to help cover the shortfall  data in the documents showed  Between 2013 and 2016  Cantv s payroll for its 15 000 employees quadrupled as the government lifted wages to compensate for inflation  according to the report seen by Reuters  Two executives with access to company data  who resigned in recent months  told Reuters that Cantv has to request funds from the central bank to pay its staff  The company also suffers from the government s insistence that it keeps its fees low  currently the equivalent of less than one dollar per month   Cantv was dependent on agreements with ZTE and Huawei to supply equipment and staff and the firms were paid in dollars out of the Venezuela China Joint Fund  a bilateral financing program  the current and former employees said  Cantv sends its employees to China to receive training  they added  President Nicolas Maduro has turned to ZTE  in particular  to implement technology projects  Last week  Reuters reported details of ZTE s role developing a new smart card ID that critics say Maduro is using as a tool to monitor the populace and allocate scarce resources to people his government deems most loyal  Su Qingfeng  the head of ZTE s Venezuela unit  said in a phone interview that ZTE was not Cantv s biggest provider and received no preferential treatment with contracts  A Huawei spokesman declined to comment on its relationship with Cantv  Even Cantv s pro government union has complained about the company s  serious problems   In a private letter to members last year  the Fetratel union chairman  Jose David Mora  wrote that Cantv could not obtain new equipment due to a lack of foreign currency  He said the company was deep in debt to Chinese firms  
 There is total impunity for those that have bled this company dry   he wrote  citing  zero confidence  in the current leadership  Fetratel did not respond to requests for comment ",2018-11-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/service-dont-rely-on-venezuelas-state-telecoms-firm-cantv-1697818,1697818

Nine years later  in October 2008  VZ stock was barely holding above  21 50  The  in the US lost two thirds of its market value in less than a decade  And just when the future looked the bleakest  the bulls finally returned 




Verizon  NYSE VZ  closed slightly below  60 a share yesterday  It is now within a striking distance of a new record  twenty years after reaching the previous one  The only question is  can it last this time  The  chart below doesn t look very encouraging 
Verizon s weekly chart reveals the stock s entire 11 year recovery since October 2008  It looks like a classic   labeled  1   2   3   4   5   Wave  3  is extended and its five sub waves are also visible  Wave 5  on the other hand  is an  
The theory states that a three wave correction in the other direction follows every impulse  If this count is correct  a bearish reversal can lead to a notable decline in the years ahead  The support area near  43 a share looks like a natural target for the bears once wave 5 of  5  is over 
Whether Verizon  NYSE VZ  will make a new all time high or not is not very important  What matters is that even if it does  the uptrend probably won t continue for very long  We think the  near  65 a share can cause a 30  35  plunge  Global recession fears only make the bearish case stronger ",2019-10-09,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-nears-new-record-can-it-last-200471756,200471756

215130,436646,VZ,Verizon  VZ  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Verizon Communications  VZ  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Verizon is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Verizon imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Verizon
This largest U S  cellphone carrier is expected to earn  4 81 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 2 1  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Verizon  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Verizon to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-09-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-vz-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know-200467481,200467481

215132,436648,VZ,Should Value Investors Consider Verizon  VZ  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Verizon Communication Inc    NYSE VZ   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Verizon has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 82  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 03  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Verizon s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 14 60 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer   Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 86  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Verizon has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 54  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Verizon stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Verizon has a P S ratio of about 1 91  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Verizon currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Verizon a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Verizon might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives VZ a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been sturdy at best  The current quarter has seen eleven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen sixteen up and one down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Verizon Communications Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineVerizon is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 26  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Wireless National industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech

higher cash flow from operations  Capital expenditures for 2019 are likely to be in the range of  17 billion to  18 billion Moving ForwardWith one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States  Verizon is likely to benefit immensely from the launch of the 5G Ultra Wideband network in select markets across the country  as it gears up to increase the tally of 5G Ultra Wideband mobility cities to 30 in 2019

215168,436684,VZ,All You Need To Know About Verizon  VZ  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Verizon Communications  VZ  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Verizon is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Verizon imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Verizon
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this largest U S  cellphone carrier is expected to earn  4 80 per share  which is a change of 1 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Verizon  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

215191,436707,VZ,Verizon s Q2 Earnings Will Highlight A Less Risky Approach To Reviving Growth,opinion,"Reports Q2 2019 results on Thursday  Aug  1  before the open


Revenue expectation   32 41 billion


EPS expectation   1 2

It s not a good time to be excited about telecom companies like Verizon  NYSE VZ   The consumer shift to internet based entertainment providers has accelerated cord cutting  pushing their revenues from cable and media businesses into a perpetual decline  In addition to that  cut throat competition in the wireless market is also hurting their margins 
These headwinds are likely to depress Verizon s Q2 earnings when it reports tomorrow  They ve already weighed heavily on the shares of the U S  s largest wireless carrier  which have significantly underperformed the broader market this year  Verizon stock has gained just 2  while the S P 500 hit a new record and is up more than 20   The shares closed down 1 3  yesterday at  56 64 





To survive in this challenging environment  the leading players in the U S  are trying different strategies  AT T  NYSE T   for example  completed an  85 billion merger with Time Warner last year as part of its push to become a modern media giant  betting big on its coming video streaming service 
Last week  the U S  Justice Department approved the acquisition by T Mobile U S   NASDAQ TMUS  of Sprint Corp   clearing one of the biggest hurdles to a takeover that will consolidate the wireless industry and limit the number of players in the game 
Verizon s Different Approach To Growth
Verizon is taking a different approach though  Instead of bulking up its balance sheet with mega deals  Verizon has been focusing on improving its infrastructure and cutting costs  The company s new CEO Hans Vestberg has  so far  avoided the big entertainment acquisitions that peers like AT T and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  have pursued 
Instead  the carrier has made smaller bets focused on enhancing its strategy to quickly improve its network  Due to its timely acquisition of Straight Path Communications last year  Verizon is ahead in the race to build a fifth generation  or 5G network  part of an industry wide effort to increase speeds and open up new revenue sources 
5G wireless networks are crucial for the success of some futuristic applications  such as driverless cars  smart homes and remote surgical procedures and this is one area where Verizon is firmly at the head of the pack 
In October  Verizon got a head start in introducing residential broadband and TV services using 5G technology in four cities that are serving as a testing ground for the company  It plans to roll out the service in parts of more than 30 cities before the end of the year 
This slow but steady approach isn t generating too many headlines for the carrier  However  it s clearly helping keep the growth momentum going  In the first quarter  Verizon posted an 11  jump in net income to  5 billion from  4 5 billion a year earlier  Quarterly revenue ticked up about 1  to  32 1 billion 
The company is in the process of cutting  10 billion in costs by 2021  By the end of Q1  Verizon had already cut  3 billion in spending  helped by a voluntary severance program and expense savings 
Bottom Line
Verizon s earnings report tomorrow may not provide many good reasons to buy its stock  given the tough operating environment for telecoms  But  in our view  the downside risk during this time of distress is also limited when it comes to Verizon  With its focused growth strategy  strong balance sheet  growing dividend  Verizon is a solid and comparatively safe pick for long term investors ",2019-07-31,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizons-q2-earnings-will-highlight-a-less-risky-approach-to-reviving-growth-200447745,200447745
215192,436708,VZ,Verizon Communications  VZ  Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Verizon Communications  VZ  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 23 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 20 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 20 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 50   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  cellphone carrier would post earnings of  1 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 20  delivering a surprise of 2 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Verizon  which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry  posted revenues of  32 07 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1   This compares to year ago revenues of  32 20 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Verizon shares have lost about 1 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for Verizon 
While Verizon has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Verizon was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 22 on  32 84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 75 on  131 83 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Wireless National is currently in the top 30  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-communications-vz-tops-q2-earnings-estimates-200448899,200448899

215232,436748,VZ,What Makes Verizon  VZ  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Verizon Communications  VZ  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Verizon basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Verizon  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Verizon
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this largest U S  cellphone carrier is expected to earn  4 75 per share  which is a change of 0 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Verizon  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Verizon to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-verizon-vz-a-new-buy-stock-200440352,200440352

215241,436757,VZ,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Verizon  VZ ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Verizon Communications  VZ   which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this largest U S  cellphone carrier has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 2 66   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Verizon was expected to post earnings of  1 17 per share  but it reported  1 20 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 56   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 09 per share  while it actually produced  1 12 per share  a surprise of 2 75  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Verizon  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Verizon has an Earnings ESP of  4 35  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-verizon-vz-200436164,200436164

215254,436770,VZ,Inflation Expectations Sketch Out Growing Downside,opinion,"For the third time in the last five months  inflation expectations have matched record lows  To hear officials and Economists talk  you d think they were at or nearing record highs  The unemployment rate  after all  is at a 50 year low point which by mainstream reckoning should mean the cusp of an epic wage driven breakout 
According to the University of Michigan s Surveys of Consumers  it s just not there  In fact  it s never been there  Like bond yields  there has only been conspicuous lack of any evidence to back up the claim the labor market is tight  The entire LABOR SHORTAGE     which has curiously disappeared this year  was based on cherry picked anecdotes and never anything more 

Even if you don t particularly care for consumer surveys  there s the same consensus from market based views  The TIPS market  where getting inflation wrong can really  really cost you  there was a total absence of concern about an inflationary breakout  too 
Nowadays  the focus is entirely the other way  Once more  consumers and the bond market agree   Economists have no idea what s going on in the economy 

In April  the FOMC trying to make some semblance of an argument for a second half rebound once more used the word  transitory   While they did so  market expectations were already low and preparing to dip even further 
The 5 year 5 year forward inflation rate  a market measure of  anchored  inflation expectations  recently dropped to the lowest level in more than two and a half years  The market is saying that inflation expectations are now less than they were in January 2015  oil crash  or September 2011  second global crisis  
 
How bad is this  Inflation expectations have rarely been lower than they are right now  This includes market as well as survey based measures  a broad consensus that the labor market view derived from the unemployment rate isn t just flawed it is entirely misleading 
It always was  which is why it is no surprise to find another month without the promised inflationary breakout in the inflation numbers themselves  Those promises were never really honest analysis  and never the actual consensus outside of econometrics and the few who never leave their models 

The PCE Deflator increased just 1 52  year over year in the month of May 2019  That s now five straight months below target  However one may think of the series  it is undershooting all over again  Had the economic trends as the mainstream described them in 2017 been true  it would have represented a paradigm shift out of the post 2008 funk  an actual end to the Great  Recession  at long last 
The bond curves disagreed all along  saying loudly there was little chance for it  Outside of oil prices  there was never any inflationary pressures because the economy hadn t changed at all  It simply went into reflationary mode  like before  and now once again it s back into being monetarily squeezed  dollar shortage  

Even the core PCE Deflator has dropped in a manner consistent with past Euro  episodes  Today without Verizon  NYSE VZ  to blame  at 1 60  growth in May it is uncomfortably close to the prevailing levels of 2015 and 2016 rather than a new ascent far and away above the monetary policy target 
The second half rebound  or even the rate cuts are insurance view  both are predicated on the same mistaken interpretation  The labor market is strong  therefore the economy will easily transit this soft patch  or at least do so with a minor boost from Jay Powell 
The inflation numbers instead make plain the labor market was never strong  and both consumers and bond investors are considering only a growing downside on the economy  One that other parts of the bond market confirm is just getting started ",2019-06-30,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/inflation-undershoots-inflation-expectations-sketch-out-growing-downside-200435873,200435873

Verizon Communications is a member of our Computer and Technology group  which includes 637 different companies and currently sits at  8 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups

215264,436780,VZ,The Government Won t Let Huawei Enforce U S  Patents,opinion,"Huawei may be looking for an opportunity to talk to government officials  but the government is clearly not in the mood  Not only have officials made it clear that there are going to be no negotiations with the company  but it has also indicated that it will go to lengths to see that the company doesn t create any mischief 
So when Huawei said Verizon   NYSE VZ   owes it a billion dollars for infringement of 230 patents  Republican Senator Marco Rubio tweeted that the action was an  attempt by  Huawei  to retaliate against the U S  by setting the stage for baseless  but costly  patent claims  
He even followed that up with a proposed amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act  NDAA  that was earlier invoked to prevent federal purchases of Huawei products on the basis of national security concerns  The NDAA sets the broad policies for spending by the Department of Defense 
The current amendment seeks to prevent companies like Huawei that are placed on specified U S  watch lists  from seeking legal resolution or damages in any U S  court with respect to U S  patents  While it still hasn t been signed into law  this could happen quickly since both Republicans and Democrats generally agree on China concerns 
Huawei has of late been amassing U S  patents  so the company may have been waiting to start claiming its rights anyway  Now that other revenue sources in the U S  are drying up  it may have been exploring this route 
The truth is  the company is already feeling the pain of U S  sanctions with officials confirming that international sales are down 40   according to media reports   And although domestic sales have accelerated  and could see the company through the short term emergency  the inability to include American technology would cripple the company and limit it to second rate offerings for sale in the domestic market  Until it is able to come up with alternatives of its own that is  If at all it is able to create suitable alternatives  it could be several years before such technology is exported for gain 
The Chinese government could step in as part of its trade deal  something the U S  has said it will entertain  Or it may not  if it is willing to take the risk of Huawei  which is a huge company  somehow battle it out on its own

215277,436793,VZ,Why Nokia Is The 5G Stock Set To Take Off,opinion,"Wireless technology has come a long way 
The first generation of wireless known as 1G was rolled out in the 1980s  The only thing a user could do with 1G was make a phone call 
At times  the call quality could rival that of two tin cans connected by a string 
But wireless tech has made huge advances since those early days 
About every 10 years we ve seen a new generation of wireless 1G  2G  3G  and today s 4G  Each was faster and more reliable than the previous generation 
As you may already know  we are about to see the next generation of wireless  It s the new 5G technology  which is slated to hit the market this year 
And that creates a big opportunity for investors 
Why 5G Is So Important
To understand why 5G is such a big deal  you must understand one thing  latency 
Latency is when there are delays in sending information from one point to the next  This is different than bandwidth  which is the volume of data being transferred  not the speed of the transfer 
The lower the latency  the faster information can race across a network 
And the 5G network has very  very  very low latency  This core attribute of 5G will revolutionize many industries 
Remote medical procedures are just one example  Low latency will enable remotely located robots to instantly mimic human movements 
This will give doctors the real time response they need to perform surgery on a patient located anywhere in the world 
The next era of self driving cars will also depend on 5G  The new technology will allow cars to  talk  to each other in real time 
5G will even change farming  Farm equipment company John Deere is developing 5G technology that promises to radically boost crop yields 
5G is a gamechanger  And there s been a ton of money flowing into 5G related companies 
Major Investment in 5G Is Already Underway
Companies have already spent over  200 billion on 5G infrastructure 
Most of this money has gone toward building 5G ready cell towers 
That s a lot of money  but there is much more to come  Research firm Moor Insights   Strategy expects that 5G related IT hardware spending will reach  326 billion by 2025 
See  to achieve the speed and reliability of 5G requires lots of cell towers 
Today  the 4G network uses 25 000 cell towers across the US  Each one is 100 feet  or more  tall  and they are spaced several miles apart 
The 5G network will need 200 000 cell towers that are much smaller and spaced in a much tighter web across the US 
So in the near term  almost all 5G spending will go to building out the cell tower grid 
When it s ready  5G speeds will be 20 gigabytes per second  That s 1000x faster than today s 4G technology 
5G will make wireless bandwidth seem infinite  And the companies building the infrastructure for this new technology will be the first to profit 
Picking the Right Horse in the Race to 5G
There are a few ways to invest in the evolution to 5G 
You could buy the stock of companies that maintain and operate 5G infrastructure  These would be stable dividend companies like AT T  NYSE T   Verizon  NYSE VZ   and China Mobile  OTC CHLKF  
These are low risk  limited upside investments that will take time to bear fruit 
Things work slowly in the telecom space  We saw this play out when 4G was introduced 
To gain the benefits of the 4G network  users had to replace their 3G phones  Phones aren t cheap  and 3G phone owners had to first be convinced that the new phones and features were worth the money  That took some time 
Instead  I recommend going the  picks and shovels  route  This means companies who build the infrastructure that supports 5G technology 
These companies are making money from their 5G investments right now 
I like to buy companies that sell the  picks and shovels  that industries need  like investing in farm machinery companies rather than agricultural businesses 
In the 5G space  this would be companies that sell the hardware  software  and services to telecom companies 
And we can leverage our bet by owning a company with exposure to the international adoption of 5G technology 
There s only one company that fits these criteria 
Nokia  NOK  
Nokia  NYSE NOK  is a Finnish multinational telecommunications company  It is the world s third largest telecom equipment manufacturer after Huawei and Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  
The company is split into two segments 
  Nokia Networks  90  of sales   provides systems and software to build high capacity network infrastructure 
  Nokia Technologies  10  of sales   develops consumer products and licenses technology for the Nokia brand 
Almost all of Nokia s business comes from selling data networking and telecom equipment  That s just what we want because I expect those types of sales will see big growth as 5G investment ramps up 
The build out of the 5G network will be global  and Nokia is a truly international company 
Even better  two of Nokia s biggest rivals ZTE  HK 0763  and Huawei  were blacklisted by the US government  This will shrink NOK s competition in this US market to pretty much just one company Ericsson  BS ERICAs  
The investment flow into 5G from the major telecom companies has already started to climb 
In July  Nokia received a  3 5 billion contract from T Mobile US  which was reportedly the largest 5G deal ever 
T Mobile has about a 17  share of the US wireless market  making this a major win for NOK 
This Play Will Take Time  Be Patient
The flow of investment will not  however  hit the 5G market like a giant wave 
It will be more like a steadily rising tide  In fact  NOK management expects 5G investment to be soft in the first half of 2019 
But that s perfect for investors  It gives us an opening to get in before the tide of money starts to rise 
The multibillion dollar contract from T Mobile looks like a sign of some early pump priming for more 5G spending 
The other major wireless carriers in the US aren t going to let themselves lag behind in the race to 5G 
I think we will soon see bigger 5G contracts make the headlines  As a major player in a market with limited competition  Nokia will almost certainly win a lot more US sales by the end of 2019 ",2019-05-27,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buy-this-pickandshovel-5g-stock-before-it-takes-off-200425218,200425218

215300,436816,VZ,Verizon  VZ  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Verizon Communications  VZ  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Verizon basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Verizon imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Verizon
This largest U S  cellphone carrier is expected to earn  4 73 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 0 4

215303,436819,VZ,T Mobile  Sprint CEOs Turn From Bitter Rivals to Kindred Spirits,news," Bloomberg     There seemed no love lost between Marcelo Claure and John Legere  a pair of chief executives who sniped at each other incessantly    on Twitter  at public events  even in ads  But behind the scenes  the two telecoms moguls were bonding around a common cause 
The fruits of that relationship became apparent this weekend  when T Mobile US Inc  agreed to acquire Sprint Corp  for  26 5 billion  Just months after a previous attempt collapsed under regulatory concerns  Legere and Claure have again driven the No  3 and No  4 American carriers together  realizing neither alone can outgun  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc  NYSE T   in the coming era of blazing fast fifth generation wireless 
The deal follows years of back and forth between Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   the German company that controls T Mobile  and SoftBank Group Corp   Sprint s Japanese owner  But it was only in the past month or so that Claure really intensified his lobbying  calling SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son several times a week to reinforce the urgency of an alliance to take on the industry leaders  according to people familiar with the matter  Legere meanwhile worked on convincing Deutsche to come back to the table  the people said  asking not to be identified discussing the details 
China is now racing ahead on 5G research and investment and the sense was that the Trump administration  distrustful of the Asian power  would be more inclined to green light a deal than its predecessor  the people said  The market dynamics were also changing  Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA   was steadily gaining broadband users while other cable operators hovered on the margins  With Legere on board    the two CEOs had begun meeting in person and speaking regularly by phone    the scene was set for the largest telecoms merger in years 
 We share a common vision on how the network will be built and we realized we need each other to be mega successful    Claure said in an interview over the weekend   We can t build a 5G network without T Mobile and T Mobile can t build it without Sprint  
The new corporation certainly carries a lot more financial heft    crucial if it s to remain competitive in costly 5G infrastructure development  Operating as T Mobile  it would have about  74 billion in annual revenue and 70 million wireless subscribers  That s within shooting distance of Verizon s  88 billion in 2017 wireless revenue and 111 million subscribers  and AT T s  71 billion and 78 million 
Under terms of the deal  Deutsche Telekom will end up with a 42 percent ownership stake while SoftBank will have 27 percent  T Mobile s Mike Sievert will be president and chief operating officer  The German company s chairman  Tim Hoettges  will serve in that role at the combined company while Legere becomes CEO  and the board will include Claure and Son 
But it s Claure and Legere that proved pivotal to resuscitating a deal  the two men had grown increasingly certain they shared the same vision of 5G as the future  the people familiar with the matter said 
 In some fashion the kernel of the thought of why these companies should come together never left either of us   Legere said in an interview   This time around I think the realization started with Marcelo and it was more 5G driven   
It remains far from certain however if Washington will green light the deal    the third time that Son has tried to bring the companies together  Previous negotiations broke down also because the two sides couldn t agree on control of the combined entity  people familiar with the matter said at the time  They d dashed a plan to merge as far back as 2014 after meeting resistance in Washington  Regulators said then that four major competitors in wireless fosters more choice  price competition and innovation    which proved to be largely true 
Sprint and T Mobile will try to convince regulators that new entrants such as Comcast mean more competition  not less  Claure told analysts on a conference call that Comcast was now adding more wireless users on a net basis than AT T and Verizon    combined  The two carriers will thus argue a combination will spur bigger investments in 5G and put pressure on larger rivals  even if the consumer benefits aren t immediately obvious 
 If Trump wants to see national 5G and the investment with it  then I think the administration can spin a story to support this   said Chris Lane  a Hong Kong based analyst at Sanford C  Bernstein 
For Sprint  which hasn t had a profitable year in more than a decade  the merger is a bailout  The company is four years into a go for broke turnaround effort launched when Claure took over and started slashing prices to stop customer losses  And growth at T Mobile    one of the more remarkable industry success stories of the past decade    is slowing 
 This deal is a great example of what we will see more of in the telecoms space  If you look at the capex that will be required as a result of 5G build out  you need to create more economies of scale   Steve Krouskos  Ernst   Young s Global Vice Chairman of Transaction Advisory Services  told Bloomberg Television   This particular deal will create a strong third player in the U S  market  ",2018-04-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tmobile-sprint-ceos-turn-from-bitter-rivals-to-kindred-spirits-1420709,1420709

While everyone continues to talk about the rollout of 5 G  the technology still appears to be somewhat down the road  Also  other fundamental drivers such as the acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo   NASDAQ AABA  do not seem to be major stock price movers for the company in the near term  And I m not sure they ever will be

215322,436838,VZ,Verizon Communications  VZ  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Verizon Communications  VZ  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  cellphone carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 17 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  32 19 billion  up 1 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 04  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verizon 
For Verizon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 02  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Verizon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Verizon would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of  2 75  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Verizon appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-communications-vz-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200407205,200407205

When looking at the last two reports  this largest U S  cellphone carrier has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 2 64   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Verizon came out with earnings of  1 12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 09 per share  representing a surprise of 2 75   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 19 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 22 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 52  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Verizon  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Verizon currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 17   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-verizon-vz-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200405994,200405994

215347,436863,VZ,Why Is Tegna  TGNA  Up 7 1  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Tegna  TGNA   Shares have added about 7 1  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Tegna due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Higher Political Ad   Subscription Revenues Aid TEGNA s Q4TEGNA reported fourth quarter 2018 non GAAP earnings of 74 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents  The figure surged 131  on a year over year basis owing to operating income growth and lower tax rates On a GAAP basis  revenues increased 31  year over year to  642 million  Top line growth was primarily driven by increase in political and subscription revenues  However  the figure came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  643 9 million Notably  GAAP revenues had a negative impact of  10 million in the reported quarter due to Premion refunds given in the previous quarters  Due to certain system issues  Premion s service was not fully delivered to a few end users  following which the company had to issue refunds TEGNA s adjusted revenues  which exclude political advertising  were up 5  year over year to  478 6 million Top Line in DetailAdvertising and marketing services  43 2  of total revenues   The category generated  277 1 million  down 6 5  on a year over year basis  The year over year decline was primarily due to significant demand for political advertising However  advertising and marketing services revenues increased in low  single digits after eliminating the effect of political revenue demand and Premion adjustment  Growth in advertising revenues from medical  retail  telecom  services and home was offset by packaged goods  automotive and restaurants  However  revenues from packaged goods  automotive and restaurants improved sequentially Subscription  34    This category generated  218 5 million in the reported quarter  up 22 4  from the year ago quarter  This was driven by growth in contract rate hike and higher paid subscribers of both multichannel video programming distributor  MVPD  and new virtual MVPD services  Moreover  increase in subscribers and revenues from OTT streaming services and increasing presence in larger markets boosted paid subscriber growth Further  TEGNA noted that in the reported quarter  it has negotiated higher rates in its new agreements Political  21 8    This category generated  139 9 million in fourth quarter 2018 compared with  9 9 million in fourth quarter 2017  The year over year growth was primarily driven by solid political advertising revenues  Notably  political ad revenues increased 51  from the previous mid term election in 2014 taking into account Premion adjustment of  5 million Other  1    TEGNA generated  6 8 million of revenues from this category  up 19 6  year over year Operating DetailsNon GAAP adjusted EBITDA surged 61 2  year over year to  273 1 million  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42 5   up 800 basis points  bps  year over year Non GAAP operating expenses  61  of total revenues  in the fourth quarter were  391 5 million  up 15  year over year primarily due to increased programming fees  primarily higher reverse compensation fees Excluding costs to generate revenues  Premion investments and higher programming fees operating expenses were up not more than 2   Notably  reimbursement of  2 4 million for Federal Communications Commission  FCC  spectrum repacking lowered operating expenses in the reported quarter Non GAAP operating income surged 66 4  year over year to  250 7 million  Operating margin expanded 830 bps from the year ago quarter to 39   primarily due to strong political revenues that aided the top line Balance Sheet   Cash FlowAs of Dec 31  2018  total cash was  135 9 million compared with  23 8 million as of Sep 30  2018   The increase was due to cash acquired to complete the acquisition of WTOL  a CBS affiliate in Toledo  OH  and KWES  a Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  owned NBC affiliate  in Midland Odessa  TX  from Gray Television on Jan 2  2019 Also  long term debt outstanding was  2 9 billion compared with  3 billion in the last reported quarter In the fourth quarter  TEGNA generated  194 5 million of cash from operations compared with  37 7 million in the prior year quarter Non GAAP free cash flow was  166 9 million compared with  24 7 million in the year ago period  Increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by record political and subscription revenues and lower tax payments made TEGNA noted that it was able to invest in new opportunities and initiatives and lower its debt burden owing to the record free cash flow generated in the reported quarter Recent UpdatesIn the first quarter fiscal 2019  TEGNA renewed a multi year affiliation deal with Disney owned ABC Entertainment till 2023  The deal covers all ABC affiliated stations that TEGNA owns and operates in nine markets nationwide Notably  the nine markets serve about 8 million households and cover nearly 7  of U S  users  Additionally  following the acquisition  TEGNA now covers one third of the United States TV households and about 87  of Texas population Moreover  in December 2018  the company extended its multi year carriage agreements with both Dish TV and Verizon  NYSE VZ   We believe that TEGNA s deal with its affiliates is expected to expand its content offerings and boost user engagement levels  thereby attracting advertising dollars Further  renewals in existing agreements and ongoing repricing of about 65  subscribers from fourth quarter 2018 to the end of 2019 are expected to boost its cash flow TEGNA is witnessing strong advertising spending for the 2020 U S  presidential elections  Therefore  the company expects strength from political ad revenues to continue in the upcoming quarters  which is a positive GuidanceFirst Quarter 2019TEGNA expects GAAP revenues to increase in the low single digit range  Non GAAP revenues  excluding Olympics and political  are anticipated grow in the mid to high single digit range  Total operating expenses are anticipated to increase in mid single digits 2019TEGNA expects subscription revenues to increase in mid teens on a year over year basis  Total capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of  70    75 million  Management expects about 5 to 6 of its stations to be

Zack Industry Rank  Zacks divides the market into 255 industries  then ranks them among each other in terms of the strongest earnings trends  Industries seeing lots of positive activity in earnings estimates will be near the top of the pack  Then  you can dig into each industry to find the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks which are leading the way One such strong stock in a strong industry is

Industry which ranks in the Bottom 28  of our Zacks Industry Rank The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  lies in the series of earnings estimate revisions to the downside recently

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Verizon shares have lost about 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 5  
What s Next for Verizon 
While Verizon has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

215410,436926,VZ,Verizon renews NBA deal as it seeks to be go to screen for sports,news,"By Jessica Toonkel
 Reuters     Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ  has renewed its deal with the National Basketball Association for two years  allowing users to live stream games on its Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  platform and mobile devices and access out of market live games 
Verizon will partner with the NBA to create original content as well as establish a technology innovation fund to experiment with new formats  such as virtual reality  executives at Verizon and the NBA told Reuters 
The new deal opens up Yahoo s pro basketball fantasy sports to Verizon users globally  The companies declined to comment on the terms of the agreement 
Verizon is seeking to make live sports a focus in the wake of last year s acquisition of Yahoo  said Brian Angiolet  global chief media and content officer at Verizon 
Live sports is valuable for advertisers because viewers are willing to pay for it and watch it for long periods of time in real time  There is increasing competition between broadcasters  tech companies and cable operators for live sports rights as it remains one of the few areas where viewers watch in real time 
Last month  Verizon paid around  2 25 billion for a five year partnership with the National Football League for non exclusive rights that include games on its Yahoo and Oath sites 
It has spent the past several months renewing deals for its FIOs TV service that enable it to also include more live sports and other league related content on its digital Oath and Yahoo platforms 
For example  Verizon recently signed TV distribution deals with Spanish language broadcaster Univision Communications and A E that include Mexican soccer league Liga MX and National Women s Soccer League games respectively on Yahoo 
 We want to be the first screen consumers go to find live sports   Angiolet said 
The NBA is looking to tap Verizon s data and technology to help it continue to reformat its game telecasts to appeal to younger fans  said Bill Koenig  NBA president  global content and media distribution 
Another attractive element for the NBA about the deal is the marriage of Verizon s data with fantasy sports presence  he said 
Yahoo has tens of millions of fantasy players and its users spend 30 billion minutes playing fantasy sports every year  according to Verizon 
 Fantasy is a good business on its own  but we think fantasy can be an important driver to becoming deeper fans and watching more telecasts   Koenig said ",2018-01-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/verizon-renews-nba-deal-as-it-seeks-to-be-goto-screen-for-sports-1115563,1115563

continuously evolving  companies in the sector are fighting it out to stay ahead of the curve A growing U S  economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  Wireless operators will thrive on 5G network in 2019 Strong Wireless MarketWith rapid growth in video and other bandwidth intensive applications  the wireless industry participants are making considerable investments in LTE  broadband and fiber in order to provide additional capacity and ramp up Internet and wireless networks  The LTE network has the highest penetration rate of 91  in the North American region The impending 5G boom is likely to propel the wireless industry to newer heights  The success of 5G technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support anticipated growth in data services Advantage of 5G Wireless NetworkThe United States is progressing well to lead the world in 5G   the next generation of wireless connectivity   which will enable faster speeds and low latency wireless broadband services  5G networks will be ten times faster than 4G networks  Although 5G network is not likely to replace existing 4G standards on large scale before 2020  several telecom behemoths are expected to launch 5G smartphones in this year Latency period of 5G data delivery will be in milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless network

215438,436954,VZ,Why Verizon  VZ  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ   This company  which is in the Zacks Wireless National industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this largest U S  cellphone carrier has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 3 89   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Verizon was expected to post earnings of  1 19 per share  but it reported  1 22 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 52   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 14 per share  while it actually produced  1 20 per share  a surprise of 5 26  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Verizon  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Verizon has an Earnings ESP of  0 87  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

215459,436975,VZ,Dial Up Verizon Stock For A High Yield And Low Volatility,opinion,"For investors getting nervous by the market s rising volatility in recent weeks  high yield dividend stocks might offer some shelter from the storms  Stocks with high dividend payouts provide a valuable offset against falling share prices  And  stocks that typically exhibit low volatility in their share price can be even more valuable for those investors with a low tolerance for risk 
One way to judge a stock s volatility is its Beta value  which compares how much a share price has historically fluctuated  in relation to how the broader S P 500 Index moves  Telecom giant Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  has a Beta value of 0 51  which makes it one of the 100 lowest Beta stocks in the S P 500 Index 
In addition  Verizon stock offers a hefty 4 3  dividend yield  more than double what the average stock in the S P 500 pays today  Its high dividend yield and low stock volatility make Verizon an attractive stock for risk averse income investors 
The Top Wireless Carrier
Verizon Communications is the largest telecommunications company in the United States based on market capitalization  It has a market capitalization of  231 billion  Its only competitor of similar size in the U S  is fellow telecom giant AT T Inc   NYSE T   Verizon s core business is Verizon Wireless  the largest wireless carrier in the country  The company s Wireless segment contributes approximately three quarters of its aggregate revenue and covers approximately 298 million people and 98  of the United States 
Until 2014  Verizon had only owned 55  of Verizon Wireless  But in February 2014  Verizon closed on its acquisition of the remaining 45  of the wireless business  which was held by European telecom giant Vodafone  LON VOD   Verizon paid Vodafone a hefty sum approximately  130 billion for the remainder of Verizon Wireless  This was a huge amount of money  which saddled Verizon with a significant amount of debt  At the time  Verizon s rationale was that it needed to make the deal because the future of the telecom industry was wireless service  It seems from Verizon s strong financial performance over the past several years  that management was right  Wireless service revenue growth has accelerated over the past year 

Source  Sell side Analyst Meeting  page 15
Verizon reported solid growth in the most recent quarter  Revenue grew 2 8  to  32 6 billion  which beat analyst estimates by  110 million  Earnings per share of  1 22 beat estimates by  0 03 and grew by more than 24  over the same period a year ago  Verizon s better than expected financial results were driven in large part by strong performance in its core Wireless segment  Subscriber additions  net of cancellations  were 295 000 last quarter  far ahead of the 161 000 expected  Wireless segment revenue increased by 6 5   which more than offset a decline of 3 8  in the Wireline segment  This was the sixth consecutive quarter in which Verizon had a customer churn rate of 0 8  or less 
Looking Toward The Future
Verizon has grown its earnings per share by approximately 5  per year over the last decade  thanks largely to the growth of the wireless business  There should be plenty of continued growth in wireless  as the smartphone boom shows no signs of ending  And  Verizon is on the cusp of some exciting new growth opportunities for the future 
Future growth will be driven by the continued strength of its Wireless segment as well as new initiatives such as the introduction of a 5G network  Verizon expects to unveil 5G service in the first half of 2019  Another growth catalyst for Verizon is the Internet of Things  or IoT  which will power connectivity outside of just smartphones and tablets  Verizon has made multiple acquisitions to boost its IoT business in recent years  including the  2 5 billion acquisition of Fleetmatics  and the  900 million acquisition of Telogis  Verizon s IoT business generated 12  revenue growth in the most recent quarter 
Plus  as the largest wireless carrier in the U S   5G is a major growth catalyst for Verizon  The company has initiated pilot programs in a handful of U S  cities  and is ramping up for a broader rollout in 2019  There is a huge opportunity for Verizon in 5G  The company stated in its 2017 annual report that 5G will allow 10 to 100 times better throughput  10 times longer battery life and 1 000 times larger data volumes than anything offered today  Verizon s  3 1 billion acquisition of Straight Path Communications gave it additional spectrum and a head start in 5G 
Dividends On Speed Dial
Verizon s long term growth potential is highly attractive  In the meantime  the company rewards shareholders with a compelling dividend  With an annualized dividend payout of  2 41 per share  Verizon stock has a dividend yield of 4 3   Importantly  Verizon s dividend is secure  thanks to its highly profitable business model and its satisfactory debt metrics 
Verizon is on pace for a payout ratio of approximately 54  in 2018  This is a modest dividend payout ratio which leaves plenty of room for dividend increases  Verizon has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years and is likely to continue to pay rising dividends for the foreseeable future  Adding to the security of the dividend is a manageable amount of debt on the balance sheet  Verizon consistently operates with an interest coverage ratio exceeding 5x and is on pace for approximately 5 5x of interest coverage for 2018  In addition  Verizon has a credit rating of BBB  from Standard   Poor s and Baa1 from Moody s  along with a stable outlook from all three major U S  credit ratings agencies  Maintaining investment grade credit ratings helps keep Verizon s cost of debt from becoming too burdensome 
Verizon is likely to generate earnings per share of approximately  4 35 in fiscal 2018  Using this estimate  the company is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 12 9 today  This is a reasonable stock valuation  Consider that the broader S P 500 Index has an average price to earnings ratio in the mid 20 s  Verizon traded at an average price to earnings ratio of 14 over the last decade  If the company s price to earnings ratio expands to its 10 year average over the next five years  this will increase Verizon s total returns by about 1 7  per year  The combination of 5  annual earnings growth  the 4 3  dividend yield  and 1 7  additional return through expansion of the price to earnings ratio  Verizon s total expected returns are 11  per year 
Final Thoughts
The telecom industry is normally associated with slow growth dividend stocks  While Verizon gives investors all the benefits of investing in telecom stocks specifically  a highly profitable business model and a high dividend yield it also offers growth potential as well  Through its investments in 5G and new technologies like the Internet of Things  Verizon is poised to continue growing earnings and dividends for many years  These qualities make Verizon an attractive stock pick for income investors

215460,436976,VZ,U S  Inflation Rebound Hasn t Been the Right Kind for This Fed,news," Bloomberg     This isn t the inflation rebound that Federal Reserve officials were looking for 
While inflation moved closer to the U S  central bank s 2 percent target in September and October following months of lackluster results  its increase reflected gains in goods and services that aren t necessarily linked to monetary policy  according to new Fed research  That means policy makers could still have a hard time reaching their target  which has remained elusive throughout much of the economic recovery 
The Nov  27 study by San Francisco Fed researchers Tim Mahedy and Adam Shapiro broke down inflation into two categories  procyclical  which responds to changes in the unemployment rate  and acyclical  which does not  It s the first one that Fed officials care about  as the federal funds rate can have an impact  while the second is more immune to the state of the labor market and  as a result  central bank policy 
And unfortunately for policy makers  an acceleration in acyclical inflation over the last two months has masked further declines in procyclical inflation 
The Fed s preferred price gauge  which is based on personal consumption expenditures excluding those on food and energy  picked up in September and October to 1 4 percent following declines in six of the seven previous months 
The procyclical inflation measure  which represents 42 percent of the goods and services in the core PCE index  finally rose to the 3 percent level consistent with previous expansions late last year  but has since fallen to 2 4 percent  Meanwhile  the acyclical measure  which represents 58 percent of the core PCE  bounced back to 0 8 percent in October from an almost two year low of 0 5 percent in August 
The rebound in acyclical inflation reflected the fading effects of  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   s decision earlier this year to change the way it prices cell phone plans  as well as accelerating airfare prices and motor vehicle maintenance and repair costs 
The procyclical measure has fallen in large part due to a deceleration in inflation for pharmaceuticals and housing  which includes rentals  Housing in particular should be a concern for the Fed because throughout much of the expansion it had responded more closely than other items to labor market tightening  The Fed s hand may be weakened further if rental inflation decouples from the unemployment rate 
Market interest rates have risen over the past three months on increased confidence among investors that the Fed will hike its benchmark overnight rate three times next year  as Jerome Powell takes over leadership of the central bank from Janet Yellen 
That confidence partly reflects the Fed s conviction that inflation will rebound to 2 percent as the labor market continues to strengthen and transitory effects that weighed prices down this year fade away 
Now  it s time for the data to play along  The proof will be in the procyclical pudding ",2017-12-04,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-inflation-rebound-hasnt-been-the-right-kind-for-this-fed-949963,949963

215473,436989,VZ,U S  Supreme Court weighs major digital privacy case,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Wednesday takes up a major test of privacy rights in the digital age as it weighs whether police must obtain warrants to get data on the past locations of criminal suspects using cellphone data from wireless providers  The justices at 10 a m   1500 GMT  are due to hear an appeal by a man named Timothy Carpenter convicted in a series of armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan with the help of past cellphone location data that linked him to the crime locations  His American Civil Liberties Union lawyers argue that without a court issued warrant such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U S  Constitution s Fourth Amendment  Law enforcement authorities routinely request and receive this information from wireless providers during criminal investigations as they try to link a suspect to a crime  Police helped establish that Carpenter was near the scene of the robberies of Radio Shack and T Mobile stores by securing from his cellphone carrier his past  cell site location information  tracking which cellphone towers had relayed his calls  The legal fight has raised questions about the degree to which companies protect their customers  privacy rights  The big four wireless carriers   Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   AT T Inc  NYSE T   T Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp  receive tens of thousands of these requests annually from law enforcement  Verizon was the only one of those four companies to tell the Supreme Court that it favors strong privacy protections for its customers  with the other three sitting on the sidelines  There is growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U S  law enforcement and intelligence agencies amid concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and authorities evading warrant requirements  The Supreme Court twice in recent years has ruled on major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology  both times ruling against law enforcement  In 2012  the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle  Two years later  the court said police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest  Carpenter s bid to suppress the evidence failed and he was convicted of six robbery counts  On appeal  the Cincinnati based 6th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his convictions  finding that no warrant was required for the cellphone data  The ACLU said in court papers that police need  probable cause   and therefore a warrant  in order to meet Fourth Amendment requirements  Based on a provision of a 1986 federal law called the Stored Communications Act  the Justice Department said probable cause is not needed to obtain customer records  Instead  it argues  prosecutors must show only that there are  reasonable grounds  for the records to be provided and that they are  relevant and material  to an investigation  President Donald Trump s administration said in court papers the government has a  compelling interest  in acquiring the data without a warrant because the information is particularly useful at the early stages of a criminal investigation  Civil liberties groups said the 1986 law did not anticipate the way mobile devices now contain a wealth of data on each user

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

215500,437016,VZ,Verizon  Safe Harbor During This Market Storm,opinion,"As a rule  dividend stocks that provide the best buy and hold opportunities are often boring  albeit dependable  businesses  Think of banks  insurance companies  telecoms and utilities 
Each month these companies take their fees out of customer bank accounts  but unless something goes wrong  customers rarely complain  This  cash cow  component of the business model makes shares of these companies perfect candidates for a retirement portfolio  one that s built to earn growing income in preparation for  and during  an investor s golden years 
Another reason to own these dividend paying stocks  no surprises each time you check your portfolio  They simply continue slowly adding wealth  boosting a retirement portfolio at regular  prescribed intervals 
Verizon  NYSE VZ   the US s largest wireless carrier  hits all these parameters perfectly  And right now  if you re looking for safety after the market s steep correction during the past two months particularly among high growth technology shares the timing looks opportune  In a challenging environment for the traditional telecom industry  where there s intense competition from disruptors  to survive  Verizon is doing many things right 
Slow And Steady Growth
Instead of bulking up its balance sheet with mega deals  Verizon has been focusing on improving its infrastructure  Indeed  the telecom has avoided the big entertainment acquisitions that peers like AT T  NYSE T  and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  have pursued 
Instead  the carrier has made smaller bets focused on enhancing its strategy to quickly improve its network  Due to its timely acquisition of Straight Path Communications earlier this year  Verizon is ahead in the race to build a fifth generation network  part of an industry wide effort to increase speeds and open up new revenue sources 
The acquisition was the culmination of an intense bidding war with AT T Verizon paid  3 1 billion for Straight Path  which holds very valuable licenses in the wireless spectrum  that can be used for delivery of faster 5G service 
This traditional  slow but steady approach isn t generating too many headlines for the carrier  However  it s clearly helping keep the growth momentum going 
In the third quarter  Verizon posted its sixth straight quarter of subscriber growth  During the period  Verizon added 515 000 subscribers  topping the 468 000 predicted  That helped push its earnings to  1 22 a share  3 cents above Wall Street estimates 
For income investors  the most important thing is to see how effective their investments are through the thick and thin of market activity  In the case of Verizon  over the past six months the stock has hugely outperformed  both versus the S P 500 and the company s closest rival  AT T 

For the period mentioned  Verizon shares are up about 23  versus a 3  decline for the benchmark index and 9  plunge in AT T stock 
Verizon also has a solid track record of rewarding investors with growing dividend payouts  Verizon hiked its quarterly dividend by 2 2  this year  bringing its payout to  0 6025 a share 
At the stock s current  59 16 price  that s a robust annual dividend yield of 4   Perhaps even better  this was the 12th consecutive year that Verizon s board approved a quarterly dividend increase  And with a payout ratio of 50 63   there s still plenty of room to run if the company decides to increase it s dividend yet again 
Bottom Line
Telecoms may not provide hefty capital gains such as those delivered by high flying  more volatile technology stocks  But the downside risk during times of distress is also limited  With its strong balance sheet  growing dividend  and leading position in the 5G rollout  Verizon is a solid and comparatively safe income choice for long term investors looking to shield their portfolios from ongoing market volatility ",2018-11-22,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-safe-harbor-during-this-market-storm-200361628,200361628

First and foremost  the greenback started the NY session under pressure with the sell off gaining momentum on the back of softer U S  data  According to Challenger Grey   Christmas  layoffs surged in October  although more than half of the 153 6  increase was due to Verizon s voluntary severance program  Manufacturing growth slowed with the ISM index dropping to 57 7 from 59 8  a consequence of the trade war  The dollar is also down because high risk currencies are up and part of this move is driven by the decline in Treasury yields and corresponding rise in Eurozone  UK and Australian rates  Another reason for the move is the third day of recovery in equities  which encourages gains in high beta currencies  Some investors got excited about President Trump s comments on China   he said in a tweet that he had a long and very good conversation with President Xi and plans to sit down with the Asian leader at the G20  Xi is also willing to meet with Trump but investors shouldn t let their hopes get carried away because shortly after Trump s tweet  Chief Economic Advisor Kudlow said if no deal is reached  the president will act aggressively 
5 Reasons Why USD Declined Thursday

Weaker U S  Data
U S  yields fall  causing yield spread to move against the dollar
Stocks rally for the third day in a row  boosting risk appetite
U S  China trade deal hopes
Profit taking ahead of Nonfarm Payrolls

Nonfarm payrolls are scheduled for release Friday and despite Thursday s decline in the dollar  the market is looking for strong jobs growth  Last month  we learned that due to hurricane disruptions  only 134k jobs were created in September  A snapback is expected in October with economists looking for nonfarm payrolls to rise by 200K  Although we also expect jobs to rebound  the risk is to the downside because of the increase in the 4 week average of jobless claims and the voluntary severance offer by Verizon  NYSE VZ   We don t anticipate improvements in the unemployment rate or average hourly earnings  So if either one of these reports miss  we could see Thursday s pullback in the dollar turn into a deeper correction  In the long run  we don t think the dollar has peaked but a correction is long overdue 
Here s a look at how the leading indicators for NFPs stack up this month  Bear in mind  the ISM non manufacturing report won t be released until after the report 
Arguments For Stronger Payrolls

Consumer Confidence index Hits 18 Year High
ADP Rises to 227K from 218K
Continuing claims Fall to 1 63M from 1 65M

Arguments For Weaker Payrolls

University of Michigan Reports Drop in Sentiment
Challenger Reports 153 6  Increase in Layoffs 
Employment Component of ISM Manufacturing Index Declines
4 Week Average Jobless Claims Increases to 213K from 209K

Meanwhile  the big focus Thursday was the Bank of England meeting  which combined with Brexit optimism sent sterling above 1 30  Thursday s 1 85  rally was the strongest one day gain for the pair this year  The BoE voted 9 0 to leave interest rates unchanged and lowered its growth forecasts for the year but instead of falling  sterling soared as the central bank talked rate hikes  According to the summary of the report  the MPC felt that  Were the economy to continue to develop broadly in line with the November Inflation Report projections  an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate   Governor Carney said a Brexit deal could release pent up investment demand but a no deal Brexit could also lead to a major supply shock that could drive up inflation and interest rates  While many are skeptical  the fact that he is thinking about rate hikes in a deal and no deal scenario underscores the BoE s hawkishness  As a result  bears covered their shorts allowing sterling to enjoy its strongest day since April 2017  Although 1 30 is a natural area of resistance  given the trending nature of GBP  we expect the rally to extend beyond 1 3050 quickly 
It was also a good day for other currencies such as EUR USD  which rose 0 9   AUD USD  which jumped 1 8  and NZD USD  which increased 2   The Canadian dollar traded higher but its 0 5  gains were modest in comparison  A stronger than expected Australian trade report helped AUD while NZD was supported by an uptick in job ads and house prices  At the end of the day  however   the only reason why these currencies experienced such strong gains is because of short covering   a force that could continue if Friday s U S  jobs report miss ",2018-11-01,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-reasons-for-the-dollars-decline--why-nfps-may-not-help-200353386,200353386

215522,437038,VZ,Chart Of The Day  Trading Any Surprises When Verizon Reports On Tuesday,opinion,"Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  is set to report Q3 2018 earnings on Tuesday  October 23  before market open  As popular Mad Money analyst Jim Cramer says  the major communications services company has  decent growth with good yield  
The company is expected to post EPS of  1 19  which would be a 21 43 percent jump from the same quarter last year  Revenue consensus for Verizon is  32 49 billion  up about 2 6 percent year over year 

Shares have been trading within a 4 percent range since mid August  That means that an earnings surprise might be followed by a violent move  should the price break out of its roughly  52  56 range  as stop losses are triggered  on a downside breakout  or a short squeeze occurs  with an upside penetration  
Readers should note that the range top coincides with the early February peak  thick black line   revealing that traders consider that price level significant  Will it be broken  Indicators suggest it will 
The price move that led to the range coincided with the moving averages executing a golden cross  when the 50 DMA  green  crossed over the 200 DMA  red   in an indication of superior performance by recent price data  Since then  the 50 DMA has been supporting prices  as the 100 DMA  blue  climbed to support the range bottom 
The RSI demonstrates that while the conception of the range was coupled with a falling momentum  it has since broken to the upside  in what may turn into a bottom line for momentum  should the RSI cross over the 58 mark  Should that happen  the MACD will provide a buying signal as well  when it s shorter MA  blue  overcomes its longer MA  red   projecting an outlook for continued rising prices  as reflected by the superior performance of shorter major moving averages relative to longer ones 
Trading Strategies 
Conservative traders should wait for a decisive upside breakout  following a minimum three percent penetration  to filter out a bull trap  A close above the  57 would be safer  Some investors employ a time filter as well  such as three days  Then  conservative traders would wait for a return move to retest the support of the range top  manifested with at least one long  green candle engulfing a preceding red or small candle of any color 
Moderate traders would wait for a minimum two percent penetration  followed by a return move  either to confirm the pattern s integrity or for a closer entry to minimize risk 
Aggressive traders may hazard a long position with a one percent filter  then wait for the return move  either for trend confirmation or an entry closer to support 
Very aggressive traders may enter a contrarian short position  relying on Friday s shooting star as confirmation of the range top resistance  Although a potentially risky trade  it provides a high risk reward ratio  especially if waiting for an entry closer to the shooting star s high price as bulls test that ceiling

215529,437045,VZ,Re Valuation Of Softbank And Its Son,opinion,"Valuation  updated 
You d think Softbank would be priced to reflect Son s premium  Instead  its stock currently trades at around a 50  discount to the fair value of its known assets  SoftBank has about 1 300 investments  many of them not consolidated on its financials  
The gap between what SoftBank is worth  its fair value  and its stock price has widened substantially over the last few years despite the stock s appreciation  Our fair value estimate of SoftBank shares is about  80 
Frustrated with SoftBank s valuation  Son has begun to make strategic moves to deleverage SoftBank  Last February  SoftBank announced it may take its Japanese telecom business public  SoftBank is expected to sell about 30  of its stake and should raise about  20 billion 
SoftBank owns a large chunck of Didi  the largest Chinese ride hailing company  a Chinese version of Uber  which in fact bought Uber s assets in China  Didi is a privately held company  Recently SoftBank announced that it is going to sell its shares of Didi to Vision Fund for  20 billion  Vision Fund is a  100 billion private equity like investment vehicle created by Son  SoftBank owns one third of Vision fund and has an even larger economic interest in it 
And then there is Sprint   SoftBank owns 82  of its publicly listed shares  After dating T Mobile for almost a year  Sprint and T Mobile finally decided to merge  There is a chance that the government might not approve this merger  but we think the probability of approval is high  The telecom industry requires scale  the cost of a network  cell towers  equipment  and spectrum  is mostly fixed  and profitability of a carrier is for the most part determined by the number of users 
T Mobile and Sprint are each half the size of giant incumbents Verizon and AT T  which achieved their size through dozens of acquisitions  The combination of Sprint and T Mobile would reduce competition in the short run  but in the long run it would create a strong and viable competitor and thus stable prices for consumers  T Mobile and  especially  Sprint on their own would eventually get marginalized into irrelevance by AT T and Verizon by the large cost of 5G rollout 
If the merger goes through it would improve the optics of SoftBank s balance sheet  SoftBank owns 82  of Sprint and thus has to consolidate Sprint s  30 billion of debt on its balance sheet  Despite SoftBank s control of Sprint  in the event of bankruptcy SoftBank is not liable for Sprint s debt  After the merger SoftBank will own around 27  of the combined entity and thus  magically  the debt of the new company will migrate from SoftBank s balance sheet to the balance sheet of Deutsche Telecom   the majority owner of T Mobile 
Between the sale of Didi  the Japanese telecom IPO  and the Sprint T Mobile merger  SoftBank should see its debt drop by about  70 billion  The current discount between the fair value of SoftBank s assets and its stock price is caused by the perception of enormous leverage  and as the leverage gets cured so will the perception 
Conclusion
There are many ways to look at SoftBank  You can think of it as buying a stock at a roughly 50  discount to the market value of its assets or as a way to buy Alibaba  NYSE BABA  at less than half its current price  Alibaba is a great play on the Chinese consumer who is spending more and more money shopping online  Alibaba is synonymous with Chinese online shopping  whose growth may accelerate with higher smartphone penetration and  just as important  the ongoing rollout of a fast wireless LTE network 
You can also look at SoftBank as a vehicle through which to invest in emerging markets   not just China but India as well  It is almost like hiring the combination of Buffett  Branson and Jobs to go to work for you investing in markets whose economies in a few decades will surpass that of the U S   while also investing in a segment of the economy   the internet   that is growing at a much faster rate than the overall economy  And  of course  you have Masayoshi Son  the Buffett Branson Jobs fusion  making these investments for you  With SoftBank at this valuation  you can ditch your emerging markets mutual fund 
Additional thoughts
Some additional thoughts  I don t expect every bet Masayoshi Son makes in Vision Fund to work out  Not at all  I look at Vision Fund as a portfolio of bets  For instance  his investment in WeWork and WeWork s valuation make me cringe  I am also concerned that he feels the need to spend  100 billion all at once  There will be a time when this money will buy a lot more than it does today 
I feel uneasy that the  100 billion will be like a pig going through the python of Silicon Valley  inflating the prices of technology companies  But a few things let me sleep well owning Softbank  First  Mr  Son owns 20  of the company   every dollar Softbank spends  20 cents are his  As Nassim Taleb would put it  Mr  Son has skin in the game  Second  the discount of Softbank stock to the fair value of its assets is so huge that it could absorb the blow up of Vision Fund  And finally  I remind myself that I d probably have had a similar feeling of uneasiness about Mr  Son s decisions at any time in his 30 plus year career  PCs in the  80s  Internet in the  90s  telecom Japan and internet in China in the  00s   And this is when I remember Einstein s quotes ",2018-07-10,Vitaliy Katsenelson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-would-you-get-if-you-crossed-warren-buffet-richard-branson-and-steve-jobs-200329999,200329999
215537,437053,VZ,CWA union to oppose Sprint  T Mobile deal over job losses,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The 700 000 member Communications Workers of America  CWA  union said on Tuesday it would oppose a deal to merge wireless carriers Sprint  N S  and T Mobile  arguing that such a move would cost tens of thousands of jobs in the United States  The companies are expected to announce an agreement in the first half of November to create a company that would have more than 130 million U S  subscribers  just behind  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T   The deal would have to be approved by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department s Antitrust Division   The union cited a 2016 study by Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson Research which showed that some 20 000 people could lose their jobs if a deal went through   Allowing Sprint and T Mobile to merge guarantees the loss of tens of thousands of U S  jobs that would result from store closures and the consolidation of administrative work   Shelton said    One of the FCC s responsibilities is to ensure that mergers and other corporate actions are in the public interest  The massive job loss that this merger would cause is not in the public interest   he said  The CWA also estimated that T Mobile has 10 000 people working in 17 U S  call centers whose jobs could move overseas if a deal is approved  union spokeswoman Candice Johnson said  The FCC may take job losses into consideration when reviewing a merger  Job losses are not considered in an antitrust review  Sprint declined to comment while T Mobile did not respond to a request for comment  The two companies had contemplated a merger in early 2014 but scrapped the idea after initial meetings with high level officials at the FCC and Justice Department  who had said it was unapproveable   Many of the staffers who were in the Justice Department s Antitrust Division in 2014 remain in place  and will be skeptical of the tie up this time  sources have told Reuters  But the final decision will be made by political appointees who have changed since President Donald Trump took office

215573,437089,VZ,T Mobile Is Getting A Deal On Sprint  But There s A Not So Good Reason,opinion,"Summary
The final price for this deal is slightly above Sprint s raw book value  assets liabilities  
T Mobile US Inc  NASDAQ TMUS  is getting Sprint for less than Sprint s enterprise value 
But Sprint is not exactly an unvarnished gem 
 This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community    
The big news today is that T Mobile    will buy Sprint Corp  NYSE S  for  26 5 billion   

T Mobile US Inc  and Sprint Corp  agreed to combine in a  26 5 billion merger  creating a wireless giant to compete against industry leaders AT T Inc  NYSE T   and Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  
Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   the Bonn  Germany based company that controls T Mobile  and SoftBank Group Corp  OTC SFTBY    the Tokyo based owner of Sprint  agreed to a combination that values each Sprint share at 0 10256 of a T Mobile share  the companies said in a statement Sunday  That ratio values Sprint at  6 62 a share based on T Mobile s Friday closing price of  64 52 

As I ll show below  T Mobile is getting a good deal  But that s because Sprint just isn t that great of a company 
What s Sprint really worth  Let s start with book value  assets   liabilities  This is the most basic valuation measurement available 

 data from Morningstar com  author s calculations 
All I ve done here is to subtract total assets from total liabilities  in blue   According to this measure  Sprint is worth  18 8 billion  which makes the  26 6 billion bid 141  higher than Sprint s 2017 book value  I ve added a second calculation  above in red   where I remove goodwill from the measure  Personally  I detest goodwill  If you ask 10 different accountants what a company s goodwill is  you will get 10 answers  Using that calculation  book value at the end of 2017 was  12 2 billion  which means T Mobile paid more than twice Sprint s book value  Regardless of which measurement you use  the total cost is at a premium  But  paying 1 5x 2x book value for one of the four major cell phone companies isn t really that pricey 
Next up  let s look at Sprint s market capitalization  According to Finviz com  Sprint has 3 71 billion shares outstanding  At  6 share that s  22 6 billion  Again  T Mobile is paying a premium  but not much above current market value 
Let s next look at   where we also include total debt and cash in the calculation  for the sake of simplicity  I m skipping the preferred and minority interest parts of the equation  just to keep this  back of the envelope  friendly   According to Sprint s latest balance sheet  they have  35 billion in debt and  8 3 billion in cash  Assuming Sprint s debt is trading at par  the company s enterprise value is  48 90 billion  22 26   35   8 3   Even if we assume that Sprint s debt is trading at 50 cents on the dollar  Sprint s enterprise value is  31 46 billion   22 26 17 5 8 3   This is a far more complete value measurement and shows that T Mobile is getting a pretty good deal 
But the final amount is low fora very a very important reason  Sprint has problems  I compared the four major wireless carriers a few months ago and 

Sprint has posted a net loss for each of the last three years  top row   While not encouraging  it s not the end of the analysis  plenty of companies have net losses yet still generate sufficient cash to fund operations  After adding and subtracting various items we find that for the last three years Sprint s operations have been cash flow positive  But after subtracting the company s two largest investments  network and leased devices   cash flow is once again negative  This means that financing has provided Sprint s new cash for the last three years  which has resulted in total long term debt increasing from 37  to 42  of total assets from 2016 2017  Interest payments as a percent of gross revenue are also increasing  totaling 5 94   6 78  and 7 48  in fiscal 2015  2016  and 2017  respectively 

Here s a chart of the basic problem Sprint is facing 

 Data from Morningstar com  author s calculation 
There are three categories of cash flow on the cash flow statement  The first is  cash from operations   This category shows how much actual cash  as in physical dollars  the company s operations generate over a twelve month period  The second category is  cash spent on investments   which shows the company s capital outlays  If the company is very profitable  it can self fund investment  which ultimately means it doesn t have to get third party financing to continue as a going concern  But if a company is cash poor  it needs third party cash on a regular basis  And that is Sprint s real problem  every year  they needed to either issue debt  issue equity  or get a loan to get cash  They chose debt 
In three of the last five years  Sprint issued an average of  5 4 billion dollars of debt  This situation is unsustainable  at some point  the debt burden becomes too high for the company 
This is the reason why Sprint would eventually be sold  And it also means that while T Mobile gets Sprint s customer base and network assets  they re also buying some problems

215574,437090,VZ,Sprint  T Mobile Merge To Form 100 Million Customer Network  Good Deal  ,opinion,"Following much speculation  and several aborted attempts  Sprint Corp  NYSE S  and T Mobile US Inc  NASDAQ TMUS  agreed to merge in a  26 billion deal 
The   which regulators still must approve  would leave the U S  wireless market dominated by three national players 

The all stock deal would combine Sprint  which has a market value of  26 billion  with T Mobile  which has a market value of  55 billion  based on Friday s closing prices  The two companies also have about  60 billion of combined net debt 
Under the terms of the deal  T Mobile will exchange 9 75 Sprint shares for each T Mobile share  T Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  will own 42  of the combined company and Sprint parent SoftBank Group will own 27   The remaining 31  will be held by the public 
Deutsche Telekom would also control voting rights over 69  of the new company and appoint nine of its 14 directors  The companies said they hope to close the deal in the first half of 2019 
Joining forces would create a wireless provider with nearly 100 million cellphone customers  second only in the U S  to Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ   The combined company  which would be called T Mobile  would be run by T Mobile CEO John Legere 
 This isn t a case of going from 4 to 3 wireless companies there are now at least 7 or 8 big competitors in this converging market   Mr  Legere said on Sunday  The companies also vowed to boost hiring and spending in the U S  after the transaction 
Sprint and T Mobile executives could make the case that times have changed  Investments in 5G infrastructure could blur the lines between cellphone provider  cable company and technology firm  Even using current technologies  Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA   has rolled out low cost wireless service to its cable customers that rides on Verizon s network 
Dish Network Corp    led by its chairman Charlie Ergen  meanwhile is building a bare bones wireless network that could be used to link autonomous cars  drones and other machines aside from cellphones  Companies could use that project to argue there are more than four nationwide wireless companies  though it would be a harder sell if Dish avoids directly competing with Sprint and T Mobile 

Capital Spending

The companies pledged Sunday to invest up to  40 billion on its network and business in the first three years after the deal closes  But the companies  which would employ about 200 000 people and own thousands of retail stores  will also be looking to cut costs  On Sunday  they projected savings totalling  6 billion in annual costs 
Rolling out 5G services will require heavy investment in cellular spectrum and installing hundreds of thousands of antennas around the country  which gave new impetus to Sprint and T Mobile executives to join forces 
AT T  NYSE T  said it will devote at least  23 billion to capital spending this year  excluding some investments in a new public safety network  Verizon said it plans to spend at least  17 billion on capital expenditures in 2018  Both budgets are well ahead of Sprint and T Mobile  which each spend under  10 billion a year on construction  electronics and the like 
Left alone  the spending gap will only widen as companies rush to install 5G equipment   You can t win a race by having half the horses   said Roger Entner  an analyst for telecom consultant Recon Analytics Inc 
Winning the race wouldn t come cheap  Consulting firm Accenture estimates that U S  telecom companies together could invest  275 billion over the next seven years to deploy the next generation wireless technology 

Wireless Employment
Capital spending will create jobs but employment at the companies will likely decline sharply  Retail stores will close  Operations  sales staffs  and technical support operations will merge 
Good Deal for Customers 
Is this a good deal for customers 
Of course  How can it not be 
Both T Mobile and Sprint customers will have increased coverage 
I wish all the networks could share towers such that coverage was universal  It seems ridiculous for each network to have to build their own towers  When appropriate  why not share 
Press Release
The  cites these benefits 

With Sprint s expansive 2 5 GHz spectrum  T Mobile s nationwide 600 MHz spectrum  and other combined assets  the New T Mobile plans to create the highest capacity mobile network in U S  history  Compared to T Mobile s network today  the combined company s network is expected to deliver 15x faster speeds on average nationwide by 2024  with many customers experiencing up to 100x faster speeds than early 4G 
Neither company standing alone can create a nationwide 5G network with the breadth and depth required to fuel the next wave of mobile Internet innovation in the U S  and answer competitive challenges from abroad 
Neither can AT T and Verizon in the near term  even though they will still respectively own 34  and 172  more spectrum than the combined company  Even with their vast resources  AT T and Verizon cannot rapidly build nationwide 5G and their planned 5G networks will only be available sporadically in just a handful of very limited areas  To build nationwide 5G  they either have to kick current customers off LTE  which would take years  or use a type of spectrum  millimeter wave  that can only carry a signal 2 000 feet from a cell site   versus multiple miles for other spectrum   making it nearly impossible for either of them to create a truly nationwide 5G network quickly 
Ubiquitous high speed 5G service and Internet of Things   IoT   capabilities will ignite innovation across industries and create the conditions for U S  firms and innovators to lead the globe in the 5G era 
 Going from 4G to 5G is like going from black and white to color TV   added Claure   It s a seismic shift   one that only the combined company can unlock nationwide to fuel the next wave of mobile innovation  
5G for All will unleash incredible benefits and capabilities for consumers and businesses  Imagine  for example  augmented reality heads up displays that see everything you do  and provide real time cloud driven information about the people and objects around you  Imagine never losing anything again because low cost sensors with decade long battery life are embedded in everything you own  Imagine an earpiece providing real time translation as a friend speaks to you in another language  Imagine environmental sensors in infrastructure and for agriculture having a profound impact on productivity 
Wireless  broadband  and video markets are rapidly converging  AT T is now the largest TV provider in the country  Comcast added more wireless phone customers last year than AT T and Verizon combined  and Charter is launching wireless this year  And  more than 1 in 10 Americans  12   use wireless as their only Internet or broadband connection  freeing themselves from the grip of the traditional  uncompetitive in home broadband providers 

Message to Regulators
That last paragraph above is clearly a message to regulators telling them not to fear going from four wireless providers to three while conveniently sniping at ATT s TV service  
Traveler Woes
As a traveler  I frequently find that my phone does not work  When I travel with my wife Liz  usually one of our phones work  I am on ATT and she is on Verizon 
Service in some national parks is nonexistent  I just returned from a trip to Arches and Canyonlands  There is essentially no cell service  Curiously  there was cell service at Delicate Arch  reachable by a 3 mile round trip hike that starts deep in the interior of the park  It s an uphill trek and the elevelation change must have put it in sight of tower 
When I last went to Death Valley  ATT worked in a few spots  but not Verizon  In Glacier National Park  nothing worked anywhere  It is a real pain ",2018-04-30,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sprint-tmobile-merge-to-form-100-million-customer-network-good-deal-200310647,200310647
215575,437091,VZ,Could There Be Another Winner In The T Mobile Sprint Deal ,opinion,"A Cellular Mega Merger
Cellular giants T Mobile    and Sprint    announced their intention to merge on Sunday in a deal that would create a new company  to remain named  T Mobile   with a combined customer base of 125 million customers  putting it in the league of AT T  NYSE T     with 141M subscribers and Verizon     with 150 million 
The deal is certain to face stiff regulatory scrutiny because it would reduce the number of large carriers from 4 to 3  potentially stifling competition   T Mobile CEO John Legere   who will lead the new company if the deal goes through   said in a conference call on Sunday and reiterated in several Television interviews on Monday that because of the scale of the combined enterprise  they could potentially offer improved service and lower prices  forcing the other big networks to compete on price 
Legere claims that the merger will create thousands of jobs   He also points to the larger company s ability to compete with Chinese competition in establishing 5G networks  an argument that s likely to be popular with the business friendly the Trump administration  The Federal Communications Commission and The Justice Department are likely to view the proposed deal with skepticism however  as the typical reasons for large mergers are a reduction in expenses and an increase in pricing power  contrary to how Legere portrays the deal 
Fifth Place to Fourth
If the deal is approved and completed  it seems likely that the three remaining major carriers would enjoy reduced competition and could potentially raise prices and or limit service offerings to increase profitability Another carrier could be an unlikely beneficiary of the merger   U S Cellular    
Currently the nation s fifth largest carrier with 5 million customers  U S  Cellular has considerably less network coverage that its larger competitors and relies on roaming agreements to provide coast to coast coverage  
Rising prices for cellular service could either allow U S Cellular to raise its own prices  or could also encourage disgruntled customers of the big carriers to seek out lower priced alternatives 
U S  Cellular has been on an earnings win streak of late  beating the Zacks Consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters and meeting expectations in the fourth  Analyst estimates going forward are rising  with expectations that they will report  0 29 share when they report tomorrow   up 123  from the  0 13 that was expected just 90 days ago 
Full year earnings estimates have risen as well  currently standing at  0 82 share  42  higher than the  0 58 share U S  Cellular posted in 2017   USM earns a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Getting Creative
While the big mergers tend to dominate press coverage when deals are announced  savvy investors look for smaller companies that stand to benefit as well   U S Cellular could certainly be one of those companies ",2018-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/could-there-be-another-winner-in-the-tmobilesprint-deal-200311067,200311067

215619,437135,VZ,Wireless Carrier Stocks Soar As Sprint   T Mobile Restart Merger Talks,opinion,"Shares of Sprint   NYSE S   soared more than 2  in Tuesday afternoon trading after reports emerged that the telecom company has restarted merger talks with T Mobile   NYSE T    The new rumors breathed some life into the rest of the wireless carrier industry  lifting shares of AT T   NYSE T   and Verizon   NYSE VZ   as well 
According to anonymous sources cited by   the latest round of negotiations between T Mobile and Sprint the third  and fourth largest mobile providers  respectively are still in preliminary stages   
The companies previously ended merger negotiations in November  with T Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom   NYSE T    Sprint majority owner SoftBank   NYSE T    and all other interested parties unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a deal 
But today s development is just latest twist in what has been an ongoing story ever since Softbank completed its acquisition of Sprint in 2013  Softbank s enigmatic CEO  Masayoshi Son  has been an outspoken proponent of the deal  but the two sides have thus far been met with regulatory headaches and differing expectations 
Sprint shares skyrocketed more than 20  to touch an intraday high of  6 41 shortly after the new reports emerged  T Mobile followed suit  gaining as much as 7  through early afternoon trading hours  At the same time  AT T popped about 2 6  and Verizon ticked roughly 4  higher 
A combined T Mobile Sprint would still fall behind both AT T and Verizon in number of wireless subscribers and total market cap  but the new company would likely create billions in cost synergies almost immediately 
Meanwhile  consolidation in the broader telecom and media space has become the norm over the past few years  and with the rollout of 5G networks set to begin over the next few years  the wireless carrier industry is on the cusp of what should be a transformational period 
One thing investors will want to keep an eye on is chatter about the leadership structure of a combined T Mobile Sprint  In the past  it was assumed that T Mobile CEO John Legere would be at the helm of the merged brand  but Son has also said that he wants a say in the direction of the company

215631,437147,VZ,Verizon Vs  AT T  Which Telecom Is A Better Buy Today ,opinion,"Investors on the hunt for higher dividend yields shouldn t ignore the U S  top telecom operators  Verizon  NYSE VZ  and AT T  NYSE T   The two players enjoy a dominant position in the U S  telecom market  Indeed  smaller players can t even get close to the volume of their subscribers and superiority of their networks 
With this duopoly type situation  however  it s difficult for investors to figure out which stock is a better buy right now  Let s examine both Verizon and AT T to figure out which telecom is in a superior position to provide growth for investors 
Share Price Performance

Verizon shares didn t do much during the past 12 months  remaining almost flat in the period when the S P 500 rose more than 14   The main reason of this underperformance was the intense competition in the crucial wireless market where Verizon struggled in 2017 
Through their aggressive marketing  AT T and T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS  snatched a significant number of customers from the biggest U S  wireless carrier  which had to then offer unlimited data plans in order to continue luring subscribers  But in its Q4 2017 earnings report  it appears Verizon has started to turn the corner 
Verizon added 1 2 million net new wireless customers  operating revenue rose 5  year over year and Internet of Things revenue soared 17   As well  sales at the company s media business  Oath  rose 10  
Verizon management is also estimating that the company s full year 2018 revenue will grow by low single digit percentages  which is better than the 1  analysts had been expecting 
AT T shares  on the other hand  performed poorly during the past 12 months when compared to Verizon  Its shares plunged 12  in the period as investors remained on the sidelines as the company struggles to overcome legal hurdles to acquiring Time Warner  NYSE TWX  in an  85 billion deal 

The Justice Department sued in November to try and stop AT T  which owns DirecTV  from buying movie and TV content creator Time Warner  arguing the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors as well as for consumers 
Future Growth Drivers
For long term income investors  what matters most while deciding between the two top dividend payers in this sector is which one has the best strategy for success in the fast changing world of technology  By this metric  both Verizon and AT T have made some strategic moves with the potential to unlock future growth 
Verizon bought Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  last year for  4 5 billion  in order to package its content with AOL to create a company called Oath 
AT T  on the other hand  wants to combine its telecommunications assets with Time Warner s media empire to bundle wireless with TV and internet for millions of customers 
Both telecom giants are also investing heavily in the game changing  next generation of wireless networks  known as 5G  to expand their wireless dominance  5G networks will enable new technologies and connect millions more everyday devices including smart appliances  wearables and cars 
I think Verizon is ahead in this race due to its acquisition of Straight Path  After an intense bidding war with AT T  Verizon recently  to buy Straight Path Communications for  3 1 billion  Straight Path holds very valuable licenses in the wireless spectrum that can be used for delivery of faster 5G service 
Which Is Better 
Both stocks have a solid track record of rewarding investors with the growing dividend payouts  With an annual dividend yield of 4 84   Verizon hiked its quarterly dividend by 2 2  last year to  0 59 a share  This was the 11th consecutive year that Verizon s Board approved a quarterly dividend increase 
At 5 4   AT T has a juicier dividend yield and a 34 year of history of consecutive payout hikes  Investors received a 2  increase in the quarterly dividend to  0 50 per share in December 
Assuming that AT T s Time Warner deal goes through  it will create a major spike in the company s net debt level  forecast to touch  182 billion  slightly more than triple the EBITDA of the combined companies  according to Bloomberg calculations  That will stretch AT T s balance sheet and may make it harder for the company to grow its dividend going forward  unless it finds a way to cut its debt load 
I think investors are better off ignoring AT T s attractive dividend yield at this point and should wait on the sidelines until there s a decision on the Time Warner merger  Buying Verizon  which has been much more aggressive in its 5G roll out and also has a better balance sheet is the less risky play for long term investors ",2018-03-08,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-vs-att-which-telecom-is-a-better-buy-today-200296512,200296512

215644,437160,VZ,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Verizon Communications  Telecom Argentina  Mobile TeleSystems  TIM Participacoes And Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 14  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    Telecom Argentina S A    NYSE TEO    Mobile TeleSystems OJSC   NYSE MBT    TIM Participacoes S A    NYSE TSU   and Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A S    NYSE TKC   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Buy These 5 Telcos to Cushion Against Market TurmoilAfter an exponential rise throughout 2017  the U S  stock markets have been witnessing turmoil in the last couple of weeks  There is widespread panic in Wall Street  with all the major indices officially entering the correction territory that has extinguished the nearly nine year bull run  As of now  there is no clear cut opinion about recent market volatility  whether this is only a healthy correction or the beginning of what could become a full fledged bear market  Whatever be the reason  investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently should rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability  At this juncture  we believe telecom stocks may become important instruments for portfolio stabilization Why Telecom Stocks The need to remain connected is a human need  An era of digitization and technology is essentially built on this human need  It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility  The need for telecommunications in both rural and urban areas as well as its role in the infrastructural development of an economy is of vital importance  Telecom is one of the few industries to have seen rapid technological improvement even during recession A growing economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment  This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers  particularly wireless equipment manufacturers Major PositivesSeveral positives emerged for the telecom industry since the last quarter of 2017  President Donald Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy  Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75  of all governmental regulations during his term as President  We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change On Dec 14  2017  in a landmark decision  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime  There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and deployment The telecom industry is highly capital intensive in nature  Therefore  the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible  intangible and real property  other than land  would significantly benefit telecom carriers  This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure  Major proposals such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years along with the above mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending   Upcoming 5G Wireless Network5G  Fifth generation  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In 2018  we expect 5G wireless network to be a game changer in the telecom space with a full fledged deployment in 2020  Per a report by research firm iGR  U S  telecom operators will spend around  104 billion between 2015 and 2025 to upgrade existing 4G networks to the upcoming 5G standards and thereafter  execute full installation of 5G wireless services We expect wireless networks to provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In this regard  Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space  According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation  IDC   worldwide spending on IoT will grow at 19 2  compound annual growth rate to nearly  1 7 trillion in 2020 from  698 6 billion in 2015 High Dividend YieldsOne of the easiest ways for any company to raise its shareholders  wealth is to hike dividend rate  Telecom companies offer one of the highest dividend yields in the U S  economy Typically  well established  profitable companies pay dividends  Investors seeking income producing  dividends  stocks are well served by growth and income oriented companies  i e   companies with stable earnings growth that pay a solid dividend Unlike other industries  U S  telecom operators generate revenues predominantly in the country  This makes these stocks less susceptible to volatility in the foreign exchange rate as well as macro economic fluctuations plaguing the rest of the world As the U S  economy is growing steadily supported by strong data of various macro indicators  many of these large companies are likely to generate massive cash but because of their size  may not have growth opportunities they once had  For that reason high dividend yielding companies will be attractive for investors Our PickAs a predominantly defensive industry  we believe telecom stocks will be beneficiaries when the market is in doldrums  Significant tax relief together with the strong underlying policy of ensuring that Americans have access to high speed mobile broadband in rural and urban areas alike  should help large telecom operators going forward  Substantial government expenditures  including those on U S  broadband infrastructure development program and similar structural subsidies in China and India  have been a boon to telecom service providers At this stage  we believe investors should choose stocks which promise strong near term growth  solid dividend yield and carry a favourable Zacks Rank  Taking into account these factors  we present five such stocks for investors to consider  Each of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can

Meanwhile  for Sprint  it worsened from 1 67  to 1 80   Importantly  for the national wireless carriers  average revenue per user  ARPU  has declined  This was primarily driven by adoption of unlimited data plans offering a lot of services free of cost Consolidated ChartWe have taken a consolidate chart of these four stocks for last three months to show how investor sentiments have changed from just before the announcement of earnings results to date  The chart shows that Verizon  AT T and T Mobile US have gained 11 9   7 1  and 2 2   respectively  while Sprint has lost 12 8  
Will the Momentum Continue in 2018 All four national wireless carriers have gained substantial subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2017  We believe this trend will continue in 2018 as the industry is moving toward a transition from 4G to 5G standard for which initial deployment will start this year 
Robust U S  macro economy and growth induced policies taken by the Trump administration are other positives  Moreover  wireless operators are quickly moving toward digital media platform offering online TV streaming services  resulting in innovative product differentiation on the part of wireless carriers Our View and Zacks RankAfter taking a closer look at the fourth quarter results  we can deduce that T Mobile US and Verizon have done reasonably well with respect to important financial and operating metrics  Although Sprint s subscriber metrics improved  it missed on revenues  Moreover  the company is still reeling under loss  Notably  AT T has also performed well after its lukewarm performance in the previous quarter Our view is also established while considering the Zacks Rank  Verizon and T Mobile US sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while AT T and Sprint carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Don t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year  giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more  Those gains  however  came with serious volatility and risk  Bitcoin sank 25  or more 3 times in 2017 Zacks  has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly ",2018-02-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-national-carriers-key-takeaways-from-q4-earnings-200290602,200290602

215674,437190,VZ,FCC Bids Adieu To Net Neutrality   Legal Battle Looms,opinion,"Yesterday  in a landmark decision  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime 
Ever since President Trump elected existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the chairman of the FCC in January 2017  the fate of Net Neutrality was at stake  Nevertheless  Net Neutrality supporters are preparing for legal battle  We expect this subject to remain a hot cake in the 2018 telecom space On Feb 26  2015  the FCC under the chairmanship of Tom Wheeler adopted Net Neutrality implying an open Internet atmosphere  which will prohibit ISPs  Internet Service Providers   especially the telecom and cable TV operators  from discriminating against applications  So far  these companies were allowed to restrict any device  application  service  or content from running on their respective networks Proponents of Net Neutrality argued that the law bans common ISP practices such as data traffic blocking  slowing any data traffic and paid prioritization  Content developers have to pay hefty sums to ISPs for accelerated data transfer  which they eventually transferred to end users  In this situation  implementation of Net Neutrality by FCC was a huge positive for several web based application and content developers  especially the start up companies and general consumers   Read   Opponents of Net Neutrality have argued that several billion dollars of investment for high speed broadband network which the ISP s spend will be significantly jeopardized if discriminatory pricing is disallowed and it would eventually result in loss of jobs for the economy   Read   Irrespective of the arguments of the two sides  some important socio economic policy related issues are also involved in the Net Neutrality controversy  We will now try to understand those Is Internet a Public Utility Under Title II The primary issue related to the Net Neutrality controversy is that can high speed broadband  Internet  be treated as a public utility like phone  electricity  gas  water etc  Telecom is a major infrastructure product  Can Internet be classified as an essential service for livelihood for which the bulk of the investment is coming from private sector Net Neutrality laws reclassified Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act  The reclassification is associated with strong control mechanism Importantly  these regulations were applicable to both mobile and fixed broadband networks  The reclassification of the Internet called for a radical change in the way the government treats high speed broadband service  This gives the FCC increased control over the ISPs Private Investment KeyIn the last 20 years  private sector has invested a mammoth  1 5 trillion to install communications network throughout the United States  A group of 63 smaller service providers  the majority of which serve rural areas  have given an estimate that they invest more than  70 billion every year on enhancing and expanding their networks  which raised rural broadband connectivity by a whopping 117  in the last 10 years This enormous expenditure took place primarily due to not so stringent rules implemented by the regulator  Due to this exponential deployment of telecom network  the web based applications and solutions developers are flourishing Per a recent study by USTelecom  investment in broadband infrastructure declined from its peak at  78 4 billion in 2014 to  77 9 billion in 2015 and  76 billion in 2016  According to USTelecom  the reclassification of broadband as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act has resulted into precipitous lower investment in broadband infrastructure Control Mechanism vs  Private InvestmentThe champions of Net Neutrality argued that strong regulatory measures are required to ensure free availability of Internet to everyone  If ISPs are allowed to practice paid prioritization  a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for fast and smooth transmission of their data traffic  then only a handful of large web based content and application developers will benefit This will have a negative impact on start up companies resulting in less innovation and competition  General consumers will also be affected since established content and application developers will ultimately raise their price to recoup the extra charge they pay to the ISPs On the other side  opponents of Net Neutrality argued that the basic rule of the neo classical economic theory is left to itself the market will be able to bring back equilibrium  The equilibrium is achieved when marginal utility equalizes marginal cost  If multi media application generates more demand than simple text message  users need to pay accordingly  Similarly  ISPs will reach equilibrium when marginal revenue equals marginal cost  If an application requires more bandwidth consumption  then the users should pay more for that Moreover  establishing Internet fast lanes become necessary in some critical scenarios  Remote healthcare applications and self driving cars will require high speed secured broadband connections with exceptional reliability In these situations  FCC s soft regulatory policies will enable ISPs to better serve the nation  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies Politics MattersLook at the voting pattern of the FCC when it adopted Net Neutrality and when it abandoned it  On both occasions  the result was 3 2  The Democrats were at the helm of FCC when the regulatory body adopted Net Natality  while Republicans are in power now  Ajit Pai strongly argued that a light touch regulatory measure generated higher investment in the overall telecom industry   Even when the former FCC under the chairmanship of Wheeler adopted Net Neutrality  Republican senators were not in favor of this directive  These groups believe that a slight law reformation under section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act will be enough to enforce Net Neutrality Trump himself is a strong critic of Net Neutrality  He has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75  of all governmental regulations during this term as the President  A new FCC headed by Pai  exercising lesser restrictions  certainly augurs well for the ISP industry The regulator s sole concern will be transparency of ISP practices  This will ensure that consumers can buy service plans best suited to them  Also both large and SMB  small and medium business  enterprises can avail instant technical information for product innovation  The Federal Trade Commission  FTC  will be in charge overseeing ISP practices for the protection of consumers  online privacy Who Will Gain as FCC Revokes Net Neutrality There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality  Leading ISPs including AT T Inc    NYSE T    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   and Charter Communications Inc    NYSE T   strongly criticised Net Neutrality rules  AT T carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   However  Verizon  Comcast and Charter have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Bottom LineThe primary viewpoint of Net Neutrality proponents is that choice of content should be left to the consumer  No discrimination should be allowed in treating contents  An open Internet should be the backbone for product innovation in a free market environment 
On the other hand  the opponents of Net Neutrality argue that a light touch regulatory measure will generate higher investment in the overall telecom industry  That will pave the way for web based service providers to flourish 
We are waiting for a legal solution to this controversy in 2018 Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big potential profits for early investors  Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now ",2017-12-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fcc-bids-adieu-to-net-neutrality--legal-battle-looms-200273739,200273739

215691,437207,VZ,U S  judge faults CFPB  indifference  toward Sprint settlement,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U S  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau s apparent  indifference  toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges  U S  District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut  Indiana  Kansas and Vermont to send  15 1 million remaining from the  50 million accord to two state based projects  saying the money should go to the U S  Treasury  The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB  whose September accord with  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal  was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements  at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency s power  Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund  50 million to customers subjected to the  cramming  of charges onto their wireless bills  following similar settlements by AT T Inc  NYSE T   T Mobile US Inc and  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ   But a plan to send the leftover  15 1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January  Pauley said the CFPB maintained a  conspicuous silence  on the proposal until May 10  when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short   gossamer  memo  modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition   Ultimately  Pauley sided with the CFPB  but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury s hands for six months  The CFPB s role as a public watchdog  extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole   Pauley wrote   Until this court issued its April 10 order  the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds   he added   It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians   The CFPB declined to comment  A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office  which handled legal filings in the case  was reviewing the decision  In court papers  Overland Park  Kansas based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley s decision  Pauley has criticized government agencies before  including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research

215693,437209,VZ,3 ETFs For 2017 Tax Loss Harvesting,opinion,"Tax loss harvesting is one of the more underutilized strategies for taxable investment accounts  This approach involves selling holdings at a loss in the current calendar year to offset capital gains and income  Furthermore  there is the opportunity to replace a mutual fund or ETF with a similar investment to maintain a like kind asset allocation  The net effect is to mitigate the impact of taxes in a particularly bountiful year 
The first step in this process is identifying holdings that are sitting at a loss and may be ripe for a transition  Your monthly brokerage statement or online portfolio view should allow you to easily spot these culprits  The following categories may be the most easily exploited tax loss harvesting opportunities for 2017 
Energy
Despite a second half rebound  the energy sector has been firmly mired in the red and many investors are still upside down in stocks or funds related to this group  The Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE  is down over  7  this year and is among the worst major market sectors within the S P 500 Index 
It s also worth noting that sub sectors of the energy space such as the VanEck Vectors Oil Services  NYSE OIH  and the ALPS Alerian MLP  NYSE AMLP  have experienced even deeper and prolonged losses over the last several years  These funds and their related holdings may be perfect candidates for tax loss sellers if they have weighed on an otherwise healthy portfolio 
Those who still believe in the potential value potential or rebound effects of the oil and gas sector may opt to simply rotate their exposure to a similar sector focused ETF  There is also the option of choosing a more diversified fund with an overweight position in energy such as the iShares Core High Dividend  NYSE HDV 
Telecommunications
Another struggling sector for 2017 has been telecommunications stocks  The Vanguard Telecommunication Services  NYSE VOX  has over  1 3 billion dedicated to a cadre of 27 large cap companies in this space  Top holdings include Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  and AT T Inc  NYSE T   which have both struggled to maintain relevance in a world dominated by high growth technology peers 
VOX has fallen nearly  10  this year and continues to demonstrate signs of a more determined down trend  This ETF and others like it are often found in income focused portfolios due to their above average yields and more conservative business attributes 
Volatility
If you have been stubbornly betting on a return of volatility this year  it s likely that you are sitting underwater on a few positions  The iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Exp 30 Jan 2019  NYSE VXX  and ProShares VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE VIXY  have both fallen nearly  70  through 2017 as the CBOE VIX Volatility Index has remained persistently low  These funds are generally the realm of short term traders  but have become increasingly utilized by more main stream investors for hedges in recent years despite their structural issues and above average costs 
Trimming some volatility funds prior to year end may allow you to off set a portion of your capital gains in other areas to enhance the tax efficiency of your investment accounts 
The Bottom Line
Tax loss harvesting doesn t have to be an all or nothing strategy  It may simply be an opportunity to re evaluate existing holdings to determine if they are still meeting your investment criteria and is most effective for those investors in the highest tax brackets  The application of this method may help alleviate a portion of your tax burden and create available cash to utilize in fresh opportunities 
Keep in mind that this process does not apply to traditional retirement accounts  which are not impacted by capital gains or losses

215694,437210,VZ,4 Big U S  Telecos In Focus After Senate Approves Tax Bill,opinion,"In the early hours of Dec 2  2017  Senate Republicans passed a  1 5 trillion tax overhaul package proposed by President Donald Trump in a 51 49 voting  The White House hopes that the bill becomes law by the end of the year  While the tax reform bill has resulted in a series of controversies among several economists and financial experts  we believe the U S  telecommunications industry is going to be a major beneficiary Growth Induced PolicesTrump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely  a significant cut in corporate taxes and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy   The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35  to 20  is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years  Large telecom operators book much of their revenues in the homeland  Therefore  a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow  Moreover  the tax proposal offers to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate Capital intensive Nature of Telecom IndustryThe telecom industry is highly capital intensive in nature  Therefore  the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible  intangible and real property  other than land  would significantly benefit telecom carriers  This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure 
Major proposals like a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending  This may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade  which in turn will fuel long term economic growth Effect on Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U S  wireless carriers  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment   In this context  Internet of Things  IoT  holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space  Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT  Lower taxes would also enable telecom operators to increase capex budgets to build and upgrade their networks in order to make it IoT ready 
According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation  IDC   worldwide spending on IoT is expected to grow at a 17  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  to nearly  1 3 trillion in 2019 from  698 6 billion in 2015 Easy Regulatory PoliciesPresident Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75  of all governmental regulations during this term as the President  We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change  A new Federal Communications Commission  FCC   headed by Ajit Pai  exercising lesser restrictions  certainly augurs well for the ISP  Internet Service Providers  industry On Apr 3  2017  Trump signed a repeal of the Obama era broadband privacy rules  This has given a major boost to the ISPs  The digital advertisement market is growing exponentially and ISPs have been increasingly investing resources to cash in on bountiful opportunities  However  the FCC s previous directive stipulated that the ISP should notify customers before sharing any user data for advertising  This would have marred ISP prospects More importantly  on Nov 21  Pai revealed a draft plan for a complete roll back of Net Neutrality  The FCC is set to vote on the proposed changes during its upcoming Dec  14 monthly meeting  There is little doubt that if the new FCC scraps Net Neutrality laws  the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new mergers and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies Stocks in FocusWe believe that the major beneficiaries of the U S  Tax Reforms bill will be the four large national telecom operators  Significant tax relief together with the strong underlying policy of ensuring that Americans have access to high speed mobile broadband in rural and urban areas alike  should help large telecom operators going forward 
Notably  all four national telecom operators currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    Headquartered in New York  the company is one of the largest communication technology companies offering all kinds of wireless and wireline services  For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share  EPS  is pegged at  3 88  reflecting year over year growth of 2 75    The consensus estimate for revenues is  127 31 billion  up 1 64  year over year AT T Inc    NYSE T    Headquartered in Dallas  TX  the company is also one of the largest communication technology companies offering all kinds of wireless and wireline services  For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at  2 96  reflecting year over year growth of 1 32   The consensus estimate for revenues is  160 59 billion  up 0 32  year over year T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T    Headquartered in Bellevue  WA  the company is a leading wireless service provider in the United States  For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at  2 69  reflecting year over year growth of 11 47   The consensus estimate for revenues is  43 09 billion  up 5 88  year over year Sprint Corp    NYSE S    Headquartered in Overland Park  KS  the company is a leading wireless and wireline service provider in the United States  For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss per share is pegged at  0 02  reflecting year over year improvement of 17 90   The consensus estimate for revenues is  32 98 billion  up 1 25  year over year Bottom LineTelecommunications is one of the few industries to have seen rapid technological improvement even during the recession  Owing to the significance of this service as an infrastructure product  we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in favor of the industry  At this stage  we believe that these four stocks are poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities of major tax relief

215695,437211,VZ,U S  Supreme Court to settle major cellphone privacy case,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    Police officers for the first time could be required to obtain warrants to get data on the past locations of criminal suspects based on cellphone use under a major case on privacy rights in the digital age taken up by the U S  Supreme Court on Monday  The justices agreed to hear an appeal by a man convicted in a series of armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan with the help of past cellphone location data who contends that without a warrant from a court such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U S  Constitution s Fourth Amendment  Cellphone location records are becoming increasingly important to police in criminal investigations  with authorities routinely requesting and receiving this information from wireless providers  Police helped establish that the man at the center of the case  Timothy Carpenter  was near the scene of the robberies at Radio Shack and T Mobile stores by securing past  cell site location information  from his cellphone carrier that tracked which local cellphone towers relayed his calls  The case reaches the high court amid growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U S  law enforcement and intelligence agencies amid concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and police evading warrant requirements  The legal fight has raised questions about how much companies protect the privacy rights of their customers  The big four wireless carriers   Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ   AT T Inc  N T   T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS  and Sprint Corp  N S   receive tens of thousands of requests a year from law enforcement for what is known as  cell site location information   or CSLI  The requests are routinely granted  The Supreme Court has twice in recent years ruled on major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology  on each occasion ruling against law enforcement  In 2012  the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle  Two years later  the court said police need a warrant to search a cellphone that is seized during an arrest  The information that law enforcement agencies can obtain from wireless carriers shows which local cellphone towers users connect to at the time they make calls  Police can use historical data to determine if a suspect was in the vicinity of a crime scene or real time data to track a suspect  Carpenter s bid to suppress the evidence failed and he was convicted of six robbery counts  On appeal  the Cincinnati  Ohio based 6th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his convictions  finding that no warrant was required for the cellphone information  Civil liberties lawyers have said that police need  probable cause   and therefore a warrant  in order to avoid constitutionally unreasonable searches   LONGSTANDING PROTECTIONS   Because cellphone location records can reveal countless private details of our lives  police should only be able to access them by getting a warrant based on probable cause   said Nathan Freed Wessler  a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberty Union s Speech  Privacy and Technology Project who represents Carpenter   The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that the longstanding protections of the Fourth Amendment apply with undiminished force to these kinds of sensitive digital records   Wessler added  But  based on a provision of a 1986 federal law called the Stored Communications Act  the government said it does not need probable cause to obtain customer records  Instead  the government said  prosecutors must show only that there are  reasonable grounds  for the records and that they are  relevant and material  to an investigation  The case will be heard and decided in the court s next term  which starts in October and ends in June 2018  The Trump administration said in court papers the government has a  compelling interest  for acquiring the records without a warrant because the information is particularly useful at the early stage of a criminal investigation   Society has a strong interest in both promptly apprehending criminals and exonerating innocent suspects as early as possible during an investigation   the administration said in a brief  David LaBahn  president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys  said warrants can be obtained quickly from judges but police may have problems getting the evidence needed to show probable cause   They may not be able to get over that legal hurdle  so the court couldn t issue the warrant   LaBahn said  Civil liberties groups assert that the 1986 law did not anticipate the way mobile devices now contain a wealth of data on each user   Steve Vladeck  a national security and constitutional law professor at the University of Texas  said the case will have  enormous implications  over how much data the government can obtain from phone companies and other technology firms about their customers without a warrant  
 Courts and commentators have tried to figure out exactly when individuals will have a continuing expectation of privacy even in data they ve voluntarily shared with a third party   Vladeck said   This case squarely raises that question  ",2017-06-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/supreme-court-agrees-to-decide-major-privacy-case-on-cellphone-data-491873,491873

215704,437220,VZ,FCC Plans To Repeal Net Neutrality  Who Gains ,opinion,Ever since President Donald Trump elected Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the chairman of the FCC  Federal Communications Commission  in January 2017  the fate of Net Neutrality has been at stake  Pai  a staunch Net Neutrality opponent  has always maintained his view that consumers would be worse under Net Neutrality and should expect their bills to go up along with slow broadband speed In May 2017  the FCC voted 2 1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules  On Nov 21  Pai revealed a draft plan for a complete roll back of Net Neutrality  The FCC is set to vote on the proposed changes at its next monthly meeting on Dec 14 Net Neutrality implies an open Internet atmosphere  The 2015 Net Neutrality laws reclassified Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act  This gives the FCC increased control over the ISPs  Internet Service Providers   Net Neutrality will prohibit ISPs from discriminating against applications  Earlier  these companies were allowed to restrict any device  application  service  or content from running on their respective networks   Read   Arguments Against Net NeutralityEven when the former FCC under the chairmanship of Tom Wheeler had adopted Net Neutrality  Republican senators were not in favor of this directive  These groups believe that a slight law reformation under section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act would be enough to enforce Net Neutrality All ISPs  along with several cable TV and telecommunications industry bodies have been vehemently opposing Net Neutrality  The major argument against the directive is that ISPs have to spend several billion dollars to install and upgrade high speed mobile fixed  mobile broadband network Further  disallowing discriminatory pricing policy will significantly reduce revenues and margins  which will result in lower investments in the high speed broadband sector  Consequently  broadband equipment service providers might suffer  due to lesser investment by ISPs  and loss of jobs is also a likely scenario Per a recent study by telecom industry body USTelecom  investment in broadband infrastructure declined from its peak at  78 4 billion in 2014 to  77 9 billion in 2015 and  76 billion in 2016  According to USTelecom  the reclassification of broadband as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act has resulted in precipitous lower investment in broadband infrastructure The Draft Proposals of Ajit PaiPer the new proposals drafted by the FCC chairman  the regulator s sole concern will be transparency of ISP practices  This will ensure that consumers can buy service plans best suited to them  Also both large and SMB  small and medium business  enterprises can avail instant technical information for product innovation  The draft proposes the return of the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  in charge overseeing ISP practices for the protection of consumers  online privacy Pai strongly argued that a light touch regulatory measure generated higher investment in the overall telecom industry  For example  establishment of Internet fast lanes become necessary for some critical scenarios  Remote healthcare applications and self driving cars will require high speed secured broadband connections with exceptional reliability  In these situations  FCC s soft regulatory policies will enable ISPs to better serve the country Pai further stated that in the last 20 years  private sector has invested a mammoth  1 5 trillion to install communications network throughout the country  This enormous expenditure happened primarily due to not so stringent rules implemented by the regulator According to Pai   Internet is inherently an interstate service   Therefore  the new proposals will prevent state and local governments from creating their own Net Neutrality rules  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new mergers and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies Who Will Benefit if FCC Revokes Net Neutrality Trump himself is a strong critic of Net Neutrality  There is little doubt that if the new FCC scraps Net Neutrality laws  the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary  Leading ISPs

215705,437221,VZ,Spectrum Deployment Gives Telecom More Room To Grow,opinion,"Wireless networks will be key to the future of the overall telecom industry  Given that wireless networks run on radio frequency  spectrums  airwaves  have become the most sought after commodity in the industry  Additionally  U S  telecom operators are increasingly implementing fiber network to install more small cells to help their wireless networks 
Upcoming 5G Wireless Technology 
Fifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U S  wireless carriers 
In this context  the Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential of becoming the  1 factor in driving growth in the space  Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT 
Presently  all the four major national wireless operators  namely  Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    VZ   AT T Inc  NYSE T    T   Sprint Corp   S  and T Mobile US Inc   TMUS  are conducting trial runs for 5G wireless standards  All four stock currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Massive Spectrum Deployment by Carriers
T Mobile US has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low band airwaves  In 2018  AT T will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project 
Furthermore  AT T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America s police  firefighters and emergency medical services  As part of the 25 year contract  FirstNet will provide AT T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration The company is expected to spend around  40 billion over the life of the contract to build  deploy  operate and maintain the network 
The market for U S  public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive  In August 2017  Verizon announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks  RANs  deployed by FirstNet  Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public safety network 
Additionally major U S  telecom operators are currently exploring ways to commercialize the usage of 3 5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum  Notably  the 3 5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard  thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally  
The FCC  Federal Communications Commission  at its next open meeting on Nov  16 will discuss on the proposal of making available 1 700 MHz of high frequency spectrum for flexible terrestrial wireless use and providing 4 GHz for core satellite use 
Growing Demand for Fiber Optic Network
Fiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure in order to meet the surging need for cloud based business data  along with more video streaming services by individuals  Moreover  fiber optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop  which are needed by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network 
Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G  Dark fiber based wireless backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management  This will eventually lead the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs 
Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells  The increase in adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas  
Verizon stated that small cells would be used to augment its existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or shopping mall  Small cells will increase voice capacity and data speeds as well as complement wireless service providers LTE infrastructure 
OpportunitiesThe telecommunications industry as a whole offers a number of positives that are difficult to disregard from the standpoint of investors          Rapid Technological Advancement  Telecommunications is a vital industry witnessing rapid technological improvement even during recession  Unprecedented growth in high speed mobile Internet traffic  particularly with respect to wireless data and video  has transformed this industry into the most evolving  inventive and keenly contested space 
         Barrier to Entry  Lack of public airwaves  spectrum  in the telecommunications industry creates a high barrier to entry  The U S  telecom market is controlled by just four national players  as regional low cost operators are not eligible to compete with large carriers  Moreover  it is not easy for a new telecom carrier to establish itself in the market  as it requires government approval to transmit voice  data  and video on public airwaves  Spectrum licenses are limited and therefore quite expensive  Moreover  the deployment of network infrastructure requires significant capital expenditures  which only a few entities can afford  Thus  this barrier protects the profits of incumbents in the telecom space 
         Strong Demand  A recovering economy drives demand for real time voice  data and video manifold  This escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions  while upgrading plans  Moreover  the FCC projects 25   50 folds mobile data demand growth over the next five years

215707,437223,VZ,German cyber agency chides Yahoo for not helping hacking probe,news,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN  Reuters    Germany s federal cyber agency said on Thursday that  Yahoo Inc   O YHOO  had not cooperated with its investigation into a series of hacks that compromised more than one billion of the U S  company s email users between 2013 and 2016 
Yahoo s Dublin based Europe  Middle East and Africa unit  refused to give the BSI any information and referred all questions to the Irish Data Protection Commission  without  however  giving it the authority to provide information to the BSI   Germany s BSI computer security agency said 
A BSI spokesman said it decided to go public after Yahoo repeatedly failed to respond to efforts to look into the data breaches and garner lessons to prevent similar lapses  BSI also urged internationally active Internet service providers to work more closely with it when German customers were affected by cyber attacks and other computer security issues 
Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment  while Ireland s data protection agency was not immediately available 
The BSI s statement comes at a time of heightened German government concerns about Russian meddling in national elections in September  after cyber attacks on the French and U S  presidential elections which have been linked to Russia 
The U S  Justice Department in March charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts  marking the first time the U S  government had criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offences   while U S  officials have charged Russian intelligence agents with involvement in at least one of the hacks that affected Yahoo 
Moscow has denied any involvement in hacking 
The BSI said it did not yet have any concrete information about the data breaches because of Yahoo s lack of cooperation 
 Users should therefore be very careful about which services they want to use in the future and to whom they entrust their data   BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement 
The BSI chief reiterated his recommendation that German consumers consider switching to other email service providers  adding that certifications such as those offered with C5 class cloud service security were valuable for customers 
C5 is a German government scheme to encourage cloud based internet service providers to attest they use various safeguards against cyber attacks 
Late last year Yahoo  which has agreed to be acquired by U S  telecoms giant Verizon  N VZ  and is set to be merged with AOL to form a new business known as Oath  revealed a data breach dating back to 2013 of one billion user accounts 
The various disclosures led Verizon to cut the amount it was willing to pay for Yahoo by  350 million on its previously agreed  4 83 billion deal  Yahoo has said it expects the merger into Verizon to close in June 
BSI said an additional 32 million Yahoo users were affected by cyber breaches in 2015 and 2016  A spokesman for the agency said he was unaware of any additional breaches in 2017 ",2017-05-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/german-cyber-agency-chides-yahoo-for-not-helping-hacking-probe-483002,483002

Services Revenues
Except T Mobile US  the other three companies wireless services revenues declined year over year in the reported quarter  This was primarily due to the adoption of several unlimited data plans by Verizon  AT T and Sprint in order to counter T Mobile US  data plans  However  Verizon  AT T and T Mobile US  wireless service revenues improved sequentially  while Sprint failed to follow suit 
T Mobile US    Un Carrier   service  which was launched in March 2013 to offer a series of price concessions such as no annual service contract  equipment instalment facility  free international data roaming  helped the company gain a strong foothold  Offers such as unlimited data download and international roaming facility  coupled with no annual service contract  garnered significant market traction 
In the wireline front  Verizon s services revenues increased  However  services revenues decreased for both AT T and Sprint  Verizon stated that extensive deployment of fiber network is going to raise its wireline revenues in the future  We expect the same for AT T and Sprint 
Margins 
For the wireless segment  adjusted EBITDA margins improved on a year over year basis for both Verizon and Sprint impressively  For Verizon it increased from 44 9  to 46 2  and for Sprint it rose from 38 6  to a significant 48 9   For AT T  operating margin for domestic wireless operation also increased from 29 6  to 30 5   However  for T Mobile US  adjusted EBITDA declined a percentage point from 38  to 37  
Subscribers Addition
Although all the four telecom operators added postpaid wireless customers in the reported quarter  a closer look gives us a more interesting picture  Notably  postpaid customers are those who are billed monthly and considered more profitable to telecom operators 
Verizon added 603 000  up 36 4  year over year  retail postpaid customers and 139 000  up 67 5   retail prepaid customers  Importantly  the company added a net 30 000 postpaid phone customers in the reported quarter compared with a net loss of 107 000 postpaid accounts in the prior year quarter 
On the other hand  AT T s domestic mobile operation added a net 117 000  down 44 8   postpaid connections and 324 000  up 6 6   prepaid connections  Here it needs to be mentioned that in the reported quarter  AT T lost 251 000 satellite TV customers and 134 000 U verse TV customers  However  it gained 296 000 DIRECTV NOW connections 
Sprint added a net 168 000  down 51 1   postpaid subscribers and 95 000 prepaid customers compared with a loss of 449 000 prepaid customers in the prior year quarter  T Mobile US added a net 595 000  down 30 1  year over year  postpaid phone customers  222 000  up 88 1   postpaid mobile broadband customers and 226 000  down 67   prepaid customers 
Churn Rate and ARPU
Verizon and T Mobile US improved their postpaid churn rate  However  for AT T and Sprint  the postpaid churn rate worsened year over year  The postpaid churn rate improved from 1 04  to 0 97  for Verizon and 1 32  to 1 23  for T Mobile US  On the other hand  AT T s domestic postpaid churn increased marginally from 1 05  to 1 07  while for Sprint  it worsened from 1 52  to 1 72   Importantly  for the national wireless carriers  average revenue per user  ARPU  has declined  This was primarily due to adoption of unlimited data plans offering a lot of services free of cost 
Consolidated Chart
We have taken a consolidate chart of these four stocks for last 15 days to show how investors  sentiments have changed from just before the announcement of earnings results to date 

 
The chart shows that T Mobile US and Verizon have gained 2 5  and 2 1   respectively while Sprint and AT T have lost 1 8  and 4 8   respectively 
Our View and Zacks Rank 
The U S  telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition as success depends largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Challenges in the form of competitive product introduction and cut throat pricing pressure will persist in the telecom sector 
After taking a closer look at the third quarter results  we can deduce that T Mobile US and Verizon have done reasonably well with respect to important financial and operating metrics  Although Sprint s subscriber metrics improved  it missed on revenues  Moreover  the company is still reeling under loss  Further  a possible merger between Sprint and T Mobile US is rife  AT T  on its own part  is aggressively offering bundled services  However  it needs to set the stage right as so far  its bundled customer addition has failed to match the outflow of users from its legacy services 
Our view is also established while considering the Zacks Rank  Verizon  T Mobile US and Sprint carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see  
AT T carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

215730,437246,VZ,Chart Of The Day  Verizon Heading Toward Channel Bottom  Eyeing  40,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Verizon  NYSE VZ   the telecommunications and entertainment giant  is scheduled to report Q3 2017 earnings this coming Thursday before the market open 
Consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is  0 97 versus  1 01 EPS for the same quarter last year  on revenue of  33 06 billion revenue versus  34 13 billion for the same quarter last year 
The company s long term revenue base is in question and its margins are shrinking  Currently  revenues are predominantly derived from wireless equipment and especially services 
Consensus expects this quarter s decline to slow to  just  a negative 5 8 percent YoY  When this happens it may mean that the company is turning around  Or not 
Whatever the case  it also suggests that the concurrent decline in the company s stock price till now may also slow down 

The post 2008 crash was followed by an uptrend since October 2008  As we can see  that trend remains intact 
We also see that while the price in July eked out a higher peak than the previous peak in 2013  officially keeping the trend alive  a gain of less than 5 percent in 4 5 years while the S P 500 climbed 65 percent during that same period just doesn t cut it  and certainly doesn t provide any real reason to be confident of Verizon s continued uptrend 
Moreover  despite the aforementioned possibility of a slower decline in revenue  which might suggest a recovery is underway  the price of the stock actually entered a downtrend in the medium term  as can be seen visually via the falling channel  That spells out the balance of supply and demand  which may or may not include  informed money   people within a small circle who know more than the public 
Specifically  since mid June the short term rise was within the shape of a rising wedge  which holds bearish implications  signaling short term over eager sentiment among buyers  even while supply is drying out  Note that the apex of the wedge is pointing at the channel top  where supply overruns demand 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders should not trade against the primary trend  which is still up 
Moderate traders may take the risk of a short  after the price confirms the resistance of the channel top  or alternatively after a decisive close beneath the bearish rising wedge 
Aggressive traders may risk a long position  with a stop loss beneath yesterday s  47 71 low  and rejoin the medium trend with a short  as it nears the  50 level ",2017-10-17,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-verizon-eyeing-40-level-200219210,200219210

215744,437260,VZ,T Mobile And Sprint Shares Pop On Renewed Merger Chatter,opinion,"Shares of T Mobile   NYSE T   and Sprint   NYSE S   moved higher on Tuesday morning  this time on the back of a new report that the two wireless carriers are  in active talks  regarding a merger 
According to sources cited by   both companies and their respective parents  Deutsche Telekom   NYSE T   and Softbank   NYSE T    have engaged in  frequent conversations  related to a stock for stock merger that would see Deutsche Telekom emerge as the majority owner of the new wireless giant 
Nevertheless  CNBC s sources said that the companies are still  weeks away from finalizing a deal  and there is still a chance the merger could fall through  Apparently  the two sides have not yet agreed on an exchange ratio for the deal 
Still  the news was enough for investors to get excited about both stocks  T Mobile shares gained over 3  in early morning trading hours on Tuesday  while Sprint climbed nearly 8  
Today s rumors are the latest twist in what has been an ongoing story ever since Softbank completed its acquisition of Sprint in mid 2013  Softbank s enigmatic CEO  Masayoshi Son  has been an outspoken proponent of the deal  but the two sides have thus far been met with regulatory headaches and differing expectations 
In fact  the companies had advanced to the late stages of merger talks as far back as 2014  but the Obama administration quashed the deal  opting to maintain a four player mobile market 
For the third and fourth largest players in that market  however  consolidation seems like a reasonable goal  A combined T Mobile Sprint would still fall behind both AT T   NYSE T   and Verizon   NYSE VZ   in number of wireless subscribers  but the new company would create billions in cost synergies almost immediately 
What s more  M A activity in the broader telecom and media space continues to heat up  and with the rollout of 5G networks set to begin over the next few years  the wireless carrier industry is on the cusp of what should be a transformational period 
For now  investors will have to wait and see whether all parties involved can agree on an exchange ratio and the leadership structure of the new company  All accounts indicate that T Mobile CEO John Legere would be at the helm of the merged brand  but Son has also said that he wants a say in the direction of the company

215745,437261,VZ,AT T  T  Vs  Verizon  VZ   Which Wireless Stock Should You Buy ,opinion,"As news began to fly earlier this week surrounding the renewed possibility of a T Mobile   NYSE T   and Sprint   NYSE S   merger  other wireless companies and investors took note  A deal between two of the largest U S  wireless carriers has the potential to shake up the entire industry  
Though the deal is still  weeks away from being completed and is certainly not a lock  investors are likely waiting with great anticipation to see what comes of this possible mega merger 
AT T   NYSE T   and Verizon   NYSE VZ    the second and first largest carriers in the U S   might not be worried about a potential merger just yet  but investors are likely starting to consider the possible ramifications a stronger third competitor could have on both companies 
For now  let s take a look at the two biggest U S  wireless carriers and their fundamentals to help investors  who might soon have to weigh their options more heavily  decide which stock is the best investment right now 
AT T Inc   T 
AT T is the second largest wireless carrier in the U S   but its stock price has fluctuated greatly over the last year  Shares of AT T now rest almost  5 below their 52 week high of  43 03 per share 
In AT T s second quarter  the company beat Wall Street expectations  posting earnings of  0 79 per share and revenues of  39 84 billion  The company s revenues dipped slightly from last year  but the wireless carrier s earnings experienced growth  AT T is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  but it sports an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  as well as an overall VGM grade of  B  
What s more  many key figures support the stock s  A  grade for Value  The company s 3 05 PEG ratio matches the industry average  and its P B ratio of 1 86 also hovers right around the  Wireless National  industry norm  AT T stock is currently trading at 12 93x earnings  which is stellar compared to the overall market and looks even more favorable against the average of 35x earnings posted by its industry peers 
AT T s 16 42  cash flow growth also helps to show that the company is on a solid growth trajectory  especially compared to the industry s nearly double digit decline  However  the stock has slumped 5 27  over the past year  Furthermore  its sales numbers are projected to fall slightly this quarter and for the full year  based on our current consensus estimates 
Within the past 60 days  AT T has received mixed revisions for its current quarter earnings estimates  with six positive revisions and eight negative revisions  For AT T s full year estimates  there have been 15 upward revisions within the last 60 days  compared to four downward revisions 
However  AT T s earnings are expected to climb 2 28  this quarter and gain 4 08  for the year to hit  2 93 per share  AT T has only missed earnings expectations once in the last 11 quarters 
Verizon Communications Inc   VZ 
Verizon  the number one wireless provider in the U S   has shared a fate similar to its counterpart  The company matched earnings expectations in its second quarter after it posted earnings of  0 96 a share  and Verizon s sales of  30 55 billion beat quarterly revenue projections 
Still  much like AT T  its stock price has gone on a wild up and down ride over the last 52 weeks and has experienced a 7 57  drop since the start of the year  Shares of Verizon currently sit roughly  5 per share below their 52 week high of  54 83  However  VZ also has a  B  Value grade in our Style Scores system and is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Our current consensus estimates call for Verizon s sales to see slight gains this quarter and next quarter  but dip 1 58  for the year to hit  126 89 billion  Next year  Verizon s revenues are projected to gain 0 95   In terms of projected EPS growth  our consensus estimates call for the company s earnings to fall 3 19  this quarter and 1 88  for the full year 
Verizon stock is currently trading at 13 03x earnings  which is strong compared to the market as a whole  But the company s 3 72 PEG ratio and P B ratio of 7 52 are both above the industry average 
Verizon has received split positive and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter within the past 60 days  For the company s full year estimates  it has received 12 upward revisions along with six negative amendments 
Bottom Line
A looming merger between the third and fourth biggest U S  wireless carriers could pose a threat to both companies  but a more formidable opponent could also help spur one or both of these giants to innovate more quickly 
Both companies are currently Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  and it seems that  with their mixed earnings estimates revisions  the companies could stay in this position for the time being  Nevertheless  AT T and Verizon also both present strong value for investors 
However  AT T s recent track record of earnings beats is a bit stronger than Verizon s  which has failed to meet expectations in two of its last three quarters  On top of that  Verizon s negative cash flow growth could make it harder for the company to spend more money if a T Mobile and Sprint deal were to happen

215759,437275,VZ,Major Telecom Carriers Opt For Legacy Services Shutdown,opinion,Discontinuation of legacy voice services and Ethernet services has become a growing trend in the wireline segment of the telecommunication industry  The decision to terminate the services stems from lack of demand  Customers are migrating from these older services toward newer options and latest technologies  Given the low number of subscribers and high costs of support for these services  the shutdown of these services seems appropriate Meanwhile  telecom service providers are moving toward IP based networks as an increasing number of enterprise customers are opting for IP enabled cloud services Accordingly  to shut down any of its services  the respective company carrier has to seek permission from the U S  telecom regulator  Federal Communications Commission  FCC   clearly stating the reasons behind the closure of the service Let s have a look at the service discontinuations by different service providers U S  telecom behemoth  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is  seeking permission fromthe FCC to discontinue its four legacy interstate DS0 services in multiple New York wire centers  These four legacy interstate special access services include Voice Grade Service  WATS Access Line Service  Digital Data Service  DDS  and DIGIPATH Digital Service II On or after Dec 15  2017  subject to FCC approval  Verizon will stop accepting orders from new customers for these services  Existing subscribers will no longer be able to purchase additional circuits for these services on or after Jul 1  2018  The services are expected to get discontinued on or after Sep 2  2019 in specified New York wiring centers The company claims that these four legacy services have become outdated legacy voice grade and data transmission services  which are no more preferred by bunch consumers As an alternative product  Verizon is planning to offer fiber based voice services  Fios Internet  Switched Ethernet Service  Private Internet Protocol Service  DS1 services  machine to machine services and LTE Another U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc    NYSE T   has also  appealed to FCC  to shut down its legacy Ethernet services   GigaMAN and DecaMAN  citing weak interest and the migration of customers to its newer dedicated service lines AT T will discontinue offering GigaMAN and DecaMAN services in 11 states  including Arkansas  California  Illinois  Indiana  Kansas  Michigan  Missouri  Ohio  Oklahoma  Texas and Wisconsin  Beginning on or after Sep 30  2017  the company will no longer offer these services to both new customers as well as existing customers  The termination of the services is currently planned for Sep 30  2022 GigaMAN and DecaMAN is expected to be replaced with AT T Dedicated Ethernet  ADE  services  which include new protocols provisioned over fiber facilities Notably  during the second quarter of 2017  the service provider continued to see challenges in the business segment due to wireline pressure from legacy services and equipment sales  Business Solutions segment revenues were  17 1 billion  down 2 7  year over year due to continued declines in legacy services and fewer wireless equipment upgrades  partially offset by growth in strategic business As for AT T  the telco has earlier requested the FCC for permission to discontinue a series of legacy services including collect calling  person to person calling  bill to third party  Busy Line Verification  Busy Line Interruption and International Directory Assistance in Jun 2016 In Dec 2016  AT T has sought permission from  FCC to shut down 13 legacy TDM  Time division multiplexing  services of its wholly owned subsidiary  Southwestern Bell Telephone Company  Southwestern Bell Telephone Company operates in Arkansas  Kansas  Missouri  Oklahoma  Texas and parts of Illinois Similar Service Termination IssuesIn January 2017  telecom service provider Cincinnati Bell Inc    NYSE CBB   unveiled its plans to discontinue offering Local Area Service  LAS  in the Butler  Falmouth  Glencoe  Warsaw and Williamstown exchanges within the Kentucky portion of the telco s operating area In November 2016  telecommunications and data service firm  Windstream Holdings Inc    NASDAQ WIN   announced plans to discontinue the DSL service it offers to SMBs  small and medium sized business  and residential customers in CLEC  competitive local exchange carrier  territories across 25 states  Currently  300 customers avail the service In June 2016  Level 3 Communications Inc    NYSE T   had sought permission from the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to discontinue its legacy voice services based on outdated TDM  time division multiplexing  technology  The service is expected to shut down effective Aug 25  2016 subject to the FCC s approval  All affected users will be shifted to high speed IP based network before the termination of the legacy voice system All the above mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of

215760,437276,VZ,Here s Why Investors Should Retain Crown Castle  CCI  Stock  Revised ,opinion,"On Aug 28  we issued an updated research report on Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI    a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States 
The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
On Jun 26  2017 Crown Castle finally completed the acquisition of privately held Wilcon Holdings LLC   With this buyout  Crown Castle will attain ownership rights of over 28 000 route miles of fiber  The company s ongoing effort to reposition itself as a fiber provider  focused on small cell opportunity  from being a tower company looks impressive  In the last few years  it has purchased three fiber operators   FPL FiberNet Holdings  LLC  in January 2017   Quanta Fiber  called Sunesys  in April 2015  and 24 7 Mid Atlantic Network  in September 2014  
The deployment of 5G network should also drive growth of the company s tower and small cell assets as the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks 
Crown Castle s extensive tower portfolio  increased demand for infrastructure  strong business outlook  healthy leasing activity  continued acquisition of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband have been major positives for its expansion prospects  Wireless services are gaining ground based on technological advancements and network upgrade 
Majority of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management  Crown Castle capitalizes on this opportunity as over 90  of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T   and T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   
The company has acquired 9 700 wireless towers from AT T and taken over 7 200 wireless towers of T Mobile US 
Shares of Crown Castle have outperformed the industry s gain in the past three months  The stock has added 3 4  outshining the  gain of 0 2  

However  the company s continuous operation in a consolidated wireless industry has reduced demand for cell tower deployment and consequently is expected to dent the top line considerably  New technologies have reduced demand for site leases

215786,437302,VZ,What Like Ahead For Telecom ETFs ,opinion,"The U S  telecommunications industry is currently balanced with almost equal proportions of positive and negative influences  This year  we expect this industry to witness growth more or less in line with the broader market 
 
Positive Factors
 
At present  the U S  telecom industry enjoys several positive attributes  First  the new telecom regulatory body   Federal Communications Commission  FCC    has given enough indications that it will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration and is likely to roll back several regulations of the previous regime  Second  the less restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions which are likely to spur growth in 2017  Third  President Trump has decided to improve broadband availability in rural areas  Rural broadband development will be an element of his ambitious  1 trillion infrastructure plan he will submit to the Congress soon   Read   
 
Negative Factors
 
However  several near term headwinds prevail in the telecom industry  The chief ones include growing price competition for wireless services that are likely to reduce carriers  revenue growth in 2017  Leading cable MSOs  multi service operators  have decided to enter the wireless field this year  which is likely to intensify competition in an already saturated market  Further  capital spending by U S  telecom carriers may be muted in 2017  4G LTE wireless penetration is currently 83  in North America  This can primarily be attributed to most carriers  intention to upgrade to the 5G wireless network standard which requires massive investment  However  a full phased 5G network deployment is unlikely before 2020 
 
Internet of Things  IoT   The Next Growth Driver
 
IoT  which enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network  is fast gaining market traction and bringing about fundamental changes in business models  Next generation superfast wireless networks  4G LTE  LTE A  upcoming 5G  will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In this context  IoT holds the potential to be the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space  Superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT   Read   
 
Unlimited Data Plan War
 
Wireless consumers pay millions extra in the form of added surcharges  taxes  monthly fees and carrier price hikes every year  The practice seems to have peaked and carriers are still looking for ways to fetch more from their customers  Several consumer groups have criticized extra fees because these are easily overlooked and lead to higher than advertised price payments  The U S  telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition as success depends largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability   Read

215806,437322,VZ,Straight Path settles with FCC over licenses,news,"By Liana B  Baker
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters     Straight Path Communications Inc   A STRP   a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum  said it has settled with the U S  Federal Communications Commission  resolving an investigation into the company 
As part of the settlement  Straight Path will pay  15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses  the company said in a statement on Thursday 
The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path s former parent company  IDT Corp   N IDT  and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller 
Straight Path s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology  Wireless providers such as AT T Inc  N T  and  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks 
In July 2016  the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands  a major part of Straight Path s spectrum holdings  to be used in mobile communications 
Straight Path is also hiring investment bank  Evercore Partners Inc   N EVR  to help the company explore strategic alternatives 
As part of the consent decree  if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months  it will have to pay the FCC  85 million or return its licenses 
 We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC  which allows us to move forward   Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement 
The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company  whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from  50 to less than  8  Besides the anonymous shortseller  it had also been targeted by New York based Kerrisdale  a  400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly 
Shares in Straight Path closed 5 6 percent lower at  31 41 per share on Wednesday ",2017-01-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/straight-path-settles-with-fcc-over-licenses-452706,452706

Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  has formed a falling wedge to its light blue rising megaphone bottom  It s tagging the bottom of that falling wedge today 
The move down can t end on an exact tag of that wedge bottom  So VZ could pierce the wedge bottom a bit or form a megaphone bottom from here to tag the bottom of the light blue rising megaphone and then take off upwards past the July 2016 high 
Or VZ could break out the bottom of the falling wedge and through the bottom of the blue rising megaphone back to the red megaphone VWAP and reverse there for a trip back to the all time high 
Neely Long Term Set Up Targets at Least the All Time High
VZ has a Neely long term set up on the chart for a trip back to at least the all time high  The set up is the crash into the 2002 low  partial retrace of the crash with extended topping  then retest of the 2002 crash low  After that retest you d expect to see a return to the all time high and the price could go well beyond that 
If VZ retests the red megaphone VWAP  we ll likely just be redrawing the blue rising megaphone  If VZ turns at or above the blue rising megaphone bottom  it will be putting in a rising megaphone extension within it  Either way  VZ should be setting off soon on a major move up

215821,437337,VZ,Yahoo under scrutiny after latest hack  Verizon seeks new deal terms,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK  Reuters     Yahoo Inc   O YHOO  came under renewed scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers on Thursday after disclosing the largest known data breach in history  prompting  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  to demand better terms for its planned purchase of Yahoo s internet business  Shares of the Sunnyvale  California based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday  following another large hack reported in September  Verizon  which agreed to buy Yahoo s core internet business in July for  4 8 billion  is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks  according to people familiar with the matter  The U S  No  1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal  but is looking for  major concessions  in light of the most recent breach  according to another person familiar with the situation  Asked about the status of the deal  a Yahoo spokesperson said   We are confident in Yahoo s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon   Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September s breach disclosure  Late on Wednesday  it said it would  review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions  about whether to proceed   The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday   Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced  citing a material adverse effect  said the people familiar with the matter  who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential  No court in Delaware  where Yahoo is incorporated  has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement   Nevertheless  the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals  and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely  given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches  Renegotiating the deal s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time  according to Erik Gordon  a professor at the University of Michigan s Ross School of Business   A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal  based on the liabilities that occur  The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches  Gordon suggested  Verizon shares rose 0 4 percent to close at  51 81  in line with the S P 500 Index  SPX   Yahoo closed down 6 1 percent at  38 41   BIGGEST BREACH  Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts  the largest known breach on record   It said the data stolen may have included names  email addresses  telephone numbers  dates of birth  hashed passwords and  in some cases  encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers  The company added that some of its partners were affected  One such partner  Europe s Sky Plc  L SKYB   said Yahoo provides email services to its 2 1 million Sky com email account holders  but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected   The announcement followed Yahoo s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts  which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers   The White House said on Thursday the U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach  Several lawsuits seeking class action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed  or are in the works  Meanwhile  Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo s cyber security practices   This most recent revelation warrants a separate follow up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users   he said in a statement  Warner  who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year  described the hacks as  deeply troubling    New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach s circumstances and the company s disclosures to law enforcement   Germany s cyber security authority  the Federal Office for Information Security  BSI   advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email  and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption technique in a statement  The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts  several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts   Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account  either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT T  NYSE T   get rid of it   Stu Sjouwerman  chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc  said in a broadly distributed email

Back in August  2016  while the stock price was slightly below  53  we published  Verizon   where the following chart was included 

Almost a year ago  the weekly price chart of Verizon stock allowed us to recognize a complete five wave  up from the bottom in 2008  According to the   a three wave correction in the other direction follows every impulse  In addition  there was a bearish RSI divergence between waves III and V  So  instead of joining the bulls near  53 a share  we thought investors should be careful  because the stock was on the verge of a significant pullback  probably down to the  area of wave IV  It is July  2017 now  and this is an updated chart of Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  

It is true that the plunge between  56 95 and  43 21 already has a three wave structure  which in theory means the 5 3 wave cycle is complete and the uptrend should be expected to resume  But it is also true that the current decline is quite small relative to the preceding impulse  Therefore  we believe one of the following scenarios is more likely 

The first alternative suggests that wave C of  II  is not over just yet and should extend further to the downside until reaching the mid  30s  The other equally probable count suggests that Verizon s correction could extend more in terms of time than in terms of price  as shown below 

If the market chooses this count  wave  II  could evolve into a more complex W X Y double zig zag correction from now on  Then  the recent three wave slump would turn out to be just the first phase   wave W   which should be followed by a three wave recovery in wave X and then another three wave decline in wave Y  To be honest  we like this count most  because it includes the time factor into the picture  Time will tell which one the market is going to pick  but chances are Verizon s troubles are not over yet ",2017-07-09,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon:-the-worst-djia-stock-of-2017-200199885,200199885

215838,437354,VZ,Verizon Crowned The Fastest Network In U S  In Latest Study,opinion,"According to a latest study conducted byPCMag com    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is the fastest high speed network operator among all other mobile networks in the U S 
PCMag com conducted a speed test among the four major carriers in 30 U S  cities with Samsung  KS 005930  Galaxy S8 phones that ran a customized version of Ookla s Speedtest net app  According to the test Verizon offers the most reliable and consistent high speed network overall 
Verizon topped the list with a total score of 97 points  whereas T Mobile US  Inc    NYSE T   and AT T Inc    NYSE T   scored 96 and 93 points  respectively  With 74 points  Sprint Corporation   NYSE S   finished last 
The result indicates the strong competition among the carriers to improve their individual network performance  Data speeds roughly double every two years  jumping from 50 60 Mbps in 2014 to 120 Mbps in 2016 and reaching 200 Mbps in the latest study by PCMag com  While Verizon has the fastest mobile network overall  T Mobile offers quite the same performance at a comparably less cost  Meanwhile  AT T has the fastest average download speed in the nation  However  Sprint has the most inconsistent performance 
Verizon to Deploy 5G Wireless Network
Wireless network standards are continuously evolving around the globe to offer faster speed  Following significant deployment of 4G LTE networks  LTE A  Long Term Evolution Advanced  wireless networks are gradually finding a solid foothold globally  LTE A network is a major step toward the smooth transition from 4G to the upcoming 5G network standard 
The wireless giant Verizon  which was the first to deploy the 4G LTE  Long Term Evolution  network nationwide  is initially testing equipment at 15GHz  28GHz  39GHz and 64GHz frequency bands for 5G network deployment   The company is considering mobile hotspot and home based fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the U S  in 2018  However  a full phased 5G wireless network will be offered only in 2020 
The company claims that its 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second   which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Furthermore  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless networks available these days  Therefore  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts 
The U S  telecom industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Thus  in order to stay ahead of competitors  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products  At this juncture  we believe that Verizon s drive for 5G wireless network bodes well for future growth 
Price Performance of Verizon 
Over the past three months  share price of Verizon declined 7 18  compared to the Zacks categorized U S    industry s loss of 6 39    The company currently holds Zacks Rank  4  sell   However  AT T  Sprint and T Mobile US are currently enjoying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold    You can see

215845,437361,VZ,Infrastructure Stocks 101  Key Factors Investors Need To Know,opinion,"One area of the investing landscape that is attracting plenty of attention these days is the world of infrastructure  Thanks in part to a decrepit infrastructure profile here in the United States and hopes for massive spending to correct the situation  many investors are trying to figure out which areas might be the best to play the possible trend  And even if we don t see a big concentrated burst of spending here in the U S   plenty will need to be doled out to keep things at the current level  while there is a general need for more infrastructure assets around the globe in the near future too 
To get some insight on this topic  I recently did a Q A session with Chris Huemmer  Vice President and Senior Investment Strategist for FlexShares  What follows are my questions and his answers on a number of key infrastructure investing topics  which should guide you through this industry  So  definitely check it out below if you want more information on this increasingly in focus area of the stock market world 
 
Eric Dutram   A lot of investors are focused on the infrastructure market these days thanks to hopes for a big Trump spending plan in this sector  Is that going to be as great for the space as many are imagining  And if it doesn t go through  does the investment case fall apart for the infrastructure stocks  
Chris Huemmer  The demand for infrastructure is a global phenomenon and investors should avoid too heavy a focus on domestic news and conjecture     spending on infrastructure projects increased globally over the last decade and many countries  including the U S   are trying to find ways to finance new projects and renovate existing assets 
One of the newest tools available to countries and municipalities are listed markets  which allow these entities to build  renovate and maintain infrastructure assets  Listed securities offer investors greater transparency and increased liquidity compared to other infrastructure alternatives 
 
Eric   And no matter what happens with Trump s plans  how do infrastructure stocks fit into a portfolio  Are they more of a lower risk high yield play or a growth opportunity for investors  
Chris  FlexShares is focused on firmly established infrastructure assets that offer investors an innovative asset class with potentially unique benefits  Generally speaking  since these assets are essential services that everyone needs  they tend to have inelastic demand and historically good performance in down markets 
In addition  infrastructure companies operate in fairly monopolistic environments often with highly regulated pricing structures  These conditions can create predictable expenditures and reliable cash flows that allow management to offer compelling yields with historically low equity correlations 
Finally  infrastructure is often considered a long term inflation hedge since regulated price increases are often tied to the consumer price index  CPI   or its local equivalent 
 
Eric   There are many types of infrastructure stocks  is there a particular area that investors need to focus on right now  
Chris  One of the best practices an investor should remember when allocating to infrastructure is to diversify their exposures as much as possible  We believe that broader exposure is better and opens up exciting investment areas like social infrastructure and communications  both typically not available in legacy indices 
By including social infrastructure  i e  government outsourcing such as health care facilities and post offices  and communications  areas such as cell towers  data centers and wireless companies that own their networks   investors can mitigate concentrated positions into segments like utilities and energy 
 
Eric   So  the FlexShares ETF in this market  the STOXX Global Broad Infrastructure Index Fund  NFRA   holds stocks from around the globe  Perhaps you can discuss why some investors might want this holding profile which includes significant exposure outside of the U S  
Chris  Spending on infrastructure is increasing on a global scale  so investors should consider how global holdings can help minimize the traditional risks associated with this asset class  Infrastructure securities often are location specific  capital intensive assets with long lifecycles  it is often difficult or impossible to move these assets  You cannot transport a power plant  toll road or airport  so they are susceptible to changes in the political and regulatory landscape in which they are based or unforeseen risks  such as natural disasters that can impair the asset 
The best way to counter these risks is to diversify the portfolio across different geographies  sub sectors and revenue types  This is one of the reasons we worked with STOXX to build not only a global index  but a broad representation of sub sectors in each infrastructure segment 
 
Eric  Let s also discuss why certain segments are included in the ETF  It seems heavy in energy  but also communication stocks too  The top three holdings include AT T  T   Verizon  VZ   and Comcast  CMCSA   Perhaps you can talk about how these sorts of equities fit in a broad infrastructure play  
Chris  People are often surprised to see certain telecommunication and cable companies categorized as infrastructure  They view these companies as their cell phone or cable provider that can be replaced easily  First  it is important to note that not every telecom or cable company would qualify to be included in STOXX s definition  What sets these companies apart is the amount of infrastructure assets each owns 
Take Verizon  for example  they have 500 000 miles of wirelines over six continents  200 teleports in 90 countries  another 200 datacenters and numerous satellites  They just announced a deal to purchase 12 4 million miles of fiber optic cable a year to further build out their internet capabilities  It is Verizon s ownership of these assets and importantly the revenue derived from them that qualifies the company as infrastructure 
This is a great example of what we value about STOXX s expertise in the index design  STOXX is able to use a bottoms up approach to identify the infrastructure assets owned by companies around the globe and tie those assets to revenue earned off of those assets  That methodology enables the index to separate wireless tower and data centers incorporated as REITs from others that are not infrastructure companies 
 
Eric   The fund also has a solid yield current SEC Yields come in at around 2 6    is this segment one that could be troubled by additional interest rate hikes in the near future  
Some areas of infrastructure can be sensitive to changes in interest rates  which is why we advocate for a broad representation of the asset class  This is another reason to pursue a global approach  Monetary policy has remained accommodative in many international markets so a global strategy will not be as affected as a domestic only approach

215846,437362,VZ,Why The Cuban Dream May Be Over For U S  Telecom Operators,opinion,"President Donald Trump recently announced that his administration will do away with many policies related to the communist state of Cuba  taken by his predecessor  Barak Obama  As a result  the previous regime s decision to normalize U S  diplomatic and economic relations with Cuba  which has been considerably strained since 1961  is under threat once again 
Under Obama s administration  new Cuban policy regulations  approved by the Treasury and Commerce departments  aided the U S  telecom industry to gain initial exemptions from the existing embargo to invest in Cuba  The newly developed truce between the two countries enabled these telecom operators to export equipment and services to Cuba  Moreover  they were permitted to establish the necessary infrastructure in the region for offering various telecom services  including the Internet 
Advantages to U S  Telecom Operators 
In Mar 2015  U S  based IDT Corp had formed a joint venture with Cuba s state run Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA  ETECSA  to provide direct international long distance service  In Sep 2015  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   became the first U S  telecom operator to offer roaming wireless services in Cuba  
Meanwhile  in Nov 2015  Sprint Corp    NYSE S   signed the first direct roaming wireless service agreement with ETECSA  Earlier  in Apr 2015  Sprint s prepaid service division   Boost Mobile   had launched an unlimited voice call and text message service plan between the U S  and Cuba 
In May 2016  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   had also signed an interconnection and roaming wireless service agreement with ETECSA  Notably  T Mobile US serves the maximum number of U S  customers who are of Cuban descent  Furthermore  starting from Oct 18  2016  U S  telecom giant  AT T Inc    NYSE T    has been offering direct roaming mobile interconnection services to Cuba 
All four stocks mentioned above currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Trump to Impose Business Restrictions
Trump is unlikely to reverse all the reforms taken by his predecessor  However  the current administration will go all the way out to limit commercial relations with the Cuban military s business and commerce wing  Grupo de Administraci n Empresarial  GAESA   This conglomerate is managed by the Cuban military and is benefiting from the opening in U S  Cuba relations 
It has been widely considered that the Cuban military could be the beneficiary of increased American private investment  According to Trump  the money is used for more repression and to crush the peaceful democratic movement resulting in large scale human rights violations   Even though the existing business deals have been spared  the U S  firms will face tougher restrictions to expand their businesses in Cuba in the future 
Our View
We believe that the U S  telecom operators may not reap any near term benefits from Cuban investments as the country is less developed at present and reels under highly restrictive government regulations  However  in the long term  Cuba may become a boon for those telecom carriers who choose to operate in the country  To sell products and services to 11 million untapped customers is a very lucrative and enticing opportunity 
Further  with the weakening of communism and its willingness to enter the economic as well as political mainstream  Cuba is poised to become an attractive emerging market in the future  Additionally  the country s geographical proximity to the U S  is a major positive for these telecom operators from the standpoint of cost of operations

215859,437375,VZ,Ericsson  ERIC  To Deploy Verizon s  VZ  Managed SD WAN,opinion,"U S  telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   has inked a managed services deal with Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   wherein the latter will be deploying Verizon s Managed Software Defined Wide Area Network  SD WAN  for its corporate IT  including virtualized security services and Managed Enterprise Radio Access Network  E RAN  solutions  This should help Ericsson in the transformation of its corporate IT environment toward a virtual services implementation 
As per the deal  Ericsson will utilize virtualized network functions  VNFs  as a utility in a pay as you go model  This model will be based on usage and will expand the global reach of the company s corporate IT infrastructure using Verizon s Global IP network for public and private networking solutions 
The use of Verizon s software defined services will help Ericsson in the automation of operations  maintenance of application performance and enabling on demand implementation of WAN policies  From an SD WAN perspective  Ericsson s technology helps Verizon in the proper management and organization of hybrid client networks in real time 
Verizon s Managed SD WAN and Managed E RAN solutions are part of the its network as a service  NaaS  offerings  The services offered are an outcome of Ericsson s Dynamic Orchestration  Closed loop service assurance and Automated Validation and Onboarding Platform 
Currently  Ericsson carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  while Verizon Communications is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  You can see  
What s a Software Defined Wide Area Network  SD WAN  
The software defined wide area network  SD WAN  is a specific application of software defined networking  SDN  technology applied to WAN connections  which are used to connect enterprise networks   including branch offices and data centers   over large geographic distances 
SD WAN has the advantage of removing potentially expensive routing hardware by provisioning connectivity and services via the cloud  The main goal of SD WAN technology is to deliver a business class  secure  and simple cloud enabled WAN connection with as much open and software based technology as possible 
A key application of an SD WAN is to allow companies to build higher performance WANs using lower cost internet access  enabling businesses to partially or wholly replace more expensive private WAN connection technologies such as MPLS  Multiprotocol Label Switching  
Bottom Line
Ericsson is a long standing and major vendor partner for Verizon Communications  Apart from focusing on 5G wireless network field trials and Internet of Things  IoT  associations  the two companies are working together to uplift Verizon s Network and Technology division 
Meanwhile  where the SD WAN industry is expected to witness a rapid growth of around 200  in the next 12 months  we believe the idea of highlighting Ericsson as one of its SD WAN customers marks a strategic move on Verizon s part in increasing its enterprise customer base 
To deliver SD WAN  Verizon also uses software from Viptela and Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Verizon Communications claims to have over 90 active SD WAN implementations and 16 full scale deployments  It also has 30 participants taking part in a universal CPE program trial 
Two other major wireless carriers  Sprint Corp    NYSE S   and AT T Inc    NYSE T   also launched their software defined wide area network  SD WAN  services 
Price Performance 
Over the past three months  share price of Verizon declined 7 26  compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s fall of 5 22  

Meanwhile  share price of Ericsson moved up 14 18  outshining the Zacks categorized  industry s 8 64  growth in the same time frame

Frontier s speculative grade liquidity  SGL  remains unaffected at SGL 2  The negative outlook for the company assigned by Moody s also remains unchanged 
Frontier Communications continues to be significantly challenged by slow economic recovery in its service territories and competes with the loss of legacy fixed telephony business to wireless and other offerings  The persistent decline in access lines continues to tighten local service revenues  which accounts for most of Frontier Communications  overall revenues 
Management expects to continue experiencing declines in wireless backhaul revenues in 2017  This is because a number of its carrier partners might migrate to Ethernet solutions at lower price points  while some customers may switch to competitors  Thus  deteriorating wireless backhaul business is expected to remain a headwind for Frontier Communications  Also  the company is experiencing a decline in its residential voice segment  Management expects this downward trend to persist in the near future

215872,437388,VZ,Risks growing to telecom operators  defensive models  Citi says,news,"FRANKFURT  Reuters    Caught between regulators and competitive threats by Internet players  telecom operators globally face harsh choices that could upset their favored status with investors as defensive  dividend rich stocks  Citi said on Wednesday 
Citi research analysts say in a 146 page report that mobile and fixed line operators must choose between investing to become digital players to fend off Internet foes or streamlining their businesses and acting as  dumb pipes  for digital players 
The global  comparative survey finds dozens of promising examples of telecom network operators testing the waters to become digital players in their own right  but no successful examples of complete digital makeovers 
A major factor in telecoms  resistance to change is that most investors prize them for their stability and consistent dividends  while assigning little value and mostly big risks to the deal making and restructuring needed for digital makeovers 
 A majority of investors are still skeptical that such transformation with a fundamental industry impact would even happen   Citi analysts write   That said  a growing number of investors are already starting to see digitally driven structural changes as a possibility  
Among many issues raised  operators may be required to make investments on an  unprecedented scale  in next generation 5G wireless networks due around 2020  the authors warn 
The benefits of embracing new digital strategies beyond providing basic network access is that these tend to come with lower burdens from local or national regulators 
Concrete moves in this direction include Verizon s  N VZ  push to buy web properties like Yahoo  O YHOO   NTT DoCoMo  T 9437  and SingTel  SI STEL  investments in media  advertising and big data   Safaricom  s  NR SCOM  move into financial services and BT  L BT  ownership of football broadcast rights 
Still  Citi notes  the idea of telecoms expanding into adjacent industries is nothing new   A similar idea about telecoms expanding into Internet  advertising  e commerce etc  was in fact one of the drivers which fueled the 1990s stock market bubble in the sector  
The report is called  Re Birth of Telecoms into a New Digital Industry  and is available at 
Two years ago  a similarly hefty Citi report entitled  Re Birth Of Telecom Monopoly  anticipated the rebound of incumbent telecom operators as powerful national players  reversing years of deregulation and efforts to foster telecom competitors ",2016-10-04,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/risks-growing-to-telecom-operators'-defensive-models,-citi-says-430330",430330

215880,437396,VZ,Frontier Communications Risk Reward  Bonds Vs Stock Vs Options,opinion,"To the chagrin of yield chasers  Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  finally cut its big dividend  Specifically  the dividend was reduced by 62  last week  it now sits at 13 2    and the stock is now down 64  this year  For your consideration  this article reviews the potential risks and rewards of investing in Frontier s high yield bonds   10  YTM   big dividend stock  and leveraged options 

Overview
Frontier provides phone  Internet and data services to urban  suburban and rural communities in 29 states  The company has been struggling with customer attrition  challenging integration issues  they recently acquired assets from Verizon in California  Texas and Florida   and a significant amount of debt  Despite the significant price decline  the recent dividend cut is a strong signal from managements that they believe a more stable Frontier is around the corner 
The High Yield Bonds
As the following chart shows  AT T  NYSE T  has various magnitudes of high yield debt outstanding  some of which offers double digit yield  that will mature in the coming years 


And as the discounts and premiums to par in the following table indicate  the market has a high degree of confidence in the company s near term bonds  but not so much the longer term bonds 


For example  the outstanding 2018   2020 bonds all trade at a premium to par  and offer reasonable yields to maturity   indicating the bond market believes the chances of default are less likely than the longer dated bonds  On the other hand  the outstanding bonds that mature in 2021 and beyond trade at discounts to par  and offer significantly higher yields to maturity  an indication that the bond market has far less confidence in Frontier beyond 2020  Said differently  Frontier appears to have the financial wherewithal to stay afloat for a couple more years  but beyond that timeframe things are very uncertain 
Referring back to our earlier graph of debt maturities and magnitudes  Frontier should have no problem meeting its debt obligations in 2017  It has  341 million of cash and short term investments on its balance sheet  and only  325 million of 2017 debt maturities  much of which has already been paid off  
Next  we agree with the market s assessment that Frontier should be able to manage its 2018   2020 debts  remember  these trade above par  an indication of market confidence relative to the later dated bonds that trade at a discount   Specifically  despite Frontier s struggles  it has continued to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of positive free cash flow year after year  see chart below   and this will help pay the 2018   2020 debt maturities  Not to mention  the recent dividend cut frees up significantly more cash  hundreds of millions per year  to help support the debt payments 

Moving out to the large amounts of debt maturing in 2021   2022  things get more hairy  as indicated by the higher yields to maturity and significantly discounted prices versus par   However  Frontier has a few tricks up its sleeve to help cover these large outstanding debts 
For example  the company recently announced that it is willing and able to issue new secured debt in the second quarter  This will help pay down outstanding debt and reduce interest payments thereby freeing up more cash to support the 2021   2022 bonds  Additionally  there is an increasing likelihood that Frontier will go to the capital markets to raise more cash via a new equity offering  Such an offering would most likely not be good for existing shareholders  it would likely be dilutive   but it would be good for bondholders  it ll help the company pay its debts  
Further  management was optimistic on the recent earnings call that they d be able to stop the steady outflow of customers  the Verizon  NYSE VZ  integration is improving  and for some customers Frontier is simply the only option  
If we combine Frontier s free cash flow generation  the new debt offering  the reduced interest payments  the potential new equity offering  and the possibility of less  or even eliminating  customer attrition  the company likely does have the wherewithal to support the bonds at least through 2022  in our view 
The debt maturities in 2023 and 2024 are relatively small  however it s the huge maturities   4 5 billion  in 2025 that will create the most significant challenge  in our view  And as our earlier table shows  this is the debt  2025 and beyond  that trades at the most significant discount to par  However  for the most optimistic investors  there are reasons to believe that this debt  2025   is also  money good   For example  aside from getting earlier maturity debt under control thereby freeing up more cash to support the later maturity debt  and aside from management s optimistic view that they will turn things around  this debt could get support from the regulators government and or by another company acquiring Frontier and thereby assuming responsibility for the debt 
With regards to regulator government support  there is an interest in ensuring Frontier customers have access to data  phone and Internet  For example  the Connecting America program allows the government to turn up and down the funds provided to Frontier to support its business  In particular  from 2012 2014 Frontier received  133 million in  Connecting America  funds  they received  280 million in 2015  2015 annual report  p  9   and in 2016 they received  626 million in total subsidies  2016 Annual Report  p  30   In cases where Frontier is the only option  the government wants to make sure customers have access to phone  Internet and data 
And regarding an acquisition  if Frontier s stock price gets cheap enough  someone larger will acquire them  And this will be with the blessing  and perhaps financial support  of the regulators government because they want Frontier s customers to continue to have access to high speed connections  And if Frontier gets acquired  it ll be by someone with better financial wherewithal  at it ll cause the value of the bonds to increase significantly 
Overall  we agree with the market s assessment that the Frontier bonds maturing before 2021 have less risk  2021 2024 are higher risk  and 2025 and beyond are very highly uncertain  And we also agree with our own thesis about the bonds from late February   
The Stock
Frontier s common stock currently offers a 13 3  dividend yield and  to some extent  it trades like an option right now  Specifically  at a price of around  1 20 per share  the downside risk is limited to  1 20  if it goes to zero   However  if Frontier gets its business and finances in order  then the shares could easily triple in price and trade back up to the  3 60    3 75 range that it achieved earlier this year 
However  in our view  the stock is much riskier than the bonds  Besides being a lower priority in the capital structure  management could easily cut the dividend on the stock to zero if they need more cash to support the bonds  and this would torpedo the stock price   In fact  this type of action is often prudent given the higher priority of bonds than stock in the capital structure  In our view  the only reason management hasn t slashed the dividend to zero is because they still want to keep the stock price as high as they can in case they need to go to the capital markets to raise more cash via an equity offering  If they had cut the dividend to zero already it might have helped free up cash for the debt  but the stock price would have fallen much further  and the company wouldn t be able to raise as much cash in a public equity offering  if need be

215895,437411,VZ,FCC To Scrap Stringent Business Data Service Regulations,opinion,"Yesterday  the U S  telecom regulator   Federal Communications Commission  FCC    voted 2 1 to withdraw most of the stringent regulatory requirements to reform the business data service  BDS  market  The BDS reform report was introduced by the previous FCC body that was led by Tom Wheeler under the Democratic rule  However  the new FCC  reconstructed by President Trump and headed by Ajit Pai  has ushered a less restrictive regime 
The BDS market  where telecom operators and cable MSOs  multi service operators  provide a host of network related services to business entities of various sizes  has been a lucrative source of revenues in the recent years for service providers  Significantly  these service providers have been generating handsome revenues by frequently charging steep prices from small and medium businesses  At present  BDS is a  45 billion market opportunity per annum 
In 2016  the FCC proposed rules to regulate pricing in the market  citing low competition  The proposals include   1  removal of tariffs  2  not classifying telecom providers as either dominant or non dominant carriers  3  implementing a new Competitive Market Test to determine where competition exists  4  imposing technology neutral regulations  5  instituting price caps on access to legacy TDM networks in non competitive markets  6  setting wholesale prices in relation to retail prices for any given service in non competitive markets 
Yesterday s voting outcome will substantially ease the regulatory requirements in the business data services market  However  some price caps in areas with little competition will be retained  Welcoming the voting result  Pai said that stringent regulations would be detrimental to competition and future investment need for technological upgrade  
Gainers from FCC s New Decision
The BDS reform proposals adopted by the FCC under the previous regime have been criticized by industry players and several industry organizations  They argued that being that the BDS regulations will cause more harm than good  discouraging further network investments  costing jobs and reducing economic output  Incumbent service providers like AT T Inc    NYSE T    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    CenturyLink Inc    NYSE T   and Comcast Corp    NYSE S   together with several other telecom operators and cable MSOs  vehemently opposed this proposal  These companies are set to gain the most from today s FCC decision 
On the other hand  the vote comes as a blow to Sprint Corp    NYSE S   and other firms that backed a 2016 FCC plan under Wheeler s chairmanship that would have cut business data prices  All the stocks mentioned above currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

Q1 Performance
Verizon reported non GAAP earnings per share of  0 95  which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 98  Moreover  Verizon s first quarter revenues also missed Zacks Consensus Estimate of  30 504 billion 
Wireless Business Performance
Verizon reported revenues of  20 878 billion in its wireless segment compared with a  22 004 billion in the year ago quarter  The telecom company attributed this decline of 5 1  primarily to its loss of 307 000 postpaid customers  which included phone losses to the tune of 289 000  It also stated that it lost 17 000 prepaid customers in the quarter 
Wireline
Wireline segment revenues dropped to  7 876 billion from  7 923 billion a year earlier  However  some respite was provided by the company s Fios revenues  which grew to  2 891 billion from  2 761 a year earlier  The company expects to capitalize on customer growth in this segment  Net additions in Fios digital connections were 14 000  while additions to Fios Internet subscribers came to 35 000 
Outlook
Verizon expects its 2017 organic revenues to be flat with 2016 levels  It expects its consolidated capital spending to be in the range of  16 8 to  17 5 billion  On the tax front  Verizon expects a full year effective tax rate of 34 36  In the current scenario  let s have a look at some ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Verizon

To Conclude
Verizon fell short of the consensus estimate on both earnings and revenues  primarily due to a decline in postpaid customers  However  its outlook remains strong and it expects a turnaround in its wireless segment and strong performance in the Fios segment  As a result  we believe it is best to remain on the sidelines for now

Two more specialized ETFs are worth noting in particular though as both saw trading volume that was far outside of normal  In fact  both of these funds experienced volume levels that were more than triple their average for the most recent trading session  This could make these ETFs the ones to watch out for in the days ahead to see if this trend of extra interest continues

The significant rise in volume was largely the result of increased uncertainty in the markets because of the French presidential elections  The first run off was held on Sunday  April 23  2017  Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen emerged victorious and will be facing each other in the second run off on May 7  2017  For the month  EWQ is up 0 96   The fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  with a Medium risk outlook

The fund has high exposure to Vector Group   NYSE VGR   and Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ   with 3 66  and 2 54  allocation  respectively  The higher than average trading volume in the ETF can largely be attributed to the increased trading in the Vector group stock following the sale of 100 000 shares by its director Bennett S  Lebow  Moreover  Verizon Communications reported disappointing 2017 first quarter earnings due to which shares of Verizon lost 2 4  on April 21  2017  For the month  PEY is up 0 24   while the fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 with a Medium risk outlook

215907,437423,VZ,3 Things To Watch When Verizon And AT T Report Earnings,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ   two American multinational telecommunication conglomerates  are set to report earnings in the next few days  Verizon will report its Q1 2017 earnings on Thursday April 20 before the market opens  while AT T will report Q1  17 earnings on Tuesday  April 25  before the open as well 

AT T is expected to report EPS of  0 75 on  40 7 billion in revenue 

Wall Street s consensus for Verizon is  0 98 in EPS and  30 5 billion in revenue 
In the past  telecom behemoths such as AT T or Verizon provided communication services primarily in the form of voice  text  and internet landline connectivity  However  these companies as well as the sector in which they operate have evolved in recent years  and are now focusing more on everything wireless  providing business solutions  even content  in the cases of both AT T and Verizon 
We appear to be at a crossroad for telecom companies  the shifting business environment is providing telecoms with opportunities through which to expand beyond their original core as never before  For this reason  now may be the exact right time to take a long  hard look at two of the sector s giants 

1  Lackluster Stocks  Stellar Dividends
One thing to immediately acknowledge  the performance of both stocks has been  to put it mildly  lackluster over the past four years  In April 2013  Verizon traded within a range of between  48 and  54 dollars a share  Yesterday  Verizon closed at  49 22  Thus  very little to no capital appreciation at all over the past four years 
AT T s story isn t all that different  It traded in a range of between  36 and  39 a share during the same month in 2013  It closed at  40 25 last night  Any investor who bought these stocks just for the capital gains has  by now  been sorely disappointed 
However  savvy investors buy and hold shares of these two companies not for the share price movement  but rather for their stellar dividends  AT T currently yields a hefty 4 86  which it has been maintaining and growing for the past 32 years  This exemplary payout history has made the stock a Dividend Aristocrat  the designation given to S P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends consecutively for 25 plus years 
Verizon currently yields 4 73   and has consistently grown its dividend for the past 10 years  So  while shares didn t appreciate  stakeholders were still rewarded for their investment  That s likely one of the reasons Warren Buffet continues to retain shares of the stock 

2  Business Performance
Verizon s business is divided into two segments   Wireless   which includes the company s wireless network  as well as phone and data divisions  and  Wireline  which consists of broadband and fiber operations  including Fios   Verizon s fiber optic network 
The  Wireless  segment  accounting for over 70  of Verizon s income  has struggled throughout 2016  registering lower operating revenue  89 billion vs  91 billion   2 7   and lower operating income  29 9 billion vs 29 8 billion   0 4    though that was partially offset by lower operating expenses  However  the trouble is more pronounced when looking at the slow down in new customer expansion  Verizon added 2 28 million customers in 2016  compared with 4 5 million in 2015  The churn  percentage of canceled subscriptions from within the entire customer base  has also popped from 0 96  in 2015 to 1 01  in 2016  including an especially bad quarter just recently when churn increased to 1 10  in Q4 2016 
While  Wireline  suffered from a 2 3  drop in revenue during 2016  from  32 to  31 3 billion  it actually returned a  40 million profit on the year  after losing  521 million during the previous year  Customer additions were also on the decline  from 677 thousand net adds in 2015 to just 317 thousand in 2016  53  less 
AT T s business is divided into three segments  Business Solutions  Entertainment Group  which includes pay TV and high speed internet  and Consumer Mobility  which is the equivalent of Verizon s  Wireless  segment  The Business Solutions segment remained flat for the year  with wireless services and  strategic services   VPN and other internet services  picking up the business leaving AT T legacy voice services which are also part of the Business Solutions segment 
The Entertainment Group got a boost from the DirecTV integration in Q3 2016  so a YoY comparison is harder to make  but early numbers show growth of 3 4  in video entertainment revenue 
The Consumer Mobility segment is suffering even more than Verizon s equivalent division  with a 6 5  decline in revenue over the past year from  35 5 billion to  32 2 billion  However lower operating expenses more than made up for the losses  as the segment finished with  9 8 billion in income   0 1  over last year  Net customer adds are also down  from 463 thousand to 359 thousands   22  

3  Acquisitions and Growth
As we ve shown above  both companies have been struggling to grow organically over the past few years  a key reason for the inevitable share price stagnation  Consequently  in pursuit of new routes to profitability  they ve both been on acquisition rampages 
Notable deals for Verizon include the purchase of AOL in May 2015  for  4 4 billion  Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  in July 2016  for  4 8 billion  and Fleetmatics  a fleet management software company  in August 2016 for  2 4 billion 
Notable deals for AT T include DirecTV  acquired in July 2015 for  48 5 billion  Time Warner in October 2016 for  85 billion   108 billion including debt   and Straight Path Communications  for its 5G licenses  earlier this month for  1 6 billion 
The difference between the two companies becomes clearer when you consider their recent acquisition history  Verizon is dipping its toes into media and advertising markets by buying companies that are mostly past their prime  hoping for a good deal on still valuable assets such as brand names  although a general  is also in the works   With its recent acquisitions  Verizon will own The Huffington Post  AOL  TechCrunch  Tumblr  Flicker and more 
AT T on the other hand is betting big  and going all in on content including television  streaming and video content  These moves should make every AT T investor nervous  The company is adding a considerable amount of debt to its books in order to try and create a media empire  by purchasing control of both the content and distribution sides of the business 
It s an integrated approach that AT T executives believe will succeed over time  For example  the acquisition of Straight Path  while small  could be what allows AT T to control the 5G space and would benefit all of its other endeavors too  since it would allow AT T to transfer data  such as video  a hundred times more quickly than before 
Comparing the ambitions of each company  it appears that AT T s moves have the bigger potential upside  though of course that also comes with greater risk  AT T has  9 billion in debt due every year for the foreseeable future  but its massive Future Free Cash Flow of  26 billion should be able to cover this as well as the dividend  which cost the company  11 8 billion in 2016  This would still leave over  5 billion for the company s use after those two major expenses 

Conclusion
Of the two companies  AT T is the one we like best  It s more diversified  has a stronger business customer base  is less affected by the price war going on among retail phone and data service providers  and overall simply has more room for top and bottom line growth in the near   mid   and longer term 
However  a company is only as good as the price you pay for it  Luckily  though the stock is priced at nearly its all time high  AT T s valuation isn t excessive  It currently has a P E ratio of 19  a Price to Book ratio of 2  and a Price to Free Cash Flow of 14  Surprisingly  both AT T s Price to Book and Price to FCF are below the industry average 
Verizon s P E is 15  lower than AT T s  but its Price to Book ratio is 8 8 and its price to FCF is 38 8  Note however  that Verizon recently changed accounting methods  making its numbers look worse than they actually are 
Still  AT T is the better value considering its growth potential  Taking everything into account  we d give Verizon a hold  though AT T is most definitely a buy  Our ideal entry point for AT T would be  37  but everything under  40 seems reasonable ",2017-04-19,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-things-to-watch-when-verizon-and-at-t-report-earnings-200183578,200183578

215914,437430,VZ,Is Verizon Mulling To Bid For Straight Path Communications ,opinion,"As per a recent report by Reuters  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is considering offering a counterbid to acquire Straight Path Communications Inc   a leading provider of fixed wireless spectrum licenses  Notably  on Apr 10  2017  AT T Inc    NYSE T   announced its decision to purchase Straight Path Communications in an all stock merger deal 
AT T has agreed to pay  95 63 per share  a near 160  premium over Straight Path s closing price of  36 48 on Apr 7  Total value of the AT T deal was around  1 6 billion after considering the liabilities of Straight Path  On Apr 13  after the market close  Straight Path submitted a filing with SEC stating that the company is exploring a new offer from a third party that may top the AT T bid  According to Reuters  the new entrant is Verizon 
Importantly  Straight Path has a strong portfolio of 868 spectrum licenses in the high frequency 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands  which are included in the Federal Communications Commission s  FCC  designation for the next generation of wireless broadband services  Notably  on Jul 2016  in a landmark voting  the FCC unanimously decided to make high frequency radio spectrums  above 24 GHz  available for the use of the 5G wireless network 
The regulatory body has voted to open up a total of nearly 11GHz of spectrum  Of the total  3 85GHz will be licensed spectrum and the remaining 7GHz will be unlicensed bandwidth to be used for mobile and fixed wireless 5G network  According to the research firm ABI Research  5G network deployment is expected to ramp up after 2020 and its market size may reach  247 billion worldwide by 2025 
Verizon is conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network  The company is preparing for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the U S  in 2018  AT T is testing 5G technologies on 3 5GHz  4GHz  15GHz and 28GHz frequency bands  Moreover  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   is using the company s 28 GHz and 39 GHz frequency bands to test run 5G wireless standards 
Importantly  in Feb 2017  Verizon completed the acquisition of privately held XO Communications Inc  s dark fiber optic network  The deal  valued at  1 8 billion  was formulated in Feb 2016  The company will also lease XO s LMDS  Local Multipoint Distribution Service  wireless spectrum with an option to buy them by the end of 2018  XO has a portfolio of 102 LMDS licenses in 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands 
The U S  telecom industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Thus  in order to stay ahead of competitors  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products 
Recently  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   unveiled its wireless data plan going by its intentions to enter this market by mid 2017  The company has also acquired a series of licenses in the recently concluded 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction conducted by the FCC 
At this juncture  acquisition of more high frequency wireless spectrum will be immensely helpful for Verizon to make a strong foothold in the upcoming 5G wireless network race 
Price Performance of Verizon

Year to date  the stock price of Verizon has witnessed a loss of 8 58   underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 4 99  in the same time period 
Nevertheless  Verizon has a very powerful diversified business model  In the wireless front  it will start initial deployment of the upcoming 5G network in 2018 while on the wireline front  the company is aggressively expanding fiber based footprint  In the digital media front  Verizon has become a major contender for the lucrative online advertisement business  We believe these are primary reasons behind the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

215922,437438,VZ,Straight Path Communications  STRP  Stock Skyrockets On AT T  T  Buyout,opinion,"Shares of Straight Path Communications   NYSE T   opened more than 150  higher on Monday after wireless carrier AT T   NYSE T   announced that it would buy the holder of wireless spectrum licenses in a deal worth about  1 25 billion 
AT T  which is the second largest U S  carrier  will pay  95 63 per share for the company  This price represents a premium of more than 160  from Straight Path s previous closing price  The deal is an all stock merger and is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization 
The buyout comes just a few months after Straight Path announced that it was hiring Evercore Partners  an investment bank intended to help the company explore its strategic options  Evercore advised Straight Path on the sale  and the merger was also supported by Straight Path s largest investor  Howard Jonas  the founder of IDT Corporation   NYSE T   and Genie Energy   NYSE GNE   
AT T s decision to pay nearly three times Straight Path s stock price underscores the carrier s desire to bolster its 5G portfolio  Straight Path currently holds the rights to 868 spectrum licenses in the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands  which are both included in the FCC s  for the next generation of wireless broadband services 
 By becoming the first nation to identify high band spectrum  the United States is ushering in the 5G era of high capacity  high speed  low latency wireless networks   said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler 
5th generation mobile networks are expected to be fully rolled out by 2020  and these new services could provide speeds of up to 100 times faster than today s 4G networks

215923,437439,VZ,After AT T Buys Straight Path  Globalstar Could Be The Next Telecom Takeover Target,opinion,"Globalstar  Inc  s   NYSE T   stock skyrocketed 15  Monday morning on buyout speculation after AT T   NYSE T   purchased Straight Path Communications   NYSE T   for a 162  premium  Globalstar s fun in the sun faded quickly after the initial wave of takeover speculation died down  but a buyout could still be on the horizon 
The struggling satellite phone maker looked poised for a massive Monday after  fellow communications company Straight Path for  1 6 billion  As is often the case  investors began to buy Globalstar stock in the hopes that Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    T Mobile US  Inc    NYSE T    or another cell phone giant might buy the company in order match AT T s new acquisition 
Globalstar s stock was up 2 16  to  1 65 per share in Monday morning trading 
Globalstar s major Monday push might have ended earlier than expected  but its stock has the potential for future gains  as a buyout is still very possible based on the company s relatively niche offerings 
Niche Market 
The company provides mobile voice and data communications services via satellite throughout the world  Globalstar s clients include massively important industries such as oil and gas  government  military  transportation  and emergency preparedness  The company does not face extreme competition  as its bread and butter is out of reach of traditional wireless network clients 
Still  Globalstar saw its stock price fall drastically last June when news surfaced that the Federal Communications Commission wouldn t vote on its plan to pair licensed and unlicensed spectrum to create its new Terrestrial Low Power Service network  Globalstar s stock then popped in December after the company addressed the  
Globalstar all but abandoned its plans to try toease Wi Fi congestion in densely populated urban areas when it halted its efforts to pair licensed and unlicensed spectrum in January  Instead  the company pivoted to  
Shares of the Covington  Louisiana based company   but the stock is up just 2 53  since the beginning of the year  Before that  Globalstar s stock price had dropped steadily over the last three years  after trading at an all time high of  4 46 per share in June 2014  The sinking price meant investors were dying for Globalstar to bring something new to the table 
Last Friday  the company made a small  but potentially significant play in order to do just that 
Globalstar announced the launch of its new satellite industry compression service  The company will offer its compression services  which were developed by Yippy  Inc    OTC YIPI    to its existing clients  as well as other players in both the Mobile Satellite Services and Fixed Satellite Services industries  The move will increase internet speeds for Globalstar customers and allow them to access and download important data and information much faster than before 
Some Globalstar satellite clients can expect to see wait times to load online content decrease from minutes to seconds  The compression industry is likely to grow as the amount of data stored on the web increases exponentially  and Globalstar has positioned itself well by partnering with compression technology leader Yippy 
 The rollout of this effort has been a major initiative for our satellite operations teams and last year we provided the service on a trial basis   Globalstar CEO Jay Monroe said in a    After months of rigorous testing  we have concluded that Yippy s platform provides subscribers with a greatly enhanced data service experience  Additionally  we believe that the technology can be used by operators throughout the satellite industry and we look forward to working with other providers to integrate this technology into their platforms  
Globalstar s push into the compression market could prove to be viable as the compression industry grows  The move could also help increase the company s buyout chances 
Furthermore  the company s satellite phones and remote internet connection services are still in high demand from the U S  military as well as others such as major shipping companies  oil giants  and disaster relief organizations 
AT T paid a premium for Straight Path in order to bolster its 5G capabilities  But with a  248 billion market cap  AT T could be looking for additional small acquisitions in the near future 
A buyout is still very possible for Globalstar as any deal would be relatively affordable for Verizon  AT T  or another player  especially when considering it would uniquely expand the business offerings of any of the industry giants

215924,437440,VZ,AT T To Buy Straight Path Communications  ETFs In Focus,opinion,"AT T   NYSE T   will acquire Straight Path Communications   NYSE T   for  1 25 billion in an all stock deal to accumulate the airwaves it needs for a next generation network 
This is the second acquisition by AT T this year as it competes with other telecom giants to create a stronghold in the 5G space  In February this year  AT T said it was acquiring privately held FiberTower and its millimeter wave spectrum rights  read    
Straight Path Communications is one of the largest holders of 28 and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum  which has already been approved for use in 5G services by the U S  Federal Communications Commission  Wireless carriers are willing to pay a premium to get into this space by acquiring companies that have the required licenses and expertise to help them get the right spectrum for the next generation network  The network is expected to boost Internet speeds significantly 
We note that earlier this year  Straight Path Communications was involved in a legal scuffle  It was asked to pay the FCC  15 million to settle a probe  The company was accused of submitting false progress data to renew airwave licenses  It was asked to transfer its 28 and 39 GHz licenses by January 2018 and pay 20  of sales proceeds 
Coming back to the deal  AT T has agreed to acquire Straight Path for  95 63 a share in an all stock deal designed to be a tax free reorganization  This marks a 162  premium to its closing price of  36 48 on Friday  April 7  2017  After the deal was announced  shares of Straight Path took a giant leap and closed at  91 64 on Tuesday  April 10  2017  However  there was no noticeable impact of the announcement on AT T shares 
The total value of the deal includes liabilities and the amount owed to the FCC  This deal can be a game changer for AT T in the 5G space  Let s discuss some ETFs  which have a high exposure to AT T  see all

215935,437451,VZ,Frontier Communications  Here s How To Play The Dividend Cut Fears,opinion,"Fear is high that a Frontier  NASDAQ FTR  dividend cut is coming  Its price is down  its yield  12 4   seems unsustainably high  and short interest is among the highest in the S P 500 
However  to a large extent  Frontier does have the ability to control its cash flows and sustain its dividend in the near  and mid term  The real challenge is that Frontier s business exists in an anemically eroding marketplace  And if you are attracted to Frontier because of its big dividend yield  then you may want to consider the bonds instead  Many of Frontier s high yield bonds offer big interest payments  and they re far safer than the stock  plus the bonds might get a nice price bump if Frontier s dividend actually does get cut  
Frontier faces challenges
Frontier faces big challenges  For starters  the company provides voice  video and data services to customers dispersed across the US  often in smaller rural markets where the big boys  Verizon  NYSE VZ  and AT T  NYSE T   are generally not interested 


The company s financial wherewithal is being stretched increasingly thin considering the high costs of maintaining its dispersed and neglected networks  its balance sheet debt obligations  and its equity investor s demands for dividends 


Also  potential increased competition from wireless service providers is threatening  And as further evidence of the challenges facing Frontier  short interest has recently exceeded 19   making it one of the most  bet against  stocks in the S P 500 


Further still  the following chart shows the company s free cash flows  the money from operations left over after capital expenditures  has recently been negative 

And considering all of these challenges  many investors are left wondering if the big dividend is safe  or if it is heading for a big dividend cut 
Frontier s dividend is sustainable  for now  
Frontier s dividend is sustainable in the short  and mid term  if the company wants to sustain it  For example  Frontier can skimp on network capital expenditures in the short  and mid term at the expense of disgruntled customers  remember  Frontier is the only provider in many of the areas it serves   However  Frontier may likely be able to sustain the dividend without further sacrificing services and capital expenditures  As the following graphic shows  the company has plans to strengthen itself in the coming years via cost synergies 

Additionally  Frontier s cash flows may not be as dire as a basic free cash flow calculation  see earlier FCF chart  suggests  In particular  adjusted free cash flow  and the dividend   as shown in the following chart  is much less stressed 


 For reference  Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as free cash flow  as described above and adding back interest expense on incremental debt and dividends paid  prior to the company s ownership of the CTF operations  on debt incurred and preferred stock issued to finance the Verizon Acquisition  
Also worth noting  the government has a vested interest in supporting Frontier  In particular  the government wants Frontier to keep providing phone and data services in certain dispersed and underserved areas  and that s why Frontier receives multiple government subsidies  For example  in 2015   500 million  or 9   of Frontier s total revenues were derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high cost support  commonly referred to as USF  2015 10 K  p 22  
Frontier s bonds  better than its stock
As the following table shows  Frontier currently has a variety of high yield bonds outstanding 

Specifically  many of these bonds offer big coupons and very attractive yields to maturity  And what makes them even more attractive to us is that many of them are far safer than the stock  For example  Frontier has some 2025 bonds that offer 11  interest payments  10 496  YTM   And not only does Frontier have the cash flow to keep paying these bonds now  they have the ability to cut the stock dividend in the future which will free up even more cash flow to pay the bonds if needed  And if Frontier does cut the dividend  the bonds will likely experience an immediate jump in price because the market will perceive the bonds as even safer  i e  cutting the dividend frees up more cash flow thereby making the bonds safer  
Generally speaking  companies don t stop paying interest on their debt unless they re going into bankruptcy  and that s not the case for Frontier  i e  Frontier has plenty of business and cash flow to remain a going concern   And as we mentioned earlier  the government has a vested interest in NOT letting Frontier go into bankruptcy  i e  the government wants Frontier to keep serving the areas that it does  and that s exactly why Frontier receives all those government subsidies   Unless some hostile takeover occurs  whereby the barbarians intentionally take Frontier into bankruptcy  the bonds are money good  especially considering the government regulators want Frontier to stay in business  
Risks
As we mentioned earlier  Frontier s business faces a variety of risks that are worth considering  For example  Frontier serves customers in dispersed regions across the US which makes supporting the network expensive  And in many areas  the network has been neglected and requires significant capital expenditures  Other risks include the threat of a reduction in government subsidies  potential competition from wireless providers  costly pension obligations  the costs of unionized workers  and customers angry about the quality of service  However  despite the risks  there are a lot of stakeholders that want the company to remain a going concerns such as the government regulators  the customers that have no other viable phone and data options  and the investors and management that have skin in the game 
Conclusion
If it s big safe yield that you re after  consider Frontier s high yield bonds  not the stock  Frontier will cut the huge dividend on its stock long before it defaults on its debt  And if you are interested in more companies with big dividends and a high level of fearful investors  like Frontier   consider this list of   Lastly  and most importantly  don t subject yourself to unnecessary risk  unless you want to  such as is the case with Frontier s stock ",2017-02-28,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/frontier:-how-to-play-the-dividend-cut-fear-200177218,200177218

215969,437485,VZ,FCC Abandons Plans For BDS Reforms  Delays Voting Process,opinion,"The surprising victory of Republican nominee Donald Trump as the next U S  president is starting to show its impact on telecom policy parameters  On Nov 16  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  abandoned its plans to reform Business Data Services  BDS  market by dropping the voting procedure on proposals made by its Chairman Tom Wheeler 
The FCC took this sudden decision after a group of Republican lawmakers asked Wheeler to refrain from acting on  controversial  issues like BDS during his final months in office  Notably  Donald Trump will take over charges of White House on Jan 20  2017 
The BDS market  where telecom and cable MSOs  multi service operators  provide a host of different network related services to business entities of different sizes  have been a lucrative source of revenues in the recent years for the service providers  More significantly  these service providers have been generating handsome revenues from the small and medium businesses by often charging steep price  At present  BDS is a  45 billion market opportunity per annum 
The FCC has proposed rules to regulate pricing in the market  citing low competition  According to LightReading  the FCC s proposal include   1  no more tariffs  2  No more classifying telecom providers as either dominant or non dominant carriers  3  Implement a new Competitive Market Test to determine where competition exists  4  imposition of technology neutral regulations  5  Institute price caps on access to legacy TDM networks in non competitive markets  6  in non competitive markets wholesale prices should be set in relation to retail prices for any given service 
However  such proposals have been criticized by the industry players and several industry organizations  Their argument being that the new BDS regulations will cause more harm than good  discouraging further network investments  costing jobs and reducing economic output  Incumbent service providers like AT T Inc    NYSE T    CenturyLink Inc    NYSE T   and Frontier Communications Corp    NYSE T   together with several cable MSOs have vehemently opposed this proposal

operational initiatives undertaken by the company supported the bottom line Inside the HeadlinesDycom s fiscal first quarter contract revenues continued their strong momentum and came in at  799 2 million  up 21 2  year over year  However  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  801 million by a whisker  Contract revenues grew 18  on an organic basis  Acquisitions too  added  56 6 million in revenues  significantly supplementing the revenue stream Extensive deployment of 1 Gigabyte wireline networks by major customers and increasing rollout of fiber by cable operators in small and medium businesses boosted top line growth  Solid performance across the majority of business lines  including engineering   design and aerial and underground construction services  and healthy inorganic growth also augmented revenues The company reported non GAAP adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  of  129 2 million for the quarter  compared with  105 7 million recorded a year ago LiquidityDycom exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  21 7 million compared with  33 8 million as of Jul 30  2016  The company s long term debt was  774 5 million as at quarter end  compared with  706 2 million as of Jul 30  2016 Outlook for Goodman NetworksLast quarter  Dycom had acquired certain telecom related assets of Goodman Networks Incorporated for about  107 5 million in cash  It had purchased certain assets and associated liabilities in Goodman s current wireline and wireless network deployment businesses Initially  Dycom projected the buyout to generate about  150  165 million in revenues over the next 12 months  by providing services like wireless network construction in Texas  Georgia  Southern California and other markets  This specialty contracting services provider also projected the EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  of the acquired business  as a percentage of revenue  to be roughly in line with its own ratio in fiscal 2018 However  concurrent with the earnings release  Dycom announced that the recently acquired operations of Goodman Networks are now forecast to generate revenues of about  10 million per quarter  which is much lower than the initial expectations  Consequently  Dycom has reduced its contract backlog by about  211 million GuidanceDycom issued guidance for second quarter fiscal 2017  wherein adjusted earnings per share are projected in the range of 61 73 cents on revenues within a range of  640  670 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings is currently pegged at 71 cents per share  within the company s guided range DYCOM INDS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Our TakeWe believe that Dycom s top line has benefited significantly from favorable industry trends over the past few quarters  which are driving client spending  Deployment of fiber to the home and fiber to the node technologies by major telecom operators to enable video offerings and 1 gigabit high speed connections  have been opening up considerable growth opportunities for the company  Going forward  we expect that the significant investments in wireline networks  cable capacity projects and the ongoing Connect America Fund II project will help Dycom maintain its growth momentum Also  the company s diligent capital expenditure strategy has supplemented organic revenue improvement over the past 12 months  We also believe that investments made in assets will enhance operating efficiency  accelerating the delivery of backlogs  which in turn bodes well for long term growth This apart  Dycom has a highly concentrated client base  among which the biggest ones   i e  AT T  Inc    NYSE T    Comcast Corporation   NASDAQ CMCSA    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and Centurylink   contributed about 56  of revenues in fiscal 2015 However  uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment  especially fluctuations in oil prices and unfavorable weather conditions  remain headwinds for the company  As a matter of fact  pronounced seasonal impact from businesses acquired by the company in 2015 has hampered earnings

215972,437488,VZ,Why The Cuban Dream Maybe Over For US Telecom Operators,opinion,"President Obama s decision to normalize U S  diplomatic and economic relations with Cuba  which had been considerably strained since 1961  is again under threat 
Recently  President elect Donald Trump threatened to terminate the Obama administration s efforts to normalize US Cuba relations  According to CNN  Trump tweeted  If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people  the Cuban American people and the U S  as a whole  I will terminate the deal  
Notably  Cuba is currently going through a political transition as its long time dictator and former President Fidel Castro passed away on Nov 25  His brother and present President Raul Castro is taking over complete control of Cuba  Likewise  the White House is witnessing a change of regime from Obama to Trump 
Under Obama s administration  new Cuban policy regulations  approved by the Treasury and Commerce departments  aided the U S  telecom industry to gain initial exemptions from the existing embargo to invest in Cuba 
The newly developed truce between the two countries enables the U S  telecom operators to export telecom equipment and services to Cuba  Under these regulations  the U S  telecom carriers were also permitted to establish the necessary infrastructure in Cuba to offer various telecom services including the Internet 
In Mar 2015  U S  based IDT Corp had formed a joint venture with Cuba s state run Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA  ETECSA  to provide direct international long distance service  In Sep 2015  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   became the first U S  telecom operator to offer roaming wireless services in Cuba   
Meanwhile  in Nov 2015  Sprint Corp    NYSE S   signed the first direct roaming wireless service agreement with ETECSA  Earlier  in Apr 2015  Sprint s prepaid service division   Boost Mobile   had launched an unlimited voice call and text message service plan between the U S  and Cuba 
In May 2016  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   had also signed an interconnection and roaming wireless service agreement with ETECSA  Notably  T Mobile US serves the maximum number of customers in the U S  who are of Cuban descent  Furthermore  starting from Oct 18  U S  telecom giant AT T Inc    NYSE T   has been offering direct roaming mobile interconnection services to Cuba 
All four stocks mentioned above currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Price Performance of Four Major Wireless Operators

Year to date  the Zacks categorized U S  wireless industry has registered an impressive growth of 17 02   However  the stock prices of two relatively large telecom operators  namely  Verizon and AT T have underperformed the industry mark  While AT T has registered a growth of 14 73   Verizon witnessed just 10 26  growth in the same time period 
On the other hand  two smaller players    T Mobile US and Sprint    have outperformed the industry  Shares of T Mobile US surged 41 59  while Sprint witnessed an astonishing 120 99  growth in the same time frame 
Nevertheless  both T Mobile US and Sprint are emphasizing on their core wireless network offering several price concessions to entice customers away from their large peers  In contrast  Verizon and AT T are gradually diversifying their business model into Internet TV  digital mobile platform and highly lucrative mobile advertising segments  We believe this is the primary reason behind all four nation wireless operators currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3 
Our View
We believe that the U S  telecom operators may not reap any near term gain from Cuban investments as the country is less developed at present and reels under highly restrictive government regulations  However  in the long term  Cuba may become a boon for telecom carriers who choose to operate in the country  An opportunity to sell products and services to 11 million untapped customers is a very lucrative and enticing one 
Further  with the weakening of communism and the willingness to enter the economic as well as political mainstream  Cuba is poised to become an attractive emerging market in the future  Additionally  Cuba s geographical proximity to the U S  is a major positive for these telecom operators from the cost of operations standpoint

215974,437490,VZ,FCC advances reform of U S  business data market,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted to advance reforms of the  40 billion market for business data services  known as special access lines  and to bar some contractual practices by providers  The FCC voted 3 2 to approve an order that will bar some existing contract requirements by special access providers for businesses using high capacity data and voice connections and to advance a proposed regulation reforming the market that would create a  new technology neutral framework  that would extend regulations in non competitive markets  Many businesses rely on the little special access lines to transmit large amounts of data quickly  for instance connecting banks to ATM machines or gasoline pump credit card readers  The lines are used by offices  retailers  banks  manufacturers  schools  hospitals and universities to move large amounts of data  Mobile networks also rely on the lines for the backhaul of mobile traffic  But there is little competition in many markets  said FCC chairman Tom Wheeler   Where competition does not exist  then government has a job to do   protecting consumers and competition   he said Thursday  Wheeler has noted competitive carriers reach  less than 45 percent of locations where there is demand   One issue is many businesses signed long term contracts that impose high penalties for opting out of using the services  FCC officials said  making it difficult to switch to another service  Companies must withdraw  unjust and unreasonable  conditions within 60 days of the order being published  the FCC said Thursday  The proposed reforms of the overall market will face public comment before a final vote by the FCC  Republicans questioned why the FCC should intervene on behalf of sophisticated businesses like banks that signed contracts for data services  The services are profitable for large carriers  such as  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  and AT T Inc  NYSE T   Smaller carriers  such as Sprint Corp  have argued the special access market is uncompetitive  Sprint praised the FCC Thursday for taking a  significant step in reforming the long broken market for business data services   The FCC said special access lines are worth about  25 billion of the  40 billion annual market for business data services  The proposal also considers whether other types of business data services  like cable or Internet services  could face further regulatory scrutiny in non competitive markets   
The National Cable and Telecommunications Association criticized the proposal  It said that while cable companies entering the market has resulted in improved services and lower prices for businesses  it was  disappointing  that the FCC was considering  imposing onerous new rate regulation on these competitive services  ",2016-04-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/fcc-advances-reform-of-u.s.-business-data-market-398913,398913

215985,437501,VZ,Is Verizon Ready Ror Yahoo Merger ,opinion,"Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  has come a long way from its humble origins in the Bell breakup  It has grown from a small eastern seaboard phone company into one of the largest digital communications networks in the country 
Most recently  Verizon has dominated tech  and finance industry news with its bid to buy Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO   The ailing internet services provider could use a facelift  And Verizon is prepared to take on that challenge 
But mergers of this size are not orderly events   And as we recently covered  they often don t receive approval   Sure  Yahoo has stumbled in recent years  but it s still worth  40 billion  An acquisition like this will be a serious strain on Verizon s resources 
Is Verizon stock prepared for it  It s hard to say  Shares are up for the year  but not by a ton 

This deal with Yahoo could make or break Verizon  It could be the beginning of a new phase for both companies  Or it could mark the end of Verizon s stability in the telecom space  With that in mind  Investment U readers want to know  What should you do with Verizon stock 
To find out  we ran it through the Investment U Fundamental Factor Test   As a reminder  our checklist looks at six key metrics to diagnose the financial health of a stock  
Earnings per Share EPS  Growth  Verizon doesn t give us a promising start with regard to earnings  Its earnings per share have shrunk in the last year  with a growth rate of  10 10   Other telecoms are down too  but not as badly  The industry average is  3 28  
Price to Earnings  P E   The company redeems itself a bit with its price to earnings ratio  It s just 12 23  a little more than a third of the industry average  which is 34 72  That indicates that the market is excessively bearish on Verizon stock  relative to its competitors 
Debt to Equity  Telecom is an expensive business  and many of Verizon s peers are highly leveraged  The average debt to equity ratio is 125 37   But Verizon has even more debt than that  Its ratio of 484 88  is worryingly above average 
Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   This is a very bad omen for Verizon  While other telecoms have respectable cash flows of 24 95  per share  Verizon has seen free cash flow per share drop  86 89   That is not the number we were hoping for here 
Profit Margins  Verizon returns to above average here  Its profit margin of 11 70  is a decent bit higher than the industry average of 8 87   which is already quite good 
Return on Equity  The company ends on a very good note with its return  Verizon equity has earned 83 48  in the last year  compared to average returns of 18 11  among competitors 
In sum  Verizon is doing OK  Its profit margins and return on equity are strong  And the market isn t giving it the credit it deserves  But the company s predicament is a bit weaker than we d like to see from a company that s about to spend a few billion 
Verizon s earnings  debt burden and cash flows are all causes for concern  And in the short term  its merger with Yahoo could make matters worse  Hopefully  the acquisition will give Verizon momentum and opportunities for growth in the long term  Only time will tell  For these reasons  Verizon stock has earned a grade of C

215988,437504,VZ,Cable MSOs Maintain Lead In High Speed Broadband Market,opinion,"Per a recent report by Leichtman Research Group Inc   LRG  the cable multi service operators  MSOs  in the U S  have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high speed broadband  Internet  market  This comes as a respite  especially at a time when the cable TV operators have been losing their foothold in the core video market to fiber based telecom operators and online video streaming service providers 
The second quarter of 2014 marked the first year in the 66 year long history of the cable TV Industry  where cable MSOs outpaced telecom operators in the high speed broadband market  Since then  cable MSOs has been rapidly gaining foothold in the space 
According to data compiled by LRG  14 large cable TV and telecom operators jointly had approximately 92 5 million high speed Internet subscribers at the end of the third quarter of 2016  representing about 95  of the nation s total broadband market  Of the count cited  cable MSOs commanded nearly 57 8 million subscribers  62 5   while the remaining 34 7 million customers  37 5   were serviced by telecom operators 
In the third quarter  seven major cable TV operators added a net of 774 956 high speed Internet subscribers while seven major telecom operators lost 149 593 net subscribers resulting in a total net subscriber addition of 625 563 for the broadband industry  In the first nine months of 2016  the cable TV operators have gained around 2 44 million subscribers in contrast to a loss of about 475 000 subscribers on the part of the telecom operators 
In the third quarter  top two cable MSOs in the U S   namely  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   and Charter Communications Inc    NYSE T   added 329 000 and 387 000 high speed broadband subscribers  respectively  On the other hand  telecom behemoth AT T Inc    NYSE T   lost 23 000 subscribers while Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   gained 24 000 subscribers  All four stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
Over the last ten years  the internal dynamics of the pay TV market have been gradually shifting from cable TV offerings toward fiber based video services of large telecom operators  Moreover  the strong presence of online video streaming providers is posing a significant threat to the existing pay TV business model  Video offering  which represented the core business function of cable TV operators  seems to be fast slipping out of their hands 
Nevertheless  of late  with the deployment of the next generation DOCSIS 3 0 technology  cable TV operators have extensively penetrated into the high speed Internet market  In an attempt to capitalize on this technology  leading cable TV operators are increasingly emphasizing on the broadband market  At this juncture  a strong momentum in the high speed data  Internet  market bodes well for cable MSOs

216013,437529,VZ,FCC proposes reforming business data services market,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The chairman of the U S  Federal Communications Commission on Friday proposed reforming the estimated  25 billion a year market for high capacity data and voice connections  known as special access lines  to businesses 
FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said he was recommending a new  regulatory framework  barring some contractual practices by circuit based systems that make it harder for businesses to switch to other data carriers  adding he wants  a new  technology neutral  approach 
 If we want to maximize the benefits of business data services for U S  consumers and businesses  we need a fresh start   Wheeler said in a blog post on Friday  noting that despite cable companies entering the market  competitive carriers reach  less than 45 percent of locations where there is demand  
Many businesses rely on the little special access lines to transmit large amounts of data quickly  for instance connecting banks to ATM machines or gas pump credit card readers 
The lines are used by offices  retailers  banks  manufacturers  schools  hospitals and universities to move large amounts of data  Mobile networks also rely on the lines for the backhaul of mobile traffic 
The services are profitable for large carriers  such as  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  and AT T Inc  NYSE T   Smaller carriers  such as Sprint Corp  have argued the special access market is uncompetitive 
One issue is many businesses signed long term contracts that impose high penalties for opting out of using the services  FCC officials said  making it difficult to switch to another service 
Verizon said in a statement it is  encouraged that  Wheeler  has proposed a path toward a balanced framework that would put all providers on equal footing under the same set of rules  It would also rely on competition  rather than regulation  whenever possible  
A coalition of groups  including Sprint  praised Wheeler saying the  forward looking rules will ensure that competition governs the health and sustainability of this critical input  
The FCC said special access lines are worth about  25 billion of the  40 billion annual market for business data services  The proposal also looks at whether other types of business data services  like cable or Internet services  could face further regulatory scrutiny in non competitive markets 

The FCC will vote on the proposal on April 28 and will take public comments before it aims to finalize the rules later this year  A separate order proposed by Wheeler to be voted on this month would bar some existing contract requirements by special access providers ",2016-04-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/fcc-proposes-reforming-business-data-services-market-394304,394304

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Is AT T Planning on Entering the Media Entertainment Space 

As per a recent report by Bloomberg  leading wireless and pay TV company AT T Inc   NYSE     is looking to foray into the media and entertainment industry  Notably  the telecom giant intends to expand through the acquisition of a number of media and programming content producing companies over the next few years  Notably  AT T s pay TV rival and cable giant Comcast Corporation  NASDAQ     has also adopted the same strategy to diversifying its business 

Focus on Video Programming

As prospects in the wireless industry are dim due to a saturated market  telecom players are looking to boost revenues through the adoption of different strategies  Although business services solutions have been gaining momentum  some cash rich telecom companies are looking for further diversification  AT T s wireless rivals Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE     and T Mobile US Inc   NASDAQ     have been active in the mobile advertisement space  AT T  on the other hand  has been focusing on the pay TV industry and is the largest pay TV operator in the U S  post its acquisition of satellite TV provider DIRECTV  However  the pay TV industry faces cord cutting and regular escalation in programming content costs  affecting margins to a large extent  Thus  a move into content production space will help AT T reduce programming costs 

The Bottom Line

As AT T operates as a pay TV operator as well  investing in media and content programming will allow it to achieve backward integrated synergies  mostly reduction of cost to deliver content to subscribers  However  such a move will not be easy as the company doesn t have the required cash to expand a newly created media division  Thus  it has to raise more debt for foraying into the media space  However  with a net debt at the end of second quarter of 2016  piling up further debt may spook investors

216028,437544,VZ,FTC Appeals Court Ruling On AT T s Data Throttling Case,opinion,"According to a recent report by Bloomberg  the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  recently filed an appeal in the U S  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco  to review the previous ruling regarding a data throttling charge issued by the FTC against the U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc    NYSE T   Data throttling basically means data traffic blocking and slowing any data traffic once customers hit certain usage thresholds in a month  In Oct 2014  the FTC disputed that using the data throttling technique the telecom carrier had deceived its unlimited plan customers  In its latest filing  the regulatory agency stated that the Appeal Court s previous ruling would permit any technology company that also offer phone or broadband services  either launching their own service or merging with an existing carrier  to sidestep enforcement of consumer protection laws On Aug 29  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California reversed a lower court s denial of AT T s motion to dismiss the throttling lawsuit  The appeals court identified AT T as a common carrier  Due to this  the service provider could not be held liable for the violations of rules that the FTC brought in its case Notably  the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  slapped a fine of  100 million on AT T for a similar reason in Jun 2015  The company has filed a response  which is still under review by the FCC  It is worth mentioning here that the FCC had adopted the Net Neutrality rules in Feb 2015  The new laws has classified high speed broadband  Internet  as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act  Net neutrality implies an open Internet atmosphere which will prohibit ISPs  Internet service Providers   especially the telecom and cable TV operators  from discriminating against applications  The enforcement of the new law has banned common ISP practices such as data traffic blocking  slowing any data traffic and paid prioritization  The FCC will closely monitor and put a check on all such deals in the future For the FTC case  AT T hasn t denied that it had throttled some users  However  the company defended itself citing that an exception is in place for common carriers  In Oct 2014  AT T was a common carrier for landline phone and mobile voice service  but not for mobile Internet access  The FCC reclassified mobile Internet as a common carrier service only after adopting the Net Neutrality Rules  These arguments by AT T most  likely compelled the federal court to dismiss the FTC case The U S  telecom industry is becoming immensely competitive with cut throat pricing  Recently  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   and Sprint Corp    NYSE S   escalated the pricing war with new unlimited data plans  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   announced that it completed a major upgrade of its 4G LTE networks to LTE Advanced technology covering 461 cities in the U S  The LTE Advanced network will raise the data packet transmission speed by more than 50  At this juncture  a favorable court ruling related to the FTC case will be a major relief for AT T  AT T currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  AT T INC Price

216031,437547,VZ,Verizon Looking To Cut  1 Billion Off Its Yahoo Bid,opinion,"On Friday  it was reported that telecommunications giant Verizon   NYSE VZ   is looking to cut  1 billion off its  4 8 billion offer for Yahoo s   NASDAQ YHOO   core business  The New York Post  the story 
This is most likely an after effect of bad news for the web stalwart over the past few weeks  Yahoo recently revealed that in 2014  it had been hacked  and 500 million accounts including usernames and passwords were stolen 
And earlier this week  reports surfaced that claimed Yahoo scanned users  incoming emails for terrorist signatures for roughly a year  on classified orders from a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 
According to unnamed sources   The discount is being pushed because  Verizon  feels Yahoo s value has been diminished   writes the Post  However  Yahoo s team is pushing for the deal to close sooner rather than later  as well as fighting efforts to negotiate the deal price down in any way 
As a result  YHOO stock is sliding  down just over 1  in midday trading  VZ stock is also down about 0 50  today to  50 02 per share

216040,437556,VZ,Cable  phone industry urge FCC to limit Internet privacy protections,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A group of trade associations representing major cable and telephone companies on Thursday urged the U S  Federal Communications Commission to limit protections in forthcoming broadband privacy rules 
Broadband providers currently collect significant amounts of consumer data and some use data for targeted advertising  drawing criticism from privacy advocates 
The American Cable Association  U S  Telecom Association  Consumer Technology Association  National Cable   Telecommunications Association and other groups wrote FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler urging him to propose limited broadband privacy protections consistent with the Federal Trade Commission s rules that bar  unfair or deceptive  practices 
The letter comes after a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union  Center for Digital Democracy and Electronic Frontier Foundation urged the FCC to write sweeping privacy protections for the nation s broadband users 
The letter suggested the FCC could  identify privacy or security goals  and afford providers  including smaller providers with limited resources  flexibility in achieving those goals  Rules dictating specific methods quickly become out of date and out of step with constantly changing technology  and will only hamper innovation and harm consumers  
Jeffrey Chester  executive director of Center for Digital Democracy  said the industry letter was  an attempt by the phone and cable giants to stop the FCC from protecting the privacy of broadband consumers  
Chester argued that when major Internet providers  are aggressively expanding capabilities to monitor and monetize their customer data across all platforms  including TV  they want to ensure there s no consumer cop on the beat  AT T Inc  N T   Comcast Corp  O CMCSA  and  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  are among companies affected by new rules 
The FCC has new authority to set privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations  A federal appeals court has not ruled on a court challenge to that decision 
Wheeler told Reuters on Thursday he did not see the letter  but reiterated he hoped the commission would move  with dispatch  on new privacy rules 
Wheeler said previously broadband providers must make sure information they collect about consumers is secure  that they are informed and have a choice about whether to participate ",2016-02-11,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/cable,-phone-industry-urge-fcc-to-limit-internet-privacy-protections-384344",384344

216056,437572,VZ,Wall Street s Next Ticking Time Bomb  Pensions,opinion,"Make no mistake  the criminality and fraud of most  if not all  DC politicians that is being exposed now  is also occurring in corporate America and at pension funds  especially with regard to fraudulent financial reporting  As an example  Exxon  NYSE XOM  is now being investigated by the SEC over its asset valuation and accounting practices  The same concept can be applied to pension funds  public and private   The Dallas Fireman and Police Pension fund is the postcard example of both  
The pension time bomb has been activated for a long time but it s now in the final countdown  Pensions are woefully underfunded even if we give them the benefit of the doubt on their current use of market to market  Every pension fund under the sun in this country   because rates are so low   has monthly negative outflows of cash  beneficiaries are being paid more money than is flowing into the fund 
If the stock market declines more than 10  for an extended period of time  nearly every pension fund in the country would blow up  This is why the last two stock plunges  which took the S P 500 down over 10   were met by heavy  if not blatant  Fed intervention  which produced a steep V bounce in the stock market both times 
Yesterday I spoke to a friend colleague who works at a public pension fund  He said the latest fad in pension management land is to shift money out of hedge funds   which are woefully underperforming the market   and to put even more money into private equity funds  This allows the pension funds to subject that capital to a quarterly mark to market test  rather than an daily or monthly valuation accounting 
The only problem  private equity investments are highly illiquid and the valuation of the underlying investments is an  art  that is not at all based on actual market transactions  This private equity investment mark to market  Picasso  leads to extreme  over marking  of private equity investment valuations at pension funds 
This is also one of the primary reasons that the Fed can not raise interest rates  even if it were true that the economy was improving and the labor market was tight  both conditions of which we know are not even remotely close to accurate but everyone seems content to play along with the joke  
Many pensions have now allocated as much as 20  of the fund to private equity  This is because they can control  to a degree  where the investments are marked and as long as the stock market does not decline  they never have to market them down  But with the example of the Dallas pension fund above  if the beneficiaries are allowed to withdraw all of their money  the fund will have to unload its illiquid private equity investments to meet the outflow requests  Good luck getting anything close to where those investments are marked in the fund  The beneficiaries won t receive anything close to the current stated value of their pension account 
If the status quo in the markets were to continue for the foreseeable future   which it won t   pensions funds will run out of cash to pay beneficiaries well in advance of the  foreseeable future   Without cutting benefits drastically or  in the case of public pension funds raising taxes steeply to cover pension beneficiary outflows  some public pensions will hit the wall within 12 24 months 
Away from private equity investing   which is just another of the many asset bubbles spawned by the Fed s near zero interest rate and money printing policy  by the way  the Fed  unbeknownst to many  is still printing money    Wall Street has been busy stuffing a plethora of high fee generating asset backed  investment  securities into the market  These securities exploit the need by pensions to generate much higher investment income  When you hear the term  reach for yield   think  pigs are greedy  hogs get slaughtered  These securities are hog food 
The only problem is that interest rates are so low now that the risk embedded in the underlying asset pools are much greater than the interest rate compensating the investor for buying these securities  Ratings agency fraud is also present again  This is another instance of the current period of financial insanity  rhyming  with the Wall Street fueled insanity that led to the 2008 financial collapse 
A perfect example is the latest  brain child  of Wall Street in which the payables from cell phone bills  the mobile carrier s receivables  are packed into pools and   Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  is the first to do a deal like this  It s receivables from cell phone bills were packaged into bonds  received a triple A rating and were priced at 55 basis points over the benchmark triple A corporate index  That means it was issued around a 2 67  yield 
Think about this way  would you lend money to a stranger to pay his cellphone bill in exchange for receiving the amount you loaned plus receive a 2 67  annualized rate of interest on the loan next month  There s a reason the bonds were priced at 55 basis points over standard triple A bond  If the implied reason were apparent to all  the bonds would be yielding substantially more  Eventually that reason will come to light and the bonds will tank in price 
The Dallas police and firemen had the right instinct  if you are eligible  contact your pension administrator and demand to receive any pension money that can claw out of fund now  Your alternative is to face substantial payment cuts at some point  Eventually your fund will collapse and you will otherwise receive nothing more than an  Oops  Our Bad  letter from your pension fund ",2016-09-22,David I.

216060,437576,VZ,Some Yahoo investors want to sell Internet business even if it triggers big tax bill ,news,"By Deborah M  Todd and Michael Flaherty  Reuters    Several major Yahoo  O YHOO  Inc shareholders are so concerned the company s core Internet business could fall in value that they want it sold as soon as possible   The shareholders said they would prefer that than wait for Yahoo to go through with its plan to seek a tax free spin off of the operation  which includes Yahoo s sports and news sites as well as its popular email service   Reuters reviewed a letter sent to the Yahoo board by one major shareholder and spoke to people with knowledge of the views of others with significant stakes  The investors argue that it would be better to take an additional tax hit now rather than owning shares in a spin off that may have lost significant value later  Yahoo s stock has fallen 36 percent over the last year  making investors nervous about the risk of a further big decline   Some are also concerned that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge the tax free status  which could leave shareholders with a big tax bill anyway  The IRS helped to kill off a previous Yahoo plan to spinoff its stake in Chinese ecommerce giant  Alibaba   N BABA  Group Holding Ltd by declining to issue a ruling endorsing its tax free nature  That would have left Yahoo vulnerable to an IRS challenge to the status at a later date   WROTE TO BOARD TWICE  The pressure on Yahoo s management and board has increased since November  when Starboard Value LP  which owned 0 75 percent of Yahoo as of Sept  30  making it the company s 23rd largest shareholder  called for the sale of the company s main business instead of the Alibaba spinoff   Yahoo in December abandoned plans to spin off the Alibaba stake and announced it would instead spinoff its other assets  including its stake in Yahoo Japan  into a new company  Now  that new strategy is also being questioned   Canyon Capital Advisors  the 30th largest shareholder  wrote to the Yahoo board twice in December and demanded that it explore an immediate sale of the company  according to a Dec  11 letter reviewed by Reuters  Canyon  with a 0 60 percent stake in the company as of Sept  30  said in one letter that a year is  too long to wait  for a spinoff   Mason Capital  Yahoo s seventh largest shareholder  is also pushing for an immediate sale  according to people familiar with the matter   Some shareholders have expressed doubts for much of the past year about whether CEO Marissa Mayer has a robust plan to revive the struggling Internet media business    I don t think the market s going to give any bump in value as long as the current management is in place   said Eric Jackson  managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management LLC  SpringOwl  which hasn t disclosed the size of its stake  has pushed for Mayer s removal   These investors criticize Mayer for what they say were a series of ineffective acquisitions and her inability to stem the continued decline in the value of the Internet media business as reasons to replace her  But some analysts have said it is unclear if anyone could have done a better job under the circumstances   Yahoo hasn t publicly responded to critics and declined to comment for this story   A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Mayer has the support of Yahoo s board and will be given time to carry out the spinoff   When the spinoff was announced  Mayer said the company was working on a plan to revitalize the core business that would be announced early this year  The company has yet to provide details of the plan  VERIZON INTEREST  A person familiar with Starboard s thinking said the activist hedge fund estimates the main operation could be worth around  5 billion to a strategic buyer  with a projected tax bill of around  1 billion  a hit it views as the cost of obtaining maximum value from the division   Another shareholder in the top 10  who did not want to be named  had a slightly lower estimate of the tax hit  of between  400 million and  800 million  depending on the sale price   SunTrust analyst Robert Peck said it would be possible to sell the business within  three to six months   Fran Shammo  the chief financial officer of U S  telecommunications company  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ   told a media conference in New York in early December that it could be interested  and analysts say media and private equity firms may be as well  Uncertainty about the tax status of a spinoff is weighing on the investors    Investors are far from convinced by management s interpretation of the law and the advice they ve been given   said Pivot Research analyst Brian Wieser   In September  the IRS said it will no longer issue so called  private letter  rulings to companies seeking guidance on the taxable nature of spinoffs before they happen  which means Yahoo will not know if the spinoff meets the criteria to be tax free until after it occurs   When asked specifically about Yahoo  IRS spokesman Dean J  Patterson said   Federal law prohibits the IRS from discussing specific taxpayers    The person familiar with Starboard s thinking says one disastrous scenario would see the value of the Internet business falling for a year while the company fails to get a clear tax ruling   
Another worry  the IRS challenges the spinoff  Yahoo appeals and has to make financial disclosures in court that hurt the stock  and a verdict isn t reached for at least another year  said Don Williamson of American University s Kogod Tax Center ",2016-01-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/some-yahoo-investors-want-to-sell-internet-business-even-if-it-triggers-big-tax-bill-378718,378718

Strong Dividend Growth
Telecom companies offer one of the highest dividend yields in the U S  economy  The dividend yield  measured as dividends paid by a company in the last 12 months relative to its share price  is currently around 5  for the telecom sector compared with a mere 2   approximately  for the benchmark S P 500 index

216075,437591,VZ,U S  Telecom  Pricing War  Regulatory Control Major Concerns,opinion,"Technological invention and innovation at a rapid pace have resulted in significant competition within the telecommunications industry  Product life cycle and upgrade cycle have gone down drastically with several firms coming out with new versions of products and services  back to back  within a short span of time  To combat competition  firms are thus increasingly looking at consolidation  This has resulted in an array of mergers and acquisitions in the telecom space 
To add to that  the Federal Communications Commission s  FCC  net neutrality laws have made matters worse for telecom operators  Besides  several ISPs  Internet Service Providers  are in a tight spot over the FCC s orders pertaining to increased upload and download speeds of Internet service termed  broadband  
Stiff Competition
In the meantime  the U S  telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition  The two industry behemoths  namely  Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    VZ  and AT T Inc  NYSE T    T   at present  command around 68  of the U S  wireless market whereas Sprint Corp   S  and T Mobile US Inc   TMUS  jointly control the remaining 32   These two relatively smaller firms are now bringing on board several low priced value added products to entice customers away from their larger peers  In 2015  both Sprint and T Mobile US added a substantial number to its customer base 
On the video services front  the pay TV industry is facing severe competitive threats from low cost online video streaming service providers  Cord cutting has become a regular phenomenon in the country with over the top video operators offering smaller packages of channels  designed according to a customer s need  at dirt cheap prices  Established pay TV operators are now opting for the more customer friendly Internet TV service in order to counter the threat 
Net Neutrality  A Major Concern
Net neutrality implies an open Internet atmosphere which will prohibit ISPs  especially telecom and cable TV operators  from discriminating against applications  In order to control the flow of bandwidth consuming applications such as video streaming  the ISPs have been discriminating against several web based content and applications  Content developers thus have to pay heavy sums to ISPs for accelerated data transfer 
Notably  the latest regulations will be applicable to both mobile and fixed broadband networks  The enforcement of the new law will ban common ISP malpractices such as data traffic blocking  slowing down data traffic and paid prioritization  Notably  paid prioritization is a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for quick and smooth transmission of their data traffic  The FCC will closely monitor and put a check on all such deals in the future  Moreover  the FCC will also supervise interconnection deals  in which content developers pay ISPs to connect to their networks 
Notably  on Jan 29  2015  the FCC increased the download and upload speeds of Internet services to be deemed as broadband  high speed data   In a majority voting  the FCC raised the new threshold download speed to 25 Mbps from the existing 4 Mbps while the same for upload has been boosted to 3 Mbps from the current 1 Mbps 
FCC to Control BDS Market Pricing 
The Business Data Services  BDS  market  where telecom and cable MSOs provide host of different network related services to business entities of different sizes  have been a lucrative source of revenues in the recent years for telecoms and cable MSO s  More significantly  these service providers have been making handsome revenues from the small and medium businesses by often charging them high price 
As per Consumer Federation of America  such trend has led to overcharging of services to the tune of  75 billion in the past five years  Consequently  the FCC has proposed rules to regulate pricing in the market  citing low competition   However  such proposals have been criticized by the industry players and several industry organizations 
WeaknessesIn general  telecommunications companies under pressure have high debt levels and large financial leverage ratios  Moreover  they are often unable to cope with recent market trends  Other risks that pose threats are as follows Potential Business Slowdown  Sales fluctuations of carriers are expected to continue to weigh on capital spending decisions    a major problem faced by equipment vendors  The companies are expected to retain focus on improving their balance sheets  financial discipline and free cash flow generation Product Overlapping  We may see more product sharing deals between telecom  cable TV and satellite TV operators as each of these players are vying to grab a sizeable share in each other s territory  Even pay TV services  offerings to business enterprises  mobile backhaul and metro Ethernet segments may observe more convergence  Mobile phone makers are now progressively offering tablets and chipset manufacturers are providing chips for personal computers as well as mobile devices   thus frequently interchanging their areas of operations Intensified Competition  Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition  Product life cycle and upgrade cycle have been reduced drastically as several firms are coming up with new products and services within a short span of time  Increasing competition is compelling players to offer heterogeneous and bundled services to retain their position in the space ",2016-09-07,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-telecom:-pricing-war,-regulatory-control-major-concerns-200152417",200152417

Barriers to Entry   The lack of public airwaves  spectrum  in the telecommunications industry creates a high barrier to entry  The U S  telecom market is controlled by just four national players  as regional low cost operators are not eligible to compete with large carriers  Furthermore  it is not easy for a new telecom carrier to establish itself in the market as it requires government approval to transmit voice  data  and video on public airwaves  Spectrum licenses are limited and are therefore quite expensive  Moreover  the deployment of network infrastructure requires significant capital expenditure  which very few entities can afford  Thus  this barrier protects the profits of incumbents in the telecom space 



Strong Demand   A recovering economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  Moreover  the FCC projects mobile data demand to grow 25 50 folds over the next five years

216095,437611,VZ,Dycom Industries  DY  Q4 Earnings  Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"After an incredible beat last quarter  Dycom Industries Inc    NYSE DY   followed up with another impressive beat in its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  The specialty contracting services provider reported adjusted earnings per share of  1 64 in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 56 by 5 1  
The bottom line figure was even more remarkable on a year over year basis  surging a whopping 69  compared with the year ago tally of 97 cents per share 
Robust top line growth drove earnings  while diligent operational initiatives undertaken by the company supported the bottom line 
For fiscal 2016  the posted adjusted earnings of  148 4 million   4 48 per share   up a massive 76  from the previous year figure of  84 3 million   2 41 per share  
Inside the Headlines
Dycom s fiscal fourth quarter contract revenues continued their strong momentum  and came in at  789 2 million  up 36 4  year over year  Also  the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  773 million  Contract revenues grew 20  on an organic basis  Acquisitions too  added  44 8 million in revenues  significantly supplementing the revenue stream 
Extensive deployment of 1 Gigabyte wireline networks by major customers and increasing rollout of fiber by cable operators in small and medium businesses boosted top line growth  Solid performance across the majority of business lines including engineering   design and aerial and underground construction services  and healthy inorganic growth also augmented revenues 
For the full year  Dycom reported contract revenues of  2 7 billion  up over 32  year over year  on the back of sturdy organic growth 
The company reported non GAAP adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  of  126 million for the quarter  compared with  88 5 million recorded a year ago 
The Goodman Networks Acquisition
During the reported quarter  Dycom acquired certain telecom related assets of Goodman Networks Incorporated for about  107 5 million in cash  It purchased certain assets and associated liabilities in Goodman s current wireline and wireless network deployment businesses 
Initially  Dycom projected the buyout to generate about  150  165 million in revenues over the next 12 months  by providing services like wireless network construction in Texas  Georgia  Southern California and other markets  This specialty contracting services provider also expected the EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  of the acquired business  as a percentage of revenue  to be roughly in line with its own ratio in fiscal 2018 
However  concurrent with the earnings release  Dycom announced that the recently acquired operations of Goodman Networks are now forecast to generate lower revenue in fiscal 2017 than initially projected  However  they are likely to produce higher EBITDA margins sooner  than anticipated earlier 
Liquidity
Dycom exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  33 8 million compared with  21 3 million as of Jul 25  2015  The company s long term debt was  706 2 million as of Jul 30  2016  compared with  516 9 million as of Jul 25  2015 
Guidance
Dycom issued guidance for first quarter fiscal 2017  wherein adjusted earnings per share are projected in the range of  1 55  1 70 on revenues within a range of  780  810 million 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings is currently pegged at  1 62 per share  within the company s guided range DYCOM INDS Price and Consensus
 

   Our Take
We believe Dycom s top line has benefited significantly from favorable industry trends over the past few quarters  which are driving client spending  Deployment of fiber to the home and fiber to the node technologies by major telecom operators to enable video offerings and 1 gigabit high speed connections are opening up considerable growth opportunities for the company 
Going forward  we believe that the significant investments in wireline networks  cable capacity projects and the ongoing Connect America Fund II project will help Dycom maintain its growth momentum 
Also  the company s diligent capital expenditure strategy has supplemented organic revenue improvement over the past 12 months  We also believe that investments made in assets will bolster operating efficiency  accelerating the delivery of backlogs  which in turn bodes well for long term growth 
This apart  Dycom has a highly concentrated client base  among which the biggest ones   i e  AT T  Inc    NYSE T    Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and Centurylink   contributed about 56  of revenues in fiscal 2015 
However  uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment  especially fluctuations in oil prices and unfavorable weather conditions  remain headwinds for the company As a matter of fact  pronounced seasonal impact from businesses acquired by the company in 2015 has hampered earnings significantly in the past  and could affect operations in the future as well

Verizon s Network Improvements Efforts
Verizon has been very active in expanding and improving its existing wireless networks  Recently  it acquired and installed dark fiber based network throughout its network in order to support the existing 4G LTE network and more importantly to transition into the upcoming 5G wireless network  Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G 
Additionally  Verizon seems to be far ahead of others in its plans to deploy 5G wireless network  The company achieved a milestone as it became the first company in the world to issue an initial radio specification for the upcoming 5G wireless network and is eyeing for a commercial deployment of the same by 2017 
The Bottom Line
While the RootMetric test is just one of many similar tests done by wireless research firms across the country  rankings of the wireless carriers vary significantly  However  the fact that Verizon still manages to be in the top tier of these rankings consistently is indicative of its wireless strength 
A strong network enables the carrier to maintain its churn rate while improving average revenue per user  ARPU  going forward  Notably  Verizon had a blended churn rate of 1 19   flat year over year VERIZON COMM Price

216103,437619,VZ,Is It Time To Buy Verizon ,opinion,"Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  has been on a shopping spree  It was recently announced the company is going to acquire Yahoo  s core assets for  4 8 billion 
The telecom giant also spent  2 4 billion on Fleetmatics Grup  NYSE FLTX  this months  and  1 8 billion more on XO Communications in February this year 
Judging from the pace with which Verizon is expanding its empire  one might think the company has a bright future ahead  This is probably true  but does it mean now is the right time to buy Verizon stock   Wait a while  says the  
 According to the theory  the direction of the trend could be identified by recognizing a five wave   As Verizon s weekly price chart shows  there is a clear impulsive rally from 21 56 in October 2008 to 56 95 in July 2016 
This means the trend is pointing up and Verizon s future could turn out to be very bright  indeed  However  this is not the time to buy the stock  because the Wave principle also postulates that every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction 
In Verizon s case  the above shown I II III IV V sequence is likely to give way to a significant A B C decline 
Prices could be expected to decline to the termination area of wave IV  which means a pullback to around 40 00 could be in the cards  In addition  the RSI indicator is showing the typical bearish divergence between waves III and V  which also suggests the bulls are exhausted 
In our opinion  Verizon stock is going to deserve a place in investors  portfolios  but not yet  At least a couple of years might have to pass  before it is worth buying again  There is a difference between a good company and a good stock  It is not always the same thing ",2016-08-19,EWM Interactive,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-has-a-bright-future,-but-200148913",200148913
216104,437620,VZ,Charter Into Top 3 Ethernet Providers  Surpasses Verizon,opinion,"As per data provided by the Vertical System Group s Mid Year 2016 U S  Carrier Ethernet Leaderboard  Charter Communications Inc    NYSE T   has surpassed Verizon as the third largest Ethernet carrier in the U S  The ranking is based upon the retail port share of each provider 
Notably  Charter is believed to have gained considerable synergy from its recent horizontally integrated merger with previously Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks  AT T Inc    NYSE T   and Level 3 Communications Inc    NYSE T   still occupy the top two positions per the report 
A Significant Jump
At the end of 2015  Charter lacked the necessary retail port share i e  greater than 4  to be listed in the leaderboard  However  Time Warner Cable was ranked fifth at that point of time  But after the recent mergers  Charter has gained access to a large base of fiber and hybrid fiber coax footprint  This has been instrumental in providing Ethernet service to many small and medium scale businesses  SMB  
Additionally  Charter can leverage Time Warner Cable s Ethernet footprint to provide services to large business enterprises as well  Charter saw an uptick in SMB related businesses in the second quarter of 2016 
Verizon Falls Behind
In recent times  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   has witnessed declining Ethernet Cable orders  with its customers opting for a switch to cable multi service operators  MSO  for the purpose  Additionally  Verizon sold its wireline assets in California  Florida and Texas to Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  Inc  This is likely to have impacted the figures considered for the ranking  However  Verizon is slated to introduce its  Titan  Ethernet program through which it intends to price its Ethernet cable offering aggressively to entice wholesale as well as retail customers and control churn 
At present  Verizon s fiber presence is restricted to certain locations  However  with the completion of the acquisition of XO Communications  fiber network next year  Verizon will look to intensify its Ethernet penetration in the future  thereby leveraging its Ethernet service offerings  This can take Verizon back to the lost position and even challenge the incumbent leaders  going forward 
The Bottom Line
The spotlight is now on the Ethernet market  with both telecom operators and cable MSOs vying for a reasonable share  As the industry gains further accretion  expanding its scope and makes way for higher Internet speeds  increasing competition is likely to induce price compression in the future  However  one thing is for sure   SMB s are going to be the ultimate beneficiaries of such a competition CHARTER COMM A Price

Yahoo first paid  1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba back in 2005  and sold half of that back to the company for  7 6 billion in September of 2012   In late July  Yahoo agreed to sell its core internet business to Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  for  4 8 billion  This leaves the company with its stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo  Japan

At the moment  Yahoo is operating as little more than a trading vehicle for Alibaba  The company had planned to spin off its stake in Alibaba  but is not due to uncertainty from the IRS as to whether or not it could be carried out on a tax free basis

216120,437636,VZ,Failed FT bid shows Axel Springer caught between tradition and ambition,news,"By Harro Ten Wolde and Klaus Lauer
FRANKFURT BERLIN  Reuters     Axel Springer  s  DE SPRGn  failure to clinch a deal to buy the Financial Times lengthens a line of setbacks in a decade old quest by Germany s biggest news publisher to expand abroad 
Once again  cautious bidding practices cost it the prize  revealing a complex dynamic within the family controlled company  which is best known for its Bild tabloid but which calls itself a digital powerhouse with international potential 
The last minute loss to Japan s Nikkei of a newspaper Axel Springer had coveted for years was clearly a blow to its management  but for some investors it was a relief  and not just in hindsight 
 Worse than not expanding internationally would be Springer overpaying for an asset   one top 10 investor told Reuters   In that respect  shareholders gave a clear signal last week  
Axel Springer shares dropped two percent on reports it was bidding for the FT  but recovered that loss and ended the day higher after the company said it would not buy it last Thursday 
Japan s Nikkei bought the premier business newspaper for  1 3 billion  1 18 billion euros  from  Pearson   L PSON   just 100 million euros more than Springer was prepared to spend  according to a person familiar with the talks  The company declined to comment 
Springer CEO Mathias Doepfner  a former journalist at Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and editor in chief at Die Welt  had long expressed the wish to buy a big English language title 
Two people familiar with the talks said ultimately  the price was too high for a company with a market capitalization of 5 billion euros  a conservative bidding strategy and aversion to debt 
Financial prudence has been key ever since Doepfner was appointed in 2002 by Friede Springer  widow of founder Axel who built the company in West Berlin soon after World War Two 
 Doepfner doesn t do anything he has not first calculated  so he was reluctant to counter the higher bid   one person familiar with the talks said 
FAMILY TIES
The 72 year old Friede is a hands on shareholder and vice chair of the supervisory board  who sees it as her task to protect the legacy of her late husband  according to German media  and is very close to Doepfner  Their relationship is described by some Axel Springer insiders as like mother and son 
In 2012  she gave Springer shares worth almost 74 million euros   82 million  to Doepfner  at the time 2 percent of all outstanding shares  Doepfner now owns 3 1 percent of the firm 
Friede s involvement dates back to the 1980s  when she inherited about a quarter of Axel Springer shares  The Springer family s former nanny who had become the publisher s fifth wife had to fight her corner with other  German media elite shareholders including mogul Leo Kirch and the Burda family 
After buying out other shareholders and taking control of the publisher  Friede vowed she would never put herself in such a position again  a former Axel Springer worker said 
When Doepfner took over  he had three key strategies  first bring the company back on track after years of internal unrest and operational setbacks  then make the transition from print to digital and after that expand internationally 
But flirtations with global media brands have so far remained just that 
Last year  Springer walked away from buying U S  publisher Forbes  which was sold to an Asian investor consortium in a deal that valued the prestigious company at  475 million 
A decade ago  it looked at British titles the Daily Telegraph or the Daily Express but soon backed out 
Earlier this month Springer was reported to be discussing
a possible tie up with German broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1  DE PSMGn   which is about twice the size of Axel Springer 
    But a day later Springer issued a statement saying Friede would not give up control  and on Wednesday  ProSiebenSat 1 and Axel Springer announced a project for digital start ups but said they had no further tie up plans 
Springer shares rose 1 5 percent and those of ProSiebenSat 1 were up 1 9 percent  outperforming a 0 2 percent weaker German midcap index  MDAXI  and very close to the high they hit when news of the tie up broke 
STILL ATTACHED TO NEWS
Instead of buying a trophy title  Axel Springer has taken stakes in financial blog Business Insider and U S  youth news site Mic com  and is a co owner of the European edition of Politico 
In the first quarter  such digital products  especially classified ads  accounted for more than 60 percent of company sales and almost three quarters of core profit 
Investors have rewarded the digital push with a 75 percent rise in the share price over the past five years  making Friede one of the richest people in Germany 
In May  news website Re code reported Axel Springer was in advanced discussions with AOL to spin off its flagship Huffington Post content unit  citing numerous sources 
AOL s new owner Verizon  N VZ  has since said it will not sell 
Axel Springer declined specific comment on its acquisition strategy but the statement on Friede s plans to retain control referred to a plan to transform into a so called KGaA or partnership limited by shares  which would allow Springer to raise more capital and grow while protecting Friede s position 
To proceed  it would need approval at next April s AGM 
An Axel Springer manager  who declined to be identified  said the price for the FT was too high but added such an asset only comes to market once in a few decades  For Nikkei it represented a chance to move beyond a flagging domestic market 
The  1 3 billion FT price tag represented roughly a 35 times multiple for its core earnings  That is three times more than the value of Axel Springer shares  which trade at 11 times earnings  broadly in line with publishing peers 
 Why on earth was Axel Springer management preparing to buy a trophy asset for a silly price    when it touts itself as investing in fast growing digital assets   brokerage Berenberg asked after Nikkei s winning bid was announced

216124,437640,VZ,SoftBank plans near  1 billion buyback as confidence in Sprint renewed,news,"By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO  Reuters    SoftBank Corp  T 9984  announced a near  1 billion share buyback and a higher quarterly profit as loss making Sprint Corp  N S  fared better than expected  with the Japanese telecoms group forecasting  light at the end of the tunnel  for its U S  unit 
The share buyback worth up to 120 billion yen   961 69 million  would be SoftBank s biggest ever if carried out in full  CEO Masayoshi Son attributed the surprise move to its lackluster share price and renewed confidence in Sprint which SoftBank bought for more than  20 billion in 2013 but has struggled to turn around 
 Repurchasing shares is an effective way of returning profit to shareholders  But it s also a message from management to markets  regarding the share price   he told reporters on Thursday   We ve now become fully confident  
SoftBank s April June operating profit rose to 343 6 billion yen from 319 4 billion a year ago  helped by the boost from Sprint and growth in smartphone customers at its domestic telecoms business  That was better than the 320 billion yen average of three analysts  estimates surveyed by Thomson Reuters 
Sprint on Tuesday reported a smaller than expected quarterly loss and lower churn  or defections  a rare sign of improvement for a carrier that has struggled to compete against larger rivals AT T  N T  and  Verizon Communications   N VZ  
Son had made a rare appearance on Sprint s conference call to say SoftBank had no plans to sell its stake in the wireless carrier  a commitment he reiterated on Thursday 
 There was a time when I lost confidence in managing Sprint   he said   Now I have no intention of selling  
SoftBank has used cash from its telecoms business to fund investments in global mobile and Internet businesses  and the Sprint buy was aimed at growth outside Japan s sluggish economy 
Son said the latest buyback did not signal a change to its acquisitive strategy  SoftBank is also the largest investor in Chinese e commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding  N BABA  
Jefferies estimates its 23 largest investments have delivered returns of 30 times with an average investment period of over 9 years  Excluding highly lucrative Alibaba  returns have been around 6 times 
SoftBank did not give a full year outlook  but the market s average forecast prior to Thursday s announcement was for an annual operating profit of 1 04 trillion yen 
Based on such views  SoftBank shares have lately been trading below 8 times forward earnings estimates  lagging multiples of over 10 for Japanese telecoms rivals KDDI Corp  T 9433  and NTT DoCoMo  T 9437   Analysts have said the comparatively low valuations were due to concerns about Sprint

216163,437679,VZ,June Jobs Report,opinion,"DOW   250   18 146SPX   32   2129NAS   79   495610 Y    02   1 37 OIL    05   45 19GOLD   4 80   1365 60
 S P just shy of intraday and closing record highs  going back to May 2015 
The Jobs Report for June showed the economy added 287 000 new jobs  and the unemployment rate rose to 4 9  in June from 4 7  as more people entered the labor force in search of work  The results topped consensus estimates around 175 000 
June payrolls were boosted by the return of 35 000 striking workers at Verizon  NYSE VZ   The May report was revised from 38 000 down to 11 000  April s gain was revised higher to 144 000 from 123 000  April and May revisions resulted in a net loss of 6 000 jobs compared to initial estimates 
Goldman analysts blamed the month to month discrepancy on weather  saying that during April and May  industries most affected by weather barely hired  Construction  leisure and hospitality and retail  added just 4 000 jobs compared to 113 000 in October through March  Construction hiring was again low in June 
Another consideration is seasonal adjustments based on the school year  In May  we saw a decline in the unemployment rate and a drop in labor force participation  The change suggested that unemployment was falling for  bad reasons   as discouraged workers gave up looking for work  Reinforcing that notion  the share of unemployed workers leaving the labor force spiked  on a seasonally adjusted basis 
The unadjusted data painted a different picture  When schools finish up in May  more students start looking for work  which adds people to the labor force  So normally  in data that aren t adjusted for seasonal fluctuations  fewer people drop out of the workforce from jobless rolls during the month 
That big slowdown in dropouts we usually see in May didn t happen this year  So when the normal seasonal adjustment was applied  it magnified the flows out of the labor force  That  in turn  helped push the unemployment rate down to 4 7 percent  even though the report only showed 11 000 new jobs created 
In June  however  the slowdown in labor force dropouts played out more fully  The unemployment rate jumped back 0 2 percentage point  while the participation rate rose 0 1 percentage point  and the economy added 287 000 new jobs 
The numbers in May and June were probably flukes  or outliers  So we can look at broader trends  The US added an average of 147 000 jobs in the past three months  Over the past six months the economy has averaged 172 000 net new jobs per month  Clearly the trend is down from an average of 230 000 per month in 2015  but that is to be expected at this point in the economic cycle 
Taking account of the growing numbers of retiring baby boomers and the population growth  a monthly gain of 75 000 to 100 000 jobs is sufficient to keep the unemployment rate steady  while a 125 000 monthly gain is what is required to nudge it down further 
The Labor Force Participation Rate increased in June to 62 7   up from May s 62 6 percent  close to its lowest level since the 1970s  The U 6 unemployment rate declined to 9 6   The U 6 rate includes the unemployed  the underemployed and the discouraged   people who have given up looking and are no longer counted in the headline number 
While the U 6 rate has made substantial gains in the past years  it remains stubbornly at pre recession levels  There are 1 97 million long term unemployed  that s more than 26 weeks   and that number is up from 1 88 million May  The number of part time workers who prefer full time jobs fell by nearly 600 000 
And the ranks of temporary workers increased by 15 000 after falling by 19 000 in May and posting meager gains in recent months  Employers often add such contingent workers before hiring permanent staffers  And even though more than 400 000 candidates jumped back into the labor market  the low labor force participation rate indicates there is still plenty of slack 
Leisure and hospitality added 59 000 jobs in June  following little employment change in the prior month  Job gains in leisure and hospitality have averaged 27 000 per month thus far this year  down from an average of 37 000 in 2015 
Health care and social assistance added 58 000 jobs in June  Employment in financial activities rose by 16 000 in June  Employment in information increased by 44 000 in June  Employment rose in telecommunications   28 000   largely reflecting the return of workers from the Verizon strike 
Employment in professional and business services continued to trend up in June   38 000   The industry has added an average of 30 000 jobs per month  compared with an average monthly gain of 52 000 in 2015 
Employment in retail trade edged up by 30 000 in June  after changing little over the prior 2 months  a positive sign for consumer spending  Retail trade has added 313 000 jobs over the year 
Employment in mining continued to trend down in June   6 000   Since reaching a peak in September 2014  mining has lost 211 000 jobs  Employment in other major industries  including construction  manufacturing  wholesale trade  transportation and warehousing  and government  showed little or no change in June 
Average hourly wages rose 2 cents to  25 61 in June  In June  the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was 34 4 hours for the fifth consecutive month  Hourly pay increased 2 6  in the 12 months to June 2016  matching the highest level of the recovery  that s good enough to outpace inflation  so wage gains mean more money in workers pockets  still the gains are not enough to raise concerns about wage push inflation 
More than a dozen cities and states raised wages this year  and those higher pay floors should cause a ripple of extra earnings for people making as much as 20 percent more than the minimum  For states like New York and California  which will increase wages to  15 an hour over the next few years  those benefits will extend to people making  18 an hour  Wage increases above the minimum wage are believed to be a response to what economists call  wage compression   which occurs when more senior employees are no longer better compensated than less senior employees 
Say you worked at a fast food restaurant in Washington  D C   at the old local minimum of  10 50  On July 1  your hourly wage increased to  11 50  That s great news for you  but the shift manager getting paid  12 an hour may not be overjoyed about your sudden good fortune  There is a hierarchy in wages  but anything above the minimum is discretionary  and that ripple effect only extends to about 20  of the wage scale  give or take 
Overall  only about 3 percent of workers are paid minimum wage  according to an analysis by the Brookings Institute  But nearly 30 percent of workers make less than 1 5 times the minimum wage  By that rough calculation  about 35 million workers could see raises if the minimum increased  The minimum wage does more than simply shift the wage distribution toward higher pay   it effectively compresses the lowest wages 
The end result is a reduction in wage inequality below the median wage   a little under  30 000 for individuals  Beyond that  the impact of increases in minimum wage don t seem to affect middle income and upper income workers 
Of course  the bigger debate about minimum wage is whether it will mean fewer jobs  the basic idea is that raising the price of anything reduces demand  But there are other factors that must be considered  When workers earn more there is less turnover and productivity increases 
Also  lower wage workers tend to spend almost everything they make  meaning the wages are circulated  increasing the velocity of the money  and stimulating the economy  The net effect is mildly positive  with a lag time 
One of the recurring complaints from employers is that they have a hard time finding skilled workers  Wages of high school dropouts are lower than they were at the turn of the century in real terms  The same goes for workers with a high school diploma  and also for workers who went to college but stopped short of a bachelor s degree  Although some of the hardest to fill jobs in the country don t require college degrees  chefs  butchers  bakers  mechanics and electricians  These jobs certainly require skills 
The most obvious solution would be to train workers for skills that are in demand  The problem is that we don t see much job training in the US  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  the United States government spends only 0 03 percent of its gross domestic product on worker training  well below budgets for other developed nations  Penny wise  pound foolish 
The Federal Reserve is back in the game  That s the simple message from the strong June jobs report  That said  don t expect a rate hike this month  The May jobs report appeared to spook the central bank and convinced investors the Fed would keep rates on hold all year  Though most Fed officials have continued to signal a desire to raise rates at least once in 2016  minutes from the Fed s June 14 15 meeting  released on Wednesday  showed the Federal Open Market Committee  generally agreed  they needed to see more data before contemplating another hike 
The Fed won t overreact to one strong report any more than it would to a single weak one  The Fed will almost certainly remain on hold at their next meeting on July 26 27  Prior to the report this morning  markets had priced in one rate hike through the end of 2018  now the CME Fedwatch calculates a 23  chance of a rate hike by December ",2016-07-10,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/june-jobs-report-200140900,200140900
216164,437680,VZ,Wireless Carriers Boosting Capacity For Election Conventions,opinion,"With U S  Presidential conventions right around the corner  all of the four leading wireless carriers of U S  viz  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   and Sprint Corp    NYSE S   have geared up anticipating the heavy traffic 
The Republican National Convention will take place in Cleveland from Jul 18 21 and the Democratic National Convention  DNC  in Philadelphia in Jul 25 28  Attendance of around 50 000 people is expected in both of these events 
Increasing Capacity
The planning for upgrading the capacity began months ago for these carriers and they have already boosted their network in the two cities mentioned above  For instance Verizon increased its capacity by 550  in the Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  Center which is the main venue for the DNC  It is during these types of high profile events that the wireless operators prepare for the utmost and use every type of resource to ensure a smooth functioning of its networks 
Most of the wireless operators use small cell technology to boost coverage near the venue  Some even use Wi Fi technology to ensure coverage inside the arenas where the event takes place 
Spill Over Benefits
While the carriers are busy managing their networks for the main event  their drive to improve capacity and max out the overall radio frequency is certainly going to help the areas which were previously shunned  Additionally  smaller venues like hotels  hospitals and universities are also going to get a major lift in terms of network coverage by virtue of this network capacity expansion drive 
The Bottom Line
As U S  prepares for the Presidential Race conventions  the wireless carriers will look for increased revenues from the data usage  Moreover  this is a major opportunity for the carriers to exhibit their capacity to handle network traffic efficiently which can act as a catalyst to attract more subscribers and business customers going forward 
Thus  it comes as no surprise as to why these carriers are leaving no stone unturned to enhance their capacity   However  will these increased investments help these telecom players in the long run  We leave it to time to answer that ",2016-07-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wireless-carriers-boosting-capacity-for-election-conventions-200141437,200141437

216177,437693,VZ,Can Nonfarm Payrolls Save USD JPY ,opinion,"By Kathy Lien  Managing Director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management 
 In less than 24 hours  the June nonfarm payrolls report will be released   Most economists and investors expect a strong recovery in job growth after last month s hauntingly weak print  With such a view  we would normally expect the dollar to be trading higher against the yen  But instead of rising  USD JPY fell for the fifth trading day in a row  The latest U S  economic reports were actually better than expected with ADP beating expectations and jobless claims rising less than anticipated  Treasury yields also rebounded  which should have sparked a rally in USD JPY  But the theme of the day was  risk aversion  and the currency pair fell victim to liquidation of all low yielding currencies  Everyone is now left wondering whether Friday s nonfarm payrolls will be strong enough to take USD JPY back to 102 
To answer that question we start by taking a look at how the leading indicators for nonfarm payrolls stack up 
Arguments In Favor Of Stronger Payrolls 

End of Verizon  NYSE VZ  Strike adds 35K jobs
ADP Reports 172K Rise in Payrolls vs  168K Previous Months
Sharp Rise in Employment Component of ISM Non Manufacturing
Jobless Claims at Lowest Level Since April
Continuing Claims Drop
Employment Component of ISM Manufacturing Returns to Expansion
Consumer Confidence Index Hits 8 month Highs

Arguments in Favor of Weaker Payrolls

Challenger Reports Smaller Decline in Layoffs
University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index Declines

 As you can see  the arguments for a rebound in job growth far exceed the arguments for deterioration  Of course  if payrolls grew by less than 38K in June  the U S  economy and the U S  dollar would be in big trouble and the 180K forecast fully accounts for the improvements suggested by the above reports  So for USD JPY to have a positive response to NFP  we would need to see payrolls rise by 200K or more AND see average hourly earnings growth hold steady or exceed 0 2   Given the magnitude of last month s disappointment  that s a lot to ask  However in order for any recovery to be sustained  we need to see payrolls rise by 250K or more  Otherwise the reversal post data will be quick and aggressive   
 Looking beyond nonfarm payrolls  we expect USD JPY to find a bottom above 100   The strong yen is a big problem for Japan  especially in light of Chinese devaluation  The Bank of Japan meets at the end of the month and is under significant pressure to ease  Unlike U S  stocks  which are still trading near their highs  the Nikkei is down 20  year to date  Knowing that easing alone will have a limited effect on the economy  we would not be surprised by a combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus  Desperate times call for desperate measures and that is exactly what Japan needs at this time   
 Meanwhile  the market remains laser focused on the British pound  which traded as high as 1 3047 before dropping below 1 2900  Better than expected U K  economic data helped to send the currency higher but as the U K  political landscape continued to dissolve  sterling gave up all of its gains  It did not matter that house prices increased sharply in June or that industrial production dropped  0 5  instead of  1  because none of these reports reflect the state of the economy post Brexit  It will be another month or two and possibly even three before we see how much damage was done to the economy  In the meantime  there is no support until the June 1985 low of 1 2565  U K  trade numbers are scheduled for release Friday but we are far more interested in the Gfk s post referendum consumer confidence report   
 The euro spent most of Thursday below 1 1100 as evidence of trouble in Italy s banking sector grows   On Wednesday we pointed out that Italian bank stocks have fallen 30  in the last 2 weeks and according to a recent report from the WSJ  17  of bank loans in Italy are bad debt  which is 3 times more than what the U S  had during the financial crisis  It s a ticking time bomb ready to go off  In order to avoid this scenario or shore up the economy when it happens  the Italian government will either have to inject money into the financial system or the ECB will need to ease monetary conditions  German industrial production was also significantly weaker than expected  adding pressure on the currency   
 Aside from the U S   Canada will also release its employment report on Friday   Economists are looking for softer numbers but the sharp rise in the employment component of Thursday s IVEY PMI report suggests that the risk is to the upside  Manufacturing activity returned to expansion in June but investors ignored the report  choosing instead to take their cue from oil  which dropped close to 5  on the back of a smaller decline in inventories  Technically  USD CAD appears poised for further gains but the path of the currency will be dictated exclusively by Friday s U S  and Canadian employment reports   
 The New Zealand dollar was Thursday s best performing currency thanks to comments from RBNZ official Grant Spencer  who warned that further cuts in New Zealand s OCR would lead to financial instability  This signaled a lower chance of rate cuts come August  In efforts to cool the heated housing market  officials are considering an increase in Loan to Value Ratios to curb investor demand and bolster bank balance sheets in case of a downturn in the housing market  In contrast  the Australian dollar was hit hard by S P s decision to downgrade the country s sovereign debt rating  The greatest losses were seen against NZD whereas AUD USD held up well thanks to yield and carry ",2016-07-07,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-nonfarm-payrolls-save-usd-jpy-200140609,200140609

216179,437695,VZ,NFP Expected To Bounce Back,opinion,"UK leadership contest narrows
The 1 30 level s proven to be a tough nut to crack in GBP USD with so much negative newsflow still circulating for the pound  Despite the narrowing of the Conservative party leadership contest  we ll still be without a dedicated leader until at least early September  so expect another protracted period of political campaigns  soundbites and vox pops where much attention is paid to the battle of Andrea Leadsom and Theresa May and little attention is paid to what is actually going on in Westminster 
Markets will closely watch the debate between the two prospective leaders  particularly as they outline what their approaches would be at the negotiating table with the European Union and how the UK will  or will not  access the Single Market  Second only to monetary policy  this is one of the most important factors for UK markets right now 
UK trade balance data close to irrelevant
Today s UK trade figures are expected to show the UK remained in a sharp trade deficit with both the European Union and those states outside the EU  This data will become increasingly relevant as the months go by  but this won t start today as the figures encapsulate May s pre referendum trade numbers 
While sterling remains weak  UK goods and services being sold overseas will become some of the most competitive in the global marketplace  and trade balance data will be one of the first pieces of evidence that could show this effect 
Nonfarm Payrolls expected to bounce back
After creating a mere 38 000 jobs in May  the lowest level of jobs growth since September 2010  where the US actually lost 52 000 jobs   the US is expected to bounce back this month by adding 180 000 jobs as one off effects including a strike at telecoms giant Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  roll off and push the headline figure higher 
If these one off factors are ruled out  it still shows the US jobs market ticking higher at a far slower rate than the past five years  where jobs growth averaged over 200 000 per month  These figures should prove troubling for the Federal Reserve who continue to appear keen to wean the US economy off record low interest rates despite the economy actually decelerating ",2016-07-08,Jeremy Cook,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-nonfarm-payrolls-expected-to-bounceback,-but-underlying-jobs-growth-200140694",200140694

It s been a typically quiet pre NFP night with most of the majors tracing out very narrow ranges as markets await the marquee release of the week 
On the eco front the calendar in both Asia and Europe has been relatively light with only UK Trade data and German Current Account reports on the docket  UK Trade was slightly better coming in at  9 8B versus  10 7B eyed  The data did not reflect the recent GBP depreciation and may in fact improve in Q3 as exports will likely get a boost and imports will no doubt decline 
Cable however showed no reaction the news and remains near the 1 2900 figure after yesterday s short covering rally to 1 3000 failed to hold once again  Cable is likely to remain in its 1 2800 1 3000 range until the market gets some clarity on UK political situation and most the economic data will be roundly ignored for the time being 
Meanwhile USD JPY continues to drift lower and is now only 60 points away from the psychologically important 100 00 level  The pair has been sliding despite generally upbeat US economic data and it is not at all clear if today s NFP report will change the dynamic 
The market anticipates that NFPs will print at 180K versus only 38K the month prior  Given the improvement in employment component of ISM Services and the ADP report  chances are good that NFPs should rebound  The end of the Verizon  NYSE VZ  strike alone will be responsible for a net 70K swing in the positive direction  But with sentiment toward USD JPY so skewed to the downside the pair may very well pop on any upside surprise only to give up its gains as the day proceeds especially if stocks turn negative  The only unambiguously dollar bullish sign would be a strong rise in average weekly earnings  which could prompt the Fed to reconsider its inflation expectations 
However  a report within the forecast range may not reverse the current FX flows and USD JPY could test the 100 00 level despite the rebound in jobs as shorts press their advantage ",2016-07-08,Boris Schlossberg,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usd-jpy-to-100.00-despite-better-nfps-200140713,200140713

Businesses must be vigilant in maintaining security to remain compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  PCI DSS   required by payment card issuers  Most of the companies have a tendency to run upgrades of security software and hardware only when they approach an annual compliance check  according to Verizon

216203,437719,VZ,U S  government unveils goal to move Medicare away from fee for service,news,"By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Obama administration on Monday unveiled an ambitious plan to control health costs by moving the  2 9 trillion U S  health systems away from costly fee for service medicine  beginning with the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled  By the end of 2018  Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters that 50 percent of traditional Medicare s  362 billion in annual payments would go to doctors  hospitals and other providers that participate in alternative payment models which emphasize cost containment and quality of care  Officials  who hope to see the initiative matched by private insurers  employers and state Medicaid programs for the poor  said the move was intended to head off a resurgence in healthcare cost growth from an historically low 3 6 percent in 2013 to a projected 6 6 percent in 2020  The administration announced its goals after Burwell met with private and public sector stakeholders including insurers  consumer and provider groups and employers Boeing Co and Verizon Communications Inc   Wall Street analysts said for profit hospitals and private insurers would be well positioned to benefit from a new shift toward lower cost care delivery   Groups representing doctors and hospitals said the move could mean greater flexibility for their members in determining care delivery  while consumer representatives said the unprecedented goals could boost the quality of care  About 20 percent of traditional Medicare payments  a sum worth  72 billion  currently go to providers with cost saving business models  The remainder are based on fee for service payments that reward providers for the volume of care they provide  Fee for service has been blamed by policymakers for promoting higher costs  mediocre care and unnecessary procedures  The administration s goals would be phased in by first increasing the participation of alternative care models to 30 percent of Medicare payments by the end of 2016   Officials described the 50 percent goal for 2018 as a  tipping point  that could help make payment reform mainstream across the U S  health system   Within four years  the administration expects all but 10 percent of traditional Medicare to be linked to new quality and efficiency standards  including most of the remaining fee for  service providers  
The government has also been experimenting with payment models that officials say have generated  417 million in savings to Medicare  But the effort could face long odds  New care models have shown limited progress in controlling costs and little evidence of being able to sustain cost savings ",2015-01-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-government-unveils-goal-to-move-medicare-away-from-fee-for-service-325132,325132

216207,437723,VZ,Verizon  VZ  Wireline Workers Return To Work In Full Force,opinion,The wireline division of Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is again operating in full swing as the strike called by members of the two workers  unions has officially come to an end on Jun 17  2016   Nearly 36 500 workers of the company s wireline and cable TV  FiOS Internet and TV  segment went to strike since Apr 13  2016 On May 31  Verizon and the striking unions  The Communications Workers of America  CWA  and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  IBEW   entered into a tentative deal following which all striking workers resumed work from Jun 1  However  union members were given a deadline of Jun 17 to vote on the tentative contract  Accordingly  the members of both unions voted and ratified the tentative agreement Verizon and its wireline workers were at a stalemate over a labor contract  The company s wireline employees were working out of contract since last August  In May 2016  the U S  Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez met with the Verizon CEO and the heads of the two unions that represent the company s striking workforce  Perez requested both sides to sit at the negotiation table to resolve the issues The New ContractUnder the new contract  Verizon will provide a 10 9  pay hike to its unionized workers over a period of four years  a small increment in pension benefit and a promise to create nearly 1 400 new union jobs  This will include around 1 300 new call center jobs and about 70 wireless retail store jobs  Importantly  the company agreed to reduce subcontracting and withdrew a proposal to relocate employees for extended periods  These two were the main issues of the strike  The new contract is valid up to Aug 3  2019 Pros and ConsThough Verizon had to make certain concessions  it stood to gain on some points  The company will be able to reduce benefit costs by modifying employee health care plans  Verizon stated that it will achieve cost savings through healthcare plan design changes  adopting Medicare Advantage plans for its retirees  maintaining limits on post retirement healthcare costs  and freezing the mortality table for lump sum pensions using the GATT rate Verizon s CEO had earlier warned that the company s second quarter 2016 financial results may be affected by the strike  Lowell McAdam had stated that the company is currently on track with respect to repairing and maintenance issues of the existing installed bases  However  the number of new installations of FiOS high speed Internet and FiOS pay TV has dropped significantly   As a result  the company may suffer high speed broadband and pay TV customer attrition  In 2015  FiOS generated 29  of Verizon s total revenue and slightly less than 7  of operating income Verizon is already facing severe competitive threat from its telecom rivals  AT T Inc    NYSE T    T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   and Sprint Corp    NYSE S    Therefore  a solution to the labor problem will definitely be a tailwind to its near term growth  Verizon currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  VERIZON COMM Price  ,2016-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-(vz)-wireline-workers-return-to-work-in-full-force-200137079,200137079
216208,437724,VZ,LeEco Purchases Yahoo s Santa Clara Real Estate For  250M,opinion,"With its core business and patents already up for sale  what good does it do to hold on to an undeveloped site  Probably that s why Yahoo  Inc    NASDAQ YHOO   just sold its Santa Clara  CA based real estate property to Chinese technology company LeEco 
LeEco has reportedly acquired the 48 6 acre development site for  250 million  Yahoo is said to have bought this property back in 2006 for  106 million  The pre tax profit from the current sale therefore stands at  144 million 
Yahoo had planned to build a massive R D site but failed to achieve its vision  The site was approved for building up to 3 million square feet across 13 buildings but stayed undeveloped for the last 10 years 
Under the prevailing circumstances  where Yahoo itself is up for sale  the property sale will surely help the company with liquidity 
The once leading Internet giant has been struggling with its core businesses    namely mail service  online sports  financial and general news sections and its vital online advertising technology  which includes the video advertising platform  BrightRoll 
It has been losing its digital advertising foothold to competitors like Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   and Twitter  Inc    NYSE TWTR   YAHOO  INC Price
    
Currently the company is looking to sell itself to the highest bidder after CEO Marissa Mayer s unsuccessful turnaround efforts and mounting pressure from investors 
After two rounds of bidding  the third and final round is expected to be finished by mid July  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc  NYSE T    are likely the leading bidders in the third round 
The company has also put about 3000 patents  related to its original search technology  e commerce and online advertising  up for sale as well 
So much for Yahoo  Now let s see what LeEco is in for 
It appears that LeEco has the same plan for the site as Yahoo had  We think that the acquisition will help LeEco boost its R D operations  especially when it is looking to launch a video streaming service and a smartphone in the U S  later this year 
The company offers a wide range of products that include mobile phones  smartphones  tablets  smart home devices  Internet TV and Internet linked electric cars 
Currently  Yahoo is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock ",2016-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/leeco-purchases-yahoo's-santa-clara-real-estate-for-$250m-200137060,200137060

216235,437751,VZ,Jobs Report Changes The Landscape For Gold,opinion,"Gold soars as chances for a Fed rate hike this month evaporate  Brien Lundin  editor of Gold Newsletter  details what that means for investors 
Perhaps the lesson is this  Don t count gold out 
Last week  I was expecting another thrust downward for gold  with the metal losing perhaps another  35  60 to the  1 150  1 175 range 
Instead  the metal soared  32 on Friday  thanks to the stunning miss on the May nonfarm payrolls report 

Against the consensus expectation of 158 000 jobs being created in May  the report showed just 38 000 jobs a shocking miss to the downside 
Rubbing salt in the wound was the fact that revisions to the April and March reports slashed another 59 000 jobs  The three month average thus fell to just 116 000  a major deceleration from the monthly average of 219 000 jobs for the previous 12 months 
The headline unemployment rate fell to 4 7  from 5 0   but that was solely due to 458 000 people leaving the workforce 
A 180  Turn in Expectations
Prior to Friday s jobs number  the market had finally begun to believe the Federal Reserve governors who had been universally pleading that   Really     this time we mean it  We re going to hike rates this month or the next  
While the odds of a June rate hike were still rather low at around 21  as judged by Fed fund futures  those odds immediately collapsed to only around 4  after the release of the May jobs number 
The odds of a July hike similarly collapsed  from 64  to just below 30  
In other words  investor expectations made a 180  turn  from Fed tightening to  potentially  monetary accommodation if the employment data continue to point toward an economic slowdown 
I had been guilty of buying into the idea that the Fed was going to tighten soon  While the economic data had been mixed  the FOMC desperately wanted to get some breathing room above zero  and the impending election would soon close the window of opportunity to raise rates 
Still  while I expected rate hikes  I warned that gold  has proven naysayers wrong time and again this year  I wouldn t be surprised to see it rebound from here  
My point is that gold has been performing in a bull market manner  Instead of looking for excuses to sell the metal as we saw from 2011 2014  investors are interpreting new developments as reasons to buy gold 
And it s hard to imagine a piece of news more dramatically bullish for gold than the disastrous May jobs number 
Where we once thought the Fed would be tightening  it s now obvious that we are in a dramatically new environment     for investors  a new world entirely     than that of last week 
There is  of course  the chance that the May payrolls report is an outlier  and many have pointed to last month s Verizon  NYSE VZ  strike as being a one time mitigating factor  But 38 000 jobs was such a massive miss  even accounting for the Verizon situation  that it seems almost certainly indicative of serious employment weakness 
Add in the downside revisions for the prior two months  and the argument for at least some sector based recessions in the U S  economy seems very convincing 
Yes  a different world than that of last week  when a Fed rate hike was looming over the markets  gold bugs expected the metal to lose another  50 or so  and we were eagerly awaiting a clearance sale on gold and silver companies with established resources 
If the new perception indeed represents the reality of the U S  economy and I think it does then we ll need to start looking further down the food chain  into the drill plays  for the greatest upside potential 
One would expect that a move like last Friday s would need some time to consolidate  and even a small correction would not be surprising 
That said  the decline in job creation  as marked by not only the May number but also the downward revisions to the previous two months  completely changes the outlook for the U S  economy going forward 
It s a different world than what we were expecting just last week  and we need to be ready for it by owning gold  silver and well positioned junior mining exploration stocks

On Wednesday  the Fed released the Beige Book  which once again painted a picture of a modest or moderately expanding economy 
Information received from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts mostly described modest economic growth since the last Beige Book report  Economic activity in April through mid May increased at a moderate pace in the San Francisco District  while modest growth was reported by Philadelphia  Cleveland  Atlanta  Chicago  St  Louis  and Minneapolis  Chicago noted that the pace of growth slowed  as did Kansas City  Dallas reported that economic activity grew marginally  while New York characterized activity as generally flat since the last report  Several Districts noted that contacts had generally optimistic outlooks  with firms expecting growth either to continue at its current pace or to increase 
Consumer spending was up modestly on balance in many Districts  though contacts in the Boston  Cleveland  Minneapolis  and Dallas Districts reported mixed or flat activity  and New York reported weakened sales  Many Districts reported modest growth in nonfinancial services  Manufacturing activity was mixed across Districts  Construction and real estate activity generally expanded since the last report  and the overall outlook among contacts in these industries remained positive  Overall loan demand was up moderately in all but one of the Districts that reported it  and many Districts reported steady to good credit availability  Crop conditions were promising in many Districts  but low commodity prices continued to put pressure on agricultural incomes  The energy sector remained weak  Employment grew modestly since the last report  but tight labor markets were widely noted  wages grew modestly  and price pressure grew slightly in most Districts 
The first paragraph provides an overview of each Fed district with the majority reporting a positive economic environment  Four districts    Chicago  Kansas City  Dallas and NY    reported slightly weaker growth  but none are in dire shape  The second paragraph contains an overview of each GDP component  again  all show modest increases  There were a few cautionary remarks  several districts saw somewhat weaker consumer sales  while manufacturing was mixed  But  on balance  the various economic sectors point to a continued modest expansion 
Price and unemployment claims also support the hawks  On Tuesday  the BEA released the latest person income figures 
The April PCE price index increased 1 1 percent from April a year ago  The April PCE price index  excluding food and energy  increased 1 6 percent from April a year ago  
Price increases are approaching the Fed s 2  target  And on Thursday  the Department of Labor reported initial claims for unemployment dropped a third consecutive week  this time to 267 000  Several weeks ago  this number increased to just shy of 300 000  which caused some analysts to issue cautionary comments  It s likely the recently settled Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  strike had a disproportionate impact on the number  But the now lower number clearly supports the hawks 
And then we come to Friday s jobs report  with a 38 000 headline number   a very large miss  Both manufacturing and service sector growth showed sharp declines  The previous two months were lowered by a combined 59 000  And while the unemployment rate declined to 4 7   people leaving the labor force were the primary reason for the decline  There was nothing good in the report  In fact  it was so negative that a June rate hike is probably off the table ",2016-06-05,Hale Stewart,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-bond-market-week-in-review:-the-hawks-get-silenced-200134044,200134044
216244,437760,VZ,Sprint Presents 5G Capability At Copa America Centenario,opinion,U S  national wireless carrier  Sprint Corp    NYSE S   unveiled its 5G technology at a Copa America event in Santa Clara  CA  The company exhibited live streaming of videos in 4K resolution with very low latency  The company is working with Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corporation and Ericsson  ST ERICAs  for testing its 5G network  Sprint s telecom rivals  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T   and T Mobile US   NYSE T    all had initiated 5G testing earlier The 5G Advantage Several industry researchers hold that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second   which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than other standard wireless networks available these days  Therefore  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts  Additionally  superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing exponential growth of Internet connected devices  popularly known as Internet of Things  IoT  Advantages for SprintSprint has been losing customers lately and is trying every means to control churn to keep up with the competition  In this regard  the company has been continually making efforts to lure customers from rival carriers through offering attractive promotional plans  This has led to a high cash burn rate and heavy losses for the company over several years  Notably  Sprint refrained from taking part in the ongoing 600 MHz low band spectrum auction  popularly known as Incentive Auction   conducted by the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC   due to a shortage of funds Although several industry researchers do not expect a full fledged 5G network deployment to start until 2020  Sprint s rival  Verizon projects some level of commercial deployment in 2017  Given the stiff competition in the telecom space  Sprint s efforts on making its mark among the industry leaders  and actively researching and demonstrating its 5G capabilities have been commendable  However  only time can tell whether Sprint will be able to deploy the technology effectively before its peers and benefit from being the first player in this market ,2016-06-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sprint-presents-5g-capability-at-copa-america-centenario-200134219,200134219
216245,437761,VZ,EUR USD  Target Raised To 1 1490  Profit Locked In At 1 1240,opinion,"EUR USD  Target Raised To 1 1490  Profit Locked In At 1 1240
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38k jobs last month  the smallest gain since September 2010  Employment gains were also restrained by a month long strike by Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  workers  which depressed information sector payrolls by 34k jobs  Underscoring the report s weakness  employers hired 59k fewer workers in March and April than previously reported  While the unemployment rate fell three tenths of a percentage point to 4 7  in May  the lowest level since November 2007  that was because 458k Americans gave up the search for work 
The weakness in the May employment data was broad based  The private sector added only 25k jobs  the smallest number since February 2010  Manufacturing employment fell by 10k jobs and construction payrolls dropped by 15k  the most since December 2013  Mining employment maintained its downward trend  shedding 10k positions  Mining payrolls have dropped by 207k since peaking in September 2014  with three quarters of the losses in support activities  Retail payrolls rose 11 400 after losing jobs in April for the first time since December 2014  Wholesale trade employment fell by 10 300 jobs  Temporary help jobs  a harbinger for future hiring  dropped by 21k  There were declines in utilities and transportation and warehousing employment  Government payrolls increased by 13k and healthcare jobs jumped by 55k 
The Fed has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continue and economic data remain consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter  The US economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than five and a half years in May  which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June 
Financial markets largely priced out a rate increase at the Fed s June 14 15 policy meeting after Friday s data  The chance of an increase in July fell to 37  from about 59  late on Thursday  
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the US labor market may be slowing and the economy is still too fragile for a rate hike  Brainard s remarks may not shift the immediate debate ahead of the Fed s upcoming June meeting  Expectations were already low for rate hike at that session because it falls a week before a British vote on whether to leave the European Union  an event Brainard cited alongside her other Fed colleagues as a risk they d rather have behind them before raising rates 
On the other hand  Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said the latest disappointing US jobs number has not changed the overall economic picture and gradual rate hikes remain appropriate  
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren gave the latest hint that while the US central bank remains on track to continue tightening policy it likely will not do so at a June 14 15 meeting  Rosengren said the jobs data contrasted with a strong pick up in US spending and growth in the second quarter  so  it will be important to see whether the weakness in this report is an anomaly or reflects a broader slowing in labor markets  
The Commerce Department said on Friday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1 9   the largest increase since October  suggesting the sector was starting to stabilize  March s orders were revised to show a 1 7  increase instead of the previously reported 1 5  gain 
These so called core capital goods are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans on equipment  Core capital goods shipments  which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report  rose 0 4  in April rather than the 0 3  gain reported last month 
Inventories of factory goods dipped 0 1   suggesting factories were making progress in reducing the inventory bloat  That could support future production at factories  The inventories to shipments ratio fell to 1 36 in April  down from 1 37 in March  Unfilled orders at factories increased 0 6   while shipments of manufactured goods rose 0 5  
The Commerce Department said also the trade gap rose to USD 37 4 billion in April  March s trade deficit was revised down to USD 35 5 billion  which was the smallest since December 2013  from the previously reported USD 40 4 billion  The trade deficit for April was smaller than the monthly average for the first quarter  suggesting trade will probably contribute to gross domestic product in the April June period  Trade has been a drag on GDP growth over the last three quarters 
The USD languished at more than three week lows against a basket of major currencies on Monday after a strongly disappointing employment report prompted investors to rule out the chance of a hike in US interest rates this month 
In our opinion Federal Chair Janet Yellen  who is due to speak on economic outlook and monetary policy to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 16 30 GMT  will craft her message to keep expectations for a July hike alive 
Our EUR USD long is in good shape after weaker than expected US jobs report  However  today s speech of Janet Yellen is an important risk factor  That is why we have locked in profit in the speculative part of our portfolio at 1 1240  On the other hand  dovish Yellen may trigger another jump in the EUR USD and we have raised the target on short term position to 1 1490  We keep bullish EUR USD outlook in the long term part of the portfolio   here we have raised the target to 1 1650 
  USD CAD  Loonie Stronger Against Dollar But Weaker Against Euro
The CAD strengthened to a one week high against its broadly weaker USD on Friday after a slowdown in US jobs growth lowered chances of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve  offsetting disappointing domestic data 
Investors also weighed the impact on Canada s economy if growth in its biggest trading partner falters  The implied probability of a Bank of Canada interest rate cut this year jumped to more than 50  from less than 30  before the US jobs data  overnight index swaps showed  However  the gap between the yield on Canada s 2 year bond and the comparable US Treasury narrowed  as US yields fell more sharply than Canada s  That is why the CAD appreciated against the USD  but is weaker against the EUR 
Canada s trade deficit in April narrowed to CAD 2 94 billion from a record CAD 3 18 billion in March as exports grew at a slightly faster rate than imports  Exports rose by 1 5  overall as oil prices recovered slightly and the United States imported more natural gas  Exports of industrial machinery  equipment and parts jumped by 10 5  to hit a 15 year high  Imports increased by 0 9  on higher imports of aircraft and other transportation equipment 
We keep bearish USD CAD outlook  The nearest important support is the area from 1 2911  low May 10  to 1 2916  low June 3  
FOREX   MAJOR PAIRS  
It is usually reasonable to divide your portfolio into two parts  the core investment part and the satellite speculative part  The core part is the one you would want to make profit with in the long term thanks to the long term trend in price changes  Such an approach is a clear investment as you are bound to keep your position opened for a considerable amount of time in order to realize the profit  The speculative part is quite the contrary  You would open a speculative position with short term gains in your mind and with the awareness that even though potentially more profitable than investments  speculation is also way more risky  In typical circumstances investments should account for 60 90  of your portfolio  the rest being speculative positions  This way  you may enjoy a possibly higher rate of return than in the case of putting all of your money into investment positions and at the same time you may not have to be afraid of severe losses in the short term

216248,437764,VZ,S P 500 Futures  38 000 Jobs Flunk A Dunk,opinion,"We knew there was going to be a big drop in the May non farm payroll number due to over 40k people out of work because of the Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  strike  and when the 7 30 CT number was released showing only 38 000 jobs created  the S P futures dropped  and then dropped again after the 8 30 futures open  The number sent shock waves all over the place  but the two places it really showed up in were the Japanese yen  which rallied 2 1   and the CBOT s 30 year bond futures  ZBU6 CBT   which traded all the way up to 166 28  up two full handles  The 1 74 million ES contracts traded was an uptick in the daily volume  but still not overly large when you consider the big move down and the big move back up late in the day  Throughout the day  the yen and bonds maintained their rally  but the S P 500 futures found an early first hour low and began to climb throughout the midday into the afternoon  Going into the close  the ES was once again tagging the 2100 level before closing just off the highs on a MOC imbalance of over  1 Billion to buy  making it  1 Billion  to buy in three of the last five MOC days 
Thinking You Know Better
I have been preaching about becoming more patient  and on Friday instead of paying attention to the ESM16 trading range  I bought too early  I knew the Twitter  bears  were out calling for blood  but by the time the ES actually rallied I had tried to buy the futures 3 different times  with the final trade being stopped out at 2083 50  three ticks off the low of the day  It happens like that when you think you know better than the markets  They have a way of  feeling  out bad trading decisions  and most of the time  like Friday   the markets will go back the other way  It s just a question of how much you are willing to risk 
It s become obvious that until the market shows a different hand the tape clearly favors dip buyers  Sure  2100 has been resistance  but the inability of sellers to capitalize on this resistance and maintain a push lower is telling  Last year the S P futures spent a lot of time crossing back and forth through 2100  Heading into this summer  it feels that one of these time the S P is going to bounce above  stay above  build a floor there and start to target many of those upside buy stops 
Overnight  markets in Asia and Europe rallied modestly helping the S P 500 futures maintain a sideways bid on low volume at 6 30 am cst  The ESM16 traded up to 2102 75 early in the European session  up 8 75 handles from the early 2094 globex low  and is currently just trading two handles off that high  Today s calendar features Janet Yellen speaking in the afternoon which could lead to some volatility  otherwise  it looks to be a  Mutual Fund Monday  with a low volume grind higher  Levels to watch are the 2095   2094 globex low area  then Friday afternoons 2091 50 low  Pullbacks to these areas look like good buying opportunities  To the upside  bulls need to push above Friday s globex high today  making a higher high

216252,437768,VZ,U S  sues AT T over alleged  data throttling  on phone plans,news,"By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  government sued AT T Inc  N T  on Tuesday  alleging the No  2 U S  wireless carrier sold consumers unlimited data plans but would reduce their Internet speeds once they exceeded a certain amount of data 
The Federal Trade Commission said this throttling of Internet feeds was deceptive and that in some cases data speeds were slowed by nearly 90 percent 
FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said that AT T wanted to retain longtime customers and so allowed them to buy unlimited data plans  in some cases after new customers were no longer offered unlimited plans  Then they unilaterally changed the terms  she said 
 They stopped providing the service that customers understood they had purchased when they entered into their contract   she said   Customers would be subject to an early termination fee if they wanted to get out of their existing contract  
AT T called the allegations  baseless  and said the practice was needed to manage network resources 
 We have been completely transparent with customers since the very beginning   said Wayne Watts  AT T s general counsel   This program has affected only about 3 percent of our customers  and before any customer is affected  they are also notified by text message  
More than 3 5 million customers with legacy unlimited data plans had their Internet speeds slowed more than 25 million times by AT T s practice  which began in October 2011  the FTC said 
AT T says on its support website that people with certain plans can experience data slowdowns once they exceed certain limits  Customers with a 3G smartphone will experience slowdowns after using 3 gigabytes of data in a month  while those with 4G LTE smartphones can use 5 gigabytes before potential slowdowns 
Those who dislike the throttling can use Wi Fi or switch to a different plan  AT T says on its website 
AT T closed up 0 6 percent at  34 33 per share 
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has said that his agency was troubled that some carriers singled out specific customers for throttling 
The FCC is reviewing wireless carriers  data management practices after Verizon  N VZ  in July announced that the top 5 percent of high speed data users on its older unlimited data plans might experience slower speeds 
Verizon  the largest U S  wireless provider  ultimately scrapped the plan for the higher speed 4G network  though the policy is in effect for unlimited subscribers on the 3G network 
Sprint  N S  and T Mobile US  N TMUS  continue to offer unlimited data plans 
Earlier this month AT T said it would pay  105 million to settle FTC allegations that it put unauthorized changes on customers  mobile phone bills 
Separately  the Justice Department is currently reviewing AT T s proposed purchase of DirecTV  O DTV  

The case in the U S  District Court for the Northern District of California is FTC v  AT T Mobility  LLC

216261,437777,VZ,Will NFP Contain Dollar s Move ,opinion,"Friday June 3  Five things the markets are talking about
The ECB did nothing  OPEC did nothing and ADP signalled another month of acceptable U S job gains 
So what s left to look forward to  Today it s nonfarm payrolls    the granddaddy of fundamental indicators 
This key reading could help determine the course for interest rates in the world s largest economy  Investors seem hesitant to make any  big  bets across the board in the run up to this morning s release  08 30 a m  EDT  
The Fed has been open and transparent in their rhetoric of late  They are a tad  hawkish  to a rate hike  but it s all data dependant  NFP is the final major release on the U S  labor market before the Fed s June 15 meeting 
A strong report could encourage Fed officials to raise benchmark interest rates this summer for the first time this year  Currently  Fed funds futures are pricing a  20  probability for a hike rate in a few weeks 
1  What the Fed needs to see in NFP
Investors and dealers continue to search for clues for any re pricing of Fed policy expectations 
Dollar bulls require a U S s jobs report to show healthy job additions  higher wage growth and a labor participation rate showing some traction 
However  with the U S consistently ticking the job growth box for the past year  the market has naturally shifted its focus to wage growth  To date  the U S s impressive growth in jobs has generally not translated to meaningfully higher wages  Any improvement in pay  along with a gradual recovery in the labor participation rate  is expected to lead to higher consumption 
The U S still needs to move the needle on wages  Average hourly earnings need to show a monthly gain of  0 2  and then some  Anything on the  positive  side will have fixed income dealers repricing current yield curves 
Then there is labor force participation  The U S participation rate continues to hover near its historical lows   62 6   It s healthy to see it edge higher even if it does happen to push the unemployment rate up   4 9   
The dollar is trading in a contained range ahead of the release  Market consensus is looking for payrolls to have risen by  158k in May  note  some analysts expect the number to be depressed due to the Verizon  NYSE VZ  strike  
A print there or there about could see some modest dollar strength  The event risk is that the data disappoints 

2  Dovishness dominated ECB meet
There were no surprises in yesterday s ECB policy decision  Draghi and company remains in  wait and see  mode  Their corporate bond buying program and the new round of targeted long term refinancing operations will begin this month 
The one surprise to dealers and investors was policy makers keeping their medium term inflation projections unchanged  In his press conference Draghi indicated that officials have shifted their focus elsewhere  namely to the looming Brexit vote  June 23  and the incomplete re pricing of the Fed outlook  Both of these event risks will keep markets occupied over the coming weeks and not the ECB 

3  OPEC full of  hot air 
OPEC failed to agree on a new production ceiling at its semi annual meeting in Vienna yesterday 
Heading into the summit  the Saudi s  Kuwait and Qatar supposedly were leaning towards a renewal of an OPEC output ceiling  while others such as Iran  Venezuela and Algeria were insisting that an output ceiling must be accompanied by a country specific quota system  It s not a surprise that self interest won the debate 
Crude prices initially came under pressure on the news  but have found traction  WTI  49 19  Brent  50 09  ever since on the back of the weekly U S  crude inventories and production data by the EIA reporting a steady decline in stocks   1 4m barrels drawdown  
Mohammed Barkindo from Nigeria was chosen to be OPEC s new secretary general 

4  PMI s from China slow
In the overnight session  China s Caixin Services and Composite PMI s slid to a new three month low  51 2 vs  51 8 prior   but remained in expansion territory 
Digging deeper  there were reported declines in the new orders component  marginal job creation  and rising volume of unfinished work 
Analysts noted that easing cost pressures in the PMI gauges also do not bode well for upcoming official May inflation figures   all of the index categories  except output prices  showed signs of deterioration  This suggests that the Chinese government needs to continue with their policy steps to boost its economy 
In Hong Kong  May s composite PMI contracted for the fifteenth consecutive month  47 2 vs  45 3   but at a slower pace  Output  new orders and employment components all fell at softer rates 

5  Yen at risk to go higher 
Thus far  the fallout from PM Abe s decision to postpone his sales tax hike appears to be contained 
All three major credit rating agencies have expressed varying amount of caution  though only one  Moody s  was  most  concerned  stating it considers the decision as a credit negative 
Overnight  Japan May services PMI returned to expansion at 50 4  Growth was supported by a modest increase in new orders for the second consecutive month  Even employment remains in growth territory 
However  Japan s deflationary trend continues  A concern for the BoJ was that input prices rose to the weakest rate in over three and a half years 
The yen is trading atop of its three week high   108 60  on the sales tax decision  Traders are looking at this latest move as a fiscal step that could potentially detract from more aggressive BoJ policy moves in the second half of the year  If the BoJ is out of the equation  it would suggest that Yen is at risk to go much higher ",2016-06-03,Dean Popplewell,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-nfp-contain-the-dollars-move-200133819,200133819
216262,437778,VZ,NFP Prints Massive Miss,opinion,"Employers in May added the fewest number of workers in almost six years  reflecting broad cutbacks that may raise concern about U S  growth and prompt Federal Reserve policy makers to put off an increase in interest rates 
The addition of 38 000 workers  the fewest since September 2010  followed a 123 000 advance in April that was smaller than previously estimated  a Labor Department report showed Friday  The increase in May was less than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey  The jobless rate dropped to 4 7 percent  the lowest since November 2007  as Americans left the labor force 
Smaller employment gains reduce the odds of a more pronounced upturn in household spending and economic growth after a poor start to the year  Fed officials will take into account more judicious hiring  at a time when corporate profits are on a downswing and global markets remain weak  as they consider whether to raise interest rates again 
 It will put a dent in optimism about the second quarter rebound   Thomas Costerg  senior economist at Standard Chartered  LON STAN  Bank in New York  said before the report   A lot of hopes are hanging on the labor market  If job growth softens it ll be a signal that the U S  economy is a bit more fragile than we think  There are a lot of question markets about the second half  

The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 160 000 gain in May employment  Estimates of 90 economists in ranged from job gains of 90 000 to 215 000 after an initially reported 160 000 increase in April  Revisions to prior reports subtracted a total of 59 000 jobs from payrolls in the previous two months 
The report showed a broad hiring slowdown  including declines in payrolls in construction  manufacturing and mining  Job growth at private service producers slowed  with employment climbing by just 61 000  That brought the diffusion index  which measures the breadth of hiring  to 51 3 in May  the lowest since February 2010 
Furthermore  Americans who are working part time though would rather have a full time position  or the measure known as part time for economic reasons  climbed to 6 4 million in May  the highest since August  from 6 million a month earlier 
The unemployment rate  which is derived from a separate Labor Department survey of households  was projected to drop to 4 9 percent  matching the lowest level since 2008  from 5 percent  according to the survey median 

Hourly Pay
A bright spot in the report was worker pay  Average hourly earnings rose by 0 2 percent in May after a 0 4 percent gain in April that was a bit stronger than initially reported  Worker pay increased 2 5 percent over the 12 months ended in May 
The report showed weakness in sectors vulnerable to slow overseas markets and the cutbacks in energy investment  along with hiring slowdowns in services  Factories cut employment for the third time in the last four months  while construction companies shed 15 000 jobs 
The payrolls figure also reflected a work stoppage at Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  that Labor Department data showed involved some 35 100 workers  the most in four years  Those workers were idle for the entire payroll survey pay period  which includes the 12th of the month 
Landline workers at Verizon began protesting in April as the company sought to increase workers  contributions for health benefits and greater flexibility in temporary job relocations 
Friday s report showed employment in the information sector dropped by 34 000  Fed policy makers  who are considering when to next raise interest rates after lifting them in December for the first time in almost a decade  have said they expect continued improvement in the job market ",2016-06-03,Dean Popplewell,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nfp-prints-massive-miss-200133843,200133843

Friday s extraordinarily weak nonfarm payrolls report sent the U S  dollar tumbling against all of the major currencies  We haven t seen a move this strong in 2 months for EUR USD and it s been more than a month for USD JPY  The 2 year Treasury yield dropped by the largest amount since March 2009 and Fed Fund futures are now only pricing in a 29  chance of tightening in July    down from more than 50  pre NFP  A mere 38K jobs were created in May  the weakest since September 2010 and while the data is distorted by the Verizon  NYSE VZ  strike  even if you add back the 35K jobs lost  the number was still terrible  The unemployment rate hit its lowest level since 2007 but the improvement was driven by a drop in the participation rate  Average hourly earnings growth eased to 0 2  from 0 3   The softness of Friday s report caused the market to downgrade its expectations for a summer rate hike and the question now is how that affects Janet Yellen s thinking  She was unabashedly hawkish last month when she said a rate hike might be appropriate in the coming months  If she repeats that view    and she could due to the consistency of comments from U S  policymakers and their overall view that the labor market is doing well    the dollar will rebound  But don t expect the greenback to recapture all of Friday s moves  Significant technical damage was done and the weakness of Friday s report will have investors eyeing every positive comment from Yellen with skepticism  In addition to the soft labor data  service sector activity also slowed  There are very few pieces of market moving U S  economic reports on next week s calendar  but even if there were  Yellen is the one to watch as her comments frequently sets the tone for trading  which is now truer than ever 
Euro Soars on NFPs  ECB in Wait and See Mode
After consolidating for more than a week  the soft nonfarm payrolls report drove the EUR USD out of its 1 0950 to 1 1250 trading range  However for the Eurozone  the ECB monetary policy meeting was the main focus and investors were unimpressed by the Mario Draghi who had nothing new to say on monetary policy  The central bank increased its growth and inflation outlook but Draghi spent a greater portion of his press conference emphasizing ECB s willingness to increase stimulus if financial conditions tighten significantly  Like the Fed  the ECB is waiting for the results of the U K  referendum before deciding what steps to take next  The bank is comfortable with the current level of monetary policy and expects corporate bond purchases  set to start on June 8 and TLTRO  which begins June 22  to provide additional support for the economy  Looking ahead  Mario Draghi will be speaking again on Thursday  revisions to Eurozone GDP is scheduled for release and from Germany we have factory orders  industrial production and the trade balance  Considering that we just heard from the ECB head  none of these event risks is likely to be big market movers for the euro 
GBP  Brexit Trumps All
For the past few months  sterling completely shrugged off economic data  The currency soared in May despite weaker PMI numbers and this month it plunged even though manufacturing and service sector activity beat expectations to rise at a faster pace  And the reason is simple    Brexit trumps all  The performance of the British pound has been driven entirely by Brexit polls and the same is expected in the coming week with only industrial production and the trade balance scheduled for release  The U K  referendum is only 3 weeks away  which means investors will be laser focused on Brexit polls  To this day  the polls are close  with some reporting more Britons in favor of remaining in the European Union while others seem to favor an exit  Leaving the EU poses a significant risk for the financial markets and could mean a period of deep economic uncertainty that will hurt consumer  business and investor confidence  ultimately translating into weaker headline growth  Some even argue that it could drive the U K  into recession  There could be significant costs for trade  investment and jobs if the U K  fails to strike a trade deal with the EU and U S  The stakes are high and that s why every time a politician warns about the consequences of Brexit  sterling rises as investors view it as another reason for the British to remain in the Union  Keep an eye on the polls because they will dictate how sterling trades on a day to day basis next week 
USD CAD Tanks But Oil Remains Weak
When it comes to the Canadian dollar  there s nothing more important than oil  For the past week  oil prices struggled to break above  50 a barrel  and that resistance translated into steady gains for USD CAD  However Friday s soft U S  labor market report and stronger Canadian trade data took USD CAD back to the bottom of its range  OPEC s decision to leave production levels unchanged put a cap on oil prices and even with the decline in Friday s dollar  crude failed to rise  However with USD CAD s decline stopping right at the 50 day SMA  we are now looking for a bounce back to 1 3000  USD CAD will remain in focus next week with Canada s IVEY PMI and employment report scheduled for release  These are tier one economic releases that tend to have a significant impact on the currency and will help determine whether USD CAD clears 1 3000 or breaks 1 29 
AUD Soars Above 200 day SMA
Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars ended the week sharply higher against the greenback  While NZD showed steady performance  all of AUD s gains came on Friday after the abysmal nonfarm payrolls report  This week s Australian economic reports were mixed with the PMI services index rising while the manufacturing index fell  GDP growth was very strong in Q1 but consumer spending growth is slowing  These mixed reports will give the Reserve Bank strong reasons to leave monetary policy unchanged next week  However the minutes from the last RBA meeting indicated that the decision was a close one  so the tone of the RBA statement could be slightly less dovish  The outperformance of the New Zealand dollar can be credited to the uptick in dairy prices but dovish comments from RBNZ Governor Wheeler in the coming week could strip the pair of its gains  When the RBNZ met last month  it maintained a dovish bias  saying that further policy easing may be required and that a lower New Zealand dollar is desirable  Since then  there has been very little reason for their views to change  China s trade balance is also scheduled for release and the outcome of the report will affect all 3 commodity currencies ",2016-06-03,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-tanks-on-epic-jobs-miss-200133934,200133934
216264,437780,VZ,CCI  A High Yield REIT Paying Safe  Growing Dividends,opinion,"Crown Castle  NYSE CCI  only began paying dividends in 2014  but the company currently offers income investors a high dividend yield near 4  with 6 7  annual dividend growth potential 
Crown Castle also has an attractive business model with substantial recurring revenue  excellent free cash flow generation  and extremely high incremental margins 
Let s take a closer look at Crown Castle s business for consideration in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewCrown Castle began operating as a real estate investment trust  REIT  in 2014 and is the largest provider of shared wireless infrastructure in the country 
Crown Castle owns approximately 40 000 towers and 16 500 miles of fiber supporting small cell networks 
The company leases its towers out to wireless carriers  which need Crown Castle s infrastructure to provide wireless services to consumers and businesses 
Tenants deploy communications equipment  coaxial cables  and antennas at the top of Crown Castle s towers that transmit signals between the tower and mobile devices  Most towers have capacity for at least four tenants 
The big four wireless carriers account for 90  of Crown Castle s revenue  and the company is completely focused on the U S  wireless market  where over 70  of its towers are located in the top 100 largest markets 
Over 80  of the company s revenue is recurring  and most of its site rental revenue results from long term leases with initial 10 year terms and five year renewal periods thereafter Business AnalysisDespite its customer concentration  Crown Castle s business model is attractive for a number of reasons  beginning with its predictability 
The company has an average remaining customer contract term of six years and approximately  20 billion remaining in contracted lease payments  compared to  3 billion in 2015 site rental revenue   providing excellent cash flow visibility 
Crown Castle s leases also have built in price escalators  which are expected to continue adding around 3  to the company s annual earnings growth 
In addition to annual rent escalators  tower economics are also attractive because very little cost is involved to add additional tenants 
A recent investor presentation by Crown Castle highlighted that the company enjoys a 96  incremental margin when it adds an additional tenant to one of its existing towers 
In other words  if a new tenant brings in  25 000 of additional rental revenue  Crown Castle keeps  24 000 in gross profits  The operating leverage in this business is tremendous  and substantially all of Crown Castle s wireless infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy 
As data growth continues accelerating  it seems reasonable that demand for Crown Castle s wireless infrastructure will also rise over time 
Carriers have no substitutes for wireless infrastructure  which is mission critical for their businesses to operate 
Additionally  by collocating on shared wireless infrastructure  wireless carriers only have to pay for their proportional usage of the infrastructure 
Instead of needing to occupy an entire company owned tower themselves  carriers can rent only the space they need to enhance their network coverage and continue servicing their customers 
As a result of these factors  tenant leases have historically enjoyed a high renewal rate  Non renewals have averaged just 2  of site renewal revenues over the last five years 
Many of Crown Castle s towers are also located in areas with strict zoning restrictions and other regulations  limiting supply and making its infrastructure harder to replicate by new entrants 
Crown Castle s cost structure is also fairly stable because the company maintains long term control over the majority of land under its towers 
About one third of Crown Castle s site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land the company owns  and its current portfolio of ground leases have an average remaining term of about 31 years 
Importantly  over 75  of its site rental gross margin is from towers where the land is owned or controlled by company for at least 20 years  There is little risk of Crown Castle losing control of its real estate assets 
As a result of continuously growing demand for data and a portfolio of mission critical wireless infrastructure  Crown Castle has delivered extremely reliable growth throughout numerous market cycles  In fact  the company s rental revenue and gross income has increased every year since 2002 
The company also maintains an investment grade credit rating  which allows it to continue accessing capital on favorable terms to invest opportunistically in growth projects 
Overall  Crown Castle has a fundamentally strong business that seems to have a solid outlook for at least the next five years  The company possesses a number of the factors I look for to find safer stocks 
Crown Castle s Key RisksThe biggest risks facing Crown Castle are customer concentration and evolving technological trends 
AT T  NYSE T   30  of rental revenue   T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS   22    Sprint  NYSE S   19    and Verizon  NYSE VZ   18   account for about 90  of the company s total revenue 
The U S  wireless market is an oligopoly  so there s really not much Crown Castle can do to diversify its customer base 
While the U S  wireless market is relatively stable  Sprint faces financial difficulties and has been slashing spending to begin working down its substantial debt load  The company has lost money for seven straight years and is struggling as the smallest  major  carrier 
Will Sprint s struggles impact Crown Castle  It s hard to say  The company is likely too large to be acquired by one of the other major carriers due to anti trust concerns  and it s difficult to know if it would benefit from cutting back its business with Crown Castle   a lower quality network with less coverage isn t exactly a winning strategy  Regardless  Sprint s situation is certainly worth monitoring because the company faces legitimate financial challenges 
It goes without saying that the loss of any of Crown Castle s major customers would be devastating  However  I think this risk has a very low probability 
Non renewals are usually the result of mergers between carriers because they can consolidate their wireless infrastructure needs  Recent examples include AT T  T Mobile  and Sprint acquiring Leap Wireless  MetroPCS  and Clearwire  respectively 
For now  Crown Castle is the largest wireless infrastructure player in the market and has long standing relationships with the major carriers  It s hard to imagine any of them being able to operate a network without the use of Crown Castle s products and services  which likely explains the excellent 2  non renewal rate the company has historically enjoyed 
Besides customer concentration risk  Crown Castle could be impacted by changes in wireless deployment technology 
If wireless networks become more efficient  e g  network sharing  or experience a substantial change in design  demand for Crown Castle s wireless infrastructure could decline 
Other technologies such as WiFi  small cells  satellites  and mesh transmission systems could eventually serve as substitutes for the company s wireless infrastructure as well 
None of these potential evolutions can happen overnight  but they could potentially jeopardize Crown Castle s earnings 5 10 years from now   no one knows 
The company s industry is also heavily regulated by the FCC  FAA  and local ordinances  They control the siting of towers and oversee tower and antenna structures  amongst other issues  It seems unlikely that a new regulation would crop up and harm Crown Castle s business  but the company does face some regulatory risk 
Finally  near term demand can be impacted by trends in capital spending by the major carriers  If they decide to pullback on plans to expand their coverage or capacity  Crown Castle could temporarily see reduced demand for its wireless infrastructure  This risk factor doesn t impact the company s long term outlook  but it could potentially cause near term volatility 
Overall  there are a few risks that could jeopardize the company s very long term future  However  the near  to mid term outlook looks good  Technology changes are likely to happen at a moderate pace  and it s hard to imagine any of Crown Castle s major customers no longer needing its services anytime soon Dividend Analysis  Crown CastleWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Crown Castle s Dividend Safety Score of 62 suggests that the company s current dividend payment is pretty safe 
The dividend payout ratio is one of the most important financial ratios for dividend investing because it shows how much of a company s earnings are being consumed to pay the dividend 
Net income is most commonly used to compute a company s payout ratio  but REITs face several complications 
REITs own a lot of property  so they record substantial non cash depreciation charges every year  which reduces their reported net income  However  the value of real estate usually rises over time  creating a mismatch between accounting and reality 
For this reason and others  real estate businesses use a supplemental measure called  adjusted funds from operation   AFFO  instead of net income to provide a better sense of their real dividend payout ratios 
AFFO measures cash flow by removing the non cash impact of real estate depreciation along with several other items to give a more accurate look at a company s operating performance 
For fiscal year 2016  Crown Castle expects AFFO per share of  4 70  With annual dividend payouts of  3 54 per share  the company s forward looking payout ratio stands at 75  
I generally prefer to invest in companies with a lower payout ratio but will make exceptions for businesses with extremely steady cash flows 
Crown Castle seems to fit this profile  The company generates consistent cash flow thanks to its long term leases  mission critical services  large base of recurring revenue  and high renewal rate 
As long as the company continues to retain its tenants and continue collecting monthly rent payments  the relatively high payout ratio shouldn t be an issue 
Another one of the most important factors impacting dividend safety is a company s performance during the last recession  As seen below  Crown Castle s revenue continued growing at a double digit clip throughout the downturn Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Economic weakness did not significantly impact Crown Castle s recurring revenue  and demand for wireless services continued to grow  Site rental revenues increased at a mid single digit clip throughout the downturn  underscoring its resiliency 
Despite stable fundamentals  Crown Castle s stock plunged by nearly 60  in 2008  significantly underperforming the S P 500 
In 2008  the company had around  240 million in cash on hand compared to total book debt in excess of  6 billion  As credit markets froze up  many highly leveraged companies such as Crown Castle were smoked 
A similar situation seems unlikely in today s age of rock bottom interest rates and easy money  but the company s history is worth being aware of 
Besides stable business results across many different economic environments  Crown Castle s excellent free cash flow generation boosts its Dividend Safety Score 
As seen below  Crown Castle has generated positive  growing free cash flow over the last decade  Most of the company s costs are fixed  which allows it to generate high incremental cash flows when it adds new tenants to existing towers 
Maintaining its wireless infrastructure is also relatively inexpensive  The company estimates that sustaining capital expenditures are typically just 2 3  of net revenues  If another downturn were to happen  Crown Castle could easily ramp up free cash flow by cutting out discretionary spending Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As I mentioned earlier  Crown Castle does maintain a high debt load  Debt can be good or bad depending on the type of business  e g  cyclical versus stable  and the amount of leverage used 
Since Crown Castle generates extremely stable free cash flow and owns a good portion of its land and properties  it can reasonably afford to maintain more debt than the average firm 
The figure below shows that Crown Castle currently holds  305 million in cash compared to a debt load of nearly  12 billion 
The company is committed to improving its balance sheet and maintains an investment grade credit rating from the major agencies  It also has around  2 billion available to use from its credit revolver  alleviating some of my leverage concerns Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  Crown Castle s dividend payment looks safe  The company s payout ratio is reasonable  its free cash flow generation is excellent  and the services provided by Crown Castle are at least somewhat recession resistant  The balance sheet could be in better shape  but the company s reliable cash generation reduces some of this risk Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Crown Castle s Dividend Growth Score of 50 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is average 
The company began paying a dividend in early 2014 and raised its quarterly payout from 35 cents per share to 82 cents at the end of 2014 
Most recently  management increased Crown Castle s dividend by 8 5  at the end of 2015  raising it from 82 cents per share to 89 cents Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The company targets 6 7  long term annual growth in dividends per share going forward  which is similar to the S P 500 s historical dividend growth rate 
Since REITs are required to pay out at least 90  of their taxable income as a dividend and are often capital intensive businesses  their dividend growth rates are usually low but consistent 
Crown Castle scores better for Dividend Growth than many other REITs because much of its future growth requires little capital  e g  adding additional tenants to existing towers  annual price escalators  
The company s reasonable AFFO payout ratio  75   is also supportive of decent dividend growth  especially considering the low amount of sustaining capital expenditures required by the business  i e  if Crown Castle cut back on growth investments  its AFFO payout ratio would drop and provide even more room for dividend increases  
While the company is too young to be considered a blue chip dividend stock  it s dividend growth profile over the next few years looks healthy ValuationCrown Castle s stock trades at 19 7 times forward AFFO per share guidance and offers a dividend yield of 3 8  
If AFFO per share grows at management s targeted rate of 6 7  per year  the stock appears to offer annual total return potential of 10 11  
The stock s current valuation seems reasonable considering the company s stability  but I d prefer to own the stock at a somewhat lower cash flow multiple for a greater margin of safety 
ConclusionThe investment case for Crown Castle over the next five years is very interesting 
As demand for data and wireless connectivity continues to grow  Crown Castle s wireless infrastructure should become even more valuable 
The company has room to add more tenants to its existing towers at very high incremental margins and will continue to enjoy annual price increases across its portfolio of leases 
These two factors should help earnings and dividends continue to grow at a mid single digit clip 
Crown Castle looks like an interesting business for dividend growth investors to keep an eye on  especially if the stock sees a pullback ",2016-06-03,Brian Bollinger,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/cci:-a-high-yield-reit-paying-safe,-growing-dividends-200133935",200133935

216266,437782,VZ,38 000  Not A Typo,opinion,"DOW   31   17 807SPX   6   2099NAS   28   495210 Y    11   1 70 OIL    39   48 76GOLD   33 10   1244 50
The US economy added 38 000 jobs in May  which is not a typo  it is the fewest jobs added in more than 5 years   just 38 000  The unemployment rate fell three tenths of a percentage point to 4 7 percent in May   again  not a typo  the lowest since November 2007 
The unemployment rate went down for the wrong reason  not because people were finding jobs but because 458 000 people dropped out of the labor force  Most forecasts were calling for 150 000 to 180 000 new jobs  so this was a big miss 
The government revised down the number of new jobs created in April to 123 000 from 160 000  March s gain was lowered to 186 000 from 208 000  or a downward revision of 59 000  Over the past 3 months  job gains have averaged 116 000 per month  The drop off in 2016 is the sharpest of the seven year old recovery 
Most industries eliminated jobs last month  the first time that s happened in several years  but there may be some noise in the statistics  35 000 striking Verizon  NYSE VZ  workers were counted as unemployed but the jobs report was still the weakest in at least two and a half years even if there were no ill effects from the strike 
Now  it seems a bit strange that the unemployment rate dropped from 5  to 4 7   even as the economy added just 38 000 jobs  Part of this is that fewer people were in the labor pool  The number of Americans not in the labor force surged to a record 94 7 million  an increase of 664 000  The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  fell 0 2 percentage point to 62 6 percent 
The participation rate has fallen since the recession  but economists don t agree on why  Some suggest that demographic shifts  mainly the retiring baby boomers  is the main cause  Others think it s more cyclical factors or changes in the economy  in other words people can t find jobs and they give up 
That 4 7  unemployment rate is the headline number  also known as the U 3 unemployment rate  U 3 is defined as the  total unemployed  as a percent of the civilian labor force   but doesn t include a number of employment situations  A broader figure is the U 6 rate 
The U 6 rate remained unchanged at 9 7 percent in May  The U 6 rate is defined as all unemployed as well as  persons marginally attached to the labor force  plus total employed part time for economic reasons  as a percent of the labor force   That means the unemployed  the underemployed and the discouraged 
Involuntary part time workers  that is those who would opt for full time jobs were they available  rose by 468 000 to 6 4 million  Jobs were skewed toward part time  which added 139 000 positions  Full time lost 59 000 jobs  While the U 6 rate has made substantial gains in the past years  it remains stubbornly at pre recession levels 
Average hourly wages climbed 0 2  last month to  25 59  Hourly pay rose 2 5  from May 2015 to May 2016  just a hair below the post recession high  The average workweek for all employees on private non farm payrolls was unchanged at 34 4 hours in May 
In another bad sign  temp employment fell by 21 000 and it s down 64 000 so far this year  Health care added 46 000 positions  Leisure and hospitality added 11 000  Government gained 13 000  Professional services up 10 000  Financial activities up 8 000 
However  mining  which includes jobs in the oil patch  lost 10 000 jobs  information related jobs fell by 34 000   the consequence of the recently resolved Verizon strike   while manufacturing lost 18 000  Construction lost 15 000 jobs 
Treasury prices jumped higher this morning  pushing yields lower  following the release of May s official jobs report  Spot gold jumped almost 3   The dollar dropped more than 1 5  against the euro and the yen  Financial shares were hit  higher interest rates allow banks to earn larger spreads on the deposits they ve collected  While the Fed s efforts to reduce rates stabilized asset prices and helped lenders access cheap debt in the wake of the credit crisis  prolonged low rates have crimped banks  margins 
The surprisingly weak jobs report pulled the rug from under a June Fed rate hike  Traders who use fed funds futures contracts now see only a 4  chance of a rate hike at the FOMC meeting in June  according to CME FedWatch  The odds of a rate hike in July have fallen to 36  from 42  prior to the job report  For September  the odds of a hike are 51   Add in a UK referendum on a possible Brexit from the EU  scheduled for one week after the June FOMC meeting 
When we look at 38 000 jobs and realize it is not a typo  we then need to look at why we saw such a dramatic drop  One explanation is that it is statistical noise  The Verizon strike skewed things a bit  The jobs report is notoriously imprecise  by some estimates there is a margin of error of about 100 000 jobs  give or take  in any month  It isn t easy to track all the job changes in the country  There will be revisions  Blah  blah   the economy only added 38 000 jobs  That s the number for now 
Some claim the recovery is getting long in the tooth  The economy has added jobs for 75 consecutive months  The economy cannot continue to create jobs more rapidly than the labor force is growing  But it certainly doesn t feel like we ve reached a tight labor market  There seems to be an overabundance of slack  as evidenced by part time jobs and weak wage growth 
Another theory is that we might be seeing early indicators that productivity is increasing  Productivity has been very low over the past five years  If productivity goes back to near normal the jobs numbers are going to deteriorate quite a lot because it takes fewer workers to do the job 
The problem with this argument is that we haven t seen any uptick in productivity  The Conference Board estimates domestic productivity ticked up an average of only 0 34 percent per year between 2011 and 2015  That s well shy of the 1 93 percent average maintained between 1990 and 2010  And that recent productivity growth also falls short of several other major world economies 
So  what happened to productivity  Well  one of the things is that following the Great Downturn    residential mobility evaporated  homeowners with negative equity were unable to sell and move  We have a long history of packing up and moving to new places and new jobs  and historically this mobility has provided the economy with a critical dose of oomph  or the technical term   stimulus 
A slide in job turnover and relocation rates is undermining the economy s dynamism  damping productivity and wages while making it more difficult for sidelined workers to find their way back into the labor force  Staying put can mean that workers are not moving to jobs where they would be more productive 
At the same time  many are forgoing the raises and ascents on the career ladder that often come with a job switch  Fewer openings can also have a ripple effect  shrinking the bargaining power of workers in general  making it tougher to ask for a bump up in pay  Mobility normally drops during downturns  and that was the case during the Great Recession  Millions of jobs vanished  and those fortunate enough to be working were less inclined to give up the one they had 
Another factor is that business investment has dried up  Many businesses saw Zero Interest Rate Policy as an excuse for stock buybacks  incurring low priced to repurchase equity  Stock buybacks are a vehicle for returning excess cash to shareholders  without the commitment usually associated with a dividend  also a handy vehicle for executive compensation  According to analysis from Barclays  LON BARC  these repurchases  which are a primary source of demand for equities  have contributed to the increase in the S P 500 2010  Almost 60  of the 3 297 publicly traded non financial U S  companies have bought back their shares since 2010  according to a report from Reuters 
Unfortunately  this strategy undermines the companies that use it  Debt producing buybacks mean money is not being reinvested in the company for innovation and improving productivity  And among the approximately 1 000 firms that buy back shares and report R D spending  the proportion of net income spent on innovation has averaged less than 50 percent since 2009  increasing to 56 percent only in the most recent year as net income fell  It had been over 60 percent during the 1990s 
If U S  companies continue to dole out their cash to investors economic investment will go where it can be used well  If a company in Germany  India or Brazil has something to do with the money  it will flow there  as it should  and create growth and activity there  not in the United States 
And if the money isn t being reinvested in R D  it certainly isn t going into training employees or providing them tools to be more productive  The productivity in the US is down  not because US workers suddenly got lazy but because companies aren t giving workers the tools to be productive  opting instead to financialize value over the short term 
Share repurchases have helped the stock market climb to records from the depths of the financial crisis  As a result  shareholders and corporate executives whose pay is linked to share prices are feeling a lot wealthier  That wealth  some economists argue  has come at the expense of workers by cutting into the capital spending that supports long term growth   and jobs ",2016-06-05,Marvin Clark,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/38,000-not-a-typo-200133996",200133996

US Economic News  Housing prices were strong in all areas  especially in the West and Northwest  Consumer Spending had its biggest 1 month rise in 7 years in April  Non Farm Payrolls fell to only 38K jobs created in May  with the previous month also cut by 37K  to 123K  The Unemployment Rate fell to 4 7   its lowest point in 8 years  but the drop was mainly due to 458 000 people dropping out of the labor force  More than half of those who dropped out were people over 55 years old  The May employment numbers were also hurt by a Verizon  NYSE VZ  strike  which accounted for an approx  35 000 worker decline 
However  before we hit the panic button  let s remember that job growth tends to slow down as an economy reaches full employment  which is virtually where we are now in the US 

CCN reports that   Back in 2009  the unemployment rate hit 10   Now it s down to 4 7    the lowest rate since 2007  Yes  it recently dropped in May because more Americans dropped out of the job market  But much of the decline in the unemployment rate since 2009 is for good reasons  The economy has added 13 6 million jobs since October 2009 when the unemployment rate hit double digits 
Now we re at a moment when the unemployment rate can t go much lower  Typically  job growth tends to slow down   and wage growth tends to go up   as the economy gets closer to full employment  Plus  other recent indicators show improvement  Jobless claims have been below 300 000 for 65 straight weeks  That s the longest streak since 1973  And the ADP payroll number  which shows private sector hiring  for May was much higher at 173 000 jobs  The May report is already drawing skepticism from some market observers

216268,437784,VZ,Verizon open to divesting cell tower assets  CFO,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Verizon Communications Inc is open to divesting its network s assets including its cell towers  the company s chief financial officer said on Wednesday 
Verizon  which in February completed a  130 billion deal to buy Vodafone s stake in Verizon Wireless and get full ownership over the company  has previously announced plans to trim some aspects of its portfolio 
CFO Fran Shammo said the company was inspired by rival AT T s  4 85 billion sale of some of its towers to tower operator Crown Castle last year  a deal which preserved AT T s right to lease and operate the towers for about 28 years 
 The AT T deal was a good deal for them  It opened our eyes and we said  OK  maybe there is a way to get through this and protect our interest and get a deal that is palatable to us    Shammo told investors at a conference in Los Angeles  adding that Verizon wants to protect its ability to expand its network when necessary 
Shammo also said the company s multicast technology  which allows mass audiences to stream content from multiple devices without crowding Verizon s network  will be available in most devices the company launches in the fourth quarter 
Verizon is negotiating deals with content providers to create a web based TV service delivered to mobile platforms outside of a linear TV subscription 
However  Shammo predicts it will be a few years before the multicast technology translates into greater leverage for negotiations with content providers 
 It will take a year or two before we have a meaningful number of subscribers where content providers say  I can get my hands around this  you now have a meaningful base of subscribers   he said 

The company will also have better leverage once Nielsen Holdings  which measures television audiences  is able to measure mobile audiences  he said  Nielsen is expected to launch that service in the fourth quarter

216269,437785,VZ,France s Iliad plans to bid for bigger T Mobile stake  Bloomberg,news," Reuters    French low cost telecom operator Iliad SA  PA ILD  is gearing up to bid for a  significantly larger  stake in T Mobile US Inc  N TMUS  than it previously sought for in July  a Bloomberg report said  citing people familiar with the matter 
Iliad  which had initially proposed buying a 56 6 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom AG s  DE DTEGn  U S  unit  is still prepared to offer about  33 for each T Mobile share  the Bloomberg report said on Thursday    
Executives at Deutsche Telekom  which owns 66 percent of the fourth largest U S  carrier  feel that a minimum of  35 per share would be a fairer price for T Mobile  the report cited two people as saying 
Sprint Corp  N S   which in August dropped its bid to acquire T Mobile  had agreed to pay  40 per share under the broad terms of an agreement worked out with Deutsche Telekom 
Iliad has set a mid October deadline to decide whether to improve its bid or walk away  sources had told Reuters earlier in September 
Deutsche Telekom  which makes about a third of its sales and a fifth of core profits in the United States  has tried to sell T Mobile twice since late 2011 because it sees it as too small to compete with market leaders Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ  and AT T  N T

216282,437798,VZ,3 Numbers  Weak Inflation Numbers Will Not Move ECB Policy,opinion,"Analysts predict no change for the ECB s stimulus program
ADP data should show a modestly firmer rise in US private payrolls for May
A strike at tech company Verizon strike may skew employment figures for May
US jobless claims are expected to fall for the third straight week
The European Central Bank s monthly policy announcement  followed by a press conference  will dominate the economic news in Europe today  Later  two reports will offer fresh insight into US payrollsfor May  starting with the monthly estimate of private employment via ADP  Later  the Labor Department publishes its weekly release on jobless claims 
Eurozone  ECB Monetary Policy Announcement  1145 GMT  and Press Conference  1230 GMT   Consumer inflation fell again in May in the preliminary estimate published by Eurostat on Tuesday 
The 0 1  annual decline is the fourth consecutive update of flat to negative year on year inflation  Questions about the threat of deflation will no doubt be front and centre today as the crowd pores over today s news from the European Central Bank  including the obvious one  Should the ECB do even more 
Analysts are expecting no change in monetary policy despite the worrisome data in the latest inflation report  On that point  consider that core inflation  which strips out energy and food prices  is in no danger of slipping into negative territory for the near term future 
Most of the deflationary winds are coming from energy  By contrast  core inflation   arguably a superior benchmark for monitoring the broad pricing trend   ticked higher in May  inching up to 0 8  in year over year terms 
That s a touch lower than the recent highs of 1   Nonetheless  the relatively steady trend in core inflation suggests that deflation risk is minimal to non existent  Rather  it s all about energy 
 The  Eurozone  economy is expanding at a satisfactory clip  the hypothetical deflation threat has receded and none of the risks that had roiled markets early this year has materialised   a Berenberg Bank economist  the FT   While the ECB will not rule out further easing  the council will likely emphasise that its previous stimuli seem to be working  
Economic growth is still sluggish  but for the moment it appears that a modest expansion will endure  albeit at a subdued pace against the trend from a few months earlier 
The May report for the   a monthly estimate of Eurozone GDP   posted a 0 26  advance  The softer gain implies that Eurozone GDP growth is headed for a slowdown in the second quarter after firming up to a 0 5  quarter on quarter gain in Q1 
In other words  the celebrated rebound in Q1 is at risk of faltering  It doesn t look fatal at this point   a roughly 0 3  GDP rise  if that s what Q2 delivers  will match the trend in last year s second half  Not great  but firm enough to fend off predictions of a new recession 
In any case  the main event for the euro area today centers on a single question  What does the ECB s  think  Tune in to the 1230 GMT press conference for the answer 

US  ADP Employment Report  1215 GMT   A modest round of improvement is expected for today s estimate of US private payrolls from ADP 
Econoday com s consensus forecast sees companies adding 175 000 workers in May  up from a 156 000 gain in the previous month  That s still a modest pace compared with recent history  but at least the expected change is positive 
Some analysts are warning that a Verizon  NYSE VZ  strike  which ended this week  may skew the employment figures for May by temporarily depressing the monthly growth comparison  Reuters last week  that the Labor Department s payrolls report for last month  which is due on Friday  will be lighter by at least 35 000 because of striking employees at the US telecom company 
If the official jobs data for May will suffer  it s reasonable to expect that today s ADP data will be affected too  If so  a weak number in today s release may not be a reliable estimate of the labour market s health  or lack thereof  No doubt that s what the bulls will say if the employment numbers for May are weak 
In other words  we may have to wait until the June reports to figure out what s really going on with payrolls 
 
US  Initial Jobless Claims  1230 GMT   The Verizon strike is also said to be the source for the early May spike in jobless claims  which surged in the first week of last month to a 10 month high 
The good news  The two subsequent updates show that new filings for unemployment benefits are easing  providing the basis for a collective sigh of relief 
Today s update for the final week of May is projected to more or less hold steady 
Econoday com s consensus forecast calls for a decline of 1 000 to a seasonally adjusted 267 000  If the estimate holds  the news will boost confidence that the dramatic rise in claims in early May was  for whatever reason  noise 
For additional perspective  keep an eye on today s update of a related indicator  the monthly report on job cuts  which is published by the outplacement firm Challenger  Gray   Christmas  today s data is due at 1130 GMT  
Recent figures on this front  however  don t offer much support for the bulls  The April job cuts data revealed layoffs that accelerated to a six year high of just over 65 000 
But a lot of that is due to downsizing in the energy industry  which has been hit hard by the bear market in oil prices in recent years   downsizing that may not be all that useful for modeling the broad US macro trend 
 We are also seeing heavy downsizing activity in other areas  such as computers and retail  where changing consumer trends are creating a lot of volatility   Challenger s chief executive officer  last month 
If job cuts continue to rise in May   particularly outside of the energy industry   the news will limit any celebrations related to encouraging news on jobless claims

216283,437799,VZ,Top 10 ECB Takeaways  Nonfarm Payrolls Preview,opinion,"By Kathy Lien  Managing Director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management 
The European Central Bank s monetary policy announcement proved to be a big disappointment as it failed to trigger a breakout for EUR USD  Although the currency pair rose to a 1 week high of 1 1220 before the monetary policy announcement  it gave up all of its gains after Mario Draghi s press conference  The ECB head didn t have anything particularly negative to say about the economy or monetary policy outside of the expected warning that unwanted tightening of financial conditions  most likely in reaction to a negative Brexit vote  could trigger more stimulus  For the time being they remain comfortable with current policy and expect corporate bond purchases    which begin June 8    and TLTRO    which begins June 22    to provide additional support for the economy  Their views even led to upgraded GDP and inflation forecasts for 2016  Still  euro traders were not impressed because Mario Draghi went out of his way to emphasize his willingness to increase stimulus if markets go haywire after the U K  referendum  So between the ECB s dovish bias and its upgraded growth forecasts  the EUR USD remained confined between its 1 1100 to 1 1250 trading range  A break of this range is now up to the U S  nonfarm payrolls report

The focus now shifts to the U S  dollar and nonfarm payrolls  USD JPY extended its losses Thursday on the back of Japanese and U S  equity market weakness  Bank of Japan board member Sato also said the sales tax delay won t affect monetary policy  The recent decline in USD JPY has taken the pair near support at 108 25  Whether this level breaks or holds hinges entirely on NFPs  We need an unambiguously positive U S  labor market report for USD JPY to recapture 109 and possibly even 110  That means nonfarm payrolls need to exceed 175K  the unemployment rate needs to drop back to 4 9  and average hourly earnings has to rise more than 0 2   That s a lot to ask for especially with the Verizon  NYSE VZ  strike expected to reduce payrolls by 35K jobs  Still  job growth last month was subpar  so a bounce in May would not be unusual  Every month we take a look at 8 economic indicators for clues about the state of the labor market and this month  there are more arguments in favor of a weak release  Although Challenger reported fewer layoffs and ADP reported an increase in corporate payrolls  the rise in the UMich survey was offset by the drop in the Consumer Confidence index  Jobless claims also increased  continuing claims rose and jobs contracted at the same pace in the manufacturing sector according to ISM  However the strongest leading indicator for NFPs    the non manufacturing ISM report won t be released until after the jobs number  so there s still chance for an upside surprise  The main focus will be on wage growth  Last month  the dollar soared despite lower job growth because wages grew at a faster pace  If the momentum in earnings can be continued  weaker job growth can be forgiven

The OPEC meeting ended with no deal on cutting production and oil prices dropped in reaction  There s very little desire among leading oil producers to reduce output and the headlines during the meeting from various nations were consistent  They all found the meeting positive and cooperative in the sense that they all agreed that production levels should remain the same   50 a barrel continues to cap gains in oil and encourage rallies for USD CAD  We are now looking for a deeper pullback in oil prices but Canadian trade numbers are scheduled for release Friday and the risk is to the upside  Manufacturing activity accelerated last month according to the IVEY PMI report and with Western Canada Select oil prices rising 38  in April  export values should increase  leading to a smaller trade deficit

216285,437801,VZ,Sprint grabs lifeline with rural U S  roaming deals,news,"By Marina Lopes and Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON  Reuters    With plans for a T Mobile US Inc merger in tatters  Sprint Corp is expanding a roaming program with rural cellphone companies that could provide a much needed way for the debt laden wireless carrier to cheaply increase its footprint 
In March  Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son struck a roaming deal with the Competitive Carriers Association  CCA   which represents many U S  rural and regional carriers  to use each other s networks for roaming at a mutually attractive price 
In June  Sprint announced that a dozen small carriers  covering a population area of 34 million people  had struck roaming deals following the outlines of the CCA agreement 
Sprint and CCA plan to announce another batch of individual agreements to expand the roaming partnerships at an industry trade show in early September  CCA President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Berry said this week 
When Son announced the mutual roaming agreement  many industry observers shrugged it off as a sweetener to soften U S  regulators  opposition to a T Mobile acquisition  Rural carriers have long complained about the difficulty and expense of getting the largest carriers  Verizon Communications Inc and AT T Inc  to let customers of smaller providers onto their networks 
Deals with rural carriers could offer Sprint a lifeline to improve its national presence following the collapse of the merger with T Mobile  So far  Sprint has already saved an estimated  1 7 billion in costs of building new towers and other infrastructure  according to a source familiar with the calculations 
Sprint s new CEO Marcelo Claure said that the networks of rural carriers  are really important in places where we haven t and don t intend to build our network  
CHEAPER ROAMING
The 12 mutual roaming agreements already signed with rural and regional carriers  including Virginia based nTelos Wireless and Mississippi based C Spire Wireless  have added 352 000 square miles to Sprint s service territory  which like T Mobile s has been largely concentrated around metropolitan areas while Verizon and AT T s coverage stretches nationwide 
 It s a business relationship that s frankly bred out of necessity   said CCA s Berry  explaining that the agreement helps rural partners share savings with Sprint while staying competitive   You ve got to have a roaming partner  
Claure s challenges are complex and long term as the company struggles to recover the millions of customers it lost during its messy network overhaul in recent years  The task is particularly tough in a nearly saturated market and with No  4 T Mobile pushing to leapfrog Sprint as the No  3 U S  carrier 
Sprint s debt is equivalent to 147 percent of its market cap  compared with 55 percent at Verizon 
Perhaps because Sprint needs rural coverage more than its rivals  its roaming agreements offer the carriers more perks and more flexibility than they have seen from other companies 
While T Mobile has offered some roaming agreements  experts say Verizon s rural program is the only comparable alternative that offers rural carriers nationwide 4G roaming 
Verizon s program  however  largely limits partners to building networks that rely on airwaves owned by Verizon  while Sprint s allows them to use their own spectrum  Sprint s partners also say it offers more attractive roaming rates 
 It s one thing to get a roaming agreement  it s another thing to get a roaming agreement with non punitive roaming rates   said Eric Graham  senior vice president of strategic relations at C Spire 
Roaming agreements are notoriously secretive  with companies signing non disclosure agreements about rates  Verizon says its roaming rates reflect the value of its nationwide network 
Another major perk Sprint offers is access to devices at cheaper prices negotiated with handset distributors  solving a major problem for smaller carriers who are often stuck paying top dollar for devices because they lack their competitors  scale 
Claure s appointment as CEO may lead to even better handset prices 

The Bolivian born entrepreneur made his fortune through a cellular phone wholesale business called Brightstar which has close ties with handset makers and may provide better access to the latest smartphones at decent prices both for Sprint and its partners

216286,437802,VZ,Sprint expands rural roaming program  adding 15 new carriers,news,"By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON  Reuters    Sprint Corp said on Friday it was adding 15 new rural and regional wireless providers to its U S  roaming program  a move bolstering the company s efforts to cheaply expand its footprint as it fights to stay competitive as a national carrier 
The program allows Sprint and its smaller partners to use each other s networks for roaming at a mutually attractive price  A total of 27 carriers  covering 565 000 square miles and a population area of more than 38 million people  have now entered into roaming agreements with Sprint 
The 27 partnerships could save Sprint about  1 9 billion in expenditures on new cell phone towers and other infrastructure that would be necessary to bring 4G coverage to new areas on its own  based on calculations provided by a source familiar with the program estimates 
With those savings  deals with rural carriers could offer Sprint a lifeline to improve its national presence following the collapse of the merger with T Mobile US Inc 
Like T Mobile s  Sprint s network has been largely concentrated around metropolitan areas while the coverage by the two biggest U S  carriers  Verizon Communications Inc and AT T Inc  stretches nationwide

In March  Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son struck an agreement with the Competitive Carriers Association  which represents many U S  rural and regional carriers  providing the framework for a rural roaming program 
In June  Sprint announced the first 12 individual carriers to launch the rural roaming program into reality  including Virginia based nTelos Wireless and Mississippi based C Spire Wireless 
The 15 new partners announced Friday include Kentucky based Bluegrass Cellular  Idaho based Syringa Wireless and Alabama based Pine Belt Wireless 
Perhaps because Sprint needs rural coverage more than its rivals  its 4G roaming agreements offer the carriers more perks and more flexibility than they have seen from other companies

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

AT T Poised for Long Term Growth Despite Competition Woes

	On May 18  we issued an updated research report on U S  telecom behemoth AT T  Inc      

	AT T reported strong financial results in the first quarter of 2016 with both the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the company s U S  postpaid wireless subscriber addition of 129 000 was down a significant 70 7  year over year 

	Nonetheless  prospects of better earnings and revenues over the long haul from the DIRECTV  NASDAQ DTV  purchase are bright  From 2016 to 2018  AT T expects consolidated revenue growth to be in line with GDP growth or higher while adjusted earnings per share growth is projected in the mid single digit range 

	With its combination of U Verse   DIRECTV s satellite TV    and an all fiber GigaPower Internet service  AT T now has the operational flexibility to provide traditional cable TV service as well as mobile video streaming service to users 

	In March  the company announced plans to offer a version of its DIRECTV satellite TV service through the Internet which would not require customers to have a satellite dish  set top box or annual contract  The company will be offering three affordable video plans in order to appeal to all types of viewers  ranging from those who want the full package to a streamlined bundle 

	We believe that the new endeavor will help AT T attract cord cutters and boost revenues  Also  offering of two year guaranteed pricing for its new DIRECTV  home internet and digital phone customers is expected to aid in expansion of its satellite offering in the residential services segment 

	AT T has revealed plans to field test the next gen 5G technology  If the company succeeds to bring 5G to the U S  market before any of its peers  its quest to be the numero uno in the domestic market will definitely see a positive direction 

	Further  the company stands to benefit hugely from initiatives in the Internet of Things  IoT  space and investments in the Mexican telecom market and fiber arena 

	However  AT T has increased the prices of its voice and U verse video services because of rising operating costs  especially in programming and service delivery  as well as increasing content costs  This may impact subscriber retention in the near term 

	Additionally  a saturated wireless market  spectrum crunch and regulatory risks remain potent headwinds  Moreover  intensifying competition in the U S  wireless market from peers like Verizon Communications Inc      T Mobile US  Inc     and Sprint Corp      is another major concern 

	AT T currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations

216296,437812,VZ,France s Iliad challenges Sprint for control of T Mobile,news,"By Soyoung Kim and Leila Abboud PARIS NEW YORK  Reuters    French telecommunications company Iliad SA  PA ILD  has made a surprise offer for T Mobile US Inc  N TMUS   setting up a potential bidding war with Sprint Corp  N S   the U S  mobile carrier now controlled by Japan s Softbank Corp  T 9984  
Iliad  which has shaken up the French mobile and broadband market in the past decade with its cheap  pared down subscriber plans  bid  15 billion in cash for 56 6 percent of T Mobile US at  33 per share  it said in a statement on Thursday 
The Paris based company said its offer for the fourth largest U S  carrier values all of T Mobile at  36 20 per share  a premium of 42 percent over the pre announcement share price 
That is less than the roughly  40 per share Sprint agreed to pay under the broad terms of an agreement worked out with Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   T Mobile s majority owner  The terms of that proposal  which followed months of talks and which was reported by Reuters in early June  would value T Mobile at nearly  32 billion 
Deutsche Telekom and Sprint declined to comment  and a representative for Softbank could not be reached 
Despite Iliad s lower offer  a person close to the French company said founder Xavier Niel believes he has a strong card to play because his bid would not face the antitrust scrutiny that confronts Sprint in trying to merge the third and fourth biggest U S  mobile operators 
 SoftBank has been told in many very clear coded words that the Department of Justice and the FCC would probably not approve the acquisition   said Reed Hundt  a former chairman of the U S  Federal Communications Commission   There s no question to me that the FCC would say  bienvenue   to the proposed Iliad deal 
The FCC and Department of Justice expressed a desire earlier this year to have at least two more network operators competing against AT T and Verizon 
The T Mobile offer is Niel s most audacious attempt at extending his reach beyond France  Monaco and Israel  where he owns part of operator Golan Telecom  Still  his bid to enter the United States mobile market is a long shot  some investors and analysts say 
The French company specializes in broadband and lacks experience in mobile  T Mobile s main business  having launched its mobile service only in 2012  It is also unfamiliar with the demands of competing in the United States  with its massive coverage needs and deep pocketed competition from AT T Inc  N T  and Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ   the market leaders 
Iliad expects  10 billion in savings from the deal  although it is unclear where they would come from because the company has no U S  operations 
The Iliad offer could falter on price alone  said Joseph Mastrogiovanni and Michael Baresich  analysts at CreditSuisse 
 We are sceptical that T Mobile and its shareholders  including Deutsche Telekom  will find this bid attractive   they wrote in a research note   However  it could put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather later 
EMPIRE BUILDING
Few doubt the scale of Neil s ambitions  The entrepreneur  an unknown outsider in France when he started out  has joined the elite  lunching with ministers  starting a tech school  and holding part ownership of the influential Le Monde newspaper 
He earned his first fortune from an adult chat and dating service on the Minitel  a rudimentary computer network that pre dated the Internet in France  He then surfed on a wave of market liberalisation in telecoms to create Iliad 
In many ways Niel is similar to Masayoshi Son  the head of Softbank and his rival for T Mobile US  Both have operated their companies as challengers who cut prices and take on larger rivals with bigger resources 
Niel sees the U S  market as ripe for the kind of challenge Iliad mounted in France  where its entry into the mobile market in 2012 sent prices down 30 percent and hurt the profits of bigger rivals Orange SA  PA ORAN  and SFR  as well as Bouygues SA  PA BOUY   He ranks 133rd on Forbes  list of billionaires  with a net worth of  9 5 billion 
Son  who is also Sprint s chairman  has pledged to start a price war in the United States  and he has said industry consolidation would allow Sprint to compete more effectively against Verizon and AT T  He owns 19 3 percent of Softbank and is 46th on the Forbes list  with a net worth of  18 4 billion 
T MOBILE TURNAROUND
T Mobile would appear well suited for the role of challenger championed by Niel and Son  Last year  it turned around years of subscriber losses using a strategy that eliminated contracts  restructured plans and set off a race to slash prices across the industry 
Earlier on Thursday  T Mobile posted a net profit after a year of losses  and reported the industry s largest post paid phone subscriber additions of the quarter 
T Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere  known for his outspoken and sometimes abrasive style  has come to define T Mobile s new audacity  epitomized by his frontal attacks on competitors  offering to pay early termination fees for customers who defect from rivals  for example 
 We know this is a scale industry  Scale brings advantage   T Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter told Reuters earlier on Thursday 
 What we ve seen so far is a glimpse of what real competition in this industry looks like  If we could turbo charge it  it could be an incredible opportunity to bring more competition to the market  
BIG BITE FOR ILIAD
Iliad said it would finance its offer  which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal  through a mix of equity and debt  and that it already had the backing of unnamed international banks 
Nevertheless  the deal would be a big bite for Iliad  Its market capitalization of just above  16 billion compared with about  25 billion for T Mobile US 
T Mobile owner Deustsche Telekom will now have the benefit of two bidders 
A person at Deutsche Telekom familiar with the talks also said a deal with Iliad had a certain appeal because of the lower risk of being blocked by U S  regulators 
Three years ago  regulators rejected AT T s  39 billion bid for T Mobile US  which resulted in AT T paying Deutsche Telekom  T Mobile s full owner  a reverse break up fee of  6 billion in cash and U S  mobile assets 

T Mobile shares closed up 6 5 percent at  32 94 on the New York Stock Exchange  Sprint shares were down 5 3 percent at  7 35

216297,437813,VZ,T Mobile deal collapse could spark telecom price war ,news,"By Marina Lopes WASHINGTON  Reuters    Sprint Corp s  N S  newly appointed Chief Executive Marcelo Claure has so far had a Midas touch in the telecoms industry  turning Brightstar  a reseller of U S  handsets to Latin America  into a distributor valued at  2 2 billion when it was sold to Japan s SoftBank  T 9984  
But his talents will now be put to the test like never before as he must complete the No  3 carrier s network upgrade while trying to retain customers  who are defecting in droves 
 We are talking about billions of dollars of capital spending in front of this company before the network is ready   MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said  noting that Sprint likely has to cut prices to compete with the industry s top players 
 Unfortunately raising capital spending and cutting prices at same time is recipe for a very ugly financial situation  
Some analysts fear that Sprint s decision to give up its dream of merging with T Mobile US Inc  N TMUS  could lead to a wider price war as the top carriers slug it out in a nearly saturated market 
 Without the ability to compete on scale they are going to have to compete on price  so the two smaller competitors may become increasingly desperate to maintain market share and could become irrational in pricing  which could cause disruptions in pricing in the industry   said Mark Stodden  analyst at Moody s Investors Service 
Sprint might follow the lead of T Mobile  which added more subscribers than all of its competitors combined in the first quarter through aggressive promotions and campaigns that addressed customer frustrations with the industry 
 Sprint could take the same road and try to compete more aggressively on price  which could have the effect of restarting subscriber growth   said Matthew Goodman  analyst at ITG Investment Research  who saw few short term alternatives 
SUPERIOR NETWORK IN THE WORKS
Sprint  long the industry s technological weakling  has not been sitting on its laurels  It has invested  5 billion to upgrade its much maligned network in a transformation likely to trickle down to customers by the end of next year 
Sprint s new network should allow the company to combine the vast and spectrum it obtained from a 2013 acquisition of Clearwire Corp  with its other radio wave holdings  This has created a superior high speed offering known as Sprint Spark  which analysts say should be the best in the industry 
Still  even more investment is needed to make Sprint s network competitive with those of other top carriers  Spark is only available in 24 cities  and its goal is to reach 100 U S  cities by 2016 
The challenge will test the abilities of Claure  a Bolivian born billionaire who got his start distributing cellular handsets from U S  manufacturers in Latin America  Brightstar  which he founded in 1997  distributes phones to companies in the United States and elsewhere  SoftBank acquired the company in January 
 They still obviously need a lot of network expertise and they have that  But having someone in charge who is more marketing oriented coincides with the chief executive of SoftBank s outlook   said Bill Menezes  an analyst at Gartner  referring to Japanese tycoon and Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son 
 Masa is known for innovating pricing and marketing in Japan  He needs people to make Sprint their first consideration   said Menezes 
Claure will have to shed Sprint s image as a lower quality provider at a premium cost  But discounting  especially to add market share as the new network is being phased in  is likely to reduce profit margins as well 
While AT T Inc  N T  and Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ  have established reputations and T Mobile has been plugging away at its  Un carrier  brand for a year  Sprint has struggled to communicate what it stands for  said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research 

 Perception tends to lag reality by good couple years   said Dawson   Non customers really have a poor sense of network quality  Even if Sprint starts to deliver better performance  it will take time for people to realize that   he said

216298,437814,VZ,T Mobile CEO expects to unseat Sprint as No  3 carrier,news,"By Marina Lopes WASHINGTON  Reuters    T Mobile US  N TMUS  will overtake Sprint Corp  N S  as the No  3 wireless U S  carrier in subscribers by the end of the year  Chief Executive John Legere tweeted on Thursday 
The declaration came a day after T Mobile said it surpassed Sprint as the No  1 wireless provider for prepaid customers  with 15 64 million users  compared with Sprint s 15 19 million 
The figures put T Mobile  which calls itself the  uncarrier   well ahead of rivals AT T  N T  and Verizon  N VZ  in the prepaid market  Verizon and AT T hold a larger share of the more profitable postpaid U S  subscriber base 
 I predict the  uncarrier will overtake  Sprint in total customers by the end of the year  There  I said it    tweeted Legere 
A spokeswoman for Sprint declined comment 
While T Mobile has been adding record numbers of subscribers through promotions and campaigns  Sprint customers have been leaving in droves because of service problems arising from carrier s network overhaul 
Earlier this week  Sprint s parent company  SoftBank Corp  T 9984   walked away from its offer to buy T Mobile and replaced Sprint CEO Dan Hesse with Miami businessman Marcelo Claure 
Legere  known for his outspoken style  did not waste time in engaging with his new competitor  and tweeted at Claure on Thursday  Sorry  marceloclaure  you re already behind   
While T Mobile s aggressive strategy has helped the company turn around  its parent company  Deutsche Telekom  T 9984   has been concerned that its lack of low frequency spectrum and fixed line infrastructure is hampering its ability to compete 
The company will have to spend an estimated  5 billion to  10 billion in the upcoming auction of radio frequency waves  according to one analyst  the first public auction of valuable low frequency airwaves in nearly a decade 

T Mobile shares were down 4 3 percent and Sprint shares were down 0 8 percent after falling nearly 20 percent on Wednesday

216299,437815,VZ,Dividend payers attractive again as bond yields fall,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors once again are snapping up high dividend paying U S  stocks as Treasury yields fall  which should keep utilities and telecom stocks near the top of the buying list for the near future 
The S P 500 utility sector   whose dividend yield at 3 9 percent is more than 100 basis points above the 10 year Treasury yield   led the S P 500 s advance on Friday after concern about the launch of U S  air strikes on Iraq drove the benchmark bond yield to 14 month lows 
The equity market recovered from early losses  in part due to news that Russia s Defense Ministry said military exercises near the Ukraine border had ended  Any global worries that keep a bid in government debt  meanwhile  will motivate investors to go after stocks with fat dividend yields 
The utility sector is up 8 8 percent since Dec  31  the third best performing sector for the year  following technology and health care  Telecom hasn t been as strong   gaining just 0 8 percent in the same period   but two of that sector s constituents  Windstream Holdings  O WIN  and Frontier Communications  O FTR   have both gained roughly 40 percent 
Utilities hit a bout of profit taking after ending the first half of the year in the No  1 spot  The sector had risen 16 4 percent as of June 30  bolstered in part by the shares  high yields and the appeal of a safer sector at a time when investors were still a bit worried about economic growth 
Analysts say the attractiveness of high dividend paying sectors such as utilities is not likely to end soon  especially with valuations still below the benchmark s level  The forward price to earnings ratio for S P utilities is at 14 9  below the S P 500 s p e of 15 2  Thomson Reuters data showed 
 The U S  10 year is an attractive yield given the backdrop of very weak yields around the world  Therefore  that does make the dividend paying sectors increasingly attractive  That s been the footprint for this market   said Quincy Krosby  market strategist at Prudential Financial  based in Newark  New Jersey 
Overseas turmoil  particularly in Ukraine  has driven up demand for safe haven bonds  also supported by the Federal Reserve s continued purchase of Treasuries while it gradually pares back its bond buying program 
The S P 500 utility sector shot up 2 percent on Friday  its biggest daily percentage gain since June  Earlier this week  the index flirted with correction territory as it lost nearly 10 percent from a high set June 30 
Also benefiting from the drop in bond yields are exchange traded funds tied to dividend payers  including the Powershares Dividend Achiever exchange traded fund  P PFM   which rose 1 3 percent on Friday and is up 3 2 percent for the year 
The First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund  P FDL  has performed better  gaining 1 2 percent on Friday and up 6 percent for the year so far 
The S P telecommunications index has an even higher dividend yield than utilities  at 4 7 percent  though a smaller pool of stocks  The sector has been weak this year because of a lackluster performance by its biggest names  AT T  N T  and Verizon  N VZ  
However  network communications company Windstream Holdings has a dividend yield of 9 percent  the highest in the S P 500  while Frontier Communications is third highest  with a yield of 6 2 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data  Those compare with the S P 500 s dividend yield of 2 4 percent  They have gained 40 percent and 37 percent this year  respectively 

 Where yield lies is where investors are continuing to go because there continues to be no alternative from other income producing securities   said Mark Luschini  chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia

216300,437816,VZ,U S  to review rates for telecom special access lines,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  telecommunications regulators will review rates at which telecommunications providers sell high capacity data and voice connections  known as special access lines  to businesses  the Federal Communications Commission said on Monday 
Many businesses rely on special access lines to transmit large amounts of data quickly  for instance connecting banks to ATM machines 
The services are highly lucrative for large carriers  such as Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T   Smaller carriers  such as Sprint Corp  N S   have argued the special access market is uncompetitive 
The FCC has now received approval from the Office of Management and Budget to begin collecting information from providers and some purchasers of special access connections on the rates  terms and conditions of the services 
The FCC will then determine whether the industry is competitive or needs regulation  The FCC will begin collecting special access information for 2013 from companies by the end of this year  an agency spokesman said 
 We will move forward with data collection and fact based analysis that will help the Commission better understand competition in this marketplace  and the impact on consumers as we pursue the Commission s statutory mandate to ensure special access services are provided at reasonable rates and on reasonable terms and conditions   FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement 
The FCC sought permission last year to collect information about the market from the OMB  which analyzes the potential economic consequences of proposed actions by regulatory agencies  and studied whether benefits of data collection outweighed its burdens

216301,437817,VZ,Sprint cuts rates  CEO says more new plans to come,news,"By Marina Lopes and Carey Gillam OVERLAND PARK Kan  WASHINGTON  Reuters    Sprint Corp  N S  on Monday unveiled a new pricing plan that offers customers 20 gigabytes of data and up to 10 lines for  100  doubling its data offerings  the latest in a string of price cuts and promotions sweeping the wireless industry 
Sprint s chairman  business tycoon Masayoshi Son  is betting new prices will revive a carrier hampered by an expensive network overhaul and rising competition 
 The message is simple  We are back in the game  We are going to offer most competitive value for American consumers   Marcelo Claure  Sprint s newly appointed chief executive told Reuters in an interview 
The company will release new plans for individuals later this week 
The announcement marks the first move for the new CEO  who last week said cutting prices would be his top priority 
The move comes after Verizon slashed prices for its unlimited talk and text plan and T Mobile expanded its family plan to 6 lines and could signal more price cuts ahead for the industry as a whole 
Sprint is going it alone after scuttling a months long effort to pursue a merger with No  4 U S  cellular provider T Mobile US Inc  N TMUS  
Last year  an aggressive campaign by T Mobile to address subscriber frustrations and lower prices sparked a domino effect that caused the U S  top four carriers to restructure pricing plans and cut rates to lure customers in a nearly saturated market 
But analysts worry the industry s latest discount spree could increase pressure on already tight margins and rattle dividends 
While top carriers AT T  N T  and Verizon  N VZ  have largely been able to mitigate the impact of T Mobile s discounts on their subscriber base  they would likely have to respond to price cuts at Sprint with steep discounts of their own to keep subscribers from migrating  analysts said 
 We will see a trickle down in pricing concessions across the industry  This is the start of a price war many anticipated would be coming   said Angelo Zino  analyst at S P Capital IQ 
New pricing plans that charge customers separately for the cost of their devices have somewhat offset price cuts this year  Zino said  but if the discounts continue  they could pose a long term threat to the dividends 
Son  CEO of Sprint s parent company  SoftBank Corp  T 9984   said earlier this year he wants to start a  massive price war  in the United States and warned that with Claure as CEO price competition will likely heat up 
But many question whether Sprint  with  27 billion in net debt according to the company s latest filings is in a financial position to fuel a price war with its competitors 
 Do they have the balance sheet  Not really  but the good news is that they have a major investor in SoftBank  so they have the potential to get more aggressive  said Zino

Chicago  IL   May 13  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Telecom   Part 3   including  Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ       AT T Inc  NYSE T        Sprint Corp      and T Mobile US Inc     

Industry  Telecom   Part 3 

Link  

Technological invention and innovation at a rapid clip have resulted in significant competition within the telecommunications industry  Product life cycle and upgrade cycle have gone down drastically with several firms coming out with new versions of products and services  back to back  within a short span of time  To combat competition  firms are thus increasingly looking at consolidation  This has resulted in an array of mergers and acquisitions in the telecom space 

To add to that  the Federal Communications Commission s  FCC  net neutrality laws have made matters worse for telecom operators  Besides  several ISPs  Internet Service Providers  are in a tight spot over the FCC s orders pertaining to increased upload and download speeds of Internet service termed  broadband  Stiff Competition
	In the meantime  the U S  telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition  The two industry behemoths  Verizon Communications Inc     and AT T Inc       at present command around 68  of the U S  wireless market  whereas Sprint Corp     and T Mobile US Inc      jointly control the remaining 32   These two relatively smaller firms are now bringing on board several low priced value added products to lure customers away from their larger peers  In 2015  both Sprint and T Mobile US added a substantial number to its customer base 
	On the video services front  the pay TV industry is facing severe competitive threats from low cost online video streaming service providers  Cord cutting has become a regular phenomenon in the country with over the top video operators offering smaller packages of channels  designed according to a customer s need  at dirt cheap prices  Established pay TV operators are now opting for the more customer friendly Internet TV service in order to counter the threat 
	Companies in the telecommunications industry continue with mergers and acquisitions  Consolidation among the largest telecommunication services focused companies has created an environment where equipment focused companies have to contend with fewer customers and reduced selling opportunities  This has prompted consolidation among equipment companies as well to enhance their marketing value by broadening product offerings for converged fixed mobile networks Net Neutrality  A Major Concern
	The net neutrality law adoption mandate by the FCC was announced on Feb 26  2015  per which high speed broadband  Internet  will now be classified as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act  Importantly  the latest regulations will be applicable to both mobile and fixed broadband networks  The reclassification of Internet makes a radical change in the way the government treats high speed broadband services and ISPs  The FCC can now strongly regulate the ISPs 
	Net neutrality implies an open Internet atmosphere which will prohibit ISPs  especially telecom and cable TV operators  from discriminating against applications  In order to control the flow of bandwidth consuming applications such as video streaming  the ISPs have been discriminating against several web based content and applications  Content developers thus have to pay heavy sums to ISPs for accelerated data transfer 
	The implementation of the new law will ban common ISP malpractices such as data traffic blocking  slowing down data traffic and paid prioritization  Notably  paid prioritization is a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for quick and smooth transmission of their data traffic  The FCC will closely monitor and put a check on all such deals in the future  Moreover  the FCC will also supervise interconnection deals  in which content developers pay ISPs to connect to their networks 

Notably  on Jan 29  2015  the FCC increased the download and upload speeds of Internet services to be deemed as broadband  high speed data   In a majority vote  the FCC raised the new threshold download speed to 25 Mbps from the existing 4 Mbps while the same for upload has been boosted to 3 Mbps from the current 1 Mbps Weaknesses
	In general  telecommunications companies under pressure have high debt levels and large financial leverage ratios  Moreover  they are often unable to cope with recent market trends  Other risks that pose threats are as follows 

Potential Business Slowdown    Sales fluctuations of carriers are expected to continue to weigh on capital spending decisions    a major problem faced by equipment vendors  The companies are expected to retain focus on improving their balance sheets  financial discipline and free cash flow generation 

Product Overlapping  We may see more product sharing deals between telecom  cable TV and satellite TV operators as each of these players are vying to grab a sizeable share in each other s territory  Even pay TV services  offerings to business enterprises  mobile backhaul and metro Ethernet segments may witness more convergence  Mobile phone makers are now gradually offering tablets and chipset manufacturers are providing chips for personal computers as well as mobile devices   thus frequently interchanging their areas of operations 

Intensified Competition    Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition  Product life cycle and upgrade cycle have been reduced drastically as several firms are coming up with new products and services within a short span of time  Increasing competition is compelling players to offer heterogeneous and bundled services to retain their position in the space

216310,437826,VZ,U S  Equity And Economic Review  The Market Retreats From A High  Again ,opinion,"This week s employment news was mixed  Initial unemployment claims increased for the third consecutive week  this time to 294 000  While some commentators argued that the Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  strike caused this week s increase  the DOL release did not specifically mention a primary cause  This gain combined with last week s lower than expected employment report is cause for modest concern  In contrast  the JOLTs report was positive  with more openings than hires  This relationship is positive for wages  it indicates not only that employees should have additional leverage in negotiating pay but also that employers will be more willing to increase salaries to keep current workers and attract new ones  However  JOLTs is a less significant report  the recent increase in initial unemployment claims is more important 
The week s best news  however  was the 1 3  increase in retail sales 



The chart shows this data series moved sideways for the last year  a potentially concerning pattern  This makes the strong upside move all the more important  The following table from the report shows broad based increases 



All sectors save two  building materials declined 1  while general stores sales were  0   were positive 

The Atlanta Fed s GDPNow model   which has been fairly accurate    increased to a strong 2 8  in the second quarter  But it s still too early to place too much emphasis on this report 

Economic Conclusion  It s possible the employment situation is weakening  but we have insufficient data to draw a firm conclusion  However  weekly initial unemployment claims data has quickly risen in significance  The retail sales report is very noisy  so arguing that we ve seen a  turnaround  is premature  But at minimum  last week s strong number indicates the U S  consumer is still willing to spend 

Market Analysis  This week  two bond market charts provide the best explanation for the equity markets 





The iShares 7 10 Year Treasury Bond  NYSE IEF   top chart  and iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT   bottom chart  are both forming pennant patterns at the top of rallies  And both ETFs are about to break out to the upside  indicating investors expect slower economic growth  This conclusion does not support strong upside equity moves  which partially explains this week s weaker equity performance  starting with the transports 


Three weeks ago  the iShares Transportation Average  NYSE IYT   transports  broke an uptrend  Last week they crossed below the 200 day EMA and  at the end of this week  moved lower on increasing volume  The Russell 2000s  IWMs  confirmed the move lower 



The iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  are fluctuating around the 200 day EMA  But the declining momentum implies they will continue moving lower  which is bad news for the SPYs 



For the third time in a year  the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  couldn t break through the 210 212 price area  Now they are moving lower  currently using the 50 day EMA for technical support   


With some 90  of S P 500 companies having reported first quarter earnings  71  have turned in bottom line numbers that are better than mean estimates  according to FactSet  However  this may be more due to subdued expectations than improved performance 



 For first quarter 2016  the blended earnings decline is negative 7 1   The first quarter marked the first time the index has recorded four consecutive quarters of year over year declines in earnings since fourth quarter 2008 through third quarter 2009   said John Butters  senior earnings analyst at FactSet 


When viewed through a longer historical lens  the latest market action is completely understandable  The market is expensive  it needs increasing revenue to continue rallying  But that isn t happening  Instead  a strong dollar  weaker overseas economies and oil market slowdown are lowering revenue growth  This leads to the market selling off at higher valuation levels  which is exactly what occurred last week  And until corporate earnings meaningfully increase  we can expect the cycle to occur again ",2016-05-16,Hale Stewart,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-equity-and-economic-review:-the-market-retreats-from-a-high-(again)-200129974,200129974

216315,437831,VZ,Sprint  T Mobile merger not expected before September  sources,news,"By Marina Lopes  Soyoung Kim and Liana B  Baker WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The long anticipated merger of Sprint Corp  N S  and T Mobile US Inc  N TMUS  is not expected to occur before September  with the companies continuing due diligence and preparing a detailed case for a deal before U S  regulators  according to people familiar with the matter 
Japan s SoftBank Corp  T 9984   which controls Sprint  and T Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn  have agreed to broad terms of a deal  under which Sprint would pay around  40 per share for T Mobile  valuing the smaller rival at nearly  32 billion  Reuters reported in early June 
Despite agreeing to other key terms such as break up fees  the proposed transaction is taking extra time to finalize  partly because the companies are keen to bulletproof their arguments for a merger that is sure to face heavy regulatory scrutiny  two of the people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday 
All the people asked not to be named because the discussions are private 
Representatives for Deutsche Telekom could not be immediately reached for comment  while representatives for Sprint  T Mobile and SoftBank declined to comment 
Analysts see the regulatory challenge as the biggest hurdle facing the companies since both the U S  Federal Communications Commission  FCC  and Department of Justice  DOJ  have expressed a desire to have at least two more network operators competing against the market leaders AT T  N T  and Verizon  N VZ  
SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son has argued to U S  regulators that a merger would give the companies leverage to compete against the two dominant rivals  A combined Sprint T Mobile would boast more than 100 million subscribers  still behind both Verizon and AT T 
SoftBank is also likely to argue that the huge pending mergers of Comcast Corp  O CMCSA  with Time Warner Cable Inc  N TWC   and AT T with DirecTV  O DTV   would further marginalise Sprint and T Mobile 
But top U S  antitrust and communications enforcers have already warned that the wireless market is too concentrated  In 2011 the Justice Department stopped a bid by AT T to buy struggling T Mobile 

Others say recent approval of a merger between US Airways and American Airlines was a sign regulators could be convinced of the merits of a deal that reduces the number of competitors but creates a stronger number three

 in April  missing expectations of about 200 000  The unemployment rate held steady at 5   Employment gains for March and February  meanwhile  were reduced by a combined 19 000  The government said 208 000 new jobs were created in March instead of 215 000  February s gain was trimmed to 233 000 from 245 000 
 climbed 0 3  to  25 53 an hour  a gain of 8 cents  up from a gain of 6 cents per hour in March  Hourly pay rose 2 5  in the past 12 months  up from 2 3   reflecting a tighter labor market  Inflation has been running at about 2   so workers are seeing real wage growth 
Next week  the Labor Department will announce that it s doubling the salary threshold under which virtually all workers will be eligible for overtime   The current threshold is  23 660   As far back as 1940 it was common for presidential administrations to update the wage thresholds  with 6 revisions over 35 years  The outgoing Carter administration issued a rule to raise the threshold in 1980  but when Reagan took over  revisions to increase the salary levels in 1981 were stayed indefinitely  
It wasn t until 2004   23 years later   that the Labor Department next raised the threshold  and then only slightly  to  23 660  Now the Labor Department plans to double the threshold to about  47 000 and to raise it automatically thereafter with inflation  restoring the status quo that existed before the only US president ever to serve as a union leader took office 
Since the start of the year we have started to see new   most notably California  Colorado  Michigan and Massachusetts increased their minimum wages at the start of 2016  while Maryland and the District of Columbia are set to enact raises on July 1  In a first of its kind report  researchers at the National Employment Law Project pore over employment data from every federal increase since the minimum wage was first established  making  simple before and after comparisons of job growth trends 12 months after each minimum wage increase  
What did the researchers find  The paper s title says it all   Raise Wages  Kill Jobs  Seven Decades of Historical Data Find No Correlation Between Minimum Wage Increases and Employment Levels   They found that 68 percent of the time  total jobs went up across the economy  Retail jobs increased 73 percent of the time  Hospitality employment rose 82 percent of the time  The researchers say business cycles explain the instances when employment fell  Each of those times  they write  the economy had entered or just come out of a recession  or was about to enter one 
While there is some structural change for wages  these really tend to have a very small impact on the overall wage story  A bigger impact is expected if and when we start to get to full employment and possibly start seeing labor shortages  but we are not there yet 
The U 6 unemployment rate came in at 9 7   down one tenth of a point  The U 6 rate is defined as all unemployed as well as  persons marginally attached to the labor force  plus total employed part time for economic reasons  as a percent of the labor force   That means the unemployed  the underemployed and the discouraged 
Gains in general were tilted toward part time work  with full time workers declining by 253 000 and part time workers also dropping  but by just 21 000  The number of people working part time for economic reasons  at just over 6 million  remains 50 percent above what it was before the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession  But it has been stuck around that level for more than half a year  a sign that progress may have stopped or that employers have shifted some jobs permanently away from full time status 
The number of long term unemployed  those jobless for 27 weeks or more  declined by 150 000 to 2 1 million in April  These individuals accounted for 25 7 percent of the unemployed 
Job growth was concentrated in the business and professional services sector  which added 65 000 positions  Health care was up 44 000  while financial institutions added 20 000 despite some high profile layoff announcements on Wall Street 
Mining lost another 7 000  this category includes energy related jobs in the oil patch  Companies that drill for oil and natural gas or mine for coal and other metals have cut almost 200 000 jobs since the fall of 2014  Energy firms have reduced payrolls for 18 straight months  Retail lost about 3 000 jobs  Construction added about 1 000 jobs  Government continued to shed jobs  11 000 last month 
When roughly 40 000 Verizon  NYSE VZ  workers went on strike last month  it was right in the middle of the week that government number crunchers analyze to gauge the strength of the job market  Over all  the muted tone of April s report wasn t because of a big drop in any particular industry 
If you are looking for positive trends in the report  consider that this marks the 74th consecutive month of job gains  Private employment is now 5 8 million above the pre recession peak  Private employment is up 14 6 million from the recession low  In April  the year over year change was 2 69 million jobs  Over the last 12 months  employment growth averaged 232 000 jobs per month 
For Fed watchers the jobs report was a red flag and the thinking is that a drop of 48 000 jobs might stop the Fed from raising interest rates at their June meeting  Futures tied to the Fed s benchmark policy rate now put the next interest rate hike into next year  but that might be a disconnect from what Fed policymakers have in store  The rise in wages still might push the Fed closer to hiking rates  if not June  maybe September 
And the simple fact is that employment was not going to continue rising at 200 000 a month indefinitely  Monthly gains of about 100 000 jobs would be enough to maintain the rate of economic growth and absorb new job entrants as the population increases  especially as boomers continue retiring in a huge demographic shift 
The labor force participation rate  which had been on the rise in recent months  fell to 62 8 percent  down two tenths of a point and its lowest level since January  The total labor force contracted by 362 000  Analysts are divided on whether the decline is  structural   in other words due to big  long term shifts in the economy  like baby boomers retiring  or  cyclical   driven primarily by shorter term moves in hiring due to the business cycle 
It s an important question  If it is structural  it means that the labor pool is smaller and most of the slack is already out of the labor market  If it is cyclical  it means that there are still plenty of potential workers on the sidelines  waiting to get back into the labor pool  A third option is that we are nearing some sort of equilibrium where fewer people are leaving the workforce rather than people re entering  If that is the case  then we might expect the labor force participation rate to trend sideways or lower from here 
The labor force participation rate edged down  consistent with what Fed policymakers feel is a longer term trend given the country s aging population  Since 2008  the labor participation rate has fallen from a high of 67 3  in 2000 to 62 8   which is near a 38 year low  It seems that most  not all  of the sidelined workers have come back to the labor pool  We are getting closer to full employment   not there yet   but at least wringing some of the slack from the labor market 
Still  most people don t think this feels like a robust labor market  According to the US Bureau of Labor  workers are considered  employed  even if they are working a couple of part time jobs to scrape by  even if they work just a couple of hours a week  Many of the jobs created in the recovery are low paying or part time  many of the jobs are part of the 1099 economy or the gig economy   temp jobs  freelance  or contracted jobs   in other words  jobs without benefits  The number of Americans working in this capacity grew from 10 1  in 2005 to 15 8  in 2015 
After decades of stagnant wages  73 million Americans   nearly one quarter of our population   now live in households eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit  a benefit exclusively available to the working poor  And according to a 2014 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  rising income inequality  and the reduced consumer demand that comes with it  knocked 6  to 9  off US economic growth over the previous two decades 
If the US economy were 9  bigger than it is today  it would have created about 11 million additional jobs  Working people and their families are keenly aware of the fact that strong wage growth continues to be the lagging indicator in this recovery 
The Fed raised rates in December and its current projections call for another two hikes this year  But you have to wonder if the Fed really has incentive to hike rates in June  Perhaps the Fed will look at the possible inflationary impact of wage gains  but Yellen has said she is not yet convinced that recent signs of rising prices are evidence of a durable trend  There will be one more jobs report before the Fed FOMC meeting in June  Today s report was not enough to take a rate increase off the table  but it was enough to make the policymakers think twice

216330,437846,VZ,U S  Telecom  Pricing War  Net Neutrality Woes,opinion,"Technological invention and innovation at a rapid clip have resulted in significant competition within the telecommunications industry  Product life cycle and upgrade cycle have gone down drastically with several firms coming out with new versions of products and services  back to back  within a short span of time  To combat competition  firms are thus increasingly looking at consolidation  This has resulted in an array of mergers and acquisitions in the telecom space 
	To add to that  the Federal Communications Commission s  FCC  net neutrality laws have made matters worse for telecom operators  Besides  several ISPs  Internet Service Providers  are in a tight spot over the FCC s orders pertaining to increased upload and download speeds of Internet service termed  broadband  Stiff Competition
	In the meantime  the U S  telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition  The two industry behemoths  Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ      and AT T Inc  NYSE T       at present command around 68  of the U S  wireless market  whereas Sprint Corp     and T Mobile US Inc     jointly control the remaining 32   These two relatively smaller firms are now bringing on board several low priced value added products to lure customers away from their larger peers  In 2015  both Sprint and T Mobile US added a substantial number to its customer base 
	On the video services front  the pay TV industry is facing severe competitive threats from low cost online video streaming service providers  Cord cutting has become a regular phenomenon in the country with over the top video operators offering smaller packages of channels  designed according to a customer s need  at dirt cheap prices  Established pay TV operators are now opting for the more customer friendly Internet TV service in order to counter the threat 
	Companies in the telecommunications industry continue with mergers and acquisitions  Consolidation among the largest telecommunication services focused companies has created an environment where equipment focused companies have to contend with fewer customers and reduced selling opportunities  This has prompted consolidation among equipment companies as well to enhance their marketing value by broadening product offerings for converged fixed mobile networks Net Neutrality  A Major Concern
	The net neutrality law adoption mandate by the FCC was announced on Feb 26  2015  per which high speed broadband  Internet  will now be classified as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act  Importantly  the latest regulations will be applicable to both mobile and fixed broadband networks  The reclassification of Internet makes a radical change in the way the government treats high speed broadband services and ISPs  The FCC can now strongly regulate the ISPs 

	Net neutrality implies an open Internet atmosphere which will prohibit ISPs  especially telecom and cable TV operators  from discriminating against applications  In order to control the flow of bandwidth consuming applications such as video streaming  the ISPs have been discriminating against several web based content and applications  Content developers thus have to pay heavy sums to ISPs for accelerated data transfer 
	The implementation of the new law will ban common ISP malpractices such as data traffic blocking  slowing down data traffic and paid prioritization  Notably  paid prioritization is a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for quick and smooth transmission of their data traffic  The FCC will closely monitor and put a check on all such deals in the future  Moreover  the FCC will also supervise interconnection deals  in which content developers pay ISPs to connect to their networks 
	Notably  on Jan 29  2015  the FCC increased the download and upload speeds of Internet services to be deemed as broadband  high speed data   In a majority vote  the FCC raised the new threshold download speed to 25 Mbps from the existing 4 Mbps while the same for upload has been boosted to 3 Mbps from the current 1 Mbps Weaknesses
	In general  telecommunications companies under pressure have high debt levels and large financial leverage ratios  Moreover  they are often unable to cope with recent market trends  Other risks that pose threats are as follows 

Potential Business Slowdown  Sales fluctuations of carriers are expected to continue to weigh on capital spending decisions    a major problem faced by equipment vendors  The companies are expected to retain focus on improving their balance sheets  financial discipline and free cash flow generation 

Product Overlapping  We may see more product sharing deals between telecom  cable TV and satellite TV operators as each of these players are vying to grab a sizeable share in each other s territory  Even pay TV services  offerings to business enterprises  mobile backhaul and metro Ethernet segments may witness more convergence  Mobile phone makers are now gradually offering tablets and chipset manufacturers are providing chips for personal computers as well as mobile devices   thus frequently interchanging their areas of operations 

Intensified Competition  Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition  Product life cycle and upgrade cycle have been reduced drastically as several firms are coming up with new products and services within a short span of time  Increasing competition is compelling players to offer heterogeneous and bundled services to retain their position in the space ",2016-05-12,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-telecom:-pricing-war,-net-neutrality-woes-200129640",200129640

The price reportedly under discussion represents about a 17 percent premium to T Mobile s Wednesday close and values the No  4 carrier at more than  32 billion 
Under a proposed agreement  Sprint would offer about 50 percent stock and 50 percent cash for T Mobile  leaving parent Deutsche Telekom AG  XETRA DTEGn  with about a 15 percent stake in the combined company  Bloomberg cited people with knowledge of the matter as saying 
A deal could be announced as soon as July  Bloomberg said 
Softbank Corp   TOKYO 9984  owns Sprint  while Deutsche Telekom owns 67 percent of T Mobile 
Softbank Chairman Masayoshi Son has long been eager to buy T Mobile and merge it with Sprint  creating a carrier with the resources to upgrade its network and better compete with market leaders AT T Inc  NYSE T  and Verizon Wireless  NYSE VZ  
An exit from the United States would allow Deutsche Telekom to beef up its operations across Eastern Europe 
But the U S  Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department have raised concerns about such a tie up  revolving around the risk that it could raise prices for consumers  U S  regulators rejected AT T s  39 billion takeover bid for T Mobile US in 2011 
Sprint declined comment  T Mobile did not respond to requests for comment  Softbank and Deutsche Telekom were not immediately available for comment

216341,437857,VZ,Verizon to Commercially Deploy 5G Wireless Networks in 2017,opinion,"The U S  telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is currently conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with its partners  The company is looking at mobile hotspot and fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the U S  in 2017 
Verizon s CFO Fran Shammo told investment analysts yesterday at the company s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call  The CFO s statement is in line with the company s focus on building a fiber and wireless infrastructure in order to deliver mobile video efficiently 
The wireless giant  which was the first to deploy the 4G LTE  Long Term Evolution  network nationwide  is initially testing equipment at 15GHz  28GHz  39GHz and 64GHz frequency bands for 5G network deployments   The company s partners in its 5G projects are Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Ericsson  ST ERICAs  LM   NASDAQ ERIC    Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp    NYSE NOK   and Samsung  KS 005930  
Although several industry researchers have predicted that a full fledged 5G network deployment will not start until 2020  Verizon expects some level of commercial deployment in 2017  Industry researchers expect the Asia Pacific region to spearhead the global deployment of 5G wireless networks  However  neither South Korea nor Japan    the two leading countries opting for 5G network    are likely to start commercial deployment before late 2018 
Advantage of 5G 
Verizon claims that its 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second  which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless networks available these days  Therefore  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts 
Additionally  superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing the exponential growth of Internet connected devices  popularly known as Internet of Things  IoT   According to a recent report by research firm International Data Corporation  IDC   worldwide spending on IoT is slated to grow at a 17  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  to nearly  1 3 trillion in 2019 from  698 6 billion in 2015 
The Bottom Line
The U S  telecom industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Thus  in order to stay ahead of competitors  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products  At this juncture  we believe Verizon s drive for 5G wireless network bodes reasonably well for its future growth  The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

216345,437861,VZ,Vodafone Fully Takes Over Indian Operations For  1 68B,news,"By    Vodafone Plc  ADR NASDAQ VOD on Friday acquired full control of its India operations by buying out minority shareholders  including an 11 percent stake held by a local conglomerate  for nearly  1 7 billion 
UK based Vodafone closed the deal by buying a minority stake worth  1 48 billion from Piramal Enterprises Ltd   BOM 500302   a conglomerate operating in real estate  pharmaceuticals and finance in the country  The latest buyout of Piramal s stake follows the company s announcement Thursday of the purchase of a 4 5 percent stake from another minority shareholder  Analjit Singh  for an undisclosed amount  The company had received the Indian government s approval for the takeover of its India subsidiary in February 

 In March 2014  Vodafone completed the acquisition of indirect equity interests in VIL held by Analjit Singh and Neelu Analjit Singh  taking its stake to 89 03  of VIL  Today Vodafone acquired the remaining 10 97  of VIL from Piramal Enterprises Limited  The combined cash consideration for both transactions was INR 101 418 billion   1 0 billion    the company said in a statement Friday 
Vodafone announced Friday that the company now owns its Indian business in its entirety and the deal will make India the second largest market for Vodafone after Germany  once New York based Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ sells back its 45 percent stake worth  130 billion  the Wall Street Journal reported  quoting Vittorio Colao  Vodafone s CEO  
Vodafone is stuck in a long running tax dispute with the Indian government since 2007 and the country s tax authorities claim that the company owes more than  2 billion in capital gains taxes linked to the British telecom giant s acquisition of a controlling stake in Hong Kong based telecom company  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd 
Vodafone had added 4 9 million mobile customers in India until December  while the parent company generated nearly  7 21 billion in revenues for the year ending March 2013  Vodafone s shares closed 2 7 percent lower on the Nasdaq exchange Thursday while shares of Mumbai based Piramal gained 5 77 percent in late afternoon trade on the BSE Sensex 
 The equity purchase in Vodafone was consistent with our objective of making investments that offer opportunity to generate attractive long term return on equity  Ajay Piramal  chairman of the Piramal Group  said in a statement released by the company  adding   I am glad to say that we have delivered against our targeted returns with this investment  ",2014-04-11,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/vodafone-fully-takes-over-indian-operations-for-$1.68b-277099,277099
216346,437862,VZ,Can T Mobile Survive Without A Merger ,news,"By    T Mobile attracted new customers at a breakneck pace with its  Un Carrier  initiative  offering to pick up the tab for new customers willing to break contracts with their existing provider  Some 1 3 million monthly subscribers were added in the first quarter of 2013 alone 
But the cost of those early termination fees  ETFs  was steep  bringing the wireless company fresh recruits at a loss of  151 million  Some investors question whether the process is sustainable  but BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk says that such losses are necessary for a telecommunications company to grow 
 Telecom is a scale business   Piecyk told International Business TImes   You want as much revenue for your fixed costs as possible  so it s very important to grow revenue  
T Mobile US Inc  NYSE TMUS  saw margins fall to 20 percent from 29 percent in January to March of last year  but its revenue growth   thanks to all the new subscribers   have made it a very attractive prospect as Sprint Corp  NYSE S  pursues a merger of the two companies  As it scales up the number of paying customers  profits will fall in the short term 
 T Mobile returned to revenue growth for the first time in two years   Piecyk says   So the growth in subscribers more than offset the decline     from some of their strategies  
Similar to how subsidizing mobile phone purchases cost carriers when they signed customers to new contracts  a business model T Mobile has eliminated in its move to prepaid   telecoms care more about having a paying customer every month 
 At the end of the day  no matter whether it s termination fees or leases  it s still taking the same form of the same thing where you re subsidizing  paying an upfront cost to get new customers   Piecyk said   That is an economic model that has existed in the wireless business for decades  

While T Mobile returned to revenue growth for the first time in two years  it is still far behind bigger carriers in customers  Imagine riding on a Segway trying to catch up to sports cars driven by AT T Inc  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ  in years past 
 This has been extolled as T Mobile s best quarter ever  yet Verizon s market share of wireless service revenue increased in the first quarter as well   Piecyk said   In the best quarter that T Mobile ever reported  the dominant player was still able to grow their market share  
T Mobile is increasing the scale of customers paying their bills every month  but to compete with the  Big Two   it will need to merge with Sprint  Piecyk said  the combination of Sprint and T Mobile would provide them with the needed scale to be more competitive  
Strong subscriber growth may have a temporary impact on T Mobile s profits  but the real challenge will be for the carrier to hold onto those customers   You don t really buy loyalty that way in my view  and those customers will switch back   Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said during a company webcast at this year s Consumer Electronics Show  and Piecyk was inclined to agree 
 With the growth of wireless data usage     it s going to be increasingly difficult for Sprint and T Mobile to individually be competitive with companies that can spend more than both of them combined on their network   Piecyk said 
Verizon lost 138 000 phone customers in the first quarter  but added 539 000 new subscriptions overall thanks to tablets  while AT T added 621 000   They ll have plenty of room if they elected to cut prices to take more share back from T Mobile   Piecyk said 
To continue to compete  a combined T Mobile Sprint would be able to make additional pricing moves to gain customers  or to create more loyal customers  The way to do that  Piecyk said  is by offering a faster network 
 Competition is not always about the lower price  its also about building a better network   Piecyk said  Since T Mobile and Sprint pay competitors to access their wireless networks  it increases both companies  costs  By combining their spectrum and revenues  the two  would have an opportunity to build networks that have faster speeds than existing operators   and the capacity to handle it  
Combining T Mobile and Sprint is exactly what Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son plans to do  The Japanese telecom owns the majority of Sprint  but it will have to overcome many regulatory obstacles to do so  including an FCC that credits T Mobile s success on its failed merger with AT T 
If the merger succeeds  then it could have an impact on the troubled wired broadband industry  Piecyk said  With the amount of spectrum and revenue the merger would provide  the new company would be able to offer a product to the same customers who were most willing to cancel their landline telephones when they started paying for mobile  retirees 
 My mom uses an iPad to go online   Piecyk said   Her Internet could be more than handled with a 5 gigabyte or so rate plan on LTE  So why is she paying Comcast  50 a month for broadband

216347,437863,VZ,Comcast Partners With Japan s KDDI  Taiwan Mobile,news,"By    Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA  is offering at least two Asian cellular operators access to its WiFi hot spots in the United States  in trial partnerships that illustrate the cable company s ambitions to compete with U S  wireless carriers 
The deals with Japan s KDDI  TOKYO 9433  and Taiwan Mobile allow their subscribers to use Comcast s WiFi hot spots when they travel to the United States  reducing the international roaming charges that they would otherwise have to pay  according to a Comcast spokesman 
Comcast has been steadily building out its WiFi network and said last week that it aims to have 8 million hot spots by the end of the year  covering 19 of the 30 largest U S  cities  The No  1 U S  cable company is also seeking U S  regulatory approval to buy Time Warner Cable Inc  NYSE TWC   which now has 34 000 WiFi hot spots 
If the merger is approved  the combined company would have a nationwide footprint that could potentially challenge the dominance of U S  telecom giants Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  and AT T Inc  NYSE T   an idea that Comcast floated in an April 8 regulatory filing touting the deal s benefits 
Since that filing  investors have been trying to figure out what Comcast and other cable companies might be planning do in the mobile market  The topic came up frequently in the latest round of quarterly earnings calls 
Cable is  well positioned to enter the wireless voice and data market with costs that are lower than those of existing wireless carriers   New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said   This could be truly disruptive  with grave implications for new entrants and established wireless carriers alike  
Comcast has adopted a more cautious tone   We view WiFi and cellular as complementary  There are many different situations and applications where consumers may prefer one or the other   said Tom Nagel  Comcast s senior vice president and general manager of wireless services 
Comcast has not disclosed how much it is charging KDDI and Taiwan Mobile in these deals  which were signed earlier this year  The amounts are thought to be small since WiFi data fees are typically much lower than wireless data charges 
A representative for Taiwan Mobile confirmed the Comcast partnership and directed Reuters to a website promoting the offer to its subscribers  The website said subscribers normally pay T 4 per minute   0 13 minute  to use Comcast WiFi  but a promotion lasting until the end of June this year cuts that to T 2 a minute   0 07 minute  
A representative for KDDI did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
MOBILE INTERNET
U S  pay TV and phone companies are casting around for new business models amid sky rocketing growth in mobile Internet use  Satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp has spent billions of dollars on wireless spectrum  and DirecTV is working with financial advisers on a possible merger with AT T 
Even though cable WiFi networks are a potential competitor to wireless networks  Comcast s Nagel said he believes cable and telecom companies could partner to make sure customers  devices can more easily move between their networks 
 One day it should be that Sprint  or any wireless carrier  and Comcast can identify each other s devices and networks  For example  Sprint s device finds a Comcast access point and says  Hey  I think I can get on your network   Nagel said 
Building a wireless network from scratch is something cable companies considered over the past few years but never committed to due to the high costs involved 
One advantage cable companies have is a large amount of fiber wire in the ground  known as  backhaul   which they already rent out to wireless companies to handle data traffic 
While cable companies have bought and sold wireless spectrum before  analysts say the quickest way for a cable company to get into the cellular market would be to rent airwaves from wireless companies through a mobile virtual network operator agreement  or MVNO  Such an agreement would give cable companies wireless cover for areas outside the range of WiFi 
New Street Research estimates that Comcast  which already has MVNO agreements with Verizon  NYSE VZ  and Sprint  NYSE S   could capture about 6 percent of the retail wireless market within five years after its acquisition of Time Warner Cable ",2014-05-11,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/comcast-partners-with-japan's-kddi,-taiwan-mobile-283424",283424
216353,437869,VZ,Sector Earnings Update  Can Telco Sustain Its Upside Momentum ,opinion,"I wanted to post this data from Thomson and Factset  just to show how sector earnings data can be useful and how forward estimates can be impacted by M A 
Here is the spreadsheet detailing the trends in revenue and forward earnings estimates for the Telecom sector  
Q4  15 was the strongest quarter of Telco earnings growth in years  per   and much of it had to do with AT T s  NYSE T  acquisition of DirecTV  Prior to T closing the DirecTV acquisition  T was expecting 1  revenue growth in 2015  but after the Q3  15 closing  expected T revenue growth for 2015 shot up to  12  and also finished the year at  12 
Note how revenue and EPS growth accelerated for Telco through 2015  second spreadsheet   and then look at the first link again and see what 2016 holds for the sector 
The fascinating thing to me is that there are just 5 companies left in the Telco sector per the Thomson Reuters data  and the two 800 lb gorilla s are T and Verizon  NYSE VZ   Why doesn t Standard   Poors simply roll up the Telco sector into the Technology sector as Transports were rolled into Industrials years ago and leave it at that  With Telco just 2  3  of the S P 500 by market cap  it is relatively insignificant to the index  although there are a lot of income investors and elderly piled into the stocks  for the dividends no doubt 
As a long time fan of T  both as a customer and investor  I am watching the stock here  without any positions in either T or VZ  The ability for AT T to drive free cash flow and  synergies   i e  expense savings  from the DirecTV merger is crucial  We ll find out more in April  16 on how T is doing integrating DirecTV 
Here is the weekly chart of T showing it near the top of a 6 year trading range 

A trade through  38  39 on heavy volume and T makes sense as a capital appreciation play  as much as a dividend play  No question though  the earnings expectations for 2016 are subdued 
VZ is testing the 2013 high near  53 81 and T is testing the 2012 and 2013 highs near  38 50  38 80  Both stocks are at the high end of multi year trading ranges

Monday lower 
ES pivot 2023 67  Holding below is bearish 
Rest of week bias lower technically 
Monthly outlook  bias higher 
Single stock trader  ended 

Happy New Year  And good riddance to 2015  With all the holidays now out of the way and a full week of trading ahead of us to start off 2016  let s see what the charts have to offer us and what might be in store for Monday 
The technicals
The Dow  Last Thursday  for anyone who can remember that far back  the Dow plunged through its 200 day MA with a 179 point loss  On top of that  the indicators all started moving lower  falling off of overbought and the stochastic gave us a completed bearish crossover  All of that looks simply bearish for Monday 
The VIX  In contrast to an ugly looking Dow chart   on Thursday the VIX  while rising just over 5   did it on a very tall lopsided spinning top  almost an inverted hammer  Although indicators continue to rise  they are no longer oversold and there is at least a suggestion of a reversal lower here for Monday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 08 AM EST with ES down 0 77   Last Thursday  like the Dow  ES broke through its 200 day MA with a very ugly red candle  making it two in a row to fall back to 2035 and a half  That sent it just to the edge of overbought with a freshly completed bearish stochastic crossover  The new Sunday overnight is now down nearly as much  making this all look pretty grim indeed 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2061 00 to 2041 17  ES remains below its new pivot so this indicator is clearly bearish 
Dollar index  After falling relentlessly through the last half of December  the dollar has now reversed course and exited that descending RTC  We now in fact have a bullish trigger on that as indicators continue to rise off of oversold  The dollar last Thursday in fact rose 0 4  and with no resistance now until back in the middle of December  it looks like it will test its upper BB on Monday at 66 32  on the USD UPX  
Euro  Similarly the euro is now has now fallen out of its rising RTC from last month  and last Thursday continued that descent falling all the way back down to 1 0859  Indicators are now oversold but the stochastic is still a long way from even starting a bullish crossover  And with the lower BB now not too far away at 1 0821  I wouldn t be surprised to see the euro test that level on Monday 
Transportation  After a decidedly weak showing on Wednesday  last Thursday the trans fell further  but this 0 38  loss was on a red spinning top  Although the indicators are all now moving lower just short of overbought  there s at least the suggestion of reversal here for Monday  though one which requires confirmation 

This wasn t too bad  Four months of four digit returns and only one losing month  Recall that the  Dow points  are calculating by taking abs  Dow open   Dow close  and adding that number to each month when I called the close correctly and subtracting it when I was wrong 
For conditional calls  I increment the  conditional  column when I m right and the  wrong  column when I m wrong  but I don t take any Dow points for conditional calls since there s no fixed starting value for them  The  no call  column is a bit of a misnomer  That gets incremented when I make an  uncertain  call 
On days when I make no call at all  like if I take a vacation  then nothing gets changed  I think this is a pretty reasonable way to gauge my effectiveness at calling the action of the market a day ahead of time    And the winner is    
The first day of January is historically quite bullish but I don t think that s going to be the case this year  The charts are uniformly bearish and the futures tonight are looking just plain awful  apparently on some bad economic news from our pals the Chicoms  I m afraid I m just going to have to call Monday lower  This doesn t bode well for the First Five Days of January indicator either

OK  so we all know what happened on Wednesday   it was Stockopalypse Now  I ve been resisting the temptation to compare this to 2008 because everyone s been saying how this isn t 2008  Then I got one of those emails from one of my brokers today about how it was important to stay the course and not to panic  etc  The last time I got one of those was in  yes  2008  So let s take a good look at the bogeyman 2008  Here he is  on the left 


OK  and then here s today s action on the right   Click to enlarge  as they say   Take a look at the action of October 2008 compared to January 2016  The similarities are striking  I d say 
OK  so in the meantime  let s see where the world is going on Thursday  before it comes to a sudden and awful end 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow s monthly low close of last August was 15 666  interesting how that 666 keeps coming up  isn t it  666 was also the SPX low in 2009   On Wednesday we retested that low  successfully as it turns out  The resulting candle was a fat hammer  the biggest we ve seen this year so far  and on heavier than normal volume  If you don t believe the Dow will hit zero in April then you must believe there comes a point when all the margin calls have been satisified  all the scaredy cats have fled  and all the shorts have shorted all they dare  I don t know if Wednesday was capitulation  but the headlines in the paper and on the TV news were all about the stock market  And that s always a good sign the bottom is near  Of course when we get into these sorts of death spirals  we have to see confirmation so I can t call it just yet 
The VIX  I was thinking the VIX might go lower on Wednesday  but instead it gained nearly 6  on a giant lopsided long legged doji star that tested its upper BB before falling back  Once again the upper BB proved to be the third rail of the VIX  With two thirds of a bearish evening star now in place I m thinking this could be a sign that the VIX moves lower on Thursday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 34 AM EST with ES up 0 08   Mr  Market must have had an excellent lunch on Wednesday because shortly after 12 30 PM the market began reversing its ugly declines of the morning with ES ending the day on a very tall classic hammer  This candle also marked the second day trading outside the year long descending RTC and that qualifies as a bullish trigger  Whether or not that actually means anything remains to be seen  However we note that the new overnight is trading non trivially higher  Also the indicators all continue slowly but steadily rising off of oversold and that eventually has to count for something 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 1878 92 to 1845 92  That again places ES back above its new pivot so this indicator continues its flip flopping  this time back to bullish 
Dollar index  Last night the dollar disconfirmed Tuesday s dark cloud cover by gaining 0 14  on a small doji star  Indicators remain overbought but the action over the past week has been herky jerky and therefore I just can t come up with a valid reason to call it one way or the other tonight 
Euro  And it s pretty much the same story with the euro which seems to be stuck lately in a congestion range between the area of 1 086 and 1 096  The indicators are pretty much all just moving sideways so they are no help  And the bottom line here is that I am not touching this chart either tonight 
Transportation  In something of an odd bullish divergence of sorts  on Wednesday the trans lost only 0 48   in other words  three times better than the performance of the Dow  The resulting candle was a very long legged doji star on increased volume  Indicators remain oversold so the next move could just possibly be higher although given the performance year to date this requires confirmation 

Tonight we have a successful retest of the August lows and big hammers on the charts  usually good reversal signs  But the prevailing sentiment has been just so awful for so long lately that I m leery of calling the market higher  I d say we re overdue for a reversal but none of the reversal signs has been panning out all year so far  We re also not close enough to the ES pivot to make a conditional call so I guess all that leaves is Thursday uncertain

Things were looking great for my call for a higher close Wednesday   until oil collapsed   again  That sent the rest of the market lower after a wild ride that saw triple digit moves both up and down in the Dow before ending with a 76 point loss  Tonight I m short on time again so it s another Night Owl Lite night

I think things got a bit overextended on Wednesday and the VIX is now looking ready to move lower  finally  so I m going to try this again and call Thursday higher

It s been quite an interesting week in the markets so far  Many of the charts are in play right around their 200 day moving averages and oil still seems to be in the driver s seat  With yet another surprising move on Thursday  we turn the charts to try to make some sense of all of these shenanigans for Friday 
The technicals
The Dow  After finding support at its 200 day MA on Tuesday the Dow broke under on Wednesday but put in a gigantic spinning top the likes of which I ve never seen  and I went all the way back to the crazy days of 2008   I figured that was a good reversal sign and indeed on Thursday the Dow moved higher again to just barely reclaim the same MA on a tall inverted hammer  Indicators continue to be confused some rising  some falling halfway between overbought and oversold so there s no guidance there  However on Thursday the Dow closed above the MA so I think that number will now serve as support  So if anything there s a good possibility of the Dow could add to these gains on Friday 
The VIX  On Wednesday the VIX touched its upper BB at 19 93 and right on cue it backed off it  And as I ve often said the upper BB generally spells the end of a VIX rally  That proved to be the case on Thursday as the VIX lost 1 38  bouncing off that same upper BB with a small doji star  Indicators are now just short of overbought and with the star in place there s at least the suggestion that the VIX could go lower again on Friday 
Market index futures  Thursday night  all three futures were higher at 12 11 AM EST with ES up 0 17   After breaking below its 200 day MA on Wednesday things weren t looking so hot for ES  But on Thursday it managed to post a small gain closing back up to 2049 25  just shy of its 200 day MA after some intraday excursions above that level  That could be taken as a failed test of the MA but we have the benefit of the new Thursday overnight which is showing a nice gap up over that level and making it look like it has enough gas in the tank for a move higher on Friday  Note also that the stochastic is now on the verge of a bullish crossover and volume has increased 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot ticks up from 2052 00 to 2053 33  That s just barely enough to put ES negligibly below it new pivot  I m calling this one a wash 
Dollar index  After getting hammered over the course of the past week the dollar seems to have finally bottomed on Wednesday  stopping just short of its 200 day MA  Indicators are now quite oversold and we got a decent bounce up 0 64  on Thursday  This makes it look like more upside could be coming on Friday 
Euro  And the euro was also telling us something on the charts on Thursday  After a big gain on Wednesday that just touched its 200 day MA it retreated significantly retracing those gains on Thursday  With that MA now serving as resistance  the indicators all overbought and a negative candle on the books it looks like there s more downside to come on Friday  The action lower in the overnight seems to support that idea 
Transportation  The trans have been getting absolutely hammered for three weeks now but after a giant decline on Tuesday that had a whiff of panic to it   on Wednesday the trans found a bit of buying coming in in the form of a classic spinning top doji star and then that was confirmed on Thursday with a 0 57  gain its first up day since December 4th  That confirms the spinning top and makes it look that there could be more upside coming on Friday particularly with the indicators now all being significantly oversold 


With the charts generally looking at least modestly bullish and certainly not bearish  and with ES having regained its 200 day MA and carrying higher though the overnight  so far anyway   I m going to go out on a limb and call Friday higher  Keep in mind there s some economic news coming out on Friday that could easily derail that given the fragile state of Mr  Market s personality lately  but for now  that s what I see 
That s all she wrote  See you again Sunday night

Last night I said that Verizon was not a buy and indeed on Thursday was only one of a handful of losers on the Dow  down four cents  But the chart is even worse than that with a freshly completed bearish stochastic crossover and three spinning tops in a row now  There are no bullish signs at all on this chart  It is definitely still not a swing trade buy   or a buy of any other kind ",2015-12-11,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-stock-market-forecast-375475,375475

Well it looks like I picked a bad day to be wrong last Friday  as the Dow Jones tanked 310 points with all 30 components lower in a broad based sell off as oil continued to sink  That led to some important changes  so let s take a look at them as we start off what may be the most momentous week in a long long time as the market is just waiting for the Fed announcement on interest rates  The fact that it s an options expiration doesn t help matters either  One thing s for sure   we re in for a bumpy ride 
The technicals
The Dow  The 200 day MA proved to be no support at all as last Friday the Dow broke right through it for its biggest drop since August stopping only on its lower BB  And even this giant 1 76  crash wasn t enough to take the indicators oversold  They re all heading lower  but still not there yet  The Dow successfully tested support from the November lows though which is about the best that can be said for it  Other than that  there s nothing at all bullish about this chart tonight 
The VIX  Last Thursday night I noted that the VIX had touched its upper BB and suggested that might mean it could go lower on Friday  That proved to be a very bad suggestion as instead the VIX popped an astonishing 26  on Friday on a giant gap up green marubozu that blasted right through its upper BB to not only close above 20 but almost 25 for its highest finish since the last big spike we got back in September  That was enough to drive the indicators overbought and even send the stochastic starting to curve around for a bearish crossover  But we re not there yet  so it s too soon to call this chart lower on Monday  Sometimes when the VIX gets this excited  it takes it a few days for it to come back to its senses 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 59 AM EST with ES up 0 49   Perhaps the ugliest charter last Friday came from ES  After stopping right on its 200 day MA on Thursday  on Friday it was completely unable to make any headway at all and crashed right back down through its lower BB at 2018 50  and then kept right on going to close at 2009 75  That was its worst showing since last September  It was also enough to send the indicators oversold and it stopped just shy of the November lows  Interestingly  the new Sunday overnight seems to be attempting to stage something of a small rally and after such a big one day lost one might expect at least a DCB on Monday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dives from 2053 33 to 2023 67  That still leaves ES below its new pivot  although it appears to be making an attempt to climb out of its crater as I write  But for the time being this indicator continues bearish 
Dollar index  I missed the dollar last Thursday night too  Instead of rising  it gave up all of Thursday s gains and then some for a 0 44  decline that sent it right back oversold  The stochastic is now threaded out at a low level so is useless for predictive purposes at this point  The candlestick is something of a lopsided bearish engulfing pattern though  so if anything  this chart looks lower again on Monday 
Euro  And of course I missed the euro on Friday too  After looking lower Thursday night  instead it climbed right back up to close at 1 0992  leaving it still overbought  However  the new Sunday overnight is actually going higher again  now back over 1 10  And with the 200 day MA now at 1 1038  not too far away  it s entirely possible the euro might want to take a look at that level on Monday 
Transportation  And finally  as bad as the Dow s 1 76  dump was last Friday  it was only worse with the trans which loss 1 91  on a tall red marubozu  This continues what is now a three week long waterfall decline dribbling down their lower BB and is now as bad as it was last August  Indicators continue to be oversold  but that doesn t seem to help any  And there s no support from here until the August bottom at 7465  So just like the Dow  there s nothing bullish about this chart either tonight  and Dow Theory wise  that ain t a good sign 

I m probably a fool for even attempting to make any calls on an op ex week featuring such a big Fed meeting but here goes anyway  I think Friday s action was overdone to the down side  Note particularly that the SPX Hi Lo indicator has now hit 2 5  and that s definitely the territory from which rallies spring  We re also at a few key support levels and with no economic news scheduled for Monday  I m just going to give this another try and call Monday higher  Hey  I can t be wrong forever

At least I was right last Thursday night when I called Verizon lower because on Friday it dropped another 1 1  on a tall gap down inverted hammer  And even that only left the indicators about halfway between overbought and oversold  With no support now until 44 58  I see no sign of a move higher on Monday ",2015-12-14,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-stock-market-forecast-375679,375679

It s nice to see the technicals play out as expected for once and on Tuesday they delivered nicely with a 156 point gain in the Dow  I was a bit surprised to see a move this big ahead of the Fed  but it is what it is  Moving forward  it is my standing policy to never call Fed days  and this one coming up is about the best one I can think of to stay away from  Accordingly  we re skipping the detailed charts tonight  There s no point in analyzing anything when the conclusion is foregone

Recap
I had a bad feeling about Wednesday  After all  all year long it was clear that Mr  Market hates everything  But then right at 2 PM Auntie Janet served up some of her tasty Interest Rate Surprise and it was like  hey Mikey  He likes it  With the Dow up 1 28   the SPX up 1 45  and the Nasdaq up 1 52   it was a sea of green on the Street as the Night Owl had her best day of the year so far  Yum  There were some interesting charts to be sure but now we have to ask  will Mr  Market have a sugar crash on Thursday or will he be hankering for another helping of Feds  Let s check the charts to find out 
Let me also add that with Christmas coming next week  the Night Owl is planning to take the entire week off  With a holiday shortened week and after all the excitement this week  I m sure a lot of traders will be ready for a vacation 
The technicals
The Dow  Looking at it from a purely technical point of view on Monday  we got a nice hammer on the Dow  which was confirmed on Tuesday  And on Wednesday  we got the payoff in the form of a tall green marubozu good for a 2 24 point pop that took the Dow straight through its 200 day MA  That left indicators only barely off of oversold with a long way to go before hitting overbought  So with a new rising RTC established with three up days in a row  something haven t seen in since the end of September   this chart looks flat out bullish for Thursday 
The VIX  On Monday  the VIX traded almost entirely above its 200 day MA by putting in a fat red spinning top  That was confirmed on Tuesday with a small gap down spinning top that completed a bearish evening star  And that in turn was confirmed on Wednesday with another gap down spinning top  this one red that resulted in a nearly 15  decline   That leaves the VIX just above its 200 day MA at 16 51 with falling indicators and a completed bearish stochastic corssover  And there s no reason to believe that it won t try to touch that level on Thursday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 49 AM EST with ES down 0 29   Like the Dow and the SPX  on Wednesday ES smashed right through its 200 day MA in this case at 2049 to finish at 2072 on a tall green candle  That leaves all of the indicators rising towards overbought  but they re not there yet  With Monday s green spinning top confirmed and no real resistance between here and 2090  there is technically nothing bearish about this chart tonight  The only worry is that after such a big three day gain  investors might want to be taking some profits off the table on Thursday  and the overnight pin action seems to be supporting that idea  Oh   something else to note   it looks to me like ES is putting in a double bottom with support at 2007  a bullish sign for sure  Just take a look at the daily chart here and see if you don t agree 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2039 50 to 2063 00  Even at that  ES is still above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  For all the hoopla on Wednesday  it wasn t particularly reflected in the dollar which lost 0 41   a move that in other times might have seemed large but given the giant decline we saw just two weeks ago  it was nothing out of the ordinary  This fat red spinning top in bearish harami position sent the indicators moving lower before ever reaching overbought  That makes it questionable whether the dollar can advance any further on Thursday 
Euro  And on Wednesday  the euro which had been frustrated for a week now by its own 200 day MA at 1 1038 finally gave up the ghost with a gap down red marubozu that took it back to 1 0889  That also sent all the indicator is falling off of overbought and left the stochastic in full on bearish crossover mode  And that leaves nothing at all bullish about this chart for Thursday 
Transportation  And finally the trans also had a great day on Wednesday with a 1 8  gain on a tall green marubozu  That confirms Monday s hammer and sent all of the indicators rising off of oversold  We are now also just on the edge of a three week long descending RTC for a bullish set up  It very well looks like the three week long descending RTC might finally be over  In any case tonight  there s nothing at all bearish about this chart for Thursday 

Surely I can t be the only person who was surprised at the extent of the rally the last two days  I think this may tempt traders to take some profits  and some may develop a case of Fed remorse  Either way  although the charts are uniformly bullish tonight  the futures are guiding lower and we may be in for a pause or a bit of retracement on Thursday so I m going to make a conditional call  if ES can stay above its new pivot by mid morning  we ll close Thursday higher  but if it breaks under and stays there  we close lower

On Wednesday  Verizon was one of the better performers in the Dow and that was good enough for a better than 2  pop  That move took it above its upper BB on a tall green candle for a new rising RTC  Indicators are now all solidly rising along with a nicely completed bullish stochastic crossover  Since we are still nowhere near overbought  there might still be some more upside available on Thursday but this bus has now left the station  so it is sadly no longer a swing trade buy ",2015-12-17,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-stock-market-forecast-376140,376140

Recap
Blame it on Fed regret or on the price of oil which snapped a two day winning streak on Thursday to resume its downward march  but the recent market rally is now over  We re going to take one more look at the charts for Friday before taking next week off for the Christmas holidays  I m not expecting a lot of market action next week anyway 
The technicals
The Dow  With a dark cloud cover on Thursday that saw the Dow fall right back through the same 200 day MA that it broke above the day before  this chart now turns decidedly bearish for Friday 
The VIX  In a similar vein  on Thursday the VIX rose 6 05  but the candle belies that small move  It was a tall green marubozu that successfully tested its own 200 day MA and finished by giving us a bullish piercing pattern  Although indicators are not yet oversold the stochastic is starting to come around for a bullish crossover and the net impression of this chart is bullish 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 31 AM EST with ES down 0 25   Like the Dow  on Thursday ES completely reversed course and fell right back through its own 200 day MA on a tall red candle to finish right back down to 2034 25  On top of that the new overnight is continuing lower and that is causing a brand new bearish stochastic crossover before the indicators have even reached overbought  That s not a good sign and so I m not optimistic for Friday here 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot drops from 2063 00 to 2049 67  That now puts ES below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar Index  Perhaps the most extraordinary chart of the day was the dollar which took a massive 1 47  gap up pop thus completely canceling Wednesday s bearish harami  With such a big gap below it now  it looks like two thirds of a bearish evening star so I give better than even odds at this point that the dollar goes lower on Friday 
Euro  And of course just as impressively on Thursday the euro ignored a bullish harami to gap down on a tall red marubozu and close back down to 1 0830  That sent all the indicators continuing lower and they are now just off of oversold  And that marks a clear rejection of its 200 day MA and the start of a new downtrend  The overnight seems to be trying to stage something of a rally but I m not convinced it will hold through Friday 
Transportation  The trans was as bearish as anything else in the charts on Thursday  completely unable to make any headway above Wednesday s highs as they fell a large 2  to give up all of Wednesday s gains and half of Tuesday s as well  Even at that the indicators continue rising just barely off of oversold  Still with such a tall red candle it s hard to find anything bullish about this chart tonight 

And the winner is    
What a difference a day makes  With a promising rally short circuited and all of the charts looking rather bearish tonight I m just going to call Friday lower  I ll be happy to be proven wrong  That s all she wrote 
See you again not this coming Sunday night but the week after that since I m taking next week off  Merry Christmas one and all

Now we turn our attention to the waning days of the year as we look forward to 2016  With another holiday shortened week ahead  I m considering extending my vacation  And I m also not expecting a lot of action on New Year  s Eve  leaving just three days here 
In fact I was contemplating just taking the entire week off once again but what the heck  I just can t stay away that long and after all it s the last gasp of the year so let s at least take a look to see how Monday will shake out  Of course  there s little point in reviewing four day old charts  so we ll do a Night Owl Lite and just present the conclusions  Maybe I ll do Tuesday too

The first day after Christmas is historically quite bullish according to the Stock Traders Almanac  We ve also been seeing a run of down Fridays that are followed by up Mondays  However  tonight we re looking at a monster three day run up last week ending in a red inverted hammer  coupled with sagging futures in the Sunday overnight 
I note too that the indicators are all quite confused tonight with RSI and money flow falling but momentum and the stochastic rising  and OBV flat  Because of all this  plus the difficulty of calling a day following an extended holiday  I will simply note a modestly bearish bias but not enough to actually call Monday lower  So I guess all that leaves is Monday uncertain

It was probably good that I called Monday uncertain because after a morning dip  the Dow wobbled its way back to finish off just 24 points on low holiday week volume  We re going to write one more post for 2015 and then call it a year as I m not expecting much of anything on Wednesday and even less on New Year s Eve 
The technicals
The Dow  After a bearish candle last Thursday  on Monday the Dow gapped down through its 200 day MA but ended with a very long tailed hammer  Not quite sure what to make of that since the indicators continue to be confused with half rising and the rest falling as they meander around between overbought and oversold  So there s really no clear direction here for Tuesday 
The VIX  And in exact mirror image  the VIX gapped up above its own 200 day MA on Monday  gaining 7 43  but on a red candle  Frustratingly  indicators remain oversold and the stochastic has just barely squeaked out a bullish crossover  It was a bullish exit from a descending RTC though so the overall impression is less than totally clear 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 10 AM EST with ES up 0 16   On Monday  ES successfully tested its 200 day MA with a tall hanging man to close down just a bit at 2048 75  That leaves the indicators just short of overbought and the stochastic on the brink of a bearish crossover  The new overnight is trading just outside the rising RTC for a bearish setup but in the absence of a move lower and an apparent rally forming in the wee hours  it s hard to call this chart for Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2053 33 to 2046 17  That s enough to put ES back above its new pivot so this indicator now turns bullish 
Dollar Index  On Monday the dollar gapped down for the second day in a row but only for a 0 07  loss on a small doji star  With indicators nearly oversold this is looking like a possible reversal for Tuesday 
Euro  The euro also did little on Monday  rising back to 1 1005 on a small green candle that sent the indicators overbought  Despite that  the new overnight is continuing higher so in the absence of a reversal candle  I d have to guess the euro gains some more on Tuesday 
Transportation  After peaking on Thursday  the trans dropped 0 73  on Monday to exit a rising RTC for a bearish setup  Indicators are confused though  some rising  some falling  The net impression is bearish but there s considerable uncertainty around that 

The charts are a bit muddled tonight and if anything have a bearish bend to them  But ES seems to be staging something of a comeback as I write  Generally that would be cause for an  uncertain  call but I think I ll hedge it with a conditional  If ES can stay above its new pivot by mid morning Tuesday  we ll close higher  If it falls below and stays there  we close lower 
That s all she wrote and that wraps up 2015

I called the Dow higher for Wednesday but the market finished virtually unchanged  Of course that s an interesting development   so let s check out the implications of the latest charts for the market on Friday as we close out the week with option expirations for November 
The technicals
The Dow  On Thursday   the Dow went basically nowhere as it oscillated about the unchanged line to finish with a perfect doji star on its smallest range day since October 26th  Indicators are similarly wandering around halfway between overbought and oversold and thus are not particularly useful tonight  So that leaves us with a weak reversal warning but one that requires confirmation on Friday  This may just reflect uncertainty over option expiration days which often feature strange action 
The VIX  Wednesday night I thought that the VIX did not look particularly bullish for Thursday and indeed it tested its 200 day MA early on  But in the end it bounced right off it to post a small 0 83  gain on an inverted hammer  That left all the indicators somewhat confused with RSI rising but momentum and the stochastic both falling  So at this point it looks like the 200 MA at 16 is providing some support here and it s not clear that the VIX will want to go below that on Friday  Some limited upside isn t out of the question either 
Market index futures  Thursday night  all three futures are mixed at 12 13 AM EST with ES down 0 04  but YM up 0 06   Wednesday night I couldn t find any bearish signs at all on this chart  but after such a big gain on Wednesday it looks like ES finally ran out of gas on Thursday putting in a doji star sitting right at the top of Wednesday s close  This is a reversal warning that requires confirmation and it looks like we re getting it in the new overnight as ES is running lower and all of the indicators are still a bit short of overbought  So it is possible this one could move lower on Friday 
ES daily pivot  Thursday night the ES daily pivot rises from 2068 42 to 2081 25   That s enough to put ES back below its new pivot so this indicator now turns back to bearish 
Dollar Index  Wednesday night I noted a reversal warning in the dollar but noted that it required confirmation on Thursday  Well we got that confirmation big time as the dollar plunged 0 68  on a gap down red candle  That was enough to send the indicators off of overbought and also cause a bearish stochastic crossover  So right now it looks like there s more room for the the dollar to run lower on Friday despite all the noise you re hearing in the media about the strength of the dollar 
Euro  I also got the euro correct Wednesday night when I called for a higher close on Thursday as it bounced right back up to 1 0736 after a nice doji star on Wednesday  That leaves it hanging right on the edge of a month long descending RTC for a bullish setup  However the overnight is showing no interest in any sort of follow through and the indicators are confused  wandering around halfway between overbought and oversold  So right now the general impression is that it s possible the euro may run lower on Friday 
Transportation  At least I got this much correct  After a nice gain on Wednesday the trans followed it up with another 1  advance on Thursday  Indicators continue to rise off of oversold but have yet to reach overbought  In addition the upper BB is not until 8333 so there s still some room to rise here and now with a confirmed two white soldiers marching on there is still nothing bearish about this chart for Friday 

The market s failure to advance on Thursday after its 200 MA breakout make me cautious  Add in a lackluster overnight in the futures and VIX that just bounced off its own 200 day MA and it s not clear where the buyers are going to be coming from  But there are still no outright bearish signs on the charts so with Friday being op ex anyway  I m just going to call Friday uncertain  That s all she wrote  Reminder   I m taking next week off so I ll see you again Sunday night after next

Recap
I decided to take last week off because I wasn t expecting much action at all on the holiday shortened week  And nothing is pretty much what we got with the Dow trading in a tiny range all week long and moving very little  But now with everybody full of turkey and back to work again it s time to see where is market is headed on Monday  So let s get right to the charts as we close out the month
The technicals
The Dow  There s really very little to say about this chart tonight other than the fact that the indicators are all highly overbought at this point and with a pile of dojis in place it looks like there s more downside risk and upside potential at this point 
The VIX  Last Tuesday VIX made a failed attempt to break above its 200 day MA  That was followed by a gap down red candle on Wednesday and then a tall inverted hammer on Friday in a short session  All of this leaves the VIX now quite oversold and the stochastic primed for a bullish crossover  Of course it s hard to say after a holiday shortened week like this but right now it looks like the VIX has a better than even chance of moving higher on Monday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 47 AM EST with ES down 0 17   After a week s worth of dojis and going nowhere  on Sunday night ES is offering us more of the same  It is down slightly in the new Sunday overnight but still within a week long trading range  However the indicators tell a different story  They have now fallen off of extreme overbought levels and the stochastic has formed a bearish crossover  Therefore this chart definitely looks lower for Monday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2087 58 to 2089 92   That puts ES back below its new pivot so this indicator is back to bearish 
Dollar Index  The dollar meanwhile wobbled its way higher last week  but despite hitting a close not seen since last April 13th it has yet to hit overbought on the indicators  Therefore with the upper BB still a ways above us it looks like the dollar still has room to run higher on Monday 
Euro  And similarly  last week the euro continued wending its way lower as it continued what is now a two month long descending RTC after dropping below its 200 day MA on October 22nd  That left it closing Friday at 1 0602  its lowest close since April 13th  And even with all of that the indicators are not yet oversold  And with further downside in the new Sunday overnight it looks like selling is not yet over 
Transportation  The trans fell for two days last week before putting in a tall hammer  On Friday they rose out of a short falling RTC for a bullish setup  Indicators remain just short of overbought but the stochastic is starting to curve around for a bullish crossover  So this chart actually looks more bullish than bearish at this point 

The last trading day of November according to The Stock Trader s Almanac is bearish  And the overall look of the charts tonight seems to support that  Therefore I am going to go ahead and call Monday lower

Verizon fell out of a rising RTC last week for a bearish setup  But that was not confirmed and instead we now have a stochastic that looks primed to form a bullish crossover as well as a bullish engulfing candle  So I am now going to call this a speculative swing trade buy for Monday ",2015-11-30,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-stock-market-forecast-272837,272837

Monday ran true to historical form as the Dow lost 79 points to close out November on a down note  That now brings us to December and we go right to the charts to see where the first day might be headed

Not  I m sorry   just  disappointed   Hey  it couldn t happen to a bigger blowhard  Silver  you arrogant career crook  Hopefully  you ll use your upcoming time in the slammer to contemplate the error of your ways  This restores my faith in karma  I guess sometimes there s justice after all 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow s tall red candle Monday was enough to send indicators off of their extreme overbought levels just to the very edge of overbought  The stochastic has also now completed a bearish crossover and is moving lower too  This move was also enough to break us out of last week s narrow trading range  So once again  there is nothing bullish all about this chart tonight 
The VIX  Last night  I gave the VIX a better than even chance of moving higher on Monday and that s exactly what it did  gaining 6 68  to test its 200 day MA at 16 25  That test was rejected though  but the VIX still managed to close just above 16 and just below the MA  This move also sent the indicators rising off of oversold and also gave us a fresh bullish stochastic crossover  This serves as confirmation for last Friday s inverted hammer and makes it likely that the VIX will take another stab at the 200 MA again on Tuesday  Basically it looks like there s still more upside available to the VIX at this point 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 16 AM EST with ES up 0 55   On Monday  ES had its biggest drop since November 13th as it fell out of its recent trading range to close back down to 2080  That just barely sent it off of overbought and also confirmed a bearish stochastic crossover  But what s interesting to note is that the new overnight is rising significantly and that is pushing it right back into that trading range as well as curving the stochastic around to cancel the bearish crossover  So at this point  it s a little premature to call ES lower on Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2089 92 to 2084 42  That now puts ES back above its new pivot  so this indicator turns bullish again 
Dollar index  Last night I said the dollar still had room to run higher on Monday and so it did  gaining another 0 14   But it did it on a perfect doji star  which is something of a reversal warning  However  the indicators are nowhere near overbought yet  so we have to take that with a grain of salt  In fact  the dollar remains in a two week long rising RTC and the upper BB is still a long ways from here  In fact  there is no resistance until back to the beginning of last April  So while tonight is not outright bullish  I just can t call the dollar lower yet from here 
Euro  Last night  I said that the selling in the euro didn t quite look over yet and indeed it wasn t as on Monday it fell again  this time back down   1 0576  its lowest close since April 13th  That makes it three down in a row and the new overnight is going lower again as the euro remains in a month long descending RTC  With the lower BB not until 1 0504   the euro seems to be intent on touching that level before too long  In the meantime there s nothing bullish about this chart tonight 
Transportation  Last Friday  the trans exited a short descending RTC for a bullish setup  But that s why we require two days of upward activity for a confirmation of a trend reversal  And we did not get that as on Monday  the trans greatly underperformed the Dow  losing 1 39  on a tall red marubozu that sent the indicators continuing lower  though they have yet to reach oversold  In any case with no support nearby until 8053  it looks like there s more downside to come here on Tuesday 

The charts don t look all that bullish at the moment to be sure  and although the first day of most months is bullish  that s not particularly the case for December  Still  December is one of the best months for the market and the futures are all sufficiently higher that I don t feel like fighting this particular tape  so I m just going to call Tuesday higher

Last night I called Verizon a speculative buy and on Monday  it did indeed gain another half a percent on high volume  That was enough to send the indicators moving higher though they are still only halfway to overbought  It also completed a nice bullish stochastic crossover  The resulting candle is a fat spinning top though  so there s at least bit of the reversal warning here but one which requires confirmation  In the meantime  I would just put a stop under this one and let it ride as we definitely don t have a solid bearish warning at this point ",2015-12-01,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-stock-market-forecast-272974,272974

After looking like it was going to break to the downside on Monday  on Tuesday the Dow instead reversed course to post a decent 168 point gain  That changes the picture  so let s take a quick look at the charts to see where Wednesday is headed  There s no point in going into too much detail since with a bunch of Feddage due out  the conclusion is pretty much up in the air 
 The technicals
The Dow  After breaking to the downside on Monday from last week s tiny rangebound action  on Tuesday the Dow turned around and broke above the upper end of that range on a tall green marubozu  By putting in both lower lows and higher highs  the Dow is now forming a small megaphone pattern and since those usually exit in the direction from which they were entered  that bodes well for the rest of the week  I ll also note that stochastic is now on the verge of a bullish crossover from a high level  and as I always say  those are often good for another day or two if higher prices 
The VIX  Equally importantly  on Tuesday the VIX did try to break above its 200 day MA as I predicted last night  But this attempt failed even worse than Monday s and the VIX ended giving up totally  dropping over 9  on a fat inverted hammer  That sent the indicators right back to oversold and cancelled what looks like a developing bullish stochastic crossover  It also broke support at 15 14 and left the VIX just above its next support level at 14  So with nothing at all between here and there  it s entirely possible that it could go lower again on Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are slightly higher at 12 19 AM EST with ES up 0 02   After looking decidedly bearish last night  ES greatly surprised me with a major advance on Tuesday that handily cleared recent resistance around 2091 to close all the way back up to 2100 on the dot  That leaves only resistance at 2103 at this point  but all indicators are now back to overbought  So it s not clear if ES has enough gas in the tank to follow through on Wednesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2084 42 to 2095 00  That still leaves ES above its new pivot  so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  I was cautious about the dollar last night  but on Tuesday it confirmed Monday s reversal candle with a fat gap down red spinning top that left the indicators in disarray just short of overbought  Overall  this chart looks more bearish than anything but it s hardly a given 
Euro  After looking completely intent to reach parity by the end of the year  on Tuesday the euro staged something a major reversal with a tall green marubozu that brought it right back to 1 063  That caused all the indicators to reverse course just before they were going to hit oversold and also gave us a bullish setup on a descending RTC exit  So right now  it looks like there s a chance the euro could follow through on Wednesday with some additional upside 
Transportation  After an ugly looking Monday  on Tuesday the trans got almost all of it back following a tall red marubozu with a green one  That caused the indicators to stop their decline just before hitting oversold and also curved the stochastic around in preparation for a bullish crossover  leaving this chart sort of up in the air at the moment 

Although the charts are now all looking generally bullish tonight  that s not being reflected in the futures  My guess is that people are just going to sit on their hands until the latest Feddage is out of the way  So much as I m thinking this market wants to go higher  I m going to content myself with calling Wednesday uncertain 
Single Stock Trader
Verizon was a relative laggard on the Dow Tuesday  advancing just 13 cents on a spindly spinning top  That left the indicators somewhat confused and wandering around halfway between oversold and overbought  Both momentum and RSI are falling  but money flow and OBV are rising  In addition  the stochastic now has a freshly completed bullish crossover  so at this point it s kind of a toss up  My personal inclination would be to put a stop under it at this point and if it goes down on Wednesday  then just let it go  If not  then let it ride ",2015-12-02,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-stock-market-forecast-273152,273152

Recap
Well Wednesday afternoon  Auntie Janet Spaketh and Mr  Market didn t Liketh it  dropping 159 in the Dow to end near session lows  And to top it all off  it s another Nite Owl Lite Nite as I just plum ran out of time to put the blog together  So it s just the conclusions  no discussions   And I apologize for neglecting to update the Wednesday headline call  It really was  uncertain   as given on the Bottom Line

ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2095 00 to 2087 17 That puts ES below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 

Wednesday sort of undid all the progress we made on Tuesday  and the charts tonight are once again looking generally pretty negative  But from a slightly wider perspective  it looks like we re still in the same rut as last week  just a bit wider ranging now  We re near the bottom of the range  but the indicators are looking lower and the VIX is wanting to run higher  So I hate to do it  but with this sort of confusion in the charts I have no choice but to throw up my hands and call Thursday uncertain

I m sure glad I called Thursday uncertain because the Dow had its worst day since late September on Thursday  down 252 points  You can blame the price of oil  the ECB  rising interest rate fears  or the phase of the moon   whatever  In any case it was a bad day at Black Rock  At least we now finally have a decisive break from a two week long stretch of indecision so let s take a look at the charts and see which way Friday is going 
The technicals
The Dow  On Thursday the Dow took a giant 1 42  dump to go crashing right back through its 200 day MA  That s a bad sign and left the indicators oversold  and continued the current bearish stochastic crossover  Just looking at the daily chart here there s really nothing bullish to say about it now 
The VIX  Similarly on Thursday the VIX jumped right up through its own 200 day MA with a giant 13 83  pop that just exactly rang the gong on its upper BB at 19 45 before falling back a bit to 18 11  That continued the indicators rising towards overbought though they re are not there yet  However  the upper BB touch is always a bearish sign for the VIX so it s not certain it will move higher again Friday 
Market index futures  Thursday night  all three futures are higher at 12 56 AM EST with ES up 0 18   And like everything else  on Thursday ES took its biggest drop since September 28th  This featured a test of its 200 day MA but that was successful as the MA provided support and it closed exactly on it at 2051 25  The indicators are now very close to oversold but not quite there yet  However with such a big drop in one day I would say a DCB or relief rally is not out of the question for Friday  And so far a non trivial gain in the overnight Thursday seems to be supporting that idea 
ES daily pivot  Thursday night  the ES daily pivot fell again from 2087 17 to 2062 17  That still leaves ES below its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish 

Dollar Index  On Thursday  the dollar got totally hammered courtesy of Super Mario with a with an unbelievable 2 39  death dive  one so big I couldn t even find anything comparable scrolling back five years  This monster gap down red marubozu took the dollar oversold and sent all the indicators plunging lower  It is now very close to its 200 day MA and this chart if anything looks extremely overdone  I wouldn t be surprised to see some sort of a relief rally or at least a DCB off of this nonsense on Friday  Here   take a look at this chart  The 200 MA is the dashed orange line 
Euro  And of course obviously on Thursday the euro took the opposite tack with an enormous green candle the likes of which I have literally never seen in the 10 years I ve been doing this  It demolished its two month long descending RTC to close back up to 1 0974  just short of its own 200 day MA  That sent all the indicators overbought in just one day and as evidence that the dollar decline may be overdone we see that the euro in the new Thursday overnight is declining significantly  So I would look for some measure of retracement here on Friday 
Transportation  Like everything else on Thursday the trans had an absolutely miserable day dropping 1 8  to actually close below their lower BB at 7886  That leaves the indicators all oversold and the stochastic starting to curve around for a bullish crossover  But we need to see some sort of confirmation before calling this chart higher  especially now that we ve got two large black crows on the books 

We had several important 200 day MA s on Thursday with the Dow and SPX both falling below them the VIX rising above it  and ES finding support on it  That s three negative to one positive  but I ll note that oil has found four month long support on Thursday  The SPX Hi Lo indicator hit 31 4 on Thursday which is near what we d like to see for a reversal  though not quite   And the Dow and SPX both have support at their lower BB s very nearby  So call me crazy but I m going to go waaay out on a limb tonight and just call
Friday higher  I think we re due for a DCB at the least  Friday could be a hammer day  That s all she wrote  See you again Sunday night

Last night officially declared the latest Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ  trade dead and it was a good thing too because it fell further on Thursday  all the way down to exactly touch its lower BB at 44 33  That completes a bearish stochastic crossover and gives us two red candles in a row  So it s still too early to think about getting back in again ",2015-12-04,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-stock-market-forecast-374155,374155

Last night I thought that the market was going to be in for a pause on Monday  And it was a generally down day led lower by energy stocks as the price of oil continues to crater  At least now we have the pin action from Friday s big run up  so let s see what that means for Tuesday 
The technicals
The Dow  While the range was somewhat larger than I expected  the Dow indeed was completely unable to make any headway past Friday s highs  That sent the indicators lower before ever reaching overbought  though we still have a bullish stochastic crossover in place  But the resulting hanging man candle leaves some doubt  which will need to be resolved on Tuesday  Overall though  I m not very optimistic about this chart tonight 
The VIX  Last night I blew my call for the VIX quite badly  It did not fall on Monday  instead it rose nearly 7   However  the retest of its 200 day MA was a flop and the resulting candle was a tall gravestone doji  That was enough to cause a bearish stochastic crossover  so with the 200 MA serving as resistance above  it s not out of the question that the VIX goes lower from here on Tuesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 01 AM EST with ES down 0 41   On Monday ES put in a red hanging man right at the top of Friday s big pop  That s a reversal warning and a dark cloud cover  but indicators are still nowhere near overbought and in fact the stochastic has only now just completed a bullish crossover  Still the short term here looks bearish and in fact the overnight is continuing the lower  which seems to confirm that idea 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises again from 2076 08 to 2080 33  That puts ES back below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish again 
Dollar index  At least I got the dollar right on Monday as it gained 0 33   It has now retraced exactly 50  of last Thursday s giant dump  Fibonacci technicians take note   Indicators are only just recently off of oversold and the stochastic is now starting to curve around for a bullish crossover  So with a small gap up lopsided red spinning top  this one is still kind of up in the air  I won t call it tonight 
Euro  I was right about the euro too  which descended on Monday for its second losing day in a row  this time back down to 1 0847 as it continues to retrace last Thursday s big pop  Indicators have now come off of overbought and the stochastic is just now completing a bearish crossover  So with the euro continuing lower in the overnight  this chart just looks lower again  which would make three in a row on Tuesday 
Transportation  And finally  I blew my forecast for the trans too  On Monday it did not go higher  instead it lost 0 88  giving up all of Friday s gains and then some  Indicators remain oversold and the stochastic is now threaded out  having failed to execute a bullish crossover  We re back to the lower BB and there is some significant support right here around 7886  But whether or not the trans can capitalize on this remains to be seen 

Tonight we have a number of bearish reversal signs on the charts along with plenty of evidence of strong resistance blocking any further advance  And the futures are guiding non trivially lower  so I m going to go ahead and call Tuesday lower 
Single Stock Trader
Last night I expressed skepticism that Verizon could rise much further on Monday  And it managed a  0 35 gain  which is all the more impressive considering it was one of only a handful of winners on an otherwise down day  That brought it up to its upper BB on a small green marubozu  Indicators are now just shy of overbought  so it s not clear if VZ is going to just bounce off the BB or start crawling up it  We need some confirmation for this on Tuesday  In the meantime  it s not a swing trade buy ",2015-12-08,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-stock-market-forecast-374882,374882

Mr  Market sometimes goes through phases of obsessive compulsive behavior where he gets fixated on just one single factor and starts to ignore everything else  This is one of those phases and Mr M s latest obsession is the price of oil  And with oil of course in a deep and continuing funk  it s not looking good  But let s look at the charts anyway and see if there s any light at the end of this particular tunnel 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow has tracked oil perfectly for the last four days in a row   down up down down  And Tuesday was down big time  off nearly a full percent  It did however conduct a successful retest of its 200 day MA  stopping exactly at that level by the bell  That leaves us with two hanging man style candles  or is the second one a hammer    Hard to tell  and the indicators are also confused  wandering around halfway between overbought and oversold  The stochastic though remains in bullish mode  So go figure  Right now  I d kind of expect support at the MA to hold on Wednesday  but that s by no means certain  It will all depend on where oil goes  For some unknown reason 
The VIX  Well the VIX sure fooled me on Tuesday  After failing to break its 200 day MA on Monday  I expected it to move lower on Tuesday  But that clearly didn t happen as the VIX didn t even bother with its 200 MA   it simply gapped right over it for an 11  jump with a tall doji star  That left the indicators just short of overbought but it also looks like two thirds of a bearish evening star  And that  sadly requires confirmation on Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 39 AM EST with ES up 0 22   At least I got this much right  After looking bearish last night  ES had a terrible day on Tuesday to close right back down to 2059  However it conducted a successful retest of its 200 day MA  the third in four days  Indicators continue to wander around halfway between overbought and oversold  so there s little guidance there  But the new overnight seems to be staging something of a non trivial rally  so there s at least a suggestion here that Wednesday might be higher 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2080 33 to 2063 50  That puts ES exactly on top of its new pivot  so this indicator is neutral at the moment 
Dollar index  The dollar looked too difficult for me to call last night  but after Tuesday s action  it s looking a little more clear  And what it looks like is a bearish evening star as the dollar lost 0 2  on a small red candle  That kept indicators moving lower  but it also caused a bullish stochastic crossover  So unfortunately with conflicting indicators  it is once again too difficult to call this chart for Wednesday  though the bias seems continued lower
Euro  The euro fooled me last night because it did not move lower on Tuesday  instead rallying back up to 1 0889 for a classic bullish engulfing pattern against Monday s candle  But the indicators all remain overbought and the euro seems to be establishing a new trading range in the 1 09 area  so this chart is too tough for me tonight 
Transportation  Last night I noticed some support for the trans around 7886  Too bad the trans didn t notice that themselves because they massively underperformed the Dow on Tuesday with a giant 2 81  plunge that gapped right under support to head all the way down to the next level of support at 7663  The trans are starting to become something of a concern from a Dow Theoretical point of view as they have been massively underperforming the Dow for some time now  With a tall red marubozu that also punched right down through the lower BB on Tuesday and indicators that are still only just barely oversold  and with further support not until 7465  its difficult to make a bullish case for the trans at all at this point 

Withe the VIX possibly looking to be topping  the Dow sitting on some decent support and the futures guiding higher  I m going to dispense with the hand wringing and just call Wednesday higher 
Single Stock Trader
Last night I mentioned the possibility of Verizon bouncing off its upper BB to move lower on Tuesday and that s just what happened with a 0 78  decline  That was enough to send all the indicators lower just before reaching overbought and left VZ with a doji star  That leaves this chart a bit confused for Wednesday but one thing is clear   this is not a swing trade buy ",2015-12-09,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-stock-market-forecast-375030,375030

Recap
I have to admit I m a bit surprised by Friday s action in the market  I figured for sure there would be a strong reaction one way or the other after the jobs numbers came out  But instead what we got was a tiny move higher in the Dow and an even smaller move lower in the SPX  All in all  it was a big nothing  Let s take a look now to see if we can t get a bit more direction as to where this coming week is headed 
The technicals
The Dow  After a fat spinning top reversal candle last Wednesday and a doji star immediately following on Thursday  it s no wonder I called Friday uncertain  And as it turned out  what we got was another reversal candle  this one a green hanging man  Indicators remain just barely overbought and the Dow itself is just hanging by a thread on the very edge of its latest rising RTC  The rest of the indicators though have begun moving lower  so it s not at all clear which way this one s going on Monday 
The VIX  Last Friday made it 12 in a row that the VIX has been stuck in a consolidation range  This time it fell nearly 5  after Thursday s inverted hammer that just touched its 200 day MA  And it gave us a second inverted hammer  It also just squeaked out a bearish stochastic crossover  So that gives us two contradictory reversal warnings with one higher  one lower  but given recent history  my guess is that there s only a small bit of downside left available  perhaps down to 14
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 23 AM EST  with ES up 0 10   ES has been having trouble getting it together for the last three days  We had a fat spinning top on Wednesday followed by a doji star somewhat lower on Thursday followed by another doji lower again on Friday  With four days of lower highs and lower lows  it s not looking so hot  Indicators are now off of overbought  but still a long way from oversold  The new overnight is also sitting right on the edge of the latest month long rising RTC  so it is now do or die time for ES  At the moment  the Sunday overnight looks only mildly encouraging  but we ll have to see what happens on Monday  I m not convinced 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls from 2094 25 to 2090 08   That now leaves ES above its new pivot  so this indicator flips back to bullish 
Dollar index  I didn t call the dollar last Thursday night for Friday and it s just as well because I sure wasn t expecting a gigantic 1 23  gap up rocket all the way back to its upper BB at 66 46   Recall that this is on the USD UPX  not the DXY since those cheapskates at eSignal want to charge me extra for the latter  and even this giant pop was only enough to send the indicators barely overbought  And the stochastic is nowhere near even starting to put in a bearish crossover  What we do have is a an inverted hammer and a giant yawning gap that begs filling  so we ll be watching this one to see if the dollar does any retracing any time soon  as it seems ripe for that right now 
Euro  And of course similarly  on Friday  the euro took another big leg down  this time to close at 1 0 750 breaking support all the way back to the middle of July  It also just touched its lower BB  but we are now clearly in a month long downtrend here  and although the indicators have now gone oversold  again there is really no sign at the moment is that the euro could close higher on Monday 
Transportation  On Friday  the trans outperformed the Dow with a 0 75 percent gain that sent the indicators overbought and brought the trans right back to resistance at 8241  Still  that was enough to break out of their latest short descending RTC  so with a confirmed reversal candle and all the indicators rising  there are really no bearish signs on this chart tonight 

There are a few positive signs in the charts tonight  particularly with the VIX  which seems like it could fall a bit more and the futures which seem to be forming a bullish stochastic crossover at the moment  So I m going to go way out on a limb and call Monday higher

It seems like ages since I called a swing trade buy for Verizon  And indeed on Friday  it just kept going lower with a gap down red hammer for a nearly 1  loss to make it five lower in a row  That also left it right on the edge of its rising RTC  and indicators continue to fall from overbought towards oversold  but they aren t there yet  At least the stochastic has finally begun to curve around for a bullish crossover  but it s not there yet either  So what we have here is a reversal warning  but one which requires confirmation  so this stock is still not a swing trade buy ",2015-11-09,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-stock-market-forecast-270649,270649

Well I guess all the signs were there last night  but I chose to ignore them  preferring instead to go  out on a limb  with a call for Monday higher  And as it turns out  the limb snapped out from under me as the Dow dropped 180 points on a tall red candle  This is one of those days I wish I could take back  but I can t  Part of trading is being wrong sometimes  So let s simply dust off and move on to Tuesday 
The technicals
The Dow  On Monday  the Dow suffered its biggest loss in nearly a month with an exactly 1  decline  This took it clear out of its rising RTC for a bearish setup  Meanwhile the indicators have now fallen off of overbought and are heading towards oversold  but they re not there yet  and with Monday s confirmation of last Friday s hanging man  this chart just looks bearish for Tuesday 
The VIX  I also missed the VIX last night   I figured it was going to go check out the bottom end of its recent trading range on Monday  but instead  it just rocketed right off with a giant 15 28  pop that blasted it right through its 200 day MA at 16 33 to finish just above there at 16 52  That at least finally takes it out of its two week long noodling around area  and the MA cross is always bullish  Indicators continue to rise  but have not yet hit overbought  so overall  this chart looks higher again on Tuesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 15 AM EST  with ES up 0 21   On Monday  ES ignored not one but two reversal warnings in the form of doji stars  Instead of moving higher  it crashed right back down to 2073 on a tall red candle  That at least sent all the indicators falling off of overbought and headed towards oversold  although they re a long way from there  It also dropped out of its latest rising RTC for a bearish setup  And with essentially no follow through in the overnight  it s still too soon to call and move higher for ES on Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2090 08 to 2077 58  That leaves ES sitting barely under its new pivot  so tonight this indicator is only nominally bearish and essentially neutral 
Dollar index  At least I was right about the dollar not being able to make any further headway on Monday  as it did fall 019  on a small red spinning top  It wasn t classic  but one could still call this a bearish evening star  Indicators have also now hit extreme overbought levels  with RSI just under 92  The stochastic is now threaded out at overbought and has lost its predictive powers  So with a still considerable gap remaining below here  further downside is possible  but with a reversal candle in place again  we need to wait for confirmation on Tuesday 
Euro  After last Friday s big decline  I was skeptical about the euro s ability to close any higher on Monday  And that turned out to be about right  as all it was able to manage was 1 0762 on its smallest range day since I don t know when  That leaves all the indicators still oversold and nothing much to go on in technical terms  Even the new overnight isn t doing much of anything  so I really don t have anything to say about this chart for Tuesday  Hey  it happens sometimes 
Transportation  On Monday  the trans put in quite a different candle from the Dow  While they did fall 0 32   it was on a wide ranging long legged doji that sent the indicators falling after having only just barely hit overbought  This is a good reversal candle  but one which requires confirmation  so I m not making any guesses about the trans for Tuesday here 

Tonight the crystal ball is a bit cloudy as we have some reversal signs  but they all require confirmation  The best indication we ve got right now is ES  which is moving higher and forming a bullish piercing pattern  though you can t read too much into a half baked candle  So with no great clarity and ES bumping along just under its pivot  I m going to make a conditional call  if ES can break above its pivot by mid morning Tuesday  we ll close higher  On the other hand  if it stays below  or rises above but falls back  then we close lower

At least I m glad that last night I refrained from calling Verizon higher Monday on the basis of a tall hammer candle  Good thing too because VZ got caught up in the general carnage on Monday  with a 1 05  drop that took it out of its latest rising RTC for a bearish setup and also sent the indicators oversold  We now have a second hammer in a row  but all the factors in play last night remain in play as Verizon is going inverse exponential on us  This will eventually end with a nice gain  but once again  we require some confirmation  This is one falling knife I don t feel like catching at the moment ",2015-11-10,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-stock-market-forecast-270801,270801

Tuesday ended mixed with the Dow up but the Nasdaq down and took my conditional call with it   that was a total flop  Oh well  it doesn t always work  What we got was pretty much another Day of Nothing  So let s go to the charts and see if there might not be some more interesting action coming on Wednesday 
The technicals
The Dow  The bears were unable to make any further headway on Tuesday as the Dow managed to gain 0 16  and preserve support around the 17 717 level  The indicators are now mixed with money flow and the stochastic falling  while momentum and RSI rise and OBV goes nowhere  The resulting candle was clearly a green hammer  so there s at least a sign of a reversal here  but it s one which requires confirmation on Wednesday 
The VIX  I clearly missed the VIX last night when I said it would go higher because on Tuesday  it instead dropped another seven and a half percent  giving up all of Monday s gains and then some for a bearish engulfing pattern that also dropped right back through its 200 day MA  another bearish sign  With indicators now falling  my guess has to be that the VIX moves lower again on Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 13 AM EST with ES up 0 10   Technically  ES didn t look all that strong last night  so I was a bit surprised to see it put in a green hammer to close back up to 2078 on Tuesday  Interestingly  the indicators continue to fall and have now hit oversold  There is now a slight suggestion of a move higher but there doesn t seem to be much interest in the overnight to confirm that  so once again I have to defer on this chart and await confirmation on Wednesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2077 58 to 2073 83   That puts ES back above its new pivot  so this indicator turns right back to bullish 
Dollar index  And last night  the dollar was another one of these indeterminate charts that I didn t want to call  That is also just as well because despite the yawning gap beneath it wanting filling and what looked like an imminent bearish evening star  the dollar instead gapped higher on Tuesday with a non trivial 0 32  gain  But even this was on a red spinning top  the second in a row and the fourth reversal warning candle in a row  So with a dollar now back to levels not seen since last April and despite indicators that are now highly overbought  it s not at all clear when it may start moving lower  So I m just not calling this chart either tonight 
Euro  And last night  the euro was yet another chart I didn t want to call for Tuesday  And that was also wise because after putting in what looked like a bullish piercing pattern on Tuesday  it just kept going lower  closing this time down to 1 0711  its lowest close since April 15th  So that leaves us tonight with a chart that s now in a month long downtrend and the lower BB falling away  While the indicators are now highly oversold  there is still no reversal sign in sight on this chart 
Transportation  I didn t want to call the trans last night after a long legged doji star and it was just as well because on Tuesday  they put in a second even tighter star that resulted in a tiny 0 03  gain  All of which leaves us pretty much in the same spot we were last night   indecision abounds and there s no way to call this chart 

It may be incautious of me as there s still a fair bit of uncertainty in the charts tonight  but we do have some reversal signs along with a promising VIX and futures turning positive  so I m going right back out on a limb and calling Wednesday higher

Last night I called Verizon a falling knife and this was pretty much the textbook definition of that as VZ put in a third hanging man reversal warning in a row  and yet it just keeps going lower  finishing this time off another almost half a percent  The indicators at least have now gone to extreme oversold levels with RSI hitting 3 15 and the stochastic lying flat on the floor  But once again  we have merely a reversal warning and no confirmation  so it is too early to call Verizon higher  although at this level it has started to become interesting ",2015-11-11,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-stock-market-forecast-270946,270946

These small movement days are difficult to call and Wednesday was no exception  I was wrong once again because the Dow did not rise  instead  it fell 56 points  And on top of that  it s time for another Night Owl Lite because I just plain ran out of time today to put together the usual post and so I will simply present the conclusions without all of the yakking  For all the good it s done lately  this will probably be just as well 
The technicals
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2073 83 to 2074 67  That till leaves ES below its new pivot  but just barely  So this indicator turns nominally bearish  but it is definitely in play tonight 

There has been little direction to the markets the past two days  However  tonight ES appears to be finding some support as it puts in a bullish piercing pattern  On the other hand  the VIX is doing the same  The cautious thing to do here is simply call Thursday uncertain  but I m going to try another conditional call  if ES can break above its new pivot by mid morning Thursday  we ll close higher  If it remains below though  we close lower

After putting in a hammer last Friday  Verizon put in a second one on Monday and followed that with a third one on Tuesday  each one lower than the one before  Wednesday was the first day that Verizon actually posted a gain  snapping a seven day losing streak  This was significant because it s also the first confirmation of any of these hammers we ve seen and also one that broke out of the steep descending RTC for a bullish setup  It also sent the indicators rising from extreme oversold levels  and that puts us very close to the kind of swing trade buy that I m looking for  The only thing that doesn t make this a 100  trade is the fact that we had a narrow spinning top on Wednesday instead of an outright bullish candle  But I will nevertheless bless this now as a buy for the adventurous ",2015-11-12,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-stock-market-forecast-271096,271096

Recap
Last night s conditional call for Thursday worked as expected  ES made a brief and fruitless attempt to break above its pivot just after 3 AM but it was all downhill from there as it closed on session lows  And as a result the rest of the market closed lower too  Tonight once again we re going to have another Night Owl Lite because that annoying thing called Real Life  TM  interfered with my favorite hobby and I didn t have enough time to prepare the usual post  But we should still have some sort of idea of where Friday is headed 
The technicals
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dives from 2074 67 to 2052 50   ES remains well beneath its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish 

On Thursday the Dow and the SPX both ominously fell through their respective 200 day MA s  The VIX also jumped right through its own 200 day MA in the other direction  None of that is any good for the market  And to make matters worse  right now oil seems to be in the driver s seat again as it seems intent on retesting the August lows  There are certainly no bullish signs on that chart  Or any other chart that I can see tonight  So I guess I ll just have to call Friday lower  I ll be happy to be proven wrong  That s all she barely managed to write  See you again Sunday night

Last Thursday night  I noted that the charts were looking pretty grim and indeed on Friday  the Dow plunged another 203 points   You can blame the price of oil  China  whatever  but it was a disappointing end to a down week  Let s move on ahead to Monday now and see if we can recover some of those losses on this last week before the big Thanksgiving holiday coming right up 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow s 1 16  dump on Friday extended a week long decline into an inverse exponential rundown  We confirmed the 200 day MA break as the Dow continues heading down towards its lower BB  now not that far away at 17 146  Indicators have now gone to extreme oversold levels  but the stochastic is not quite ready to come around for a bullish crossover yet  So with a second tall red marubozu in the books  there is still not a bullish reversal sign on this chart 
The VIX  After blasting through its 200 day MA on Thursday  the VIX rose another 9 31  on Friday for three white soldiers  It is now climbing up its upper BB and starting to look a little overextended to me  I often note that the VIX rarely spends more than a day or two at elevated levels after it touches its upper BB  and we ve been there for 2 days now  However  indicators are only moderately overbought at this point  and we do not yet have a reversal candle here  So while I think the VIX is due to come down to earth sometime this week  it s not clear that that is going to happen on Monday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 59 AM EST  with ES down 0 47   After punching down through its 200 day MA last Thursday  ES confirmed that bearish sign on Friday with another tall red candle  That almost touched its lower BB  Now in the Sunday overnight  ES actually did test the lower BB at 2006 and for the time being that looks like a success  Indicators are now at extreme oversold levels  and we are getting a nice gap down green hammer candle  With ES having fallen three in a row in what looks like an inverse exponential and the stochastic curving around nicely in preparation for a bullish crossover  this chart has all the makings for putting in a bottom on Monday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dives again from 2052 50 to 2025 33   That still leaves ES considerably below its new pivot  so this indicator continues bearish 
Dollar index  Lately the dollar has been getting jerked around every which way  After what had the makings of a bearish evening star last week and a tall red candle on Thursday  instead of moving lower on Friday  it actually gained 0 39  on a bullish inside harami  However  the indicators remain just barely overbought  and the stochastic is now in full on bearish crossover mode  So this chart is something of a conundrum for Monday 
Euro  And of course it s about the same deal with the euro  After looking like it was going to start a nice rally in the middle of last week  on Thursday it suddenly reversed course with a tall bearish engulfing candle  And so far in the Sunday overnight  it looks like that s being confirmed as the euro is moving down another 0 2   But the indicators are now oversold and the candle  for now anyway  looks like a hammer  So with some decent support around 1 07  this chart looks like it might have more upside potential than downside risk from here 
Transportation  On Friday  the trans made it down three in a row on an inverted red hammer  but this one found support right on its lower BB  The indicators are now also oversold  although the stochastic has yet to begin curving around for a bullish crossover  So we have a reversal warning in place and it looks to me like the trans are ready to move higher sometime soon  but it s not clear that will happen on Monday 

The charts are starting to show some decent reversal signs  However  I think that s all pretty much moot in view of the barbarian attacks in Paris this weekend  I think the market is going to use that as an excuse to do some more selling  and that seems to be supported by the futures running lower by half a percent in the overnight  So I m just going to call Monday lower and keep my fingers crossed

Last Thursday night I called Verizon more of a short than a buy for Friday  and that s exactly what happened as it had an absolutely horrible day  losing 1 34  for its worst performance in 10 sessions and making it eight out of 10 down now  The good news is that it finally hit its lower BB and the indicators are all at extreme oversold levels  At this point  it will be interesting to see if it can manage to bounce off the lower BB or if it starts to dribble down it  There s no real support until 43 51  but because it s been knocked down so hard over the past two weeks  there may come a point soon  possibly this week  where all the selling is exhausted  In the meantime  it s still not my favorite swing trade buy setup ",2015-11-16,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-stock-market-forecast-271420,271420

Recap
Well that was certainly interesting  The market completely fooled me on Monday and I m sure more than a few others too by not dropping at all in the wake of the weekend barbarian attacks in Paris  With the future guiding substantially lower Sunday night and considering the fact that past similar attacks have led to market selloffs  I don t think it was unreasonable to expect a decline on Monday  What we got instead changes the picture  so we have some most curious charts to look at tonight 
The technicals
The Dow  On Monday the Dow put in a canonical bullish engulfing pattern much to my surprise  And I was even more surprised at the extent of the gain with a 238 point jump that was its best performance in nearly a month  It was also enough to send the indicators off of oversold and complete a bullish stochastic crossover  That leaves nothing bearish at all about this chart tonight 
The VIX  And in perfect mirror image fashion  on Monday the VIX put in a bearish engulfing pattern with a nearly 10  drop   That was enough to send it over off of overbought levels and also form a bearish stochastic crossover  So just as the Dow now looks bullish  the VIX looks correspondingly bearish 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 14 AM EST with ES up 0 18   What a difference a day makes  After looking decidedly negative at this time last night  on Monday ES roared back with a giant bullish engulfing candle that was stopped only by its 200 day MA at 2049  And while that still leaves the indicators oversold it also completed a bullish stochastic crossover  In any case  it looks like the latest descending RTC may very well be over and there s certainly nothing bearish about this chart tonight  It remains to be seen if ES can punch through the 200 MA on Tuesday  But judging by how much gas is in the tank I wouldn t be surprised to see that happen 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2025 33 to 2032 50 That leaves ES well above its new pivot so this indicator now turns bullish 
Dollar index  And also on Monday  the dollar put in an exceptional chart of its own with a 0 45  gain that broke monthly resistance for its highest close since April 13th  That also sent the indicators back overbought and caused the stochastic to curve around for a bullish crossover  As an aside  it s interesting that further dollar strength may delay the widely anticipated Fed rate hike next month  which would be something  a delay that is  I would definitely applaud 
Euro  And after a very tall bearish engulfing candle last Friday  on Monday the euro confirmed that with an equally tall red candle that closed right back down to 1 0681  its lowest close since April 15th  And although the indicators remain oversold  the stochastic has now formed a bearish crossover from a low level  Those are often good for another day or two of lower prices and a move lower in the overnight seems to be confirming that idea 
Transportation  After a dreadful week last week culminating with three black crows that took it right down to its lower BB  on Monday the trans put in a textbook perfect green hammer  With the indicators now oversold and the stochastic curving around nicely in preparation for a bullish crossover  this looks like an excellent buying opportunity in the trans for Tuesday 

With bullish engulfing candles galore on the charts tonight and with ES having just reclaimed its 200 day MA  the only logical call I can make is for Tuesday higher 
Single Stock Trader
Like most everything else on Monday  Verizon had an excellent day with a nearly 2  pop that bounced it right off its lower BB  That sent the indicators off of oversold and formed a bullish stochastic crossover  It also pushed it out of its long running descending RTC for a bullish crossover  Therefore this chart looks nothing but bullish for Tuesday  And while it s not a classic swing buy for me  I think its not a bad entry point right here ",2015-11-17,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-stock-market-forecast-271567,271567

Single stock trader  N VZ no longer a swing trade buy

On Tuesday  the markets tried to keep the momentum going from Monday s rally but it eventually fizzled out as both the Dow and the SPX were unable to move past their respective 200 day MAs  which now serve as resistance  Does this mean Monday s action was just a one off or are we simply pausing for a new attempt on the MA  Let s look at the charts and see what they have to say 
The technicals
The Dow  It was a real squeaker on Tuesday as the Dow moved higher nicely in the morning but then spent the rest of day giving it all back  We did manage a meager six and a half point gain but the 200 day MA proved too tough to crack and left us with a long legged doji star  Indicators remain oversold though and we still have a fresh bullish stochastic in place  so while we now have a reversal warning  this is one that is going to require confirmation on Wednesday 
The VIX  On Tuesday  the VIX rejected Monday s nice bearish engulfing pattern by gaining 3 74  instead on a green spinning top  However  the indicators continue to be overbought and the stochastic has just completed a bearish crossover  So that all leave this one kind of up in the air as we now have a reversal warning higher  but one that requires confirmation on Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 01 AM EST with ES down 0 12   On Tuesday  ES did manage a small gain on top of Monday s big rally but once again it was stymied by the 200 day MA and closed just below it at 2049  Indicators are now off of oversold and all rising towards overbought  The new overnight is forming something of a fat spinning top for what that s worth  Overall this doesn t look very positive for Wednesday  but it s hardly conclusive at this point 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2032 50 to 2051 33  That move was enough to put ES back below its new pivot  so this indicator now turns bearish again 
Dollar index  Last night I noted some strength in the dollar and that was born out on Tuesday as the dollar advanced another 0 16   That marks its best close since April 13th  Indicators remain overbought but the stochastic has now formed a bullish crossover from a high level and those are often good for another day or two of higher prices  So with three white soldiers on the books  now it s entirely possible the dollar could move higher again on Wednesday 
Euro  Last night I called the euro lower and indeed that is exactly what happened on Tuesday as it sank back down to 1 0652  its lowest close since April 14th  Even at that  the indicators are only just barely oversold and the stochastic continues to sink with no bullish crossover in sight  We now have three black crows on the books and no sign that the latest downtrend is over 
Transportation  After putting in a tall green hammer on Monday  on Tuesday the trans put in an equally tall doji star sitting right at the top of Monday s close  Indicators remain highly oversold though and the stochastic has just completed a bullish crossover so while we do we have a reversal indicator  it is a weak one and overall it looks like this chart might just go higher again on Wednesday 

On Tuesday  we simultaneously hit a number of resistance lines on different charts and also got some reversal signs that require confirmation  Given the overall contradictory signals  I m just going to have to call Wednesday uncertain 
Single Stock Trader
Last night I thought Verizon could move higher again on Tuesday and it did  though not by much  And the resulting candle was a lopsided spinning top  which is something of a reversal warning  But with the indicators still only just recently off oversold and a fresh bullish stochastic crossover in place  it s too early to give up on this trade just yet  It may be too late to get in but I d wait at least one more day to see where this goes on Wednesday  If it looks like it s rolling over early on  then it s probably not worth holding on to ",2015-11-18,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-stock-market-forecast-271710,271710

Wednesday morning Mr  Market must have been anticipating the Fed minutes at 2 PM because the Dow pretty much just rose all day with the gains accelerating after the announcement  It could have gone either way and that probably would account for all the uncertainty in the charts on Tuesday  So with that out of the way let s move on to Friday  I will just add that with Thanksgiving next week I m planning on taking the entire week off  I m not looking for much action in the markets then anyway and it will be nice to take a break 
The technicals
The Dow  Last night I mentioned that Tuesday s pause might just be the Dow gathering steam for another attack on its 200 day MA and I was reluctant to call it lower on the basis of a doji star  On Wednesday the reversal warning was disconfirmed in a big way as the Dow had an excellent day gaining 1 42  on a tall green marubozu that absolutely blasted right through the MA to close back to 17 737  That was enough to take the indicators off of oversold and they are now all rising towards overbought  So this chart now simply looks continued bullish for Thursday 
The VIX  On Tuesday the VIX put in a stubby green spinning top as a bullish piercing pattern  But that all went by the wayside on Wednesday as the VIX gave it all back with a nearly 11  decline and is now hovering just above its 200 day MA at 15 87  Indicators remain just barely overbought and are now all headed lower along with a nicely completed bearish stochastic crossover  So it definitely looks to me like the VIX may be interested in taking a look at the MA on Thursday  In any event this chart does not look bullish to me tonight 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 12 AM EST with ES up 0 13   Last night ES was the picture of indecision with a doji star sitting right below its 200 day MA  Well on Wednesday it picked up where it left off and put it in a giant green candle that vaulted it right over that MA and also out of its latest descending RTC for a bullish setup  Indicators continue to rise but have not yet hit overbought and the overnight seems to be guiding higher once again  So there s absolutely no bearish signs at all on this chart right now 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2051 33 to 2068 42   That s enough to place ES well above its new pivot so this indicator flips right back to bullish again 
Dollar index  And on Wednesday the dollar also rejected Tuesday s inverted hammer by gaining another 0 05  on a lopsided green spinning top  Indicators are now just short of overbought and the bullish stochastic crossover from a high level I noted yesterday is now confirmed  So there s no real bearish signs on this chart but we do have a reversal warning and that requires confirmation on Thursday 
Euro  Meanwhile the euro kept falling in a month long descending RTC on Wednesday closing this time at 1 0650  its lowest close since April 13th  However we now have a doji star reversal warning and the indicators are now rising off of oversold  Also  the stochastic has just formed a bullish crossover and the overnight is rising strongly suggesting that the euro is going to close higher on Thursday 
Transportation  And finally similar to the other charts  on Wednesday the Trans disconfirmed Tuesday s doji reversal sign with a big 1 65  green marubozu that left the indicators rising off of oversold  Resistance is still not until 8242 so there s still a bit of room to run higher and there s nothing bearish at all about this chart tonight 

After a nice rally it s tempting to think the market may want to take a pause but with indicators still generally only just off oversold and some strong 200 day MA crossings in the Dow and the SPX  and with the futures guiding higher  I think it just makes more sense to go ahead and call Thursday higher

Tonight I m stumped  The charts look mildly bearish  but the futures are climbing non trivially in the overnight  And the VIX  which I count on a lot  stopped right on its 200 day MA Wednesday  And the market has been behaving oddly the past few days anyway  so I m just going to call Thursday uncertain and leave it at that

Thursday night I called the market higher and responded accordingly on Friday with some nice gains across the board  So let s move right on to Monday  as we enter the last week of what has turned out to not be a particularly scary month of October after all 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow rose 158 points on a gap up green marubozu that punched right through its 200 day MA  That also sent the indicators to extreme overbought levels  RSI   93  but next resistance isn t until 17  750  so there s at least a little bit more room to run here  and in the absence of any bearish signs  it is too early to call this chart lower just yet 
The VIX  Friday was one of these unusual days where the VIX rose on same day the general market went higher too  Admittedly  it was only a 0 07  gain  but the candle was a fairly tall green nearly marubozu  The overall recent trend is down  but with the indicators now oversold  it s possible a reversal may be in the works in the next few days  It s just too soon to tell yet 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 45 AM EDT  with ES down 0 24   After breaking through its 200 day MA on Thursday  ES just continued rising on Friday posting a nice gain to close back up to 2066  That move has now retraced almost all of the giant plunge from back in August  The upper BB is now at 2092 so that s the logical next target  In addition  the stochastic has just formed a bullish crossover from a high level and those are often good for another day or two of gains  However  RSI has actually turned lower from overbought levels and the overnight seems to be sagging somewhat  So it s not clear to me that ES has any gas at all left in the tank to move higher again on Monday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2039 17 to 2064 58  That s enough to put ES back below its new pivot  so this indicator now turns bearish 
Dollar index  On Friday  the dollar had an absolutely awesome day with a 0 82  gain that not only vaulted clear past its 200 day MA  but then continued on to its upper BB and then closed above that  That sort of move left the indicators at extreme overbought levels  with RSI just short of 100  The stochastic is flattened out but has not yet formed a crossover  and the dollar is now near resistance from mid August  so it s not clear if it s got any more gas in the tank to run higher again on Monday  I have my doubts 
Euro  Meanwhile  in mirror image fashion on Friday  the euro continued its recent slide  having already broken through its own 200 day MA on Thursday  On Friday  it continued on down through its lower BB to close right back down to 1 1031  its lowest close since early August  That move left the indicators all extremely oversold and the stochastic now looks like it s ready to form a bullish crossover  With the overnight seeming to confirm that  my guess is that the euro could close higher on Monday 
Transportation  The trans on Friday continued a week long winning streak with 0 69  gain that cleared recent resistance at 8256  And even with that  the indicators are still not yet overbought  So with a steep rising RTC in effect  there are no bearish reversal signs on this chart tonight 

The market ended last week with a pretty nice run  but seems to have gotten a bit overextended in the process  We also had a number of 200 MA crossings and those take their toll  So with the futures guiding lower Sunday night  I m going to just go ahead and call Monday lower

After some nice gains last Thursday  on Friday Verizon put in a perfect gap up doji star and that is two thirds of a bearish evening star  In addition  the indicators are now quite overbought and stochastic has just formed a bearish crossover  so this chart is looking more like a short than a buy of any sort at this point ",2015-10-26,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-stock-market-forecast-269237,269237

Monday turned out be one of those Days of Nothing and everybody was apparently sitting on their hands  waiting for a slew of earnings reports to come out later this week as well as an upcoming Fed decision on interest rates  That s about all there really is to say about Monday s action  so let s move right on to Tuesday 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow lost 24 points on Monday on a small red hanging man  It wasn t a big move  but with indicators highly overbought  this is at least the warning of a reversal  But more important perhaps was the failure of the Dow to advance any from Friday s close  So overall  it s hard to read too much into this because of the small numbers involved 
The VIX  Interestingly as well  on Monday the VIX put in a nontrivial 5 74  gain on a day the Dow went nowhere  with a gap up green marubozu that took the indicators finally off of oversold and gives the general impression that the VIX wants to move higher again on Tuesday
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 20 AM EDT with ES down 0 21   Like all the other charts  on Monday ES pretty much stalled out  unable to make any headway from Friday s close  That caused the indicators to continue falling off their recent highs  and interestingly  also caused a fresh bearish stochastic crossover  With the overnight action going lower  it looks doubtful that ES can advance any further on Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2064 58 to 2085 92  ES remains below its new pivot  so this indicator turns back to bearish 
Dollar index  After a week long rise that saw the dollar bust through its 200 day MA on Friday and hit its upper BB  it fell back 0 29  on Monday with a small red spinning top  That was enough to cause the indicators to top at overbought and flatten out the stochastic in preparation for a bearish crossover  Overall  this chart looks like its got more downside risk than upside potential for Tuesday 
Euro  Meanwhile the euro did nothing much itself on Monday as it rose back to 1 1053 after falling through its 200 day MA last week  Indicators continue to remain overbought  but Monday s gain plus some positive pin action in the overnight suggests that there could be a higher close on Tuesday 
Transportation  On Monday  the trans put in a small red spinning top for a 0 16  loss  to follow up two green candles with a reversal warning  Indicators are now somewhat confused because RSI has started falling before ever reaching overbought  while the stochastic continues to rise and is still nowhere near in position to form a bearish crossover  So the overall impression is that the trans may be headed lower on Tuesday 

The market continues to look tired and we re seeing some topping signs tonight  With the futures guiding lower  it seems logical to call Tuesday lower

On Tuesday  the market pretty much confirmed my expectations from last night as the Dow put in a 42 point decline saved only by its 200 day MA  With another important Fed day coming up  we ll cut straight to the chase  as it is my general policy to never attempt to call a Fed day  We will resume the usual chart rundown on Wednesday

Last night  I refrained from calling the market on Wednesday because of the looming Fed decision  In retrospect  the nearly 200 point gain in the Dow was not entirely unexpected  but that s just my policy  In any case  it was an interesting candle  so let s take a look at the charts for Thursday and see where that s headed 
The technicals
The Dow  As is so often the case when the Fed s decision comes out  the Dow took off in one direction  in this case lower  only to suddenly reverse course and then finish in the other direction  in this case a 1 13  gain   That proves that the 200 day MA served as support for the second day in a row  But it still leaves the indicators overbought and after a tall green marubozu  leaves us just short of the upper BB at 17 878  So there s no bearish reversal candle immediately  but it s not clear how much upside Dow has left 
The VIX  After looking toppy last night on a lopsided red spinning top  on Wednesday the VIX declined 7 13  on a very long legged red spinning top that almost hit its lower BB at 12 54  That confirmed Tuesday s bearish candle  and with indicators that have now begun moving lower before ever reaching overbought  it looks like there s more downside possible for the VIX on Thursday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12  13AM EDT  with ES down 0 32   Thanks to Auntie Janet  on Wednesday ES broke through its recent resistance around 2065 with a big pop back all the way back up to 2085  That means we have now retraced all of the big losses from August  Indicators remain overbought  but without a reversal candle insight yet  there is no way I can call it lower on Thursday despite it sagging somewhat in the overnight 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises again from 2058 83 to 2075 08  That leaves ES above its new pivot  though not by much  But for now  this indicator remains bullish 
Dollar index  The dollar went nowhere on Wednesday until the Fed decision  Then it just absolutely took off to finish with a 1 13  gain that sent it clear above its upper BB for its highest close since August 7th  That still leaves the indicators all highly overbought and the stochastic completely threaded out at a high level  But this was not a reversal candle  so it is too soon to call a move lower in the dollar yet 
Euro  After breaking under its 200 day MA last week  the euro has been absolutely unable to get anything together  On Wednesday  it confirmed Tuesday s lopsided spinning top with a big decline to 1 0909  its lowest level since August 7th  That leaves all the indicators still quite oversold and the overnight appears to be trying to stage a rally  but it is by no means clear that the euro can finish higher from here on Thursday 
Transportation  On Wednesday  the trans put in a nearly perfect long legged doji star for a tiny 0 08  gain  Of course  on Tuesday they had an enormous decline  so any sort of recovery on Wednesday would not be entirely unexpected  as moves this big tend to add credibility to reversal dojis  So I wouldn t be surprised to see the trans move higher on Thursday 

I don t know   we don t really have any good bearish signs on the charts tonight  but I m concerned that Wednesday s action  or rather Fed reaction might have been overdone and that the market could be in for some retracing  So I m going to take advantage of the close proximity of ES to its new pivot tonight to make another conditional call  If ES remains above its new pivot by mid morning Thursday  we ll close higher  But it it galls below by then  we close lower

Single stock trader  N VZ still not a swing trade buy 

Although the spooky month of October went out with a bang in total  the final day delivered a trick instead of a treat  spoiling my call for a higher close with a 92 point decline in the Dow  Nevertheless  it was a winning month  so we really can t complain  With October now out of the way  let s look ahead to November and figure out which way it will start off 
The technicals
The Dow  On Friday  the Dow confirmed Thursday s red hanging man with a 0 52  decline  That sent the indicators a bit lower  though they remain overbought  With this bearish confirmation  on its own this chart looks negative for Monday
The VIX  Meanwhile  the VIX remains range bound as it continues to bounce around between approximately 14 10 and 16 14  Friday s action was right in the middle of that with a small lopsided green spinning top that probably doesn t mean all that much  Indicators similarly are wandering around in no man s land between overbought and oversold  so there s not much to say about that  Overall  the VIX simply continues to search for direction
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 15 AM EST  with ES down 0 37   After a doji star reversal warning on Thursday  on Friday ES put in a lopsided green spinning top that just barely touched its upper BB  That confirmed Thursday s warning sign and we note that in the Sunday overnight  ES is continuing lower  This has already sent it off of overbought and confirmed a new bearish stochastic crossover  So there s nothing bullish looking about this chart tonight 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls from 2080 92 to 2079 42  ES is now back under its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar index  Last Thursday night  the dollar looked lower to me on Friday and that is indeed what happened  with a significant 0 35  decline on a gap down doji star that nearly touched its 200 day MA  Even at that  the indicators are still overbought and the stochastic has now finally completed a bearish crossover  Therefore  I have to take this candle with a grain of salt   It s a reversal warning  but one which requires confirmation on Monday 
Euro  I also called the euro correctly last Thursday night as it continued its rise Friday to close at 1 1009  It was something of a lopsided green spinning top  but it was enough to send the indicators finally off of oversold and confirm a newly completed bullish stochastic crossover  On top of that  in the new Sunday overnight the euro is moving non trivially higher  so it looks like there s a good chance that it may close up again on Monday 
Transportation  After looking quite promising on Thursday  on Friday the trans simply petered out  losing 0 12   on a classic red spinning top  However  they also formed a classic bullish stochastic crossover  so tonight this one is simply a toss up 

The market is up on the first day of most months and according to the Stock Trader s Almanac  it has been up four out of the last five first trading days of November  However  given the situation tonight  it s not clear that s going to be the case this year  I ve been mentioning for a few days now that the market was looking toppy  Now it s looking liked it s topped  And given the direction of the overnight futures seeming to confirm that  I m going to have to call Monday lower

Well when I m wrong  I m wrong  ES was looking pretty dismal last night until about 3 AM  after which it just took off and kept on rising  The net result was a 165 point gain in the Dow  which was enough to keep the latest rising RTC intact  Now tonight is one of those nights where I m just out of time  so it s going to be another Night Owl Lite night   Just the results  no blather

In retrospect  I was probably a bit too conservative on Tuesday s call of uncertain  but that s how in goes in the middle of lots of earnings reports  Let s move on to Wednesday and see if we have more direction from the charts this time 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow confirmed the bullish candle we got on Monday with another nice 0 50  gain  This one just barely touched its upper BB at 18 005 before falling back to just under the 18 000 level  Indicators remain overbought  but not extremely so  and at this point with two green candles on the books  my guess is the Dow may want to take another peek at the 18 000 level on Wednesday 
The VIX  Tuesday was one of those unusual days when the VIX rose  in this case 2 76   on a day when the broad market was higher too  But this small gain still keeps the VIX in a more than one week long consolidation zone bordered between 14 and 15 50  So not much has changed  and there s really not much we can make of this little lopsided green spinning top other than to say that the VIX will probably continue its sideways movement for the next few days 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are mixed at 1 12 AM EST with ES down a scant 0 02   On Tuesday  ES remained in a month long rising RTC with a second green candle in a row  this one nearly touching the upper BB at 2112  The indicators remain overbought  where they ve been for nearly two weeks now  The new overnight seems to be having some trouble gaining any traction  but with such a strong rising trend in place and no bearish candle on the charts to speak of  it is premature to call ES lower on Wednesday just yet 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES pivot rises from 2086 58 to 2100 75  That leaves ES just barely above its new pivot but this indicator remains nominally bullish 
Dollar index  The dollar put in a modest 0 25  advance on Tuesday on a red gap up inverted hammer  Indicators have now fallen off of overbought and are all headed towards oversold  With two thirds of an evening star in place  this chart looks lower for Wednesday 
Euro  On Tuesday  the euro confirmed Monday s gap up red spinning top with a tall red candle that brought it back down to 1 0970 and caused all the indicators to begin falling before reaching overbought  and also sent to stochastic curving around in preparation for a bearish crossover  With the new overnight guiding lower again  the euro looks continued negative on Wednesday 
Transportation  In a bit bearish divergence  on Tuesday the trans fell 0 44  on a day the rest of the market was higher  This caused essentially a bearish dark cloud cover and left the indicators moving lower before ever reaching overbought  That leaves a general bearish impression to this chart 

Once again  the charts are a bit indistinct tonight  If anything  there s a bit of a bearish bias here  But because of fluctuations induced by earnings related news  I m going to make a conditional call  If ES remains above its new pivot by mid morning Wednesday  we ll close higher  But if it breaks below the pivot  we close lower  I know this one didn t work the last time I tried it  but it works often enough to be useful

Single stock trader  N VZ still not a swing trade buy 

My conditional forecast last night for Wednesday worked out pretty well  ES hovered above its new pivot until shortly after the open and then it fell below making just one brief vain attempt to regain it  but by 10 50 AM  it was all downhill from there and the market just closed lower  But this is all a reflection of a crazy week full of earnings that are yanking the charts around in strange ways  We ll take a look tonight again as usual  but I m not too optimistic about forecasting this whole week  
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow wandered all over the place on Wednesday  but in the end  kept on putting in lower highs and lower lows to finish the day down 0 28   The resulting candle is a classic dark cloud cover and the indicators are now right on the edge of overbought on the way down  So with the failure to make any headway above the 18 000 level and the upper BB  this chart just looks bearish for Thursday 
The VIX  On Wednesday  the VIX put in its biggest gain in over two weeks with a 6 67  advance on essentially a tall green marubozu  Frustratingly enough though  it still hasn t broken out of its extended recent trading range  If anything  it looks like it may be forming a megaphone pattern  In the meantime  we need to see if the VIX has the chops necessary to break out of this range and test its 200 day MA currently at 16 30 on Thursday  Given recent history though  it s not at all clear this is going to happen 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 51 AM EST  with ES up 0 07   Last night  I was reluctant to call ES lower on the basis of two fairly strong green candles one of which touched the upper BB  Well on Wednesday that all fell apart with essentially a red harami candle as a fat spinning top  Indicators are still overbought  but now all headed lower and with the overnight guiding lower still  this chart looks nothing but negative for Thursday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls from 2100 75 to 2098 33  That now puts ES below its new pivot  so this indicator turns bearish   
Dollar index  Well  I missed the dollar badly on Wednesday  Last night after putting in a gap up inverted hammer  it looked for all the world to me like a topping indication  But on Wednesday instead it moved higher once again on a big 0 80  gap up green candle  for its best close since August 10th  That move was also enough to send all the indicators back up after recently falling off of overbought and just squeak out a bullish stochastic crossover  So it s not out of the question that the dollar could move higher once again on Thursday 
Euro  On the other hand  I caught the euro exactly right last night when I said it was going lower   On Wednesday  the euro broke through support at 1 909 and kept on going to close 1 865  That was enough to drive indicator oversold  but also caused a bearish crossover from a low level  No through good for another day or two of lower prices and with three accelerating down days on the books now  I see no reason why they would go lower or higher on Thursday 
Transportation  Last night  I said that the trans look bearish for Wednesday after a red hanging man appeared on Tuesday  And indeed the trans did fall once again  this time down 0 65  to retrace almost all of Monday s gains  This move was also enough to flatten out the stochastic in preparation for a bearish crossover  so with indicators continuing to fall but not yet oversold and two red candles on the books  this chart looks lower again for Thursday 

I suppose anything s possible during earnings season  but the overall impression of the charts is negative tonight  so I m just going to have to go out on a limb and call Thursday lower

I called Verizon last night lower last night  and that s just where it went  down another 0 67  on Wednesday  That has now brought the indicators off of overbought and the stochastic is in full blown bearish crossover mode  With a tall red candle on the books and three down in a row  there is now nothing bullish at all about this chart tonight ",2015-11-05,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-stock-market-forecast-270328,270328

Thursday was a squeaker  I called it lower and indeed the Dow descended mightily right out the gate but then it wandered its way back up to almost break even by the time the bell rang  This probably reflects a lot of uncertainty about Friday s upcoming job numbers  And that s one tape I have no intention of fighting  Therefore I will cut right to the chase  I am simply going to defer on this particular forecast  No charts tonight as there s no point to it 
The technicals
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2080 92 to 2094 25   However  a sudden midnight rally in ES has just managed to punch through the new pivot thus turning this indicator back to bullish again  though not at this point by much 

It seems that this Friday s job numbers are being more closely watched than most  as they apparently may influence the Fed on whether to raise rates in December or not  Accordingly  the market seems to be sitting on its hands waiting for that as seen by the number of dojis on the charts tonight and the fact that the futures are basically going nowhere in the overnight  Therefore the only sensible thing for me to do is call Friday uncertain  The market will move when the numbers come out  That s all she wrote  See you again Sunday night

After ending Wednesday with three black crows   Verizon surprised me on Thursday by actually gaining  0 06 on a small doji star  That left the indicators in somewhat of a confused state with RSI rising but the rest of them falling  We re now in a new descending RTC with only a weak reversal warning  particularly since the indicators have not yet hit oversold  So this one is worth watching but it s not yet a swing trade buy ",2015-11-06,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-stock-market-forecast-270456,270456

Recap
Well it was about what I expected on Monday with a semi holiday  The Dow gained a meager 47 points and the SPX managed less than that on a low volume snoozer of a day  So with nothing much having happened  lets continue on to see which way Tuesday is headed 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow just keeps right on trucking with Monday making it 10 in a row on the latest rising RTC  Lately its been just crawling right up its upper BB and RSI is now pegged at 100  It doesn t get any higher than that  The stochastic similarly is also bumping up against the ceiling with no predictive power  We remain in the biggest uptrend I ve seen in a long time  and with no reversal candles in sight  I just can t call this chart lower yet 
The VIX  And correspondingly  the VIX is now in an equally long downtrend  losing another 5 3  on Monday with its own RSI now on zero  This is in fact the third day in a row RSI has been at zero and I can t recall the last time that happened  In any case  we continue to dribble down the lower BB with no end in sight  Of even more importance is the fact that on Monday the VIX broke under its 200 day MA  That s always a bad sign  and with a red marubozu on the books  it doesn t look like there s any reversal in sight for the VIX right now 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 36 AM EDT with ES down 0 17    After a rip roaring rally last week  ES has been having some trouble making any headway the last few days putting in just a small advance on Monday  And it appears to be giving most of that back in the new overnight in the form of a dark cloud cover  Indicators also now appear to be falling back off extreme overbought levels and the stochastic has just squeaked out a bearish crossover  So the general impression here is that this chart looks lower for Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2006 75 to 2008 92  An overnight sag in ES has now put it back below its new pivot so this indicator now turns bearish 
Dollar index  On Friday  the dollar dropped all the way to its lower BB and on Monday  it lost another 0 12  on a gravestone doji  Indicators are now oversold but the stochastic has not yet begun to curve around for a bullish crossover  So we have a reversal warning in place but one which requires confirmation on Tuesday 
Euro  After touching its upper BB on Monday with a small lopsided spinning top  the euro looks like it s falling back in the overnight  down 0 13  at the moment  Indicators look to have now peaked at overbought and the stochastic is getting ready for a bearish crossover  so overall  this chart looks negative for Tuesday 
Transportation  After a decent gain last Friday  on Monday the trans put in a tall classic hanging man sitting right at the top of Friday s candle  Indicators remain quite overbought and the stochastic is just about in position to form a bearish crossover  We remain in a steep rising RTC  but the trans are looking to be about out of gas right now  so a move lower on Tuesday would not surprise me 

Tonight the charts are looking tired  and they have the right to be after such a nice rally last week  We re getting some reversal signs so I m just going to go ahead and call Tuesday lower

Recap
After three days of small range moves the Dow finally made a break on Wednesday at it was to the downside with a 157 point loss  This finally gives us an interesting candle to work with so let s take a look at the charts and see which way Thursday might go 
The technicals
The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow made a brief attempt to move higher out of the gate but it was all for naught as after the first 15 minutes it spent the rest of the day moving lower to finish with a close to marubozu candle good for a 0 92  decline  That threw it right out of its rising RTC for a bearish trigger  sent the indicators continuing off of overbought and confirmed yesterday s bearish stochastic crossover  So there s really nothing bullish all about this chart tonight 
The VIX  Last night I said the VIX looked higher for Wednesday and indeed it was  gaining 2  on a long legged green spinning top  That finally took the indicators off of oversold and confirmed the recent bullish stochastic crossover  So despite the reversal candle my guess is that there s more upside to come here 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 19 AM EDT with ES up 0 57   On Wednesday ES followed up Tuesday s big dump with yet another move lower on a gap down inverted hammer to close at 1984  That finally sent the indicators off of overbought moving lower  But oddly enough the new overnight seems to be staging a non trivial rally despite the bearish trigger on a rising RTC exit  So I m not so sure that I can call Thursday lower at this point 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2000 00 to 1989 42  That  plus an overnight rally is enough to put ES back above its new pivot so this indicator now turns bullish again 
Dollar index  I was quite surprised by Wednesday s big 0 88  decline in the dollar on a tall gap down marubozu that went right through its lower BB  I had figured with three reversal candles in a row and having hit its lower BB the dollar would go higher  But it was not to be and instead we re left with massively oversold indicators with RSI now down to 2 48 and a stochastic that has fallen off the bottom of my chart  There s no bullish reversal candle here and yet with everything else looking quite overextended I have to wonder if the dollar might not stage rally on Thursday 
Euro  At least I had the sense to take a pass on the euro on Wednesday which is just as well because it had a big gain to close up at 1 1489  a move which punched right through its upper BB on a tall green marubozu  That leaves indicators all extremely overbought and the stochastic just in position for a bearish crossover  It looks like this finally may be it for the euro as the overnight seems to be wanted wanting to go lower  So my guess is that we could see a lower close on Thursday 
Transportation  After a massive plunge on Tuesday the Trans found a modicum of support on Wednesday in the form of a long legged green spinning top signaling a reversal warning of sorts  However  the indicators are still nowhere near oversold and the stochastic continues in a full blown bearish mode  Still  there is some question as to whether the downside might continue on Thursday  It s possible that we could be in for a relief rally as Tuesday s move looks a little overdone to me 

We have a number of reversal signs tonight  particularly in the VIX and the trans  Ordinarily they re not enough to call a market reversal but with some pretty decent support from the futures I m going to go a bit out on limb and call Thursday higher

After three indecisive days finally on Wednesday Verizon  N VZ  broke to the down side losing  0 37 on a fairly tall red candle  That was enough to send the indicators off of overbought on their way towards oversold and also to complete a bearish stochastic crossover  So the recent uptrend is now clearly over and it looks like there s more downside on the way ",2015-10-15,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-stock-market-forecast-268168,268168

Recap
I called last Friday as being uncertain and in retrospect  that was about right because the market kind of wandered around for most of the day before finishing with some small gains  We now move on to a new week to sort this all out and make some sense of where Monday might be headed 
The technicals
The Dow  It wasn t clear to me last Thursday night the Dow could follow up Thursday s big gains with another advance  But on Friday  that s just what happened with a 74 point gain on a green candle sitting right on top of Thursday s big move  It also formed a bullish stochastic crossover from a high level  Those are often good for another day or two of gains  And with resistance around 17 130 now cleared  it s not out of the question that the Dow could move higher again on Monday 
The VIX  And last Thursday I called the VIX correctly as it lost another 6 23  on Friday after breaking under its 200 day MA on Thursday  However  the candle was a red inverted hammer that left the indicators all oversold  So while further declines are not out of the question  Monday is a day that requires confirmation 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 11 AM EDT  with ES down 0 30   After a great day last Thursday  ES managed to squeak out some more gains on Friday to close back up to 2025 50  The candle was a fat hanging man and was enough to keep the indicators from continuing lower to just off of overbought  The Sunday overnight  however  seems to be giving some of that back  as the stochastic continues to consolidate its latest bullish crossover  That all leaves this chart somewhat in flux and a bit difficult to call  My guess though is that ES will have trouble moving higher on Monday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2007 83 to 2021 42  That now puts ES back below its new pivot  so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar index  Last Thursday night  I noted a bullish green harami pattern for the dollar and called Friday higher  And that s just what happened with a 0 17  gain that took the dollar away from its lower BB on a small gap up red spinning top  But that was enough to confirm a bullish stochastic crossover  so with indicators still oversold but a reversal candle in place  this chart is not clear enough to call tonight 
Euro  I was also right last Thursday about the euro  which closed lower on Friday as I had expected  But it was a small loss back down to 1 1386 on a narrow doji star  That sent the indicators continuing lower from overbought  though they are still a long way from oversold  The Sunday overnight  though  does not seem to be confirming this reversal indicator  as the euro is down again  That casts doubt on its ability to close higher on Monday 
Transportation  And finally  in a bit of bearish divergence  on Friday the trans lost a big 1 58  on a day the rest of the market was higher  The candle was essentially bearish engulfing as the trans were unable to make any headway past Thursday s highs  Indicators are now all falling towards oversold  so on the face of it this chart looks fairly bearish for Monday 

Tonight the charts look a bit indecisive and of course  Monday is generally the hardest day to call anyway  But given the close proximity of ES to its pivot  it seems like a good time to try another conditional call  if ES can break above its new pivot by mid morning Monday  we ll close the day higher  But if it remains below the pivot  we close lower

Recap
It was another snoozer of a day on Wall St  with the Dow finishing a mere 15 points higher and not much of anything else going on  However  the charts are a bit more interesting  so let s get right to them and see where Tuesday is going 
The technicals
The Dow  On Monday  the Dow put in an interesting candle because despite finishing nearly unchanged  it gave us a classic hanging man  sent the indicators just barely off of overbought and left the stochastic with the completed bullish crossover I noted last night  Considering how little headway the Dow made on Monday  this is a reversal candle worth paying attention to  but one which requires confirmation nonetheless 
The VIX  Last night I said that the VIX might move lower again on Monday  but that required confirmation  Well  we got it with a 0 47  decline on a red bearish engulfing candle  The indicators remain oversold and the stochastic continues its bearish crossover from a low level  so there is nothing bullish about this chart tonight 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 02 AM EDT  with ES down 0 05   ES continues to put in smaller and smaller gains  with Monday s move closing at 2027 50  just barely above Friday s close  It was also a classic hanging man and gave us a bearish stochastic crossover  Indicators are now just off of oversold and moving lower and the overnight is also guiding lower  So the general impression here is bearish for Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2021 42 to 2023 25  That puts ES back above its new pivot so this indicator returns to bullish 
Dollar index  I wasn t ready to commit to last night s gap up spinning top in the dollar and that s just as well because on Monday  the dollar continued higher with a strong 0 39  gap up advance on a second spinning top  This one was enough to bring the dollar off of oversold and send the stochastic on its way from oversold to overbought  So overall  that leaves us in the same spot we were last night  with a reversal warning which requires confirmation 
Euro  At least I was right last night when I said the euro didn t look like it s going to close higher on Monday because that s just what happened with it falling back down to 1 1336  The euro is in a new descending RTC  and the rising trend from the first half of this month is now clearly over  Indicators are all falling towards oversold  but haven t gotten there yet  There is a hint of some support kicking in in the overnight this evening  but the overall trend for the euro remains lower 
Transportation  Last night  the trans looked pretty bearish to me  but it turns out that on Monday they managed a 0 35  gain  once again hitting support around 8040  Indicators continue falling toward oversold  but have not reached there yet  Meanwhile  the stochastic has started curving around for a bullish crossover  but isn t there yet either  So with a hammer candle in place  this chart looks like its primed to move higher on Tuesday  but that requires confirmation 

Tonight the charts are looking toppy  However  the VIX doesn t look ready to move higher and ES remains above its new pivot  so it may be a bit premature to actually call a top right here  So all that s really left is for me to just call Tuesday uncertain

Recap
It seems more like the dog days of summer than the middle of October as the Dow put in a tiny 13 point loss on Tuesday  There s just no calling small moves like this so it s just as well I punted on Tuesday s call  But now we have a little more data to work with  so let s go right to the charts and see which way Wednesday is headed 
The technicals
The Dow  Well  the Dow has now given us two reversal warnings in a row   a classic hanging man on Monday followed by a classic spinning top in harami position on Tuesday  The closes of the last three days are all within a few points of 17 220 as the Dow continues to struggle at that level  Indicators are now falling off of overbought  with the stochastic trying to gear up for a bearish crossover  With two bearish reversal candles on the books now  my guess is that the Dow ready to move lower on Wednesday 
The VIX  After falling below its 200 day MA last Thursday  the VIX has been trying to recover ever since  It has found some decent support just above the 15 handle and gave us two reversal candles on Friday and Monday  They were followed by a third one  a green spinning top on Tuesday  as the VIX finally managed to gain 5   That was also enough to send the indicators off of oversold and cause the stochastic to form a bullish crossover  So the overall impression here is bullish Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 14 AM EDT  with ES up 0 25   On Tuesday  ES confirmed Monday s hanging man with a downward move back to 2020 50  The indicators are now falling off of overbought  but still nowhere near oversold  The stochastic  meanwhile  has completed a bearish crossover  so that all looks negative   except for the fact that the overnight actually is moving slightly higher on a candle that is so far looking like a hammer  So this chart is pretty much up in the air for Wednesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot ticks up from 2023 25 to 2023 50  The overnight gain in ES is enough to keep it above its new pivot  so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  Like I mentioned  the dollar could move lower  but it required confirmation  And indeed on Tuesday  the dollar did gap down hard out of the gate  but then proceeded to claw its way back to finally finish virtually unchanged on the day  The resulting candle was a green marubozu that did not confirm Monday s spinning top  Indicators continue to rise  but have not yet reached overbought  So on the whole  this chart looks positive for Wednesday 
Euro  I did miss the euro last night because on Tuesday  it did not continue lower  and instead finished with a stubby green spinning top to close at 1 1346  That left it sitting right on the edge of a steep descending RTC  And in the new overnight  it is trading entirely outside that with a non trivial gain  and that is a bullish setup  Indicators have not yet hit oversold  but the stochastic is starting to curve around for a bullish crossover  So despite the overnight gap up  I think there s a good chance that the euro could close higher on Thursday 
Transportation  Last night I mentioned the trans looked ready to move higher  and in a bit of bullish divergence on Tuesday  that s just what they did  gaining 0 64  on a day the rest of the market was down  The resulting candle confirmed Monday s spinning top  and arrested the descent of the indicators before ever reaching oversold  The stochastic is also narrowing in preparation for a bullish crossover  so tonight this chart overall looks bullish 

The charts aren t entirely clear tonight  The VIX is throwing off a vague reversal warning  but we have some nice positive divergence in the trans and the futures are guiding higher  So I think I m going to go with the latter and call Wednesday higher

Verizon had a nice  0 54 gain on Tuesday on a move that took it past its upper BB before falling back  The resulting candle was a gap up inverted hammer  and that is a bearish sign  Indicators are also now back solidly overbought  though the stochastic is still having trouble forming a bearish crossover  Nevertheless  the over all impression is negative and it is definitely not a swing trade buy ",2015-10-21,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-stock-market-forecast-268758,268758

Recap
My apologies to all my readers for having missed last night s post  As it turned out Tuesday s action was pretty much general continuation  So now that we re back on track let s move ahead and figure out where Thursday is going 
The technicals
The Dow  Monday night I mentioned some doubts as to whether the rally we had could be sustained into Tuesday  Turns out it couldn t as we got another day of losses  Those were followed on Wednesday with more losses with the Dow down 0 31  on a short stubby hammer  Indicators are still a fair ways away from oversold but the stochastic is finally starting to curve around for a bullish crossover  So now we have at least a minor indication of a reversal but we remain in a tight descending RTC  Bottom line  it s still too soon to call the Dow higher on that basis 
The VIX  Well this was one unusual thing I did miss on Tuesday  The VIX put in a huge inverted hammer that looked like an excellent reversal sign  And indeed on Wednesday the VIX moved lower by 1 38  to finish with a perfect doji star  Indicators are wandering around between overbought and oversold but the stochastic looks like it is now moving into position for a bearish crossover  Another unusual point is that the VIX fell on a day when the market was also lower  Overall the VIX remains in a descending RTC so I d say there s a good chance that we move lower again on Thursday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower once again at 12 09 AM EDT with ES down 0 34   After a week in a steep descending RTC   on Wednesday ES put in a decent reversal candle in the form of a long legged spinning top  Indicators have now fallen very nearly to oversold and the stochastic is definitely curving around in preparation for a bullish crossover Unfortunately  ES is showing no interest in the wee hours of going any place other than down again as it remains in a steep descending RTC 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 1938 25 to 1926 92  But even that isn t enough to put ES back above its new pivot as it just continues falling away from it  So this indicator continues bearish tonight 
Dollar index  Monday night I mentioned that the dollar looked bullish  And on Tuesday it did indeed gap up on a stubby spinning top  That was followed on Wednesday with a 0 25  decline on a red candle that formed a perfect bearish engulfing pattern  It also sent indicators slightly lower just before they reached overbought  The stochastic is not yet in position for a bearish crossover but it looks like that could happen very soon  Overall this chart looks negative for Thursday 
Euro  Monday night I mentioned the euro fall through its 200 day MA as a bearish sign  And indeed on Tuesday it continued to move lower closing at 1 1147  Then on Wednesday it staged a comeback with a bullish engulfing pattern to recoup all of Tuesday s losses and then some  closing right back up to 1 1222  But in the overnight it seems to be giving some of that back again  However we now have indicators rising off of oversold and a just completed bullish stochastic crossover  So the majority seems to vote that the euro goes higher on Thursday 
Transportation  After a bearish trigger on Monday the Trans took a bad fall on Tuesday  That was followed by a smaller 0 44  decline on Wednesday on a small red hammer  The indicators are now all falling towards oversold and the stochastic is beginning to curve around for a bullish crossover  So we do have a fair reversal warning in place and there s a chance the trans could finally move higher on Thursday 

Tonight we have a decidedly mixed picture with most of the charts looking ready to move higher but the futures guiding lower and oil looking ready to take another leg lower  And with the overall bias clearly now running to the downside  it s just too risky to call Thursday higher without all the stars lined up  So I just have to shrug and call Thursday uncertain  Sometimes that s just how it is

I ve been unable to get behind Verizon  NYSE VZ  for some time now  It s just been one thing after another with this stock and we haven t really had any good swing buy opportunities  After a possible doji star reversal warning on Tuesday  it was disconfirmed entirely on Wednesday with another leg down  But things may be about to change because on Wednesday Verizon finally hit its lower BB  and indicators have now gone oversold  More importantly the stochastic looks like it s finally about to execute a bullish crossover  However we remain in a descending RTC so we re not quite at my preferred buy point yet  But Thursday we ll be watching very carefully ",2015-09-24,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-uncertain-266028,266028

Recap
Last night demonstrated the problems we have on Sunday nights calling Monday being as most of the information is fairly old by that point  The charts actually didn t look too bad  but I hesitated calling Monday higher because the futures weren t participating  As it turns out it was good that I called Monday merely uncertain rather than higher because the Dow took an ugly 313  plunge and the SPX fared even worse  There are some interesting charts to look at tonight  so let s get right to them and see where Tuesday may be headed 
The Technicals
The Dow  On Monday the Dow disconfirmed last Friday s bullish setup on a descending RTC exit with a nearly 2  dump that took it right down to its lower BB stopping just short of the 16 000 mark  But even that still leaves the indicators only moderately oversold and continuing to fall  The stochastic is now lying flat on the ground and thus has no predictive power  Perhaps more importantly  OBV continues a decline that began way back in the middle of July  currently running at  872 million  That s not a good sign  And with a red marubozu on the books there s no sign yet of a reversal on this chart 
The VIX  Last night I thought the VIX was headed higher on Monday and that s just where it went with a big 17  gap up green candle that sent the indicators overbought  With the stochastic continuing to rise but still nowhere near in position for a bearish crossover  VVIX also continuing to rise  and the upper BB not too far away at 30 it looks to me like the VIX still has more room to run on Tuesday 
Market Index Futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 23 AM EDT with ES down 0 11   ES had a simply miserable day on Monday with its worst performance in a month closing just off the day s lows and falling through its lower BB at 1888  It looks to me very much like ES is intent on retesting last month s lows around 1863  We could easily hit that level on Tuesday  In the meantime there s absolutely no sign of a reversal higher even though the indicators are all now extremely oversold  The continued drift lower in the overnight isn t helping matters either 
ES Daily Pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls once again from 1926 83 to 1890 17  And with ES unable to make any headway  it remains below its new pivot and this indicator simply continues bearish 
Dollar Index  Last night I said that the dollar looked lower for Monday and that was where it went down 0 26  on a second red candle in a row  this one just touching its 200 day MA before recovering a bit  Indicators remain overbought but the stochastic looks like it s trying to gear up for a bearish crossover  So it appears that there is more downside in store on Tuesday for the dollar 
Euro  Meanwhile the euro continues to jiggle around in a range bounded by 1 1141 on the lower end and about 1 1254 on the upper end  It did put in another gain on Monday closing back up to 1 1244  a move that took it right up through its 200 day MA  This confirmation of Friday s lopsided spinning top and the 200 MA breakthrough makes it look like there s more upside possible for the euro on Tuesday 
Transportation  Last night I mentioned that the trans looked positive for Monday based on a bullish looking candle last Friday  Well that of course went right out the window on Monday as the trans lost two and a quarter percent to almost touch their lower BB at 7637  That also took them right back into their descending RTC thus canceling last Friday s bullish setup  On Monday we closed right on recent support  but with the lower BB now starting to fall away there is some concern here and I definitely cannot call the trans higher for Tuesday based on this red marubozu 

All the charts are looking pretty grim tonight but they re also getting pretty extended  It s starting to make me think we re due for a reversal soon  but technically I just don t see that happening on Tuesday  So I ll just have to call Tuesday lower  I d be delighted to be proven wrong

On Monday Verizon  NYSE VZ  was of course a loser just like almost the entire rest of the Dow and a gap down red candle confirmed Friday s red spinning top to send Verizon right back into its descending RTC  So much for the bullish setup  Last night I said it would be good to get out of this trade and it looks like I was right  Having now taken out support at 43 81 and with no new reversal candles insight it is still too soon to call this stock higher despite the fact that all the indicators are now considerably oversold ",2015-09-29,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-lower-266452,266452

Recap
It was another crazy roller coaster day on Wall Street yesterday and it finished with another mixed market with the Dow and the SPX closing higher but the NASDAQ finishing lower  The Dow was up then it was down then it was up then it was down before a late afternoon rally caused it to finish with that 47 point advance that caused my call to be wrong but not by very much  So with another interesting candle in the books let s move on to close out the miserable month of September by figuring out which way Wednesday may wend  
The technicals
The Dow  After the dust settled the Dow had put in a 0 30  advance on a long legged green spinning top sitting right at the bottom of Monday s big dump  As the lower BB  continues to fall away but at least support of 16 000 was respected  and the indicators have now started rising from oversold levels  This is an encouraging reversal sign for Wednesday 
The VIX  I was wrong about the VIX on Tuesday  I thought it would move higher but instead in a bit of bullish divergence it fell 2 9  on a day the Dow and the SPX closed higher but on a small green spinning top that sent the indicators a little further into overbought territory  However the candle is in a bullish harami position so I wouldn t make too much of that  At this point it s hard to tell which way the VIX goes on Wednesday  But I tend to favor continued lower at this point 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 53 AM EDT with ES up 0 77   After Monday s big dump  on Tuesday ES put in a nice reversal warning in the form of a long legged doji star sitting right on its lower BB as the indicators have now hit extreme oversold levels  We haven t quite retested the August lows yet but it looks like the overnight is wanting to confirm Tuesday s candle so we could be looking at a rally on Wednesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 1890 17 to 1875 08  That s finally enough to bring ES back above its new pivot so this indicator now turns bullish 
Dollar index  Last night I wrote that it looked like the dollar would move lower again on Tuesday and that s just what it did with another 0 20  loss that drove it right back down through its 200 day MA  That gives us a bearish three black crows pattern and has started the indicators all moving lower off of overbought  The stochastic now has a freshly completed bearish crossover so there s nothing bullish about this chart tonight and it looks like the dollar still has lower to go on Wednesday 
Euro  Similarly  last night I called the euro higher for Tuesday and that s just where it went climbing right back up to 1 1272 on a green spinning top  That s a weak reversal sign but with the indicators still rising and not yet overbought it has to be taken with a grain of salt 
Transportation  Last night despite some reversal signs I was cautious about calling the Trans higher on Tuesday  They did manage a modest 0 32  gain but it was on a long legged doji star  With indicators now extremely oversold it looks like the trans may be in a bottoming process  I still think we re due for a move higher and it might come as early as Wednesday but it s not certain 

The last day of September is historically quite bearish but tonight the charts are generally suggesting that we ve gotten overextended to the downside and a rally may be at hand  So I m going to just go ahead and call Wednesday higher as we close out the month and the quarter

Last night I was cautious about calling Verizon  NYSE VZ  higher and that proved to be a good move because it fell further with a third spinning top in a row on Tuesday as it continues to dribble down its lower BB  Indicators remain oversold but have not yet begun to put in a convincing bottom  We are still in a descending RTC so once again this is not a swing trade buy ",2015-09-30,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-266597,266597

Recap
Despite the bearish reputation of the last day of September  this year the Dow managed a decent 1 47  gain  Nevertheless it finished both the month and the quarter in the red  So with the ugly month of September out of the way let s now move on to the scary month of October and see where Thursday may be headed  
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow took a nice 236  top on Wednesday to make a tall green marubozu that lifted the indicators off of oversold and finally caused the stochastic to complete a bullish crossover  It also marked the second day trading outside the recent descending RTC and so that s a bullish trigger  The only concern on this chart is resistance around 16 315  But it does appear that the Dow still has some room to run on Thursday 
The VIX  Last night I said it looks like the VIX had lower to go again on Wednesday  And that s just what happened with the VIX falling nearly another 9  on a gap down doji star  But that still that leaves the indicators overbought and the stochastic on the verge of forming a bearish crossover  So while this is a bullish reversal indicator it is also one which requires confirmation and from the looks of it my guess is that we re not done going lower yet 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12  15 AM EDT with ES up 0 76   On Wednesday ES had its best day in almost a month as it confirmed Tuesday s doji star in a big way with a tall green marubozu that brought it all the way back up to 1908 75  That also finally exited the two week long declining RTC for a bullish setup  It also pulled away from the lower BB  which is now falling away from us and sent the indicators rising off of oversold as well as confirming a bullish crossover from the stochastic  So everything is looking pretty bullish for this chart except for the fact that there s no follow through in the overnight which is putting in a nontrivial decline  And that s a concern 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 1875 08 to 1896 83  ES remains well above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish tonight 
Dollar index  So much for the classic three black crows pattern  Last night I thought the dollar would move lower again on Wednesday especially after having pierced its 200 day MA  But no  instead it gained half a percent on a stubby spinning top perched above the top of Tuesday s big decline  That still leaves the indicators overbought and the stochastic in the middle of a bearish crossover so this could be a one and done  My guess is that the next move is lower but at this point who knows 
Euro  On Wednesday the euro confirmed Tuesday s spinning top in a big way with a massive decline that plunged right back through its 200 day MA to close at 1 1179 on a tall red marubozu  That was enough to send the indicators moving lower before ever having reached overbought and the stochastic is now curving around for a bearish crossover before having reached overbought itself  The overnight seems to be looking for some support but it s not clear that it will find it so it looks to me like after such a big move through the 200 MA on Wednesday there s more room to run lower on Thursday 
Transportation  And finally I was right about the Trans moving higher though I was a little surprised that they gained 1 10  on Wednesday  That is the second day we ve traded outside the descending RTC so that is a bullish trigger  Indicators remain oversold and the stochastic is still flat on the ground so it looks like the trans have more upside potential than downside risk at this point 

The first day of most months is bullish and though that isn t always true of October  tonight we have a nice technical base to work off of and the futures are guiding sufficiently higher that all in all I m going to go ahead and call Thursday higher 
Single Stock Trader Last night I still wasn t ready to commit to Verizon  NYSE VZ  despite the likelihood that the Dow was going to close higher on Wednesday  And that was a good thing too because Verizon ended up being one of only two Dow stocks that moved lower on Wednesday  That left us with two side by side red spinning tops and indicators that continue to hover at highly oversold levels  But until we see some confirmation of these reversal warnings it s still too early to call Verizon a swing buy ",2015-10-01,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-higher-266714,266714

Recap
Last Friday was something of a question mark as all the charts were posting reversal warnings  But in the end  I was correct in ignoring those because on Monday the Dow posted a big 304 point pop that extended its winning streak to essentially five in a row  The market is now clearly on a roll  so we need to see how much longer this can go on as we move ahead to the charts for Tuesday 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow was quite impressive on Monday  putting in a 1 85  gain on a tall green marubozu that took it all the way to its upper BB  That also sent the indicators overbought for the first time in three weeks  and caused the stochastic to show the first signs of curving around for a bearish crossover  So those are warning signs of a move lower  but they all require confirmation  Basically  it s still too soon to call this one lower for Tuesday 
The VIX  Last night I called for the VIX to hit it lower BB at 19 30 one on Monday  Turns out the low for the day was actually 19 14 as the VIX put in a stubby red gap down hammer  We have now bounced off the lower BB  but the indicators continue to fall and have not yet reached oversold  And the stochastic has still not begun to curve around for a bullish crossover  So while we do have a reversal warning now  it is a weak one  and I need some confirmation of a move higher on Tuesday before calling an end to the current decline in the VIX 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 48 AM EDT  with ES down 0 20   ES had a great day on Monday  making this rally now four in a row  It is now quite clearly more than a relief rally or a DCB  as September s big descending RTC is definitely done for  We are still a ways from resistance at 1988  but after having run hard for four days in a row and with the indicators just short of overbought and a stochastic beginning to curve around for a bearish crossover  I m starting to wonder if ES has enough gas left in the tank to continue moving higher on Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises again from 1923 25 to 1964 00  That once again leaves ES above its new pivot  so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  On Monday  the dollar confirmed Friday s giant gap down doji star in a big way as it gained 0 28   stopping only at its 200 day MA  Indicators are now wandering around halfway between oversold and overbought  so there s not much guidance there  However  the Friday reversal followed by a nice bullish confirmation makes it look like the dollar still has enough gas in the tank to put in another advance on Tuesday 
Euro  Last night  I said there continued to be no direction in the euro  and Monday s action did nothing to change that view as the euro gave up all of last Friday s gains and then some  falling right back down to 1 1192 and stopping exactly on its 200 day MA  The indicators are now halfway between oversold and overbought  so there is nothing to learn from them  The question is will the MA provide support or not  Right now it s looking in the overnight as though it just might  Still  with a bearish candle on the books on Monday  it s not at all clear that the euro won t continue lower on Tuesday 
Transportation  I wasn t ready to commit to the trans last night either  which is too bad because they outperformed even the Dow on Monday with a giant 2 31  green marubozu  That was enough to send the trans overbought even though the stochastic is still rising and has not begun to curve around for a bearish crossover  My only concern right now is that this chart looks like it is going exponential  and that would make it ripe for a pullback  which could come any day at this point 
Accuracy  

Technically tonight most of the signs remain bullish  but there are a few areas of concern  like the VIX and the futures  So I m hesitant to call the market higher again  particularly after such a nice run  On the other hand  there s not really enough bearish signs to call it lower  So I guess all that leaves is Tuesday uncertain

Last night I was playing it conservatively after watching Verizon bleed for more than two weeks straight  But on Monday  it turned out that last Friday s hammer was in fact the bottom  as Verizon posted a big 2 71  gap up marubozu on Monday  That was enough to vault it right out of its two week long descending RTC  send all the indicators rising off of oversold  and confirm the bullish crossover from the stochastic  So while we missed the bottom on this one  this chart now looks like a buy to me ",2015-10-06,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-uncertain-267152,267152

Recap
Well  that was interesting  I was reasonably certain that with the Dow having hit its upper BB on Tuesday with a spinning top reversal candle it would go lower on Wednesday  But no such luck  Instead  it gained 122 points to continue its recent week and a half long winning streak  So lets check the charts to see how that changes the picture for Thursday 
The technicals
The Dow  On Wednesday  the Dow rejected Tuesday s spinning top in a big way to continue crawling up its upper BB for the third day in a row  That has now left the indicators all extremely overbought  with RSI having hit 98 64  Of note too is that the stochastic is now perfectly primed for a bearish crossover that could happen any moment  So although this is not a bearish reversal candle  it is questionable how much further the Dow can move without reversing course at least for a day 
The VIX  Similarly  on Wednesday  the VIX rejected the spinning top that it put in on Tuesday to descend further on an inverted hammer to close down to 18 40  It is tracking its lower BB and has hit zero  and that s as low as it goes  folks  The stochastic has actually fallen off the bottom of my chart and is now primed for a bullish crossover  So with a reversal candle in place here  I would give better than even odds that the VIX goes higher on Thursday
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 23 AM EDT  with ES down 0 52    I based my call for a lower close Wednesday in part on a red spinning top reversal candle in ES from Tuesday  Instead  on Wednesday  ES put in a tall green marubozu that brought it all the way back up to month long resistance at 1988  sent the indicators to highly overbought levels and moved the stochastic into position for a bearish crossover  However  we remain in a rising RTC and this trend is far from over  On the other hand  the new overnight is experiencing a fairly significant move lower  and that bodes ill for Thursday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises again from 1971 08 to 1979 67  That move now puts ES back below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar index  After bumping into its 200 day MA on Monday  the dollar gave it all back on Tuesday and then some on a tall red candle  But on Wednesday it finished essentially unchanged on a small doji star  The indicators continue falling  but have not yet hit oversold  so what we have here is a reversal warning of a move higher but one which requires confirmation 
Euro  The euro  meanwhile  simply continues bouncing around in a two week long consolidation range bounded from below by 1 114 and from above by approximately 1 1300  After a nice gain on Tuesday  it was unable to make any further headway on Wednesday and closed right back down to 1 1263 on a small red doji star  And the new overnight isn t doing much of anything  so this chart continues to remain conflicted without any clear direction  I woudn t be trading this currency at the moment 
Transportation  Finally  on Wednesday  the trans outperformed the Dow by nearly a factor of two  They easily cleared resistance at 8085 on a tall green marubozu that keeps them in a nearly two week long rising RTC  Indicators are now very overbought  and the stochastic is in position to form a bearish crossover any day now  But without an actual reversal candle  I cannot call this chart lower just yet 
Accuracy  

It sometimes happens that I am a day early in my calls  and I m thinking that this is one of those times  All of the forces that were in play last night are still there tonight  only more so  And this time  we re getting some better confirmation in the form of futures that are moving lower non trivially  So I m going to give it another try and once again call Thursday lower

I was thinking that Verizon looked toppy last night  and indeed  it came back in on Wednesday confirming Tuesday s tall inverted hammer with a lopsided green long legged spinning top  Indicators continue to rise though  but have not yet hit overbought  That leaves this chart in a very mixed up state  but it is definitely not in my preferred swing buy mode at the moment ",2015-10-08,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-lower-267452,267452

Recap
Last night  I noted a number of good reversal signs in the charts and called Tuesday lower  All it took was some more bad news from the Chinese to push the market back over the cliff and right back down again we went  retracing more than 50  of the two big days of gains we got last week  So once again  the picture has changed and we head to the charts as usual to see where Wednesday is headed as scary September gets off to a rocky start 
The technicals
The Dow  On Tuesday  the Dow tanked right out the gate and then was unable to make any sort of a comeback  ending near the day s lows  That tall red candle was enough to short circuit the indicators  which have been rising  and send them back down towards oversold  The stochastic is also just about to execute a bearish crossover  And this move was also a bearish trigger on our last rising RTC  So with no support until 15 672  it s looking like a retest of last week s lows might not be out of the question  There s just nothing bullish at all about this chart tonight 
The VIX  Last night I wrote that the VIX  looks like it has more upside left for Tuesday   And indeed  the VIX took a 10 and a half percent pop to form a perfect gap up spinning top  That s now two thirds of an evening star  but with the stochastic just forming a bullish crossover  it s too soon to call the VIX back lower yet  and it wouldn t surprise me to see more upside on Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 06 AM EDT  with ES up 1 15   Like everything else  ES tanked on Tuesday  falling all the way back to 1931 on a tall red candle that exited its rising RTC for a bearish set up  It also formed a bearish stochastic crossover  However  the rest of the indicators are completely confused  with RSI and momentum rising but money flow falling  In any case  the overnight seems to be staging some sort of rally attempt  therefore it is impossible to call this chart lower again on Wednesday  At the moment  it s looking like a good bullish piercing pattern   but it s tough to call half baked candles 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot dives again from 1972 08 to 1927 00  But that plunge plus a move higher overnight in ES now leaves it back above its new pivot  so this indicator turns bullish again 
Dollar index  Last night I said this chart look lower for Tuesday  and so it was  with the dollar falling 0 43  on a fat gap down red spinning top that stopped just short of its 200 day MA at 63 93  And also like the other charts  it traded entirely outside its latest rising RTC for a bearish trigger  The indicators are now falling before even having reached overbought  so there s nothing bullish about this chart tonight  and it looks like it may go lower again on Wednesday 
Euro  Meanwhile  on Tuesday  the euro put in its usual mirror image of the dollar with a nice gain that just touched its own 200 day MA before falling back a bit to close at 1 1296  That also sent the indicators oversold for the first time in a month  and also curved the stochastic around just into position for a bullish crossover  With two white soldiers now in place  you d think this would mean the euro s getting ready to mount another attack on its 200 MA  But with the overnight actually lower and in the form of a dark cloud cover  I m not so sure  That makes this chart too tough to call for Wednesday 
Transportation  The trans got hammered on Tuesday  just like everything else  with a 2 14  drop that caused them to fall out of their rising RTC for a bearish trigger  That also sent the stochastic around just short of a bearish crossover  and with all the indicators now heading lower  there s nothing bullish about this chart for Wednesday 

All the charts are looking just dreadful tonight  However  with the VIX back above 30 again and some non trivial moves higher this time in the futures  it looks like we re due for some retracement of Tuesday s big move  which looked overdone to me  Heck  most moves lately have been overdone  leading to the wild oscillations we re seeing as we retrace the retracements  So anyway  I m going to go out on a limb and call Wednesday higher 
And finally  to quote Columbo  just one more thing  On Tuesday  technician Louise Yamada on CNBC said that declining momentum  is suggesting to me that we are looking at a bear market   She says that the SPX could test its uptrend at 1800  I think it s actually worse than that  I show the monthly rising RTC from 2009 currently at 1864 and that s not all that far away from where we are right now  In fact  if you go back to the 2012 rising trend  the SPX has already exited that one for a bearish set up  That s looking a lot to me like the bull market is dead

Last night I said that Verizon had more downside left on Tuesday  and it turns out that it  along with the rest of the Dow  took a dive  gapping down for a 2 4  loss on a red spinning top  That s a reversal warning  but not a great one  and with the lower BB not too far away at 44 19 and the stochastic still very elevated and just getting ready for a bearish crossover  the selling may not be over here yet ",2015-09-02,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-263771,263771

The Dow   Wednesday was something of a conundrum for the Dow  On Tuesday we got a big drop that gave us a bearish trigger out of a rising RTC  but on Wednesday we retraced more than 50  of Tuesday s drop  On the other hand the indicators are still rising and nearly overbought now with the stochastic completely threaded out at a high level  All of this leaves the Dow in a delicate position  In fact I don t even want to call this for Thursday 
The VIX  Last night I let the indicators get the best of me when I refused to call the VIX lower on Wednesday  But as it turns out we are actually did get a completed bearish evening star on Wednesday  And that was enough to send the indicators all oversold and the stochastic is now curving around very close to making a bullish crossover  The VIX is also near support at 26 so while it s possible there s more downside left I think it s going to be limited 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are just barely higher at 12 35 AM EDT with S P 500 up 0 03   On Wednesday ES retraced more than 50  of Tuesday s losses to form a classic bullish piercing pattern  The indicators continue to rise though are not yet overbought  However  the stochastic is now threaded out at a high level  And the new overnight seems to be forming a gravestone doji so any further advances from here might be problematic 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 1927 00 to 1934 42  That still leaves ES above its new pivot so this indicator remains bullish  
Dollar index  Last night the dollar looked for all the world like it was going lower on Wednesday  But I didn t count on the considerable support it found at its 200 day MA  The result was a big 0 42  gain on Wednesday with a small gap up green candle that also sent the indicators quite over bought  The stochastic like on many other charts is also threaded out here at a high level so this chart is also really too difficult for me to call tonight 
Euro  At least I had the sense not to try to call the euro last night  In the end the dark cloud cover prevailed  and the euro was unable to break up through its 200 day MA  On Wednesday if fell right back down to 1 1240 and the new overnight is continuing lower which has the indicators now oversold and the stochastic just about to form a bullish crossover  So with the euro now near recent support I think now it might stand a good chance of moving higher on Thursday 
Transportation  Then on Wednesday the Trans retraced almost all of Tuesday s losses with a tall green marubozu  That let the indicators continue rising and also threaded out the stochastic at a high level  And that leaves this chart in an indeterminate state so there s really no calling it tonight  
Accuracy  

The charts are playing it coy tonight  We re getting a few reversal signs in terms of the stochastic but they re not quite fully formed  And the futures aren t as much help tonight as they ve been recently  The market seems to be looking for direction right now  waiting perhaps for the next shocker out of China or something  So in the absence of a clear reading I m just going to call Thursday uncertain

Recap
Last Thursday night  I thought the market was looking toppy  what with a bunch of doji warnings on the charts  and then sure enough  on Friday  the Dow lost 272 points  We now face a holiday shortened week with all of the usual problems that implies  So lets take a look at the charts and figure out where Tuesday is going 
The technicals
The Dow  On Friday  the Dow confirmed Thursday s tall doji star with a tall red candle that nevertheless respected support just above 16 000  However  it also sent all the indicators moving lower before they ever even reached overbought  In particular  the stochastic formed a clear bearish crossover  so there s nothing bullish about this chart tonight 
The VIX  On Friday  the VIX gave us another doji star   this one gapping up eight and a half percent from Thursday s doji star   The three day result is something of a cross between a bullish morning star and a tristar pattern  also bullish  With the indicators now oversold and the stochastic quite low and ready for a bullish crossover of its own  this chart looks ready to move higher again on Tuesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 18 AM EDT  with ES up 0 52   On Friday  ES confirmed Thursday s tall inverted hammer to put in a tall red candle  But the indicators are now completely confused  with RSI falling  momentum rising  the stochastic falling from a completed bear crossover  but OBV also rising  The notable point here is that the new Monday night overnight is putting in a strong bullish piercing pattern  having already retraced most of Friday s losses  This makes it look like a rally may be coming on Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 1953 83 to 1926 25  And that was just enough to put ES back above its new pivot  so this indicator now turns back to bullish 
Dollar index  After a big jump on Thursday  the dollar continued its wayward ways on Friday  unable to make any headway to finish with a 0 19  loss on an inverted hammer that sent the indicators starting to descend off of overbought  The stochastic is completely threaded out at a high level  and therefore  is useless for predictions  The resulting Friday candle is a bullish harami  but with the dollar so nervous lately  I can t call this one tonight 
Euro  And despite two black crows on Friday  I wasn t ready to call the euro lower on Friday  That s a good thing too because it actually rose on a spinning top to close back up to 1 1150  The indicators are still oversold  but now rising  and the stochastic remains lying on the floor completely threaded out  But with support respected at 1 1090  and an overnight that s moving higher  it looks like the euro has a good chance of closing up on Tuesday 
Transportation  On Friday  the trans fell on a similar looking chart to the Dow   a red candle following a doji star  But the damage was only a little more than half of the Dow  Indicators have started to fall off of overbought  but the stochastic has yet to begin curving around for a bearish crossover  Overall though  in the absence of any bullish signs  it looks like this chart may have more downside left to it 

According to The Stock trader s Almanac  the first day after Labor Day is historically quite bullish  and it s looking like that may be the case this year too  With the market struggling to find any sense of short term direction  I m going to go with the futures tonight  While a 0 5  gain in the overnight isn t as big as the spectacular moves we ve seen recently  it s still more than enough for me to call Tuesday higher

Last Thursday night  once again  I refused to call Verizon a swing trade buy on the basis of a gap up inverted hammer  And once again  right on cue  Verizon dropped 2  on a tall gap down red candle  That sent the indicators falling off overbought  and also broke support and 44 90  So yet again  this stock is still not a swing trade buy ",2015-09-08,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-264349,264349

Recap
Despite what looked like a bearish technical pattern last night  the futures prevailed and Mr  Market had a great day on Tuesday  possibly due to some good news out of China  Who knows  I don t even pay any attention to any of that anymore  My position is that you can t believe anything they say  good or bad  So on we go to Wednesday to see where the charts may lead us next as this holiday shortened week progresses 
The technicals
The Dow  On Tuesday  the Dow confirmed historical precedents by rocketing higher right out of the gate and then continuing on to close on the highs of the day with a handy 2 42  advance  Looking at the daily chart  one can imagine a double bottom now in place over the last week   Interestingly  Tuesday s action has also caused the stochastic to curve back around just about into position for a bullish crossover from a high level  And as I always say  those are often good for a day or two of higher prices following  With the Dow now looking like it has broken out of its recent week long congestion area  I d say this chart looks good to move higher again on Wednesday 
The VIX  Last night I wrote that the VIX looks like it was ready to move higher again on Tuesday  That was of course completely wrong  as the VIX instead confirmed Monday s tall spinning top and then gapped right back down again to close more than 10  and below its levels of last Friday  But it did it on yet another doji star  That makes three in a row  This would be a classical bearish tri star pattern  except for the fact that that is entered from below  whereas this one is entered on a descending trend from above 
That just leaves us with indicators that are totally confused with RSI rising but momentum falling  and the stochastic continues to be threaded out at a low level  Tuesday s doji would suggest there is a possibility of the VIX moving higher on Wednesday  and with the indicators still closer to oversold than overbought  that still might happen 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 00 AM EDT  with ES up 0 67   ES had a fantastic day on Tuesday  putting in a tall green marubozu that handily cleared three days  resistance to close at 1966  The indicators are still not yet overbought  and the stochastic  in fact  has generated a bullish crossover from a high level just like the Dow did  This all makes me think that despite Tuesday s big gains  ES might still have enough gas left in the tank to continue higher on Wednesday  The fact that the overnight continues moving higher tends to support that view 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 1926 25 to 1950 08  That still leaves ES above its new pivot  so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  Last night  the dollar was looking too tricky for me to call  On Tuesday turns out it lost 0 26  to fall right back to where it opened last Friday  However  we now have three consecutive days of the dollar putting in lower highs and that was enough to send the indicators moving lower off of overbought peaks  We also now have a stochastic that has completed a bearish crossover  so I would say Tuesday s candle points to continue lower on Wednesday 
Euro  At least I got the euro correct  Last night I said it had a good chance of closing higher on Tuesday  and so it did  back up to 1 1186 on a tall spinning top  the second one in a row  All the indicators now continue moving higher off of oversold  and we have a bullish stochastic crossover in place  However  the new overnight is moving lower after having gapped up  now calling into question whether this is the start of a new rally or just another fake out breakout like we saw last week 
Transportation  On Tuesday  the trans outperformed the Dow with a giant 2 81  advance that clearly broke recent resistance at 7908  All the indicators continue rising but are not yet overbought  so with a tall green marubozu now in place  there are no bearish signs on this chart  

With no bearish technical indications to speak of on the charts tonight  and some decent follow through in the overnight futures  it doesn t seem unreasonable to call Wednesday higher

Last night Verizon wasn t looking at all like my preferred swing trade buy set up  but on Tuesday  it got caught up in the general market euphoria and gapped up anyway over 2 and a quarter percent to put in a green hanging man  But that also caused the stochastic to suddenly curve back around just shy of a bullish crossover  And with the other indicators having arrested their fall from overbought and now moving higher again  it looks like VZ may continue higher on Wednesday   but this is still not my preferred buy setup ",2015-09-09,The Night Owl Trader,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday:september-9,-2015-264484",264484

Recap
Last night I was pretty sure the market was going higher on Wednesday  We had a nice tall green marubozu and the indicators looked like they were rising towards overbought  But Mr  Market fooled me and instead the Dow plunged with another triple digit decline to fall right back into its recent consolidation zone  Is there no end to this  We check the charts for clues to Thursday 
The technicals
The Dow  Since last month s big dump  the Dow has been unable to put together more than two in a row in either direction  That trend continued on Wednesday when it fell 239 for its third triple point move in a row  Clearly volatility is the word  as it has been for the past month  I thought we had a chance of moving higher  and indeed  the Dow took a big leap out the gate Wednesday morning  but that was it  It was all downhill from there  That left the indicators all continuing to descend from overbought  and now with a tall bearish engulfing pattern in place  this chart just looks bearish for Thursday 
The VIX  Last night it wasn t very clear what the VIX was going to do on Wednesday  The wide ranging green candle we got on Wednesday was proof enough of that  In the end  we got a small 5 34  gain  That leaves the indicators stuck halfway between oversold and overbought  but with a completed bullish stochastic crossover and a bullish engulfing pattern now in place  it looks like this chart has more upside potential than downside risk 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 40 AM EDT  with ES down 0 08   So much for Tuesday s bullish engulfing pattern  On Wednesday  ES began with good intentions with a sharp move higher  But that was all it had  and it spent the rest of the day falling apart  The net result was a good bearish engulfing pattern  With the new overnight confirming that with a continued move lower  this chart looks nothing but bearish for Thursday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises again from 1950 08 to 1956 75  But that now leaves ES below its new pivot  so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar index  I also missed the dollar on Thursday  Wednesday night I thought it was going to lower  but instead it gapped up early  although it did finally come back in to end the day up all of 0 02   That leaves it now in a four day consolidation range  with the indicators continuing to fall off of overbought towards oversold  In general  that looks bearish except for the fact that we are now almost down to some decent three day support  On the whole though  I have to think there is still more downside available here on Thursday 
Euro  At least last night  I had the sense to equivocate on the euro after a wide ranging spinning top on Tuesday  On Wednesday  it put in a second wide ranging candle  this one a small real bodied red hanging man  which again is a reversal warning  But in the new overnight  it looks like that has also come to nothing  as the euro continues significantly higher in the new overnight  dragging the indicators higher with it  That all looks like a good setup for a higher close on Thursday 
Transportation  And finally  I was also wrong about the trans  After a tall green marubozu on Tuesday  I thought there was more room to run higher on Wednesday  But it was not to be and instead we lost 0 71  on a small bearish engulfing pattern  The indicators are not yet quite overbought  but the stochastic has just squeaked out a bearish crossover  So overall  this chart looks negative for Thursday 

Tonight  the charts are all looking decidedly more bearish than last night  and that includes the futures  With the VIX still floating around above 25  I may live to regret this  but the only logical course of action seems to be to call Thursday lower 
1 30 AM Update  Due to a sudden spike in ES  possibly due to some comments that just came out from the BOJ  I m revising my call for Thursday to simply uncertain

I was a bit surprised last night about Verizon s advance on Tuesday  but I wasn t ready to commit to a buy  Good thing too because on Wednesday  it formed the mother of all bearish engulfing patterns to close down 1  on a tall red marubozu  That sent the indicators all continuing lower  including the stochastic  so this chart definitely looks bearish tonight  Still no buy here ",2015-09-10,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-lower-264620,264620

Recap
The market ended up doing quite nicely on Tuesday  moving higher in pretty much a straight line all day long before giving back trust a tad into the close for a 229 point gain in the Dow  That finally gives us some interesting charts to chew on so let s get to them as this momentous week rolls on  Op ex and interest rates and triple witching  oh my 
The technicals
The Dow  Last night I mentioned the possibility of a rising triangle here and with a 1 4  gain it sure looks like we got a breakout on Tuesday  But does a one day pop constitute a new trend  particularly in such a tricky week  I don t think so  This one could just as easily fall back on Wednesday 
The VIX  Here s a good example   last night it appeared the VIX might move higher but instead it just continued lower  down another 7  on Tuesday  Indicators are still not yet oversold but we re now near support around 22 40  There s no immediate reversal in sight but we could possibly get a hammer on Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 2 01 AM EDT with ES down 0 14   ES had a very good day Tuesday breaking out of recent resistance at 1958  But the indicators have just gone overbought and the overnight seems to be faltering  That suggests the possibility of a nervous mean reversion on Wednesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 1948 25 to 1959 42  ES is back above its new pivot so this indicator is now bullish again 
Dollar index  Last night I didn t want to commit to a dollar gain on Tuesday and that s a shame because it had a nice 0 39  green marubozu for a bullish engulfing pattern that was stopped only by its 200 day MA  Indicators are now oversold and the stochastic just squeaked out a bullish crossover so this one looks higher on Wednesday 
Euro  At least I caught Tuesday s move lower in the euro as it slid back down to 1 1290 just touching its 200 day MA before bouncing off it a bit  The indicators are now overbought and the stochastic has completed a bearish crossover  Tuesday s trade was also outside the rising RTC for a bearish setup  The overnight though seems to be attempting a rally but everything else suggests lower on Wednesday 
Transportation  On Tuesday the Trans continued their latest uptrend with a big 1 85  gain  Indicators are back to overbought but this tall green marubozu is hardly a bearish sign 

Ordinarily I d say a good day like Tuesday with a rising triangle exit would call for continued higher  but with all the booby traps in place this week  it s possible the traders may simply take profits on Wednesday as they await the Fed  And the overnight futures seem to be supporting that  so far at least  So I ll just have to call Wednesday uncertain again  Oh  and since everyone else in the universe has weighed in on this  I ll add my own prognostication   the Fed won t raise rates until December

Well  we re coming down to the wire here  On Wednesday the markets put in another nontrivial gain as everybody looks forward to Thursday s big  big  big announcement from the Fed  It seems that Mr Market is pricing in a zero interest rate rise  Whether that s true or not remains to be seen so we go ahead with the chart rundown as usual for whatever it may be worth 
The Technicals
The Dow  Dow gained another significant 140 points to confirm Tuesday s ascending triangle breakout  That sent all of the indicators to overbought  but the stochastic has yet to begin a bearish crossover  Of course none of this means a whole lot since everybody is now waiting for the Fed decision on Thursday 
The VIX  Last night I said it looked like the VIX was likely going lower again on Wednesday  but we might get some sort of a reversal hammer  Well nice try  but instead the VIX just kept right on going lower with a 5 28  loss on a tall red marubozu  That took the indicators back to oversold and sent them all running lower with no sign of a bullish stochastic crossover as we remain in a two week long descending RTC  So there are no real bullish signs on this chart tonight at all 
Market Index Futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 12 AM EDT with ES down 0 15   ES made it two in a row on Wednesday with another decent advance that broke through resistance at 1980  The indicators continue to rise and are now just overbought  There s nothing really bearish about the technicals here tonight aside from the fact that the overnight seems to be sagging a bit  I don t know if this reflects profit taking or uncertainty about Thursday s Fed decision  but it does call into question whether ES has enough gas in the tank to move higher on Thursday 
ES Daily Pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 1959 42 to 2085 92  That still leaves ES above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar Index  The dollar definitely fooled me on Wednesday  I thought after Tuesday s big advance it still had enough gas left to break through its 200 day MA on Wednesday  but it was not to be  After a brief attempt to break through  it fell back and never challenged again  ending with a 0 25  loss  The resulting candle is a bearish harami  though the indicators remain all oversold  The stochastic is threaded out and so overall this chart looks negative Thursday 
Euro  Last night I thought the euro looked like it was going lower on Wednesday and indeed it opened lower  but then spent the rest of the day recovering to close at 1 1294  The result was a tall hammer that successfully tested the 200 day MA  That still leaves the indicators overbought  however  the stochastic has a completed bearish crossover  On the other hand  the new overnight is moving higher again gapping up significantly  And to complicate matters Wednesday s trade was outside the rising RTC for a bearish set up  The net result is that this chart has no direction at all and so I m not calling it for Thursday 
Transportation  Last night I noted that the trans had no bearish signs in sight and it proved to be true as on Thursday they gained another 0 24   But with indicators now pretty overbought and the stochastic threaded out at a high level and a short stubby spinning top sitting at the top of Tuesday s giant green candle  it s not clear that the trans have any more gas left in the tank for a further advance on Thursday  But with the Fed announcement coming out that s all moot anyway 

I normally call Fed days as  uncertain  as a matter of course  But Thursday s announcement is as uncertain as they get  The talking heads are all over the place on this one  Will the Fed raise or pass  Will it be 0 25  or  12  basis points   Will it be now or December  Or next year  Who knows  Personally  I m just sitting tight and waiting  We ll see  In the meantime  I can t think of a better occasion to call Thursday uncertain

It was good to be cautious about Verizon  NYSE VZ  last night because on Wednesday it came in dead last being the only loser in the entire Dow  The resulting dark cloud cover coupled with overbought indicators and a stochastic about to form a bearish crossover all makes this look more like a short for Thursday then any sort of a buy ",2015-09-17,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-uncertain-265308,265308

Well that was certainly interesting  The market went essentially nowhere as expected until 2 PM and then as soon as the Fed announcement came out all hell broke loose as Mr  Market went right off his meds again  First the market was up  then it was down  then was way up  and then finally it spent the rest of the afternoon sinking until the Dow finished with a modest 65 point loss  I ll have to seriously consider taking up day trading if this kind of thing continues  In the meantime we got an interesting candle so let s take a look at the implications 
The Technicals
The Dow  In the end  after all the months of endless speculation and hoopla surrounding the question of whether the Fed would raise rates in September or not  the end result was pretty anticlimactic  I will point out that the Night Owl was one of the people who predicted there would be no rate increase in September  What we did get on Thursday was a small 0 39  loss in the Dow with a tall inverted hammer that caused the indicators to peak just above overbought and begin moving lower  The stochastic is also now well positioned for a bearish crossover  While we remain in a rising RTC the stage seems to be set for a move lower 
The VIX  With all the crazy action on Thursday you would think the VIX would have spiked higher  Instead it actually fell 1   But it did it on a tall spindly spinning top that seems to have caused the indicators to bottom at oversold  With the stochastic threaded out at a low level it is useless for prediction though  However we now at least have a reversal warning so it s not out of the question that the VIX might move higher 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 39 AM EDT with ES up 0 16   Like the Dow  on Thursday ES put in a an inverted hammer with a giant upper shadow  The real body of this candle is a bearish harami and the indicators are back to overbought  We also have a new bearish stochastic crossover and the overnight is gapping lower making it look like there is more downside in store 
ES daily pivot  The ES daily pivot rise from 1979 92 to 1987 00  That s enough to put ES back below its pivot so this indicator now turns bearish 
Dollar index  After a failed attempt at reclaiming its 200 day MA on Wednesday   on Thursday the dollar simply gave up the ghost and gapped down with a huge 0 91  loss that really got going as soon as the Fed announcement came out  There is nothing bullish about this chart and with the lower BB now not too far away it looks like there s more downside in store 
Euro  And of course similarly on Thursday the euro put in a tall green candle to break resistance convincingly at 1 1359 before closing at 1 1413   its best close since August 25th  With a confirmation of Wednesday s spinning top and support from the 200 day MA  there s nothing really bearish about this chart other than the fact that the euro might have run a little too far too fast  The overnight was running slightly higher but at the moment is forming a spinning top of its own and so it s not clear whether the euro has enough gas in the tank to continue higher 
Transportation  When the smoke cleared Thursday the trans put in a tall inverted hammer just like the Dow  However unlike the Dow they actually managed to gain 0 39  as opposed to fall 0 39   That keeps them in a rising RTC and even though the indicators remain quite overbought this is only a tentative reversal sign and one which requires confirmation 

There s a small rally attempt going on in ES  but the overall look of the charts is bearish  It looks like our ascending triangle breakout is fizzling  Unfortunately  our reversal signs  like the VIX require confirmation  And to top it all off  Friday is a triple witching  So I regretfully have to call Friday uncertain  Perhaps with this crazy week finally behind us we can get back to calling the close next week  That s all she wrote

Recap
The selling resumed on Friday with typical triple witching madness on huge volume even for an options expiration day that sent just about everything lower leaving the charts with awash in a sea of red with some candles that changed things in interesting ways  So let s move on to the last full week of September and see if we can start making some calls again now that we have the Fed and OpEx out of the way 
The Technicals
The Dow  On Friday the Dow confirmed Thursday s tall inverted hammer by dumping 290 points on a tall red candle  That was enough to drop it right out of its most recent rising RTC for a bearish setup  The indicators all continued falling from overbought and the stochastic has now completed a clear bearish crossover  So there s nothing at all bullish looking about this chart for Monday 
The VIX  Somewhat surprisingly perhaps on Friday given all the market chaos the VIX did rise but only 5 39   And it did that on a small gap up red spinning top  The indicators remain oversold  but not dramatically so and we do now seem to have a completed bullish stochastic crossover  However  that s in conflict with the reversal warning from the candles so overall I can t call this chart tonight 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 16 AM EDT with ES down 0 41   On Friday ES confirmed Thursday s tall inverted hammer with its worst loss in nearly two weeks  That sent the indicators while moving lower off overbought  But they re still a long way from oversold  It was also enough of a move to send us out of a rising RTC for a bearish setup  And the new overnight seems to be continuing that trend with some further losses so there s nothing really bullish about this chart tonight  
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 1987 00 to 1958 25  ES remains below its new pivot so this indicator remains bearish 
Dollar index  After a nasty fall on Thursday the dollar gapped down early Friday  but then spent rest of the day climbing back up to retrace half of Thursday s losses on a classic bullish piercing pattern  The stochastic remains threaded out at oversold levels  but the indicators now look to have bottomed at oversold and are rising again  So this chart looks higher on Monday 
Euro  And similarly on Friday the euro put in a dark cloud cover on a wide ranging lopsided spinning top that finished by retracing half of Thursday s gains for a close at 1 1368  The new Sunday overnight seems to be confirming the bearish candle with a big gap down as indicators continue to fall off of overbought  So it looks fairly certain that the euro will close lower on Monday 
Transportation  Friday s chart of the trans looks just about exactly like the Dow so everything I wrote about the Dow applies here too  There s nothing bullish about this chart tonight 

Historically September is just a terrible month and this coming week is the worst week in September with the Dow being down 19 of the last 24 years according to The Stock Trader s Almanac  And right now it doesn t look like this year is going to be any different   Tonight all the charts look bearish  so it looks like I m just going to have to call Monday lower

Once again last Friday Verizon  NYSE VZ  joined the rest of the lemmings diving off the cliff  It dropped 1 46  on a tall red candle that broke support around 44 68  But even with that the indicators are still not yet oversold and the stochastic is a long way from even beginning a bullish crossover  Even after three straight days of losses this dog is still not a swing trade buy ",2015-09-21,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-lower-265646,265646

Recap
Well Mr  Market really fooled me on Monday  I sure wasn t expecting a 126 point gain in the Dow  Of course I can t complain since I m always net long anyway but things don t always work out exactly the way we planned  so we just forget about it and move on to Tuesday  Let me add that there s a chance I may not be able to publish Tuesday night since I have an all day event that may not leave me enough time to put together the usual post
The Technicals
The Dow  On Monday the Dow started off strong and then kept right on rising until about 11 AM when Honest Hillary  who couldn t keep her fingers off her keyboard  started twitting about how she was shocked to find that that drug prices are high That set off a decline  but the Dow nevertheless managed to finish up 0 77  on the day  And that left the indicators all moving higher even though they never hit oversold  Except for the stochastic which continues to fall and is still showing no sign of a bullish crossover  Monday s action also traded outside the rising RTC which now makes it an official bearish trigger  So it remains to be seen if Monday s rally can be sustained into Tuesday
The VIX  And on Monday the VIX put in a tall red candle confirming Friday s gap up spinning top  With indicators still oversold but not going anywhere  this just looks continued lower 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 24 AM EDT with ES down 0 23   On Monday ES put in a small bullish piercing pattern but one which still traded outside its rising RTC and that is a bearish trigger  The new overnight is forming another dark cloud cover  all of which leaves this chart too tough to call  though it looks more bearish than not 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 1958 25 to 1956 83  And that s enough to put ES back above its new pivot so this indicator flips back to bullish 
Dollar Index  On Monday the dollar took a huge 1 09  gap up pop to blast right back up through its 200 day MA  That completes a bullish stochastic crossover as the indicators all move higher just off oversold  So this chart is now technically bullish 
Euro  And on Monday the euro confirmed Friday s dark cloud cover with a tall gap down red candle to close back to 1 1206  and busting down through its own 200 day MA  Indicators continue falling off overbought  so there s nothing bullish here other than a weak rally attempt as I write this 
Transportation  After a big dump Friday  on Monday the trans retraced a quarter of that but with an unconvincing inverted hammer  With indicators still falling just off oversold  it doesn t look particularly bullish to me 

With ES so close to its pivot and with a few conflicting directions among the charts  I m going to do a conditional call tonight   if ES manages to remain above its new pivot by mid morning Tuesday  we ll close higher  But if it breaks below and stays there  we close lower

Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  was one of the weaker members of the Dow on Monday  but nonetheless managed to put in a small gain that was important because it respected support at 44 56  It was also enough to cause the indicators to begin moving higher before ever reaching oversold although the stochastic has still yet to begin turning around for a bullish crossover  So while this move was encouraging  it s still not my preferred swing trade buy entry ",2015-09-22,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-depends-on-es-pivot-265777,265777

  Updates to close 
 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  July 27  Reuters    U S  stocks rose slightly on
Monday in a late rally as investors rotated into financial
shares  which had lagged in the recent two week rally 
 Upbeat data on new home sales underpinned financial
stocks  the session s strongest sector  and prompted investors
to snap up the shares of several regional banks  which had
been among the worst hit by credit losses tied to a weak
housing market 
 Regions Financial Corp jumped 8 9 percent to  4 02 on the
New York Stock Exchange and Zions Bancorporation soared 13
percent to  12 65 on Nasdaq  while the S P financial index
rose 1 5 percent 
 Financials had lagged in the previous weeks  but Friday
saw the beginning of a rotation into the sector and out of
technology  which continued Monday  according to Michael
James  senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles 
 The Dow Jones U S  home construction index shot up 4 3
percent after data showed U S  new home sales posted their
biggest monthly gain in eight years in June  suggesting the
housing market may be starting to recover from its worst slump
since the Great Depression of the 1930s 
 Stronger than expected earnings  coupled with upbeat
economic data  have lifted indexes recently  giving stocks
their best two week run since just after the S P 500 hit a
12 year closing low in the beginning of March  The three major
indexes rose about 11 percent each over the past two weeks 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15 27 points  or
0 17 percent  to 9 108 51  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
gained 2 92 points  or 0 30 percent  to 982 18  The Nasdaq

1 967 89 
  There was a little more willingness to bid stocks up two

Recap
Last night I was conflicted about whether to call the market higher because of all the positive looking charts  or just uncertain because   I note that the Dow has been putting in lower highs since May now and Monday s high lies right along that descending line   Well the latter view turned out to be a better interpretation and that now raises some concerns  So let s continue to Wednesday as op ex week rolls along 
The technicals
The Dow  What stands out from Tuesday s results is the continuation of a trend back to May of the Dow continuing to make lower highs  While the Dow remains in a short rising RTC and the indicators remain just short of overbought  Tuesday s red spinning top is definitely concerning  And I m giving it better than even odds of going lower again on Wednesday 
The VIX  The VIX chart definitely surprised me by gaining 5 91  on a bullish harami on Tuesday after really looking like it was going lower  The net result was a trade outside the descending RTC for a bullish setup and a stochastic that s curving around for a bullish crossover  So the VIX now looks higher on Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 25 AM EDT with ES down 0 12   On Tuesday  ES found resistance at 2100 just too much for it as it fell back to 2094 on a red spinning top in a move that curved the stochastic around in preparation of a bearish crossover and peaked the indicators short of overbought  That s all a good sign of lower to come  and despite a rally attempt earlier this evening ES is now drifting back down 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2091 50 to 2096 00  That now puts ES back below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar index  At least I got this much right when last night I wrote  this chart looks bullish again   And the dollar indeed gained another 0 26  on Tuesday rejecting the spinning top in a big way  Indicators are only just barely off oversold and the bullish stochastic crossover is nicely completed so this one just looks higher again on Wednesday 
Euro  And last night I also wrote  I don t think the selling is done here yet    Good thinking too because the euro just fell out of bed Tuesday right back down to 1 1023  That was enough to drop it right out of a two week rising RTC for a bearish setup  And with indicators only just now off overbought and a bearish stochastic crossover in full effect  I think there s still room to run lower 
Transportation  It s also concerning that despite an absence of bearish signs  on Tuesday the Trans lost 0 21  on a dark cloud cover as a spinning top  Indicators are not quite yet to overbought but this pattern definitely doesn t look bullish anymore 

What a difference a day makes  Tonight all the charts are suddenly looking bearish and with continued failure at recent resistance indicating trouble finding more buyers  I m going to have to go with that and call Wednesday lower

Last night I didn t want to bless Verizon  NYSE VZ  despite a bullish engulfing pattern and indeed it lost ground on Tuesday  this time on a bearish dark cloud cover as a spinning top  With indicators still overbought and a completed bearish stochastic crossover there s just no buying this one ",2015-08-19,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-lower-262128,262128
216500,438016,VZ,Verizon  4 6  Yield  Decades Of Dividend Growth,opinion,"Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world  The company currently has a market cap of  192 9 billion 
Prior to July 3  2000  Verizon was known as Bell Atlantic  Including Bell Atlantic s dividend history  Verizon has paid steady or increasing dividends since 1984 
Investors looking for stability should look no further than Verizon  The image below shows Verizon s dividend history since 1984 

Verizon Wireless currently has a dividend yield of 4 6   For comparison  the S P 500 has a dividend yield of just 2 0   Verizon s dividend yield is 130  greater than the S P 500 s 
This makes Verizon Wireless an ideal candidate for retired or soon to be retired investors seeking both stability and yield 
Verizon s Yield History
Now is not  the perfect time  to buy Verizon stock  but that doesn t mean it is a bad time  either  The image below shows Verizon s dividend yield fluctuations over the last decade 

The best time to buy Verizon was in 2010  At that time  the stock could be purchased at yields of 6    and even briefly above 7   Stock don t become undervalued because everything is going well 
In 2010  Verizon s dividend payments were very much in question  The company had a large debt load  and GAAP earnings had been reduced due to the Great Recession   which had reached its bottom only a year earlier  The company had a payout ratio over 200  
As we all know now  Verizon did recover  The company continues to pay increasing dividends to this day 
Today  potential investors in Verizon no longer face the uncertainty investors in 2010 did  What makes Verizon appealing today is its high yield despite the current low rate environment 
The image below shows the yield on the 10 year U S  treasury bond  going as far back as the 19th century 

You can clearly see that we are a historically low yield environment  The 10 year treasury interest rate has only fallen since 2010  The only time in United States history that rivals today s low rate environment is the early 1940 s   when rates were artificially reduced to support World War II spending 
Verizon still has such a high yield because management is committed to paying out the bulk of its profits as dividends  From 2005 through 2014  Verizon had an average payout ratio of 73   using adjusted earnings  
While interest rates and yields have fallen in general  this is not the specific case with Verizon Wireless  In the year 2000  Verizon had a dividend yield of around 3   and the interest rate on 10 year treasury bonds was 6   Today  Verizon has a 4 6  dividend yield  while the 10 year treasury bond s yield has fallen to 2 1  
Recent Results   Total Returns
Verizon s high yield is attractive in today s low rate world relative to other investments  On top of this  the company posted solid results in its most recent quarter 
Earnings per share grew 14 3   using adjusted earnings  versus the same quarter a year ago  Verizon s CEO Lowell McAdam had this to say about the positive results 

 Verizon has delivered another quarter of strong financial and operational results  based on consistent network reliability and superior value that continues to attract new customers  In the second quarter  we again balanced quality Verizon Wireless connections growth with low churn and profitability  and we announced and completed our acquisition of AOL  We re now poised to offer customers exciting new over the top  OTT  mobile video services  and we look forward to a very positive second half of 2015  

Earnings per share growth was a result of the following 

Comparable revenue grew 2 8 
Wireless segment EBITDA margin increased from 42 3  to 43 9 
Wireline segment EBITDA margin increased from 23 4  to 23 5 
Diluted shares outstanding fell 1 6  due to share repurchases

Verizon s margin gains in its wireless segment were the biggest driver of favorable growth in the company s most recent quarter  The company realized its lowest wireless churn rate in 3 years of just 0 9   Churn measures the percentage of customers who cancel their service in a given month 
Over the last decade  Verizon has compounded its earnings per share at 3 0  a year  Dividends have grown at 3 2  a year 
Verizon s management is expecting revenue growth of around 3 0  a year going forward  in line with historical growth  With continued share repurchases  the company should be able to compound earnings per share at a rate of 4 0  a year  not accounting for additional margin improvements 
Verizon s management has managed to realize faster earnings per share growth in recent years  If the company can continue to boost margins through efficiency gains  shareholders could see earnings per share growth of 7  to 8  a year 
Investors in Verizon should expect total returns of between 8 6  and 12 6  a year from dividends  4 6   and earnings per share growth  4  to 8   
Final Thoughts
The S P 500 has offered investors compound total returns of around 9  a year over the long run  Verizon Wireless  expected total returns of 8 6  to 12 6   10 6  on average  make it likely that investors in Verizon Wireless will outperform the market 
Despite offering higher expected total returns  Verizon Wireless has a price to earnings ratio of just 12 9  using adjusted earnings   Compared with the S P 500 s current price to earnings ratio of 20 7  Verizon Wireless appears undervalued 
In addition  the company is highly stable  Verizon s 3 decade streak of stable or increasing dividends shows the company has reliably rewarded income investors  Verizon Wireless ranks in the top 30  of long term dividend stocks using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing thanks to its solid total return potential  low valuation  and stability ",2015-08-21,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verizon-wireless:-4.6-yield---3-decades-of-stable-dividend-growth-262490,262490

Recap
Well I guess there s not much I can say about Friday s collapse that hasn t already been said  I sat there watching the market go off the rails all afternoon like some rubber necker gawking at a bad car crash  I had to scroll my Dow chart all the way back to 2008 to find the last similar incident of such a bad sell off   and that was in October  08 when Lehman Brothers collapsed  Is the current state of things  which I gather is largely due to fears of Chinese book cooking  really as bad as that was  Lets take a look at the charts and see if we can sort some reality from the smoking wreckage and get a clue as to where Monday s going 
The technicals

The Dow  Well now here s something you don t see every day  in fact  this is something I ve never seen in more than 10 years of doing this  Technically  we had a bearish setup on a rising RTC exit last Wednesday  as you can see from the chart  Then on Thursday  we got a confirming bearish trigger and finally on Friday  we got the payoff in a 500 point plus dive 
But what s most concerning about this chart is the lower red line slightly increasing to the right that represents the lower line of a rising RTC that goes all the way back to the bottom of the Great Recession back in March of 2009  Any breach of this line represents a bearish setup of that rising RTC  In other words  the Dow has been rising more or less continuously ever since then  Any break of that line indicates the clear possibility that the long running bull market ever since is now over 
But in the short term  at least we re looking at a market that has gone not just inverse parabolic  but inverse hyperbolic  Of course  this may be exaggerated because last Friday was an options expiration day  but still  this is about as overdone as I ve ever seen  and that goes back to the Great Recession  So I ve got to think there s a short term reversal coming Real Soon Now 


The VIX  And now here s something even more astonishing  Check out this chart of the VIX  It pretty much speaks for itself  This one s headed straight to the moon  Alice  Normally  I d say it s more than ready to come crashing back down  but the past few days have been anything but ordinary 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are wildly lower at 12 19 AM EDT  with ES down an astounding 2 28   I have never ever seen a move of this magnitude in the overnight  What the heck   did Martians just land in China or something  
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot crashes again from 2042 58 to 1989 25  I believe this is the biggest one day drop in the pivot I ve ever seen and I ve been doing this since 2003  That leaves this indicator beyond bearish   it s just plain spooky 
Dollar index  On Friday  the dollar took its own impressive move  with a huge one percent gap down red candle that busted its 200 day MA  That sent the indicators oversold  but not overly so  And jeez  this thing traded entirely below its lower BB  But without a bullish stochastic crossover and no nearby support  I can t call it higher yet 
Euro  And in perfect mirror image fashion  on Friday  the euro broke up through its own 200 day MA for a four day winning streak to close at 1 1450  its highest since May 15th  That sent the indicators overbought  but they continue to rise  and with a steep rising RTC in effect  there s no calling this lower 
Transportation  The trans on Friday were pretty much a copy of the Dow  so everything I wrote there applies here too 


Earlier Sunday afternoon  I was all set to be writing about how Friday s action looked like a classic panic driven washout and how the selling would be about exhausted  But judging by the futures this evening  that s clearly not the case  Apparently  a bunch of stops are getting triggered and they re all diving for the exits at once  This is the sort of market that separates the Night Owls from the parakeets  It pretty much defines what it means to take the heat  and it s getting pretty hot  As for me  when the VIX went over 20  I stopped trading  I think there s going to be a great buying opportunity soon  but it ain t gonna be on Monday  This call is easy  Monday lower   much lower 
Single Stock Trader
VZ took a dive last Friday along with everything else in the market  although it wasn t hurt as bad as most of the rest of the Dow  We got an inverted hammer  making that the second one in a row  It was enough to drive the indicators extremely oversold  and we re now looking at a waterfall inverse exponential pattern  We also have strong multi year support not too far away at 45 80 and then the lower BB 45 74 just below that  It s still not quite my ideal setup  as the stochastic has not yet formed a bullish crossover  but it s pretty darn close  so if the market is looking at all decent on Monday morning at the open  I wouldn t be adverse to buying this here  Unfortunately  that doesn t look like it s going to happen ",2015-08-24,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-big-time-lower-262628,262628

Recap
Words simply fail me  I thought last Friday s action was crazy but Monday topped them all  Just for laughs  I drew a descending RTC matching the current collapse and it shows that if this trend continues  the dad will hit zero on December 8th of this year  Obviously Mr  Market is totally off his meds and has gone completely psycho  But we need to maintain some sort of stability and the charts are going to have to provide that as we take a look at Tuesday to see when this insanity may end 
The technicals
The Dow  This was absolutely amazing  On Monday  the Dow put in the mother of all hammers  let s call it Thor s hammer  with more than a 1000 point spread from top to bottom  We also saw selling volume reach a climax that exceeded even last Friday s crazy option expiration levels and finally sent the stochastic starting to curve around for a bullish crossover  Meanwhile  RSI hit 7 5  which is well below the level from which reversals usually come   This is capitulation if I ever saw it  With a candle that traded entirely below the lower BB  this is about as good a reversal indicator as I have ever seen  Ever 
The VIX  I thought Friday s VIX candle was crazy  but on Monday  the VIX picked up right where it left off  finally topping out at over 53  a level that we haven t seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008  That only served to enhance the hyperbolic nature of the current run up and we know how those things always end  Always  The indicators have now hit impossibly overbought levels with RSI almost 98 and the stochastic finally curving around for a bearish crossover  It is completely amazing to me that the VIX should now be at levels we haven t seen since the Great Recession  I don t care what s going on in China  this doesn t make any sense whatsoever  With a gigantic inverted hammer  the VIX now looks more than ready to come crashing back down to earth and reality 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are finally higher at 1 09 AM EDT  with ES up an astounding 2 34   That s an even bigger move up than the crash lower we saw last night  I m really running out of superlative adjectives here looking at the daily chart for ES  On Monday  the selling simply accelerated  as ES fell right over a cliff  falling all the way down to 1831 before finally recovering a bit  With 5 days of ever taller red candles  this is a textbook perfect inverse exponential and it s one that looks about ready to end  And the overnight seems to be supporting that theory  ES has now already retraced about 20  of Monday s losses  and that s causing the stochastic to just barely give us a brand new bullish crossover  while the rest of the indicators are still quite oversold  This to me looks ready to reverse on Tuesday  Heck  we ve already retraced half of Monday s losses and it s still only 1 AM 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot crashes again from 1989 25 to 1889 00  That amazing 100 point drop  plus the gain in ES  is enough to put it  finally  back above its new pivot  so this indicator now turns bullish 
Dollar index  Along with everything else on Monday  there was outsized action in the dollar as it cratered an amazing 1 74   crashing right down through its 200 day MA  And like the other charts  it s gone inverse hyperbolic with a series of gap down candles  with the gap getting larger and larger everyday  You d think this is never going to end  but this kind of pattern always ends with a big reversal   And with a giant spinning top on the books  it looks like this is as good a time as any for that reversal to happen 
Euro  The euro  meanwhile  made a perfect mirror image of the action in the dollar  rocketing right back up through its 200 day MA and through resistance at 1 1461 to close at 1 1603  And like the other charts  we have a classic exponential pattern here that s now got the indicators quite overbought and the stochastic in position for a bearish crossover  So it looks like the euro is ready to come back in for a landing pretty soon  and the overnight is  in fact  finally  finally guiding lower in non trivial fashion  lending support to that theory 
Transportation  On Monday  the trans were pretty much a carbon copy of the Dow   giant hammer candle  indicators at extreme oversold levels  trading entirely below the lower BB with a stochastic just about to curve around for a bullish crossover  It looks like we re about out of sellers  so I think this one is finally ready to reverse 

We have some really rare and freaky chart patterns going on the past two days  With everything at such extreme oversold overbought levels  it s high time for a reversal  I ll note also that the SPX Hi Lo indicator hit zero on Friday  It doesn t get any lower than that  And of course with the futures rallying hard in the overnight  I m reasonably confident that I can call Tuesday higher

On Monday  Verizon put in the spinning top to end all spending tops  After bottoming at an incredible 38 06  it shot right back up again to finish at 44 74  still lower than its lower BB on massively increased volume  It also formed a bullish stochastic crossover  and RSI has now hit one  which is amazing in itself  This is about as good a reversal indication as you re ever going to see  and in this crazy world we ve got going right now  I have to call it a buy ",2015-08-25,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-262799,262799

Recap
Well it was another wild day on Wall Street Tuesday as the Dow opened up big as I had expected only to see all those gains evaporate after 3 o clock when  apparently  the Chicoms decided to lower their interest rates again  That led to a 205 point loss for the Dow which makes four 200 point plus moves in a row and is  apparently  the only time in its entire history that that has happened 
So just what the heck is going on here  The market s crashing  the market s not crashing  The Fed is going to raise rates in September  the Fed is going to raise rates next March  We re in a correction  we re not in a correction  The economy is fundamentally fine  the economy is fundamentally flawed  Just who are you supposed to believe  Personally  the only thing I believe is the charts   so let s get right over there and see if we can make any sense at all out of this craziness 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow just continues to get jerked around by the Chicoms  On Monday we got a tall hammer  which is a good reversal sign  and on Tuesday we ended up with a tall inverted hammer  also a good bullish reversal sign  And this one was accompanied by a bullish stochastic crossover and highly oversold indicators  RSI is now 3 48   The losing streak is now 6 in a row and  as we ve mentioned  four in a row for 200 point plus moves lower  so there has to come a point where the selling is exhausted  Technically this chart looks like its going higher  but with the VIX still nearly 40 there s just no telling 
The VIX  Last night I said the VIX looked ready to move lower and indeed that s just what happened on Tuesday with an 11 59  decline   although it was on a green spinning top  Still that candle is in a bearish harami position and the indicators have now peaked at overbought and are proceeding lower  Also the stochastic just gave us the bearish crossover and it s at a very high level  which means that it s more likely for the VIX to move lower than higher from here 
Even more interesting  and this is a chart I haven t seen anyone mention lately  is the VVIX  which basically measures the volatility of the VIX  Just take a look at this  The long term historical mean of the VVIX is 86  On Monday it hit an astonishing high of 212  Then on Tuesday it gapped down hard to end at a still breathtaking 192 on a small green spinning top  Those three most recent candles put together constitute a good evening star and that s a bearish pattern  We also have a bearish stochastic crossover and indicators that are still overbought but now starting to move lower  That all portends a lower VIX  And that means that the market is likely to move higher real soon now 

Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 04 AM EDT with ES up 1 32   On Tuesday ES put in what ended up being a super tall long legged doji star sitting at the bottom of Monday s candle  With RSI now at an extraordinarily low 0 63 and the stochastic lying flat on the floor one would think that there s a lot more upside potential here than downside risk  But the volatility just keeps on coming in the overnight  
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot ticks up from 1889 00 to 1893 75  An overnight rally in ES has now put it back above its new pivot so this indicator is once again bullish 
Dollar index  After a big gap down on Monday the dollar gapped right back up again retracing 50  of those losses on Tuesday  Monday s 1 27  gain was enough to form a bullish stochastic crossover and send the indicators higher although they are still oversold  We re also still in a descending RTC but nearing the right hand edge  All in all this chart looks like it might have possibilities to move higher again on Wednesday 
Euro  Meanwhile volume continue to be extraordinarily high in the euro trade on Tuesday and after a tall green candle on Monday  the euro fell right back down again on Tuesday with a red inside harami to close at 1 1429  The overnight is gapping up higher once again so with the current muddled state of affairs who knows where this one is going on Wednesday 
Transportation  Despite an exponential run down in the trans  there seems to be no stopping this headlong rush to oblivion  I extrapolated the descending RTC and if the trend continues falling at the current rate they will hit zero by November 8th of this year  That s right  absolute zero  The losing streak is now six days and despite massively oversold indicators the stochastic has yet to form a bullish crossover  In fact its lines are now falling off the bottom of my chart   I can t even see them anymore  So I still can t call a reversal here yet 

I m probably taking my life in my hands by saying this  but purely technically we now have two very good reversal candles  a giant hammer followed by a giant inverted hammer  And all the charts remain crazy overextended in all sorts of directions so the only logical call is for Wednesday higher  But Lord knows  the market has been anything but logical recently  All it will take to derail this is one peep out of the Peeple s Bank of Communist China or some inopportune sound bite from a Fed head given that the VIX is still up there in outer space somewhere  Either way  should make for an interesting session 
In closing  there is an interesting chart I would like to show you 

Now it s interesting to note that if you look at the Dow in 2011 both August and September were truly crummy months  But once September was over October took off and we went on a 7 month winning streak  If history is any guide  this would imply that we have another month of downward pressure before seeing a significant rally into the end of the year  Just sayin   I grabbed this chart from Morningstar s great website  This is their market fair value indicator that tells whether the market as a whole is overbought  the red areas  or oversold  the blue areas   Today this indicator hit 0 89  The last time we were at this level following an extended period of being overbought was back on August 4th  2011  Notice the similarities between the situation we have now and what was going on back in 2011  You have an extended period of being overbought after which we hit the break even level then we have a double bottom of oversold conditions followed by a big crash  In 2011 we ended up hitting 0 79 on October 4th

Last night Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  looked like a good buy  And on Tuesday it indeed opened way higher and then continued upwards only to give it all back in the end  Leaving us right where we started  However the indicators are still way oversold and the stochastic is just microns away from a bullish crossover so I still have to think that this chart has possibilities  The fact that support at 40 47 held is encouraging ",2015-08-26,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-262967,262967

Wednesday morning started out pretty much like a rerun of Tuesday  with a big jump upwards followed by a slide back down again  But in the middle of the day  Dudley Doright came to the rescue with some welcome comments about the possibility of a delay in Fed interest rate rate hikes  That sounded the all clear and the Dow began moving higher again  Not even the 2 PM margin call stumble could keep it from finishing at session highs  As we move on into the home stretch for this crazy month  lets look at the charts to see if the bottom is in or what as we ponder Thursday 
The technicals
The Dow  The double hammer pattern that we ve seen over the past few days  one normal and one inverted finally proved to be too much for the bears and on Wednesday  the day ended up on a 619 point tear  That retraced all of Tuesday s losses plus most of Monday s losses  It also confirmed a new bullish stochastic crossover and caused all of the indicators to bottom at oversold  They are all now rising nicely  Ordinarily  I d say we re due for a pause  but these are not ordinary times  The candle itself is a tall green marubozu and the indicators are all still oversold  so I d say this chart now looks technically bullish 
The VIX  Earth to VIX  you re now cleared for reentry  On Wednesday  the VIX dropped nearly 16  on a lopsided red spinning top  its first red candle in 7 sessions  Indicators have now all clearly topped and are descending  though still overbought  We also have a nicely completed bearish crossover  so this chart now looks full on bearish 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are marginally higher at 12 21 AM EDT  with ES up 0 06   ES had an amazing day on Wednesday  rocketing all the way back up to 1938  And that big move still left the indicators oversold  They re all rising now  and we have a completed bullish crossover  So with Tuesday s giant doji star confirmed  technically this chart looks continued bullish 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises again from 1893 75 to 1910 50  That still leaves ES comfortably above its new pivot  so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  On Wednesday  the dollar rose nicely with a gap up green hanging man that stopped only at its 200 day MA  The indicators are now just off oversold and the stochastic has completed a bullish crossover  We ve also exited a descending RTC and that s a bullish setup  Now if the dollar can just clear resistance at the MA  we re good for more advances on Thursday 
Euro  The euro  meanwhile  made it two down in a row following Monday s high of 1 1718  On Wednesday  it closed at 1 1352  stopping exactly on its 200 day MA  But all of the indicators are now off overbought and descending nicely with a completed bearish stochastic crossover  and Wednesday s candle exited a week long rising RTC  so that s a bearish set up  That means this chart now looks continued bearish 
Transportation  Finally  the trans also had a great day on Wednesday  solidly establishing support at 7467 and giving us a tall green marubozu  That retraced all of Tuesday s losses and nearly half of Monday s  The indicators remain oversold  are now rising off the bottom  and we have a completed bullish stochastic crossover  That all means this chart now looks bullish 

OK  so here s the problem I m having tonight  All the charts are looking technically bullish  but with the VIX still over 30 and the futures basically flat in the overnight  so far it feels like flipping a coin and having it land on its edge  The slightest breeze could make it fall over either way  And with the wind gusting from all points of the compass lately  this weather owl isn t taking any chances  Thursday uncertain  Jack

Recap
I called last Friday  uncertain  and with Dow closing down all of 12 points  but the SPX ending up 16 points  I think that was about as uncertain as it gets  There were some interesting candles though   so lets head straight to the charts and see if we can t figure out the last day of August as we bring this miserable month to a close 
The technicals
The Dow  On Friday  the Dow was unable to make any headway at all after two big days of gains  It finished with a classic doji star  which is at least something of a reversal warning  Indicators continue to rise off oversold and the stochastic is now about halfway on its trip from oversold to overbought  More importantly  perhaps  is that on Friday  the Dow just barely managed to recover the lower edge of its long running multi year rising RTC  which currently stands at 16 630  That would cancel the bearish monthly RTC setup if we can close higher again on Monday  So while we do have a reversal warning tonight  it s one of those that requires confirmation  and with indicators not yet overbought  I can t call this one lower yet 
The VIX  Meanwhile  on Friday  the VIX continued its re entry into low Earth orbit following its short visit outside the solar system last week  It formed a small red candle that looks like a bullish piercing pattern  The indicators continue falling off overbought and the stochastic has begun curving around in preparation for a bullish crossover  It s not the best reversal indicator  but I do think there s a move higher coming in the next few days 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 08 AM EDT  with ES down 1 19   On Friday  ES put in a perfect doji star  sitting right at the top of Thursday s large gains  That was enough to send the indicators off of oversold  and they are all now rising towards overbought  We remain inside the latest rising RTC  however  the overnight is moving significantly lower  and in fact is sitting right on the edge of that RTC   This appears to be confirming the doji  so I would be looking for a move lower on Monday here 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 1971 33 to 1983 25  That now puts ES back below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar index  Last Friday  the dollar defied a gap up gravestone doji from Thursday and continued to move higher  gaining an impressive 0 51  as it left its 200 day MA in the dust  It s now on a four day winning streak  with indicators that still have not hit overbought  So in the absence of any bearish reversal signs  I can t call the dollar lower on Monday 
Euro  Last Thursday night  I wrote that  there s more downside coming here on Friday   and that proved to be exactly right as it closed back down to 1 1185  That was also the payoff for the bearish trigger we got on Thursday from Wednesday s exit from the rising RTC  Indicators are now all falling off overbought  but not yet down to oversold  We now have four down in a row and nothing really bullish about these charts  However  the overnight is showing us a non trivial gain up 0 22  in the new overnight so far  so it s possible we have a bottom here since there is some good support at 1 1172 
Transportation  Finally on Friday  the trans handily outperformed the Dow with a 0 53  gain compared to the Dow s 0 07  loss  That now gives the trans a three day winning streak and a new rising RTC  The indicators also continue rising and are now off of oversold  With a bullish stochastic crossover in full effect  there s nothing bearish on this chart tonight 

Tonight the charts are telling me the market kind of ran out of gas after two big up days last Thursday and Friday  With the futures guiding significantly lower  I m just going to call Monday lower

Last Thursday night  I thought Verizon might have a little bit more upside left to go  but that proved to be too optimistic  Instead  Thursday s hanging man was confirmed with a second reversal warning   this one a small doji star  The indicators have also stopped rising just short of overbought and the stochastic is flattening in preparation for a bearish crossover  That means Verizon is no longer a swing trade buy and in fact  may be getting ready to move lower in the next few days ",2015-08-31,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-lower-263466,263466

Recap
They knocked  em lower into the close to end August on a down note  It made for some interesting candles  so we ll get to them in a moment as we begin a brand new month  But first I want to mention something interesting I saw in the Stock Trader s Almanac   the DF DM warning  not to be confused with KMFDM which is a really awesome industrial band   There s something interesting in there which I will discuss at the bottom of this post  I encourage you to check it out 
The technicals
The Dow  Last night  we had a reversal warning in the form of a doji star on Friday  but I wasn t ready to call it lower just yet because it required confirmation  On Monday  we got that confirmation in the form of the 115 point decline in the Dow  This was also just enough to drop it outside of its latest admittedly short but steep rising RTC  and that is a bearish setup  The indicators are still short of overbought  but with a confirmation of the bearish star  this chart looks lower again 
The VIX  Last night  I noted the possibility that the VIX might be ready to move higher in a few days  It didn t even take that long  as it rose over 9  on Monday confirming Friday s inverted hammer  Momentum has now started moving higher again and the stochastic is almost down to oversold levels and preparing for a bullish crossover  Monday s action also traded entirely outside the latest descending RTC for a bullish setup  So over all  this chart looks like it has more upside left for Tuesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 26 AM EDT  with ES down 1 42   On Monday  ES handily confirmed Friday s doji star with a red candle that retraced half of Friday s gains  The indicators have now stalled halfway between oversold and overbought  and the stochastic is curving around nicely for a bearish crossover  I will note too that OBV began falling two days ago  With the overnight guiding strongly lower  this chart definitely looks lower on Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 1983 25 to 1972 08  ES remains well below that level  and so tonight  this indicator turns back to bearish 
Dollar index  On Monday  the dollar retraced half of Friday s gains  dropping 0 3  on an inverted hammer  Indicators are now almost up to overbought and the stochastic is starting to curve around for a bearish crossover  This was also just enough to exit the latest rising RTC for a bearish setup  So overall  this chart looks bearish for Tuesday 
Euro  Similarly  on Monday  the euro retraced most of Friday s losses to close right back up to 1 12 for 7  That was also just enough to place it on the edge of its descending RTC for a bullish set up  The stochastic is also beginning to curve around for a bullish crossover and the overnight seems to be guiding higher again  all of which makes it look like euro will move still higher on Tuesday 
Transportation  So much for Friday s outperformance  On Monday  the trans dropped 0 8   It definitely looks now like the trans have run out of gas and their latest rising RTC is over  That s a bearish setup  Momentum and money flow have already started moving lower  though RSI continues to climb slightly  The stochastic looks like it s curving around to begin a bearish crossover  although it s still not really quite all that over bought  But the overall gestalt of this chart is that it looks bearish 

Tonight we got a bunch of reversal warnings in the form of RTC exits  and those are usually pretty good  Add in futures that are guiding non trivially lower  and although the first of most months is historically bullish  I m afraid I m going to have to call Tuesday lower  I ll be happy to be proven wrong 
DF DM
In The Stock Trader s Almanac  they talk about the DF DM warning  that is  down Friday   down Monday   It refers to instances where the Dow closes lower on a given Friday and then again on the following Monday  Apparently  the average total number of DF DM days in a year going back to 1995 is 10  And it seems that in years that have larger than average DF DM counts  the market subsequently moves lower  Notable examples include 2001 2002  where this warning hit 13 and 18 respectively  and in 2008  when it hit 15  So where does this leave DF DM this year  Drum roll please    The answer is 9 so far  And the year is only two thirds over  So it looks like DF DM in 2015 will probably end up above average  And that bodes ill for next year  Add in the monthly rising RTC exits we ve gotten for the Dow  and it ain t looking good  folks  Just sayin

Last night  I said that Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE VZ   may in fact may be getting ready to move lower in the next few days   and that s just what it did on Monday  We now have three reversal candles in a row  the lopsided spinning top on Monday following a doji star on Friday and a fat spinning top Thursday  Monday s candle also fell out of a short but steep rising RTC  and the stochastic is flattening out for a bearish crossover  So even though the indicators are not yet overbought  this one looks like it has more downside risk than upside potential at this point ",2015-09-01,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-night-owl-trade-263604,263604

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Oct 27  Reuters    Risk aversion swept financial
markets on Monday as fears of a global recession bolstered the
dollar and yen while driving equities around the world lower 
sending both U S  and European stocks to five and a half year
lows 
 Pessimism about the deteriorating global economic outlook
pushed the price of crude oil to a 17 month low below  62 a
barrel at one point and sent the yen to an almost 13 year peak
against the dollar on risk aversion 
 Major U S  stock indexes closed down more than 2 percent
after a see saw session in which investors cheered the solid
wireless sales at Verizon Communications Inc   but then
sold off heavily in another wild session where stock prices
swung violently at the end 
 Trading was volatile and volume was light in New York  with
stocks falling sharply in the last half hour of trading  With
just four days left in October  the S P 500 is on track for its
worst month ever in the post World War Two period 
 Hedge funds and mutual funds have been dumping stocks to
raise cash to meet redemptions from their clients  traders
noted  exacerbating the late day selling 
 Earlier in Europe  shares fell to a five and a half year
closing low following a plunge in Japan that pushed stocks to
26 year closing lows  Most other Asian markets also fell
heavily in chaotic trade as investors feared a flurry of
central bank moves would not be enough to stave off a global
recession 
  It is so negative out there  you felt like a skater
without any skates   it couldn t stay up   said Angel Mata 
managing director of listed equity trading  Stifel Nicolaus
Capital in Baltimore 
  People right now are expecting the worst  a total collapse
of the hedge fund industry with half of them  hedge funds  not

 Technology shares also weighed on the broader market  with
Microsoft a top drag on Nasdaq after The Wall Street Journal
reported that defaults on tech financings    loans that let
companies buy computers  software and other products    have
spiked this year 
 Verizon closed up 10 percent at  27 61 
 The dollar climbed to its strongest level against the euro
in about two and a half years  while the yen hovered near
13 year peaks against the dollar  The yen also rose to its
highest level since May 2002 versus the single euro zone
currency despite concern by Group of Seven finance officials
about its excessive volatility 
 Both the dollar and yen have been the biggest beneficiaries
of global capital flows as investors unwind carry trades  which
use the low yielding Japanese currency to buy everything from
higher yielding currencies to stocks and commodities 
  This is a continuation of deleveraging and unwinding of
risk that has been happening the past week and this has
benefited the yen and the dollar   said Omer Esiner  senior
market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
closed down 1 7 percent at 816 04 points    the lowest close
since May 2003 
 The chemicals sector weighed heavily on the benchmark
index  with BASF  down 10 9 percent  Clariant 
8 4 percent lower and Wacker Chemie  falling 9 7
percent 
 Fear of a global recession remained high in other markets 
too  helping push the yield on two year bunds  to its
lowest in three years 
 The price of U S  government debt  which moves in the
opposite direction of yield  was capped by a slight improvement
of sentiment in short term funding markets  helped by a Federal
Reserve program to buy commercial paper 
 But most Treasury debt turned lower 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  fell
10 32 in price to yield 3 71 percent  The 2 year U S  Treasury
note  slipped 5 32 in price to yield 1 57 percent 
 The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies  with
the U S  Dollar Index  up 0 54 percent at 87 023 
 The euro  fell 0 93 percent at  1 2505  while against
the yen  the dollar  lost 0 99 percent at 93 34 
 U S  light crude for December delivery  settled at
 63 22 a barrel  down 93 cents  its lowest settlement price
since May 29  2007  London Brent crude  settled down 64
cents to  61 41 a barrel 
 Oil prices have dropped by nearly 60 percent from a record
high  147 27 a barrel in July as global economic turmoil dents
fuel consumption around the world 
 Gloom about the world economy has had a greater impact than
a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
on Friday to chop output by 1 5 million barrels per day 
  What OPEC did is constructive  but right now that is

 New York gold futures rose as an intraday rebound in the
battered U S  stock market provided support to commodities
despite the stronger dollar 
 The December gold contract  settled up  12 60 at

  Adds job cut details  share move 
 By Sinead Carew
 NEW YORK  July 27  Reuters    Verizon Communications Inc
 posted a lower quarterly profit and said it would cut
8 000 jobs in its wireline business  as weakness in wholesale
and corporate segments overshadowed wireless growth 
 Verizon  whose shares fell 1 5 percent on Monday morning 
said it would accelerate cost cuts in its landline business 
with new layoffs amounting to 3 4 percent of its workforce
totaling 235 000 employees  They come on top of 8 000 job cuts
in the last year 
  Clearly the broader economic issues are affecting the
business   Chief Financial Officer John Killian told analysts
on a conference call 
 The company said that some of the job cuts will affect
contract workers as well as internal employees  It did not
break out the split 
 In addition to short term cost cuts  Verizon would  also
need to more significantly reduce the wireline cost structure
over the next 12 to 18 months   Killian said 
 Verizon s second quarter results were largely in line with
Wall Street expectations  While revenue rose 0 2 percent in its
mass market landline segment  including home phones and small
businesses  that was offset by declines in the wholesale and
enterprise business 
 Operating revenue rose 11 percent to  26 86 billion in the
second quarter  and compared with the average analyst estimate
of  26 85 billion  according to Reuters Estimates 
 Subscriber growth at Verizon Wireless and its biggest rival
AT T Inc  probably means that customers switched from
smaller rivals such as Sprint Nextel Corp  and T Mobile
USA  owned by Deutsche Telekom   said Hudson Square
Research analyst Todd Rethemeier 
  It s reassuring that both Verizon and AT T had good
postpaid subscriber growth but it s somewhat worrisome for
Sprint and possibly T Mobile USA  who have yet to report   he
said 
 Verizon s second quarter profit fell to  3 16 billion  or
52 cents per share  from  3 4 billion  or 66 cents a share  in
the same quarter a year earlier 
 Excluding items such as merger integration and pension
charges  profit was 63 cents per share  in line with analysts 
average estimates  according to Reuters Estimates 
 On Friday  Verizon Wireless  the biggest U S  mobile
service  said it added 1 1 million wireless subscribers in the
quarter 
 AT T Inc  said last week that it added 1 4 million net
new customers 
 Verizon  which owns Verizon Wireless with Vodafone Group
Plc   said that before merger costs and other items 
wireless margins on earnings before interest tax  depreciation
and amortization rose 0 7 percent to 46 3 percent 
 In comparison AT T margins were hurt by hefty costs from
subsidies for Apple Inc s  iPhone

Recap
Last Friday held true to historical form as the Dow dropped 56 points after two nice days of gains  That comes at an interesting juncture as we begin a new month  so lets head straight to the charts to see what they have to say about Monday 
The technicals
The Dow  For the third day in a row  the Dow was stymied by the 200 day MA last Friday  After two failed attempts to break through  it just gave up and moved lower  That confirmed Thursday s dragonfly doji and curved the stochastic around to prepare for a bearish crossover  With a candle that closed right on the edge of a short rising RTC  this chart now looks more bearish than not for Monday 
The VIX  After a confirmed bearish evening star last week that sent the VIX scurrying back below its 200 day MA  on Friday we got a small doji star that after four days of declines signals a reversal warning  That s supported by a descending RTC exit for a bullish setup  And the stochastic is curving around for a bullish crossover  so I d say the VIX is going higher any day now 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 18 AM EDT  with ES Dow 0 11   Last Friday  ES gave us a second reversal warning in a row with a lopsided spinning top following a hanging man  With indicators nearly overbought and the futures not doing much of anything in the overnight  I d be cautious about going long at this point 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2098 58 to 2101 00  That now places ES back below its new pivot for the first time in several days  so this indicator turns back to bearish 
Dollar index  On Friday  the dollar put in perhaps the tallest gravestone doji I ve ever seen  battling its way back from early losses to finish essentially unchanged  But with the indicators caught halfway between oversold and overbought  and what looks like a bearish evening star complete  once again  this chart is too tough to call 
Euro  And similarly  I couldn t get a good read on the euro last Thursday night  but looking at the crazy gravestone doji we got  who can blame me  A big attempted move higher was soundly rejected and the indicators continue falling towards oversold  so if anything  I d guess the next move is lower on Monday 
Transportation  The trans also lost ground last Friday  confirming Thursday s hanging man with a 0 33  fall that curved the stochastic around to prepare for a bearish crossover  After bouncing off their upper BB on Wednesday  the trans were unable to make any further headway  That all looks like lower on Monday to me

 And the winner is    
The first day of most months is historically bullish  but August is not one of those  And we now have the Dow failing to make any headway for three days in a row  suggesting a decided absence of buyers at the 200 day MA as we enter the dog days of summer  And tonight we ve got a number of reversal signs on the charts  Add it all up and I figure I m going to call Monday lower  I ll be happy to be proven wrong since I m always net long

Recap
As expected  Monday moved lower to start off August in pretty typical fashion  Not much to see here  so we turn our attention right towards Tuesday 
The technicals
The Dow  Three strikes and yer out  After failing to retake the 200 day MA three days running  the Dow finally gave up the ghost on Monday and fell out of its rising RTC for a bearish setup on a red hammerish thing and a stochastic ever so close to a bearish crossover  Net net  I don t think the selling s over 
The VIX  Last night I wrote that  I d say the VIX is going higher Any Day Now   And we didn t have long to wait as the VIX rose 3 63  on Monday to complete a bullish morning star  It also bent the stochastic around nicely to just short of a bullish crossover  Oh  and despite a red spinning top it was also an exit of the descending RTC for a bullish crossover  So all in all  I d again have to say there s more upside left here 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 13 AM EDT  with ES down 0 07    Last night I wrote that  I d be cautious about going long at this point   Good thing too because ES fell right back to 2091 on Monday on a tall lopsided red spinning top  The overnight is continuing lower thus forming a bearish stochastic crossover  meaning that there s still nothing bullish about this chart 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2101 00 to 2091 17  Tonight ES remains below its new pivot  though not by much  But that still leaves this indicator bearish   for the time being 
Dollar index  I refused to call the dollar last night  but Monday s gap up spinning top provided some clarity with a completed morning star  Indicators are not yet overbought  so all other things being equal  it looks like there s more upside left here 
Euro  Last night I wrote that  I d guess the next move is lower on Monday   Good guess too  with the euro right back down to 1 0954  It was a classic dark cloud cover and the overnight is continuing lower  The stochastic has begun curving around for a bullish crossover  but we re not there yet  Looks like there s at least one more day lower in store before the reversal 
Transportation  The trans are now range bound  unable to make any headway past 8428  but not dropping much lower  either  Indicators have now hit overbought and we have a spinning top  but that requires confirmation  So until I get it  I still can t call this chart 
Accuracy

 And the winner is    
Tonight looks a lot like last night with a bunch of bearish technical signs on the charts  I also note that oil is back in positive correlation with the market and oil is tanking  And Dr  Copper has been feeling ill for some time now  Therefore  it appears that the logical course of action is to call Tuesday lower again

Recap
Ja  ja  the market was looking saggy last night and sure enough  down it went some more on Tuesday  With Greece and China apparently now out of the way  the technicals seem to be working again  so lets capitalize on that and see whither Wednesday 
The technicals
The Dow  On Tuesday  the Dow gave up another 48 points on a lopsided spinning top to give us three black crows  This was the payoff on Monday s bearish RTC trigger  It also confirmed a bearish stochastic crossover and with the indicators still a long ways from oversold  we re now in full blown bearish mode here 
The VIX  Ah  El Vixmo  Last night I wrote that  there s more upside left here   And sure enough on Tuesday  the VIX rose another 3 5   This gave us a bullish trigger on a descending RTC exit as well as a bullish stochastic crossover  So there s nothing but bullish signs on this chart right now 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 25 AM EDT  with ES up 0 16   On Tuesday  ES just kept on falling to yield three black crows  a completed bearish stochastic crossover and a steep new descending RTC  No bullish reversal signs on this chart  for sure 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2091 17 to 2086 92  That still leaves ES under the new pivot  but only by a fraction of a point  close enough in fact that it s a wash at this point 
Dollar index  Whoa  The dollar was doing exactly nothing until 1 25 PM EDT when it suddenly took off the end with a 0 42  gain and its highest close since July 20th  This tall green marubozu was the mother of all bullish engulfing patterns  However  it was also enough to send the stochastic around in preparation for a bearish crossover  And since we re now just short of month long resistance  I d say further upside is limited from here  Wednesday might be a doji day 
Euro  Last night I wrote that it   l ooks like there s at least one more day lower in store before the reversal   And in fact  the euro did fall again  back to 1 0897 easily giving up support at 1 0915 in the process  That now leaves it oversold and with a stochastic curving around for a bullish crossover  The overnight is continuing lower though  so the best I can say is that a move higher is coming before the end of the week  but it may not be Wednesday 
Transportation  In what would ordinarily seem to be a bit of bullish divergence  the trans rose 0 12  on a day the rest of the market was lower  However  Tuesday s candle was stopped by resistance at 5 8427  just like the last four days  And with indicators now highly overbought along with a new bearish stochastic crossover  it looks to me like the trans are headed lower on Wednesday 
Accuracy

 And the winner is    
Tonight  the charts overall are still looking pretty bearish  Ordinarily  I d just go ahead and call Wednesday lower  but I always hate to go against the futures  On the other hand  the futures alone aren t enough to make a bullish call  But the proximity of ES to its pivot makes this a good opportunity for a conditional call  if ES can break above its new pivot and stay there by mid morning Wednesday  we ll close higher  But if it remains below or falls further  we close lower

I guess third time s the charm  After three reversal candles in a row  VZ finally gave up the ghost on Tuesday  down 0 64   And that stopped right on the edge of its latest rising RTC  We ll call it a bearish setup  And the stochastic is perched on the cusp of a bearish crossover  the two lines are only 0 01 apart   So it looks like the selling still has some more to go ",2015-08-05,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-depends-on-es-pivot-260580,260580

Recap
Yup   I figured Monday was looking higher last night and the technicals did not disappoint with a nice 242 point pop for the Dow  I m the first to admit when I m wrong  so I might as well take credit when I m right  But that was then and this is now  And tomorrow is Tuesday  So lets see what the charts predict after this interesting day 
The technicals
The Dow  On Monday  the Dow had its best day since May  with a jolly green 1 39  marubozu that blew it right out of its descending RTC for a bullish setup  sent the indicators starting higher off oversold  and formed a sharp bullish stochastic crossover  Technically  this looks nothing but bullish 
The VIX  Last night  I noted that the VIX was getting ready to reverse and it sure did  down 8 66  on Monday on a big gap down red marubozu that sent the indicators lower before ever hitting overbought and formed a good bearish stochastic crossover   Now there s still strong year long support around 11 95  but that still leaves some room to run lower before hitting that on Tuesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 05 AM EDT  with ES down 0 40    ES had its best day in a month on Monday  handily confirming Friday s hammer  sending the indicators higher off oversold  completing a nice bullish stochastic crossover and exiting the descending RTC for a big bullish setup  That all looks strong except that we re real close to resistance at 2104  So we need to see how ES deals with that level 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises from 2072 75 to 2090 92  That leaves ES sitting right on top of the new pivot  so this indicator is indecisive 
Dollar index  After days of wishy washy indecision  last night I wrote that  I can finally make a call here for a move lower on Monday    And that call paid off  with a 0 43  decline in the dollar to trade entirely outside its recent rising RTC for a bearish trigger  With indicators now falling off overbought and a solidly completed bearish stochastic crossover  there seems to be lots of room to run lower still here 
Euro  Last night I wrote that  this one looks bullish for Monday   and indeed  the euro rose again to close at 1 1024 in a move that sent the indicators overbought  The stochastic is still rising though  but the new overnight seems to be losing steam  so we could be in for a pause here on Tuesday 
Transportation  On Monday  the trans did a bit better than the Dow  with a bullish one white soldier good for a nearly 1 5  advance  That drove the indicators right off oversold and sent the stochastic curving around to prepare for a bullish crossover  So it looks like there s plenty of gas in this tank for further gains

  And the winner is    
Tonight  the charts are generally bullish technically following last Friday s bottoming action  Whether the reversal can be sustained is another issue  particularly given the non trivial losses in the futures  apparently triggered by news of a currency devaluation by the Chicoms  What pin action this will have on Tuesday is unclear  But with ES currently sitting exactly on top of its pivot  that s a perfect opportunity for another conditional call  if ES breaks above its pivot and stays there by mid morning Tuesday  we close higher  But if it breaks lower and stays there by mid morning  we close lower  Simple as that

VZ got swept up in the general euphoria on Monday with its best day since March  It wasn t looking that way on its own merits though  so I couldn t call it higher that way last night  But everything I wrote about the Dow tonight holds true for VZ too  Except that we re now nearly overbought and I m afraid this might be a case of running too far too fast  So Tuesday could be a pause here  and therefore  I m not calling it a buy  This is a pop we just missed ",2015-08-11,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-depends-on-es-pivot-261199,261199

Recap
You d think  OMG  Chicom devaluation  Auto sell sell sell   But it s not that simple  ES actually spent most of the wee hours Tuesday morning just noodling about its pivot  Until about 7 15 it looked like there was a chance the damage had already been done with the decline right after the announcement Monday night  But no  ES gave up the ghost at that point and the market closed lower  That s what my  conditional call   TM  is all about  When it works  it works well 
So lets wander on to Wednesday and see what Mr  Market will make of all this 
The technicals
The Dow  On Tuesday  the Dow gave up almost all of Monday s gains on a tall inside harami   admittedly not the best reversal candle  But it was enough to short circuit all the developing positive technicals from Monday and put the Dow right back into its descending RTC  So this chart in one day turns right back to bearish 
The VIX  You can basically forget all the technical forecasts I made last night  as they were all torpedoed by the Chicoms  Case in point  the VIX  which did not go down at all  vaulting up over 12  instead on a gap up lopsided spinning top  Interestingly  it did not surpass the peak hit all of two days ago when we had our last crisis du jour  But it was enough to send the indicators almost overbought and  amazingly  even cause a bearish stochastic crossover  So with this yawning gap now below us  I d say the next move looks lower 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are significantly lower at 12 45 AM EDT  with ES down 0 67   apparently on more currency finagling by the Chicoms  On Tuesday  ES also gave up most of Monday s gains on a wide dark cloud cover  But with two essentially new driven candles back to back  I d take the current setup with a grain of salt  I m more interested in the overnight gains being posted here 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2090 92 to 2084 08  But the sharp move lower in the overnight now leaves ES well below the new pivot  so this indicator now looks quite bearish 
Dollar index  And with the Chicom devaluation  of course the dollar rose  up 0 14  on a bullish piercing pattern  But indicators are not yet oversold and the stochastic continues falling  so this one requires confirmation before calling it higher on Wednesday 
Euro  And as another consequence  it was one of those rare days when both the euro and dollar rose  the euro in this case touching its upper BB before retreating to close higher at 1 1035 on a long legged spinning top  But the new overnight isn t confirming it  moving higher still  So despite now being overbought  I can t call the euro lower yet 
Transportation  Interestingly  the trans relatively outperformed the Dow  down only half as much on Tuesday in a move that actually bent the stochastic around in anticipation of a bullish crossover  It s a stubby spinning top though  so at this point  we need to wait a day and see where this chart sorts out 

There s really not much bullish about the charts tonight  but the kicker is that it looks like deja vu all over again as the Chicoms once again tinker with their currency  And the drop in the futures is even bigger tonight than last  And since we all know how that one turned out  I m just going to go ahead and call Wednesday lower

Recap
Well that was odd  Apparently  after the obligatory mass dump right out the gate due to the latest Chinese cataclysm  just like on Tuesday  on Wednesday Mr  Market instead figured out he d been had and then spent the rest of the day marching back to break even  The net result after all the strum und drang  was a loss for the Dow of all of 0 33 points  Okey dokey  So moving right along  let s turn our attention to Thursday 
The technicals
The Dow  Holy moly  on Wednesday the Dow put in the biggest dragonfly doji I ve ever seen  one that broke well below the lower BB  and also out the left side of the descending RTC  Indicators remain just off oversold so candlestick wise this has to be bullish 
The VIX  And on Wednesday the VIX gapped up at the open right above its 200 day MA  It then motored higher only to give it all up in the end to finish with a 0 73  loss on a tall dark cloud cover and a bearish stochastic crossover That looks continued bearish to me 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 54 AM EDT with ES up 0 20   Like the other charts  ES put in a dramatic dragonfly doji on Wednesday  puncturing both its lower BB  and then its 200 day MA before bouncing back  That left the indicators  not surprisingly somewhat confused  But with a nice bump in the new overnight we re starting to see something of a morning star pattern so this chart is now looking bullish to me 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2084 08 to 2072 00  That now leaves ES well above its new pivot so this indicator turns back to bullish 
Dollar index  Wow   on Wednesday the dollar took its biggest gap down since  uh well I don t know   I scrolled back a year and couldn t find anything near this big  The resulting doji star sitting below the lower BB for a 1 07  loss is a good 2 3 of a bullish morning star  And with indicators now oversold  I d say the dollar goes higher on Thursday 
Euro  Last night I hesitated calling the euro lower in the face of a star   and good thing too because the euro kept right on rallying Wednesday with a big gain to close at 1 1174  well above its upper BB  That left the indicators highly overbought and the stochastic starting to curve around for a bearish crossover  So far the overnight is confirming that with modest losses  So with the BB hit I have to think the euro may be headed lower on Thursday 
Transportation  And finally on Wednesday the Trans put in a monster hammer  It didn t quite hit the lower BB but it did form a clear bullish stochastic crossover  With nothing else of note here  this chart now looks bullish 

We got a number of extreme reversal candles in the charts on Wednesday and the futures are guiding higher so I m just going to call Thursday higher

Recap
So last Friday  the day I took off  not much happened  The Dow rose 69 points on sub average volume and an even smaller range than Thursday  Will we see some action this week  With another op ex Friday coming up  lets see where the charts are guiding us 
The technicals
The Dow  On Friday  the Dow gave us a doji star sitting on top of Thursday s gains  This was non confirmed by Friday s further advances  and that s a positive sign  as it marks a bullish trigger on a descending RTC exit  So at this point  I see nothing bearish on this chart 
The VIX  Last I wrote about the VIX  I said it looked  continued bearish   And that continued not only on Thursday but Friday too  as it lost another 4 89  for a bearish trigger on a rising RTC exit  With a completed bearish stochastic crossover and descending indicators  I see nothing bullish on this chart 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are mixed at 1 37 AM EDT  with ES down 0 05    but NQ up just a tick  Relatively speaking  ES had the best day of any of the charts last Friday  with a big bullish engulfing pattern that continued the indicators moving higher towards overbought   There s no nearby resistance  but the Sunday overnight is stalling out  so that s raising the caution flag for Monday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2082 25 to 2084 58  That still leaves us above the new pivot  so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  Like the other charts  on Friday  the dollar exited a descending RTC for a bullish setup  It also curved the stochastic around to close in on bullish crossover  Add in a hit on the lower BB and oversold indicators  and after many days of wishy washy indecision  tonight this chart looks all around bullish 
Euro  Meanwhile  the euro really looks like it has topped in the short term after two red days with a close at 1 1124 on Friday  That makes two red spinning top reversal warnings in a row  a bearish stochastic crossover and overbought indicators  The overnight is continuing non trivially lower  so it s looking like the euro closes lower again on Monday 
Transportation  Finally on Friday we got another reversal  this one with a bullish setup on a descending RTC exit for the trans  rising indicators  plus a bullish stochastic crossover and a confirmation of Thursday s spinning top  So that all looks bullish for Monday 

Tonight all the charts are looking pretty bullish  The one exception is the news from the futures  I d expect some better pin action considering just how positive the charts look  The problem may lie with oil  which lately has been quite positively correlated with the market  and tonight oil is continuing lower  So with that kind of conflict at hand  I m afraid I m just going to have to call Monday uncertain as we kick off op ex week

Recap
All the signs were looking positive last night but I guess I just got spooked by some falling oil and lack of enthusiasm from ES  all of which made me call Monday uncertain  Turns out the Dow rose yet again  making it now four in a row and even doing a bit better than Friday   Ah but where does that leave Tuesday  Off to the charts we go in search of clues 
The technicals
The Dow  Well the Dow did exhibit some indecision on Monday as it plunged right out the gate but after the first five minutes it was all uphill into the close  That keeps us in a nice rising RTC with all indicators rising but not yet overbought  On the other hand  we now have a tall hanging man so that s at least a reversal warning 
The VIX  Whoa   this was really odd  On Monday the VIX rose 1 48   It s unusual enough for it to move in correlation with the market but it did it on a tall red marubozu dark cloud cover  And that was enough to keep it inside its descending RTC and keep the indicators falling towards oversold  So this chart still looks bearish  That was definitely a strange one 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are again mixed at 12 45 AM EDT with ES up just 0 02  and YM dead even  After a rocky open  ES ended up doing quite well on Monday  powering right back to resistance at 2100  That leaves a new rising RTC in effect and indicators also continue to rise but are not yet overbought  If ES can clear resistance here  it looks like smooth sailing all the way to the upper BB  at 2112  The currently developing overnight candle isn t looking so hot though  as an inverted hammer 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2084 58 to 2091 50  ES remains above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish
Dollar index  Last night I wrote that  this chart looks all around bullish   Well the dollar wasn t a raging bull perhaps but it did gain another 0 29  Monday to exit its descending RTC for a bullish setup  That also caused the indicators to clearly bottom at oversold and gave us a new bullish stochastic crossover so this chart looks bullish again 
Euro  And last night I also wrote that  it s looking like the euro closes lower again on Monday   And that was looking good with the euro falling back to 1 1085 to make it three down in a row and a new descending RTC  Even at that indicators remain overbought and we have a new completed stochastic crossover so I don t think the selling is done here yet  The overnight is continuing lower  supporting that idea 
Transportation  And in quite a bullish sign  on Monday the Trans outperformed the Dow with a 0 73  gain that exited the descending RTC for a bullish trigger and sent the indicators continuing higher on their way towards overbought  So there s also nothing bearish on this chart for Tuesday 

Well things are looking generally positive tonight so I m going to go ahead and call Tuesday higher  though more because of an absence of bearish signs than any strong conviction in the current mini rally  I note that the Dow has been putting in lower highs since May now and Monday s high lies right along that descending line  I guess we ll see

Verizon  NYSE VZ  was one of the weaker members of the Dow on Monday but nonetheless managed to pull off a green bullish piercing pattern  However  the indicators remain overbought  we have a new bearish stochastic crossover  and a bearish trigger on a rising RTC exit so I m afraid all that trumps the candle  Still no buy here ",2015-08-18,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-262001,262001

Recap
Though the charts were looking generally bearish last night I opted not to make that call  going with a conditional call instead  Good thing too as ES made one brief failed attempt to break below its pivot at 10 05 AM and that was it  Despite a late afternoon sell off  the Dow still managed a 14 point gain  So let s see where that all leaves us for Tuesday now 
The technicals
The Dow  On Monday the Dow actually tried to break above Friday s highs but in the end failed  So while we did get a green candle  it was a spinning top clinging to the lower end of Friday s candle  This failure to break resistance along with a reversal warning and highly overbought indicators continues to make me think this chart looks lower 
The VIX  I figured we were due for a move higher but wasn t sure it would be Monday  Well it was  but with a 2 51  advance as a small doji star it wasn t very convincing  Still  indicators remain highly oversold and the stochastic is lying flat on the floor  And with Monday giving us a bullish setup on a descending RTC exit I still have to think there s more upside to come  Oh  and it was one of those unusual days when both the VIX and the market closed higher  indicative of some ongoing internal uncertainty 
Market index futures  Tonight  the futures are mixed at 12 58 AM EDT with S P 500 up 0 02   but YM down 0 03   On Monday ES pushed past resistance at 2118 only to stop again at resistance at 2122  But its rising RTC is so steep this move led it right out of the channel for a bearish setup  Indicators remain at extreme overbought and the overnight is guiding lower  It s definitely looking toppy to me here 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2117 17 to 2121 58  That still leaves ES above its new pivot but tonight it s just barely  So this indicator remains ever so slightly bullish   for now 
Dollar index  I wasn t ready to call the dollar lower last night and good thing too because ti rose another 0 18  on Monday  That only made it more overbought and left it just shy of its upper BB  Bottom line  we re in the same spot as last night   looks toppy but I can t call it lower just yet 
Euro  The euro gapped down with a small doji star on Monday to close at 1 0837 as it continues to dribble down it slower BB and remain in a steep descending RTC  Support at 1 0871 is now long gone but Monday s close is another support line so with indicators now very oversold this would be as good a time as any for the euro to stage a rally 
Transportation  Last night I wrote that  this inverted hammer looks bearish to me   And sure enough the Trans dropped 0 36  on Monday with a second inverted hammer  Indicators remain overbought  and the bearish stochastic crossover is holding so I don t think the selling is over yet 

Looks like deja vu all over again here  All the factors that were in play last night are still there only more so  The market still looks overbought and toppy but I still can t yet definitively call it lower  And once again  ES is sitting just above its pivot so I guess I ll just make another conditional call  if ES an stay above its pivot by mid morning Tuesday we ll close higher  If it breaks under  then we close lower

Wow  Verizon  NYSE VZ  sure fooled me on Monday with a nice 1  gain  But this one took it to its upper BB and left the indicators even more overbought  I know it sounds like tape fighting but I still can t get on board this bus ",2015-07-21,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-depends-on-es-pivot-258932,258932

Recap
This has been an  ah choo  market for a while now  It looks like it wants to sneeze but it just keeps going  ah   ah   ah  but never  choo   Well we finally got the  choo  on Tuesday with the Dow dumping 181 points  It was definitely looking toppy last night  but it had been looking toppy for a while now and it just refused to break  Now that we ve finally got it  let s see how that changes the picture for Wednesday 
The technicals
The Dow  After warning of impending doom for four straight days now we finally go the break on Tuesday with a 1  dump in the Dow  Monday was the bearish RTC trigger and Tuesday was the payoff  But even after all that the indicators are still oversold  and with a nicely completed bearish stochastic crossover I say there s still more selling in store on Wednesday 
The VIX  Meanwhile the VIX continues to confound  On Monday it was higher on a day the market was higher   on Tuesday it went lower on a day the market was lower  Most bizarre  Just looking at the candles though we now have a tall inverted hammer following an even taller doji star  but with indicators that remain highly oversold  Go figure  RTC wise  it s a bullish trigger but everything s all bollixed up so no call here 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are significantly lower at 1 14 AM EDT with ES down 0 39   Last night I wrote that ES  definitely looking toppy to me here   as it fell out of a rising RTC for a bearish setup  And the fall from the top came Tuesday with a big red hanging man and a bearish RTC trigger  And with the new overnight gapping down even further this one is looking just plain ugly for Wednesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily finally falls  for the first time in a while  from 2121 56 to 2115 42  That leaves ES well below its new pivot so this indicator turns decidedly bearish 
Dollar index  After watching the dollar throw off topping warnings for days now I was reluctant to call it lower for Tuesday  Too bad too because it fell 0 75  for its biggest daily loss in a month  That s a clear exit of the rising RTC for a bearish setup and a fresh bearish stochastic crossover  So this one now looks lower again on Wednesday 
Euro  Last night  in the face of a long running downtrend I wrote that  this would be as good a time as any for the euro to stage a rally   And hey presto  it did  right back up to 1 0950 on Tuesday erasing two days of losses in one swell foop with a giant green marubozu and its biggest gain in a month  That leaves us with a fresh bullish stochastic crossover and indicators that are still oversold so this one just looks higher again on Wednesday 
Transportation  And finally more confusion as the Trans gained 0 74  on a day the Dow was down for some nice bullish divergence  There s no real trend here aside from up down up and mostly higher highs and higher lows  Going by that and with overbought indicators  you d guess the next move would be lower 

On Tuesday we got the confirmat5ion of all the topping signals the market s been showing for several days now  So with the charts all looking pretty bad  I m going to go ahead and call Wednesday lower

I ve been down on Verizon  NYSE VZ  for days now and on Tuesday I was finally vindicated as it dove a dramatic 2 35  on some negative news with a perfect gap down doji star  But that still leaves the indicators overbought  though they ve now started lower  So this is a reversal warning but I need confirmation before jumping in ",2015-07-22,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-lower-259080,259080

Recap
The markets moved lower Wednesday as I expected  Now we re left to figure out when the selling will end for the next move higher  And only the charts can tell us that so let s take a gander 
The technicals
The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow lost 0 38  on a stubby red hammer  That left the indicators just barely off overbought and the stochastic moving lower  This really isn t a reversal sign so I can t call the Dow higher from here 
The VIX  This is the third time in a week the VIX has moved in positive correlation with the market  I don t think I ve ever seen that  Wednesday gave us a 0 82  loss on a bearish engulfing pattern  But the indicators remain quite oversold and the stochastic has completed a bullish crossover  So with the candles and charts in opposition  there s no call here tonight 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 15 AM EDT with ES up 0 19   On Wednesday ES put n a classic gap down doji star  And despite indicators falling off overbought  the overnight is gapping back up again in a bullish morning star pattern  That makes this chart now look bullish for Thursday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2115 42 to 2107 42  But this time that was enough to bring ES backi above its new pivot so this indicator now changes back to bullish 
Dollar Index  Sigh   once again he dollar fooled me on Wednesday by rising 0 31  instead of falling as I thought  The resulting candle is indeterminate and the indicators continue moving lower off overbought  It s also a bearish trigger on the recent rising RTC exit so I have to think there s more downside coming despite Wednesday s gains 
Euro  And the euro on Wednesday was pretty much the mirror image of the dollar   down to 1 0912 on a stubby red spinning top but with rising indicators just off oversold  The new overnight though is gapping higher non trivially so it s possible the euro could move higher on Thursday 
Transportation  The trans continued its up down pattern on Wednesday with a 0 30  loss on a red hanging man at the top of Tuesday s candle  Indicators are now moving lower so if anything  this suggests continued movement lower on Thursday 

It s not completely clear and the charts are a bit ambivalent tonight but the one chart that does look unequivocally bullish is the futures  now forming a morning star  and I always hate going against the futures without a good reason  So I guess that just leaves a call of Thursday higher 
Single Stock Trader
It s good I didn t commit to the tempting gap down doji star in Tuesday s chart because VZ just sank another 1 11  on Wednesday  this time with a hammer that just tickled the lower BB  That s also a reversal indicator but with indicators still only recently off overbought it s still not the ideal buy setup so once again I wait for confirmation before getting in ",2015-07-23,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-higher-259200,259200

Recap
Huh   I ll admit I was nervous last week when I called Friday lower because I ve seen it fairly often lately that the market will take a completely unexpected reversal from where you d think it will be going But that wasn t the case this time and the Dow dropped another 163 points on Friday  That was an interesting move as we shall examine entering the final week of July 
The technicals
The Dow  Breaking the 200 day MA as the Dow did last Thursday is never a good sign  and Friday was the proof with another triple digit loss  That makes it four significant ones down in a row on a real steep descending RTC  We are in fact now within striking distance of the lower BB  at 17 429 and while RSI is now quite oversold the stochastic has yet to curve around for a bullish crossover so I m not calling the Dow higher yet 
The VIX  Last Thursday I wrote that  this one looks higher again Friday    And that looked about right with another 8 7  gain for the VIX  though on an inverted hammer  But indicators are only half way to overbought so it s still too early to call this chart lower 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are slightly higher at 1 53 AM EDT with ES up just 0 04   Last week s losses just accelerated on Friday with ES right back down to 2077 50  But that was finally enough to send the indicators quite oversold though money flow and OBV are now in a consistent week long downtrend and the stochastic has yet to being curving around for a bullish crossover  Now it is true that ES is forming a small star in the overnight so far  but it s still early so I still can t call ES higher on Monday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2101 25 to 2083 75  That still leaves ES substantially below its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish 
Dollar index  The dollar looked too confusing for me last Thursday  And after Friday s candle I m still confused  A scant 0 12  gain on a tall red  almost marubozu candle  And despite a gain the indicators continued lower  So now I m going to guess there s more downside in store on Monday 
Euro  The euro looked similarly opaque last Thursday and it s just as well since it put in a perfect doji star on Friday  ending right where it began  The new Sunday overnight is guiding lower though and nearing the right edge of the rising RTC   And with indicators near overbought I d say the next move is more likely lower than higher 
Transportation  Last Thursday I wrote  there s nothing bullish about this chart   And I d say a 0 67  loss on Friday was definitely not bullish  Indicators continue falling and no reversal sign in sight so I can t call the Trans higher yet 

 And the winner is    
We wrung a lot of froth out of the market last week and that drove the SPX Hi Lo indicator very low  near levels from which reversals come  The same is true of the charts   we re close to but not quite at reversal points  In fact it s looking to me like Monday might be a doji day with a hammer or perhaps a star  At this point I m hesitant to call it lower again just because it looks like the selling could be about exhausted so I will content myself with calling Monday uncertain

Recap
Last night I wouldn t commit to continue lower because I thought the selling was about over  I was wrong  It was looking good for some sort of doji early on  but then the selling just kicked back in as the Dow posted yet another triple digit loss  It seems that China is now the new Greece  Serves  em right for sending us all that deadly drywall  toxic toothpaste  and poison pet food 
Is this sell off ever going to end  Lets check the charts to see 
The technicals
The Dow  On Monday  the Dow just picked up right back where it left off on Friday with more selling  this time very nearly down to its lower BB  It was enough to drive RSI down to 1 97  The last time we were lower than this was November 15th    2012  And that very day set off a year and a half long rally  This is simply ridiculously oversold  Also  the stochastic hit its lowest level of the year on Monday  and is curving around nicely for a bullish crossover 
The VIX  On Monday  the VIX took a monster gap up 13 54  pop to vault right over its 200 day MA  but did it with a perfect doji  thus giving us a classic evening star in the making  Indicators are also now extremely overbought  RSI 92 87   so I m laying better than even odds that the VIX goes lower Tuesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 48 AM EDT  with ES up 0 44   ES just kept falling on Monday and that drove the indicators extremely oversold  RSI 8   The overnight rally so far is bending the stochastic around very close to a bullish crossover  Right now  this chart is looking bullish and ready to reverse 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot falls again from 2083 75 to 2067 25  And that  plus an overnight rally  was finally enough to put ES back above its pivot  so this indicator now turns bullish for the first time in a while 
Dollar index  The dollar continued its week long slide on Monday with a gap down 0 76  loss on a lop sided spinning top  Indicators are now oversold but the stochastic hasn t begun its curve around for a bullish crossover  So there s a reversal warning here  but one that requires confirmation 
Euro  And similarly  the euro on Monday continued its week long rally  closing this time at 1 1083  Indicators are now overbought and the euro is giving up some of Monday s gains in the overnight  That s causing the stochastic to bend around for a bearish crossover  so I d say chances are good the euro goes lower on Tuesday 
Transportation  The trans also went lower on Monday  but formed a nice doji star below Friday s action  thus setting up a bullish morning star  Indicators are now oversold and the stochastic is primed for a bullish crossover  so a reversal looks like a good possibility here 
Accuracy

 And the winner is    
We re now seeing a number of decent reversal signs on the charts  finally  And we ve got some extremely oversold conditions  with the Dow in particular at multi year RSI lows  Also  the SPX Hi Lo indicator hit 8 47 on Monday  its lowest level of the year and below levels from which rallies usually start  Finally  the futures are up non trivially in the overnight  All in all  I think there are enough factors in alignment to warrant calling Tuesday higher

Recap
Ah  Turnaround Tuesday to the rescue as the Dow finally snapped an ugly six session losing streak in style with a nice 190 point pop  Thanks to the Fed  the Chinese  whoever  doesn t matter  The bottom line is that the technicals worked  Now we move on to Wednesday but we ll cut to the chase right here   this Wednesday is a Fed day and it is my policy to always call Fed days uncertain 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow s 190 point pop on Tuesday was enough to bounce it right out of its descending RTC for a bullish setup and finally give us a long awaited bullish stochastic crossover  And with indicators still oversold  this chart looks bullish 
The VIX  On Tuesday the VIX nicely completed its bearish evening star with a big 13 85  plunge  completely giving up the 200 day MA on a tall red candle  Indicators remain overbought and the stochastic is within inches of a bearish crossover so this chart looks lower to me Wednesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 10 AM EDT with ES down 0 12   On Tuesday ES did very well  retracing all of Monday s losses plus half of last Friday s  That was also enough to solidly complete a bullish stochastic crossover So I have to think this chart remains bullish  though the sag in the overnight suggests we could be in for a pause on Wednesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2067 25 to 2079 25  Despite overnight weakness so far ES remains above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  On Tuesday the dollar continued its stair step decline by actually rising 0 27  but remaining in a two week downtrend  That may be about to end though because the indicators are now oversold and the stochastic has finally begun to curve around for a bullish crossover all while indicators are still oversold 
Euro  Last night I wrote that  chances are good the euro goes lower on Tuesday   And so they were with the euro falling back to 1 1049 on an almost dark cloud cover red marubozu  That was enough to curve around the stochastic which is now real close to a bearish crossover  The overnight is trying to rally but the daily trend seems more to suggest continued lower 
Transportation  The Trans had a huge day Tuesday  erasing thee days of losses in one swell foop  sending the indicators off oversold and forming a new bullish stochastic crossover  We re actually near resistance now but there s still some room to run and in any case there s no bearish signs on this chart right now 
Accuracy  

 And the winner is    
As a matter of policy  I am calling Wednesday uncertain  Although someone on CNBC made the interesting point that on Fed days lacking a press conference  as this one is   the market is down 90  of the time  And so far anyway  the futures action seem to be supporting that but it s really all just going to come down to whatever Auntie Janet has to say 
Single Stock Trader
Last night I was thinking Verizon  NYSE VZ  was near a swing buy and on Tuesday it did post a small six cent gain but on an odd red hammer  Still  we remain quite oversold and right on the edge of the descending RTC  and two hammers are better than one so basically nothing s changed  We re near a buy but I can t quite bless it just yet ",2015-07-29,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-uncertain-259819,259819

Recap
I guess Mr  Market s listening bug in the Fed boardroom was working better than mine  The market rose steadily on Wednesday and registered just a little blip at 2 PM for the big announcement before ending near session highs  Oh well   nothing ventured  nothing lost 
The technicals
The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow confirmed a near bullish engulfing candle from Tuesday with a nice 0 69  gain  That continued the move out of the descending RTC for a bullish trigger  That s two day out of the channel  And the only thing stopping it was the 200 day MA  But with indicators still oversold  I think the Dow s got the oomph to push higher again on Thursday 
The VIX  On Wednesday the VIX delivered the payoff on its recent evening star  off 7  to make two down days in a row  But the indicators are only just off overbought and the stochastic has just completed a bearish crossover so there s certainly more downside available here 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 25 AM EDT with ES down 0 17   ES made it two up in a row on Wednesday to pop out of its descending RTC for a bullish setup  That downtrend is now over  Indicators continue to rise and a bullish stochastic crossover is in effect so that all looks good  What looks less good is the lack of pin action in the overnight suggesting the possibility of a pause or some profit taking on Thursday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2079 25 to 2096 75  ES remains above its new pivot  though only just barely tonight  so this indicator now looks only weakly bullish 
Dollar index  The dollar has gotten bound up  ending Wednesday about where it began Tuesday  We re still in a descending RTC but also have a fresh bullish stochastic crossover  So with the indicators all balled up  I can t touch this chart 
Euro  Last night I wrote that  the daily trend seems more to suggest continued lower   And that s just what happened with the euro back down to 1 1015  And the overnight is gapping lower still so with a fresh bearish stochastic crossover and all the indicators falling  it looks like the selling s not over yet 
Transportation  On Wednesday the Trans followed through Tuesday s big gain with another 1 72  move to hit their upper BB  But the indicators are nowhere near overbought and the stochastic has just completed a bullish crossover so I can t call a move lower on the BB hit 

On Wednesday Dr  Copper finally exited a two week descending RTC for a bullish setup  the best commodity news we ve seen in a while  All the other charts are looking good too tonight  My only concern is the weakness in the futures and the proximity of ES to its new pivot  Therefore I m going to make another conditional call  if ES can stay above its pivot by mid morning Thursday we ll close higher  If it falls through  we close lower

Well it looks like the double hammer did the trick  Verizon  NYSE VZ  finally snapped its seven day downtrend on Wednesday for a bullish setup on an RTC exit  That also gave us a bullish stochastic crossover on indicators that are still oversold  This is my preferred setup so I can now finally call this one a swing buy ",2015-07-30,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-depends-on-es-pivot-259967,259967

Recap
When I woke up this morning at the crack of 11 AM and looked at the market I wondered how I could have been so badly wrong  calling the Dow higher on Tuesday when it was down nearly 200 points  But by the time the bell rang I had been vindicated as the Dow puled off the greatest comeback since Lazarus to finish up 93  It was an interesting deveopment so let s look at the implciations for Wednesday 
 Stupid Blogspot s spell checker seems to be on strike once again so I apologize for any typos in this post  
The technicals
The Dow  Last night I wrote that  this chart now looks bullish  and in the end it was as the Dow crossed its 200 day MA yet again to finish with a giant hammer   or is it hanging man  With this herky jerky Greek fueled back and forth lately it s kind of hard to tell  It does though look like the payoff on Monday s bullish RTC trigger and it left the indicators still just barely off oversold  So with the 200 MA now as support I m kinda leaning to this as still looking bullish 
The VIX  And I caught this one too when I wrote  this chart looks lower Tuesday  as the VIX dropped over 5  on a tall inverted hammer after touching its upper BB   the traditional third rail of the VIX  That still leaves the indicators just barely overbought and a bearish stochastic crossover in place  So I d hazard that the VIX sitll has more downside left here 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are significantly lower at 12 23 AM EDT with S P 500 down 0 75    After bouncing off its 200 day MA on Monday ES conducted a successful retest Tuesday to finsih with a tall tall hanging man  The new overnight is looking pretty grim and confirming that candle 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2056 42 to 2062 25  And that was enough to put ES back below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 
Dollar index  On Tuesday the dollar took big 0 62  gap up pop to trade entirely above its upper BB  With indicators now overbought  a stochastic that has just formed a bearish crossover  and a big yawning gap below begging filling  this one looks lower Wednesday  But the new overnight is up sharply so who knows where this is going 
Euro  And on Tuesday the euro continued its current two week plus downtrend with a bearish engulfing candle to close at 1 0986 as it dribbles down its lower BB 
Transportation  On Tuesday the Trans outperformed the Dow with a big 1 24  gain to close outside their descending RTC for a bullish trigger with indicators still just oversold and a completed bullish stochastic crossover  So this chart technically looks quite good 

Hmm  well technically the charts are looking pretty bullish tonight  Just one slight problem   China s stock market is cratering in the overnight and judging by the futures  that is sure to spill over into our markets on Wednesday  So even though I m a technician I m just going to go with the news and call Wednesday lower  There s no point fighting this tape  that s for sure

And Blogspot s spell checker must be hosted by the NYSE because this is the second night in a row that I click on it and nothing happens  So sorry in advance for any typos 
The technicals
The Dow  Technically  Wednesday s tall red marubozu confirmed Tuesday s tall hanging man as the Dow fell right back through its 200 day MA  its seventh cross in seven days  We re now right back to the lower BB  and indicators are back to oversold  But we also just got a bearish stochastic crossover from a low level and those are usually good for a day or two of lower prices 
The VIX  The VIX  which was looking lower last night  instead took off for a 22  pop  propelled largely by the NYSE debacle  and closing above its upper BB just shy of 20 for its higher close since January 30th  Normally once the VIX hits its upper BB  it goes lower  But when it revisits it repeatedly  it starts to want to stick around  like the spikes we had last October and December  And with a fresh bullish stochastic crossover from a high level  I am very hesitant to call the VIX lower just yet 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 37 AM EDT with ES up a significant 0 59   On Wednesday ES plunged right back to its 200 day MA making the third day in a row that s served as support  It also formed bearish stochastic crossover from a lwo level which is a bad sign  But the overnight se3ems to be trying to stage a rally  So the worst I can say of this chart is that further downside seems to be limited 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2062 25 to 2049 58  But this time that was enough to put ES back above its new pivot so this indicator now turns back to bullish 
Dollar index  The dollar took a beating on Wednesday  gapping down as sharply as it gapped up on Tuesday  With a bearish stochastic crossover and indicators still overbought  This looks like a recipe for lower again Thursday 
Euro  On Wednesday the EUR USD made its sixth direction reversal in a row by retracing all of Tuesday s losses and then some to close at 1 1071  That sent the indicators off oversold and further gains in the overnight seem to be pointing to a higher close on Thursday 
Transportation  The Trans underperformed the Dow on Wednesday turning what looked like an incipient rally into a rout with a bearish stochastic crossover from a low level and a tall red marubozu that took them right back to their lower BB  So this chart suddenly looks bearish 

Wednesday s decline may have been overdone and the futures are certainly guiding higher in the overnight  thanks possibly to some Chinese central bank meddling in their stock market   who knows  I can t keep track of all this anymore  In any case  when the futures are up nearly 0 6  in the wee hours of the morning  it s good to pay attention  So I m going to call Thursday higher despite some bearish technicals

216550,438066,VZ,How To Reap Oligopoly Profits With ATT,opinion,"AT T Inc  NYSE T  5 5  dividend yield stands out for dividend investors  Dividends have long been a central part of AT T s shareholder return  AT T  NYSE T  is a  thanks to its 31 consecutive years of dividend increases 
In the investing world size and stability often  but not always  go together  AT T is the second largest telecommunications company in the United States  AT T has a market cap of  179 billion versus  189 billion for rival Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  
AT T operates in two segments  wireless and wireline  The wireless segment now accounts for 56  of the company s revenue  The wireline segment generated 44  of AT T s revenue in its  
The wireless segment is made up of the company s smart phone  cell phone  and tablet data contracts 
The wireline segment sells internet  television  and voice over IP services to individuals  In addition  the segment provides VPN  cloud  hosting  IP conferencing  and Ethernet services to business customers 
The United States Telecommunications Oligopoly
The United States wireless telecommunications market is dominated by 4 companies  AT T  Verizon  Sprint  and T Mobile have greater than 90  market share  AT T and Verizon each have over 30  market share 
Competition is reduced when an industry is dominated by only a few large businesses  Lower competition is not good for consumers  but great for the few dominant businesses  AT T and Verizon in particular are large enough to reap the lion s share of profits in the telecommunications industry 
Why is the wireless industry in the United States dominated by only a few large players 
Due to the high barriers to entry into the market  There are massive up front costs to building the infrastructure necessary to be in the United States telecommunications industry 
In addition  wireless spectrum usage is controlled and auctioned by the United States government  AT T spent  18 2 billion in the   In total  the auction raised a cool  44 9 billion for the FCC 
Spectrum auctions prevent smaller players from gaining access to the wireless industry  The government plays a large part in this industry  It should not surprise anyone that AT T has spent over  184 million on lobbying since 1998  It would be shocking if the company were spending this money and not getting any return on investment 
Returning Profits to Shareholders
While the unique economics of the wireless telecommunications industry may be bad for consumers  they are good for investors 
AT T currently has a payout ratio of 72  of expected 2015 earnings  The company returns the bulk of its profits to shareholders  Investing in AT T  or Verizon  entitles you to the bulk of the profits generated in an oligopolistic industry 
In addition to AT T s sizeable dividend payments  the company also returns money to shareholders through share repurchases  AT T reduced its share count by 2 2  a year from 2007 through 2014 
AT T s Acquisition Fueled Growth
AT T s future growth will come from its pending acquisition of DirecTV  DTV  and its planned acquisition of Nextel Mexico 
The DIRECTV  NASDAQ DTV  acquisition will result in meaningful synergies between the two companies  The company is expecting annual savings of  2 5 billion a year within 3 years of the acquisition  The deal is expected to close this year 
The strategic rationale for the DirecTV acquisition is as follows  DirecTV will give AT T a quality video partner  Streaming is expected to become increasingly important on mobile devices in the future  DirecTV will play a large part in streaming in the future 
In addition  DirecTV has a strong presence in Latin America  AT T is focused on expanding internationally into Latin America  The DirecTV acquisition is a way for the company to quickly gain access to this market 
AT T s Latin American expansion begins with Mexico  The company is acquiring Nextel Mexico  AT T recently announced it would invest  3 billion to extend its high speed mobile internet to 100 million Mexican consumers by 2018  Customers on AT T Mexico plans will be able to make calls on their Mexican plan while in the United States to others on AT T plans  This  2 countries  1 plan  approach should have wide appeal in Mexico and help AT T gain market share in the country 
Safety and Recession Performance
AT T s telecommunications business generates stable cash flows  The company locks its customers into multi year contracts that typically have steep cancellation fees 
AT T has customer churn of around just 1  a month  This means customers do not often switch from AT T to rival competitors  Both cancellation fees and the similarity of competitor offers to AT T help to discourage cancellations 
AT T s stable cash flows and long history of consecutive dividend increases make it very likely the company will continue to pay increasing dividends 
The company performs well during recessions  AT T saw earnings per share dip slightly during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009  but the effects were not severe  the company remained highly profitable  AT T s earnings per share through each year of the Great Recession are shown below 
2007 earnings per share of  2 76
2008 earnings per share of  2 16
2009 earnings per share of  2 12
AT T s Valuation and Final Thoughts
What price to earnings ratio would you expect to pay for a shareholder friendly company that is recession resistant and has international growth potential  Probably more than a forward price to earnings ratio of 13 2  yet that s what AT T shares trade for at this time 
AT T currently ranks in the top 25  of stocks with 25  years of dividend payments without a reduction using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing  AT T offers investors a combination of stable cash flows and an exceptionally high dividend yield at a compelling valuation ",2015-07-12,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-reap-oligopoly-profits-with-at-t-258018,258018

Recap
Well the market rose as expected last Friday because Mr  Market believed the Greeks the same way Linus believed Lucy wasn t going to pull the football away when he was about to place kick it  Ho hum  So  after seeing a Good Greek  that means we must be in line for a day of the Bad Greeks  right  Let s see if the charts can sort it out in time for Monday 
The technicals
The Dow  On Friday the Dow scored another triple digit gain the net result of which was that we ended up exactly where we were seven trading days ago  It also makes nine consecutive days of 200 day MA crosses in a row  The net take away is that there s strong resistance at 17 755  Unless we get a breakout on Monday it seems more likely we go down again 
The VIX  After spending six of the last eight above its upper BB   on Friday the VIX finally threw in the towel and dove nearly 16  back under 17  That sent the indicators off overbought and set up the stochastic for a bearish crossover  So technically this chart looks lower   ah but then there s them Greeks    
Market index futures  Tonight  the futures are essentially flat for the first time in quite a while at 12 26 AM EDT with ES down all of 0 01  but YM up 0 01   On Friday ES confirmed Thursday s gravestone doji off the 200 day MA with a nice gain and is now almost back to recent strong resistance around 2072  That in itself would seem to limit potential upside 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot jumps from 2049 17 to 2062 83  But ES still remains above the new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  After a crazy week of up and down gaps  the dollar on Friday ended exactly where it began after a 0 64  loss  But we remain overbought and a completed stochastic crossover is in effect so the possibility of more downside on Monday remains 
Euro  On Friday the euro climbed to 1 1150  its eighth day in a row of alternating down up action  The overnight is continuing higher but Monday s close will surely be dictated by the news from Greece 
Transportation  On Friday the Trans outperformed the Dow to break resistance at 8176 on a tall green marubozu  The indicators are now marching steadily toward overbought so there s nothing bearish about this chart tonight 

Once again the market is hanging on the latest installment of As the Drachma Turns as the European scriptwriters burn the midnight oil trying to answer the question posed by those noted geopolitical analysts  The Clash  about Greece   Should I stay or should I go   I personally have no clue  but the outcome will determine Monday s close  not the technicals  Therefore  I call Monday uncertain

Recap
Well Mr  Market seemed happy with the outcome of the all night Greek negotiations  in which the Greeks promised to do stuff they never have and aren t likely to ever do  But no matter  optics is everything in the stock market and on Tuesday Mr  Market had his rose colored glasses on  Go figure  Now can we please get on with it and see where Tuesday is headed 
The technicals
The Dow  As has been so often the case lately  all the action on Monday was over in the first two minutes of trading  The other six hours and 28 minutes were just noise  How anyone can make money this way is beyond me  I certainly can t  In any case that now gives us three up days in a row and two white soldiers that have finally marched away from the 200 day MA  With rising indicators this chart once again looks bullish 
The VIX  Perhaps the most dramatic chart of the day was the VIX which plunged over 17  to gap down right through its 200 day MA on a tall red marubozu  With a now complete bearish stochastic crossover and falling indicators  this one looks nothing but bearish 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 50 AM EDT with ES down 0 06   On Monday ES had its best day of the year so far zooming back to 2094 50 on a giant marubozu  And that didn t even drive the indicators overbought yet  So there are really no bearish signs to speak of here 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot leaps from 2062 83 to 2080 42  But even that giant move wasn t enough to put ES back below its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  The dollar on Monday had its sixth gap move in six days with a big 0 86  jump that was good enough to form a bullish stochastic crossover  Still not overbought and with resistance some distance away  I d say there could be room to run higher again from here 
Euro  After what appeared to be a breakout from its descending RTC on Friday  the euro proceeded to give it all back on Monday and then some  down to 1 1007  Of course now we re near support and the new overnight is actually higher  so any further downside from here may be limited 
Transportation  The trans had a great day Monday  up a percent for three white soldiers and a new rising RTC that stopped right at resistance at 8303  Indicators are now near overbought so it s not clear we can push any higher from here 

I don t really see any bearish technical indications in the charts tonight  However  I am concerned that we ve come pretty far in the past two days  and three day streaks have been exceedingly rare this year so far  This seems like a market that s ready for a pause  possibly a doji day  So rather than simply call the close higher in the absence of any bearish signs  I m going to have to content myself with calling Tuesday uncertain

Recap
We declared Monday uncertain because of Greece  and Tuesday uncertain because of a question that the market had run too far too fast and was in need of a pause  Well  as is his wont  Mr  Market pulled a surprise and the Dow managed to add on another 76 points for its biggest three day run since February 
The Technicals
The Dow  It didn t quite match the previous two big gains but the Dow rose 76 Tuesday nonetheless  A new rising RTC is thus in place  we re still not overbought  and with no resistance til 18 134  there still seems to be some room to run here 
The VIX  The VIX fell again Tuesday as expected with a small red hammer  But being not yet oversold and still nowhere near support or its lower BB  there s no reversal sign here 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 08 AM EDT  with ES up 0 08   ES had a good day Tuesday  but seems to be running out of steam as the indicators near overbought  The new overnight is a doji so far  but it s still too early to call a reversal here 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot rises again from 2080 42 to 2099 33  And once again ES remains above its new pivot  so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  On Tuesday  the dollar continued bouncing around  with a small spinning top reflecting continuing uncertainty in Greece and China  This chart is too tough for me 
Euro  Similarly  on Tuesday  the euro also gave us a doji  but support around 1 0992 held  and with indicators still near oversold  I d say there s more upside potential than downside risk here 
Transportation  In a bit of bearish divergence  the trans lost 0 07  on a small doji star on Tuesday  snapping a big three day winning streak  With indicators nearly overbought  this could mean a reversal on Wednesday 

Sigh  it looks like I m just going to have to call Wednesday uncertain given the plethora of upcoming news  including Auntie Janet  a report on the Chinese economy  and those Greeks again  Any one of those could easily trump the technicals  which still aren t showing a bearish reversal yet

Recap
Last night I called Wednesday uncertain and with a net Dow change of just  3 4 points that seems to have been the right call 
Political rant
I amused myself this afternoon by watching the Empty Suit imagining himself the statesman on TV as he channeled his inner Neville Chamberlain waving about his Iranian agreement and thinking he d accomplished something 
Remember what the Fuhrer said back in 1938 after Chamberlain departed   That piece of paper means nothing   Obviously they don t teach European history at Harvard Law School  Meanwhile the Ayatollahs are popping the champagne corks in Tehran all the while their sycophants burn American flags in the streets and shout  Death to America  
Way to go  Obama  Take a good look   these are the people you think are going to sing kumbaya around the camp fire with you  Well  they ve got the fire going anyway  What were you thinking  The world  sir  is laughing at you  So sad 
The technicals
The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow was up  then down  then up some more and down some more as various pieces of news came out  In the end it all signified nothing as we got a perfect little doji star  After four big up days and with indicators now overbought  that s a decent reversal sign  IMHO 
The VIX  And the VIX was pretty much in the same boat with a doji of its own on Wednesday  With its stochastic curving around for a bullish crossover  indicators nearing oversold  and a massive four day run down  this one looks ready to move higher any day now 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 15 AM EDT with ES up 0 30   ES managed another gain on Wednesday but did it on a small spinning top  The gains in fact have been shrinking for three days now as ES looks to be running out of steam  More worrisome  the stochastic is curving around and is that close to a bearish crossover  On the other hand  the overnight is putting in a non trivial advance  possibly on some more Greek news  so once again we can t call a reversal yet 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2099 33 to 2102 33  But ES still remains above its new pivot so this indicator just continues bullish 
Dollar index   On Wednesday the fidgety dollar popped 0 51 as it continues to pinball its way through July  We re now near month long resistance but with the way things have been going lately  who knows  I m still not calling this one 
Euro   And a good example   last night I figured the euro was showing signs of bottoming  But noooo  instead it fell again  this time to 1 0957 after breaking support at 1 0989  Anyway  we now have a new descending RTC going and the overnight is continuing lower so no technical reversal signs here 
Transportation  After a divergent doji on Tuesday warning of a reversal  on Wednesday the Trans confirmed that with a big 0 72  decline that underperformed the Dow and provided even more bearish confirmation  Add in a bearish setup on a rising RTC exit and a stochastic within inches of a bearish crossover and that all spells lower on Thursday to me 

Hmm  we re seeing a number of dojis in the charts tonight that generally signal reversals  But the market has been largely news driven lately so much as I love my candlesticks  I m afraid I m going to have to go with the futures tonight and call Thursday higher  A 0 30  advance i the wee hours is too much to just ignore

Recap
Friday wasn t a bad day to take a holiday   a meager 34 point loss in the Dow and not much else going on  We now look ahead to Monday and peruse the charts for clues 
The Technicals
The Dow  On Friday  the Dow put in a nice classic red hanging man that was unable to top Thursday s peak  It also fell out of a steep  Pearson  LONDON PSON  s  0 969  rising RTC for a bearish setup  The indicators are now highly overbought and the stochastic just squeaked out a bearish crossover  making me think this one is headed lower Monday 
The VIX  The VIX only lost 1 33  on Friday  but what was interesting was the fact that it tested year long support around 12  With a green candle closing at 11 95  I m inclined to consider that a successful test  Indicators are now quite oversold  RSI 3 72   and the stochastic is in prime position for a bullish crossover Real Soon Now  It sure looks to me like a move higher is coming sometime this week  I m just not sure if Monday s the day  though that s certainly eminently possible 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are slightly higher at 1 26 AM EDT  with ES up 0 02   Last Friday  ES put in a hanging man at the top of Thursday s candle  The indicators are extremely overbought   RSI has hit 100 now  And the new overnight is trading outside the steeply rising RTC for a bearish setup  And ES still faces tough resistance at 2120  I have to think this chart has more downside risk than upside potential at this point 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2113 75 to 2117 17  That still leaves ES above its new pivot  albeit by less than before  but for now this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  On Thursday  the dollar put in a tall gap up doji  I would have thought for sure that meant it was going lower Friday  but instead  it gained another 0 19   That now leaves it at two month resistance with overbought indicators  We re still a bit shy of the upper BB though  so in the absence of a reversal candle  I can t call it lower just yet  though it looks like it will be tough sledding from here 
Euro  Meanwhile  the euro just continued to sink on Friday  right back down to two month support at 1 0883  With a lower BB touch and oversold indicators  you d think that would be a reversal warning  but no   we re going even lower in the Sunday overnight  and non trivially at that  With a descending RTC intact  there s no way I can call the euro higher on Monday 
Transportation  And finally on Friday  the trans actually gained 0 67  in some bullish divergence relative to the Dow  But they spent much of the day retracing early gains  and in the end  were unable to close above resistance at 8297  Interpret that how you want  With indicators quite overbought  this inverted hammer looks bearish to me 

We now have a number of technically bearish signs in the charts tonight  but they re all of the sort that require confirmation  I think the market s looking pretty toppy right now  but it s not clear that there isn t still one more push higher left in it before the pullback  So with ES near its pivot  I m going to make a conditional call  if ES manages to remain above its pivot by mid morning Monday  we ll lose the day higher  If it falls through  we close lower

Recap  Sigh   last week I said Thursday would go lower  so it went higher  And then I said Friday would go higher  so of course it went lower  It s amazing I have any hair left at all after pulling it all out  But then if this was easy  everybody would be doing it  So with the Fed and op ex out of the way let s see if I can get Monday right as we begin the last full week of this miserable month   The technicals  The Dow  After a nice advance last Thursday  the Dow gave it all back Friday with a red inside harami that flattened out the stochastic a if to prepare for a bearish crossover  Or we could just be back in one of these alternating up down patterns again  with the Dow changing direction every day for the past five  The short term trend remains higher   The VIX  Shoot   I figured the VIX was going lower for sure on Friday but it didn t  up instead nearly 6   for a bullish harami though we remain in a descending RTC  Chalk it up to op ex shenanigans I guess   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 25 AM EDT with ES gapping up 0 43  On Friday ES retraced 2 3 of Thursday s gains with a more or less dark cloud cover thingee that combined with overbought indicators looked bearish  But the new overnight gapped up significantly  possibly on some kind of positive news on Greece  And that was enough to unbend the stochastic so it s no longer forming a bearish crossover  And the new candle is a bullish harami so far   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2105 33 to 2104 14  But it s the big overnight pop in ES that has pushed it back above its new pivot so this indicator turns bullish As a reminder  we ve switched over to the  U  contract   Dollar index  At least I was right about the dollar on Friday  It did go higher   all of 0 03   and on a funny red candle at that  We remain in a descending RTC but we did bounce off the lower BB  and with indicators continuing oversold  it s just possible we go higher again on Monday   Euro  Last Thursday the euro was showing signs of moving lower but I wasn t confident enough to call it  Too bad too because the euro had its first down day in three with a red spinning top that failed to beat Thursday s highs  With new resistance in place around 1 14 and overbought indicators the euro may have trouble rising further on Monday   Transportation  And to round it out  I was also wrong about the Trans  which was unable to capitalize on Thursday s gains and dropped 0 38  on Friday with an inverted hammer in dark cloud cover position  Trading outside the descending RTC  it s a bullish trigger though  So with two conflicting predictors here  this one s a wash 

Tonight the overall look of the charts is fairly indecisive with the one notable exception of the futures which are rallying sharply  Since that s more current than whatever happened last Friday  I m going with that and calling Monday higher Single Stock TraderWell  Verizon  NYSE VZ  failed to clear resistance last Friday and with another dip that takes it back off the swing buy list ",2015-06-22,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-higher-255777,255777

Recap  The Greek deal  or possibility of a deal  or talk of a deal or whatever was neatly telegraphed Sunday night and resulted in a triple digit gain for the Dow on Monday  So let s move on to Tuesday and see what those slippery Greeks have in store for us now   The technicals  The Dow  On Monday the Dow retraced all of Friday s losses but that still leaves us right on resistance at 18 120  Indicators are noodling about between oversold and overbought so there s really not much to go on here   The VIX  The descending RTC asserted itself on Monday as the VIX lost 8 74  to just touch its lower BB  before recovering a bit  The indicators are not yet oversold but BB touches have marked bottoms the last 12 out of 12 times they ve happened  that s as far back as I looked   So I d have to guess the VIX may go higher on Tuesday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 48 AM EDT with ES up 0 27   Last night I mentioned the bullish aspect to this chart and on Monday it rose nicely  touching its upper BB on the dot  2122  intraday  Indicators are no longer overbought and the new overnight didn t even bother testing resistance at 2115  instead gapping up right through it  At this point it looks like a revisit of Monday s high is coming   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2104 17 to 2112 75  That leaves ES still above its new pivot so this indicator remains bullish   Dollar index  Last night of the dollar I wrote that  it s just possible we go higher again on Monday    And that possibility came to be with a 0 26  gain on a bullish harami  With indicators still oversold there now seems to be more upside potential here than downside risk   Euro  On Monday the euro continued its recent string of dojis  all reflecting the ongoing nonsense in Greece with a red spinning top back down to 1 1350  That nonetheless keeps it in its rising RTC  though just barely  With a stochastic just squeaking out a bearish crossover the overnight will tell the tale   Transportation  After an opaque Sunday night the Trans managed a nice 0 81  gain on Monday to break resistance at 8450  Next resistance is 8512 and with indicators not yet overbought I d expect to see this level on Tuesday 

The only sign on tonight s chart at all bearish is the VIX  and it s far from certain it will reverse on Tuesday so I m going to go ahead and call Tuesday higher Single Stock TraderOn Monday Verizon  NYSE VZ  gained a few cents but on a red spinning top as a bearish harami so I m still not on board ",2015-06-23,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-255920,255920

Recap  On Tuesday the market advanced again but the stress of pushing past recent resistance was evident as the Dow fell back from early gains to finish up just 24 points  Add in the ongoing Greek drama  Act MCMLXVIII and we have an interesting situation  Let s see what the chart make of this   The technicals  The Dow  The Dow managed to close above recent resistance  just barely but was unable to break intraday highs  The result was a lopsided green spinning top with indicators just shy of overbought  It s not a great situation for the bulls  I d not be going long right now   The VIX  Last night I noted the lower BB  touch for the VIX and suggested that might mean higher from there  But in closing I also noted that this wasn t a given  And indeed on Tuesday the VIX revisited and closed below its lower BB for a 5  gap down loss stopping right on two month long support  This now looks like an even better reversal case for Wednesday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are essentially flat at 12 46 AM EDT with ES down a single tick  ES did attempt to move higher on Tuesday but the 2021 area remains a sticking point  Right now it s gone overbought and with a dark cloud cover forming beside Monday s spinning top  the whole chart is looking tired   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2112 75 to 2116 08  But that leaves ES sitting smack dab exactly on top of the new pivot so until it decides which side of the fence to fall on  this indicator is a toss up   Dollar index  Holy moly  Last night I did write that  there now seems to be more upside potential here than downside risk  but I sure wasn t expecting a monster 1 20  gap up moonshot  That popped the dollar right out of its month long descending RTC for a bullish setup even as the indicators are only just off oversold  But with such a yawning chasm now below us  I need to wait as see if the buck is going to retrace on Wednesday or not   Euro  And of course the euro on Tuesday correspondingly took a big dump  all the way back to 1 1180  falling right out of its rising RTC for a bearish setup  and sending the indicators all on their way towards oversold  There s a bit of a rally going on in the overnight but it has the feel of a DCB to it  The euro might close higher on Wednesday but I m not expecting a major retracement   Transportation  And finally in a bit of bearish divergence the Trans started looking toppy on Tuesday with a 0 15  drop on a day the broader market was higher  A tall inverted hammer unable to close above Tuesday s candle nearly touched their upper BB and left the stochastic about to form a bearish crossover  So this chart is looking lower for Wednesday 

Tonight the charts are showing some signs of toppiness but not enough to just go ahead and call the market outright lower  But with ES sitting on top of its pivot  it s a perfect time for a conditional call  It goes like this  if ES breaks higher  above its pivot  by mid morning Wednesday  then we ll close higher  And if it falls below the pivot  we close lower  Doesn t always work  but it s all I ve got  I think Greece is going to be running the market until the end of the month anyway Single Stock TraderOn Tuesday  Verizon  NYSE VZ  rose again a bit but on an inverted hammer that formed a bearish stochastic crossover  It s definitely not a swing trade buy at this point ",2015-06-24,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-dependson-es-pivot-256060,256060

Recap  Foo   I thought Mr  Market had had enough last night but apparently not as the Dow sank another 76 on Thursday as the buyers continued to sit on their hands  Will Friday make them stand up and salute  Let s see what the charts have to say about that   The technicals  The Dow  The Dow is now in full on bearish mode with two black crows  a bearish RTC trigger and a completed bearish stochastic crossover  Last night I wrote that  there s nothing technically bullish about this chart  and tonight that goes double   The VIX  Last night I wrote that  this chart just looks higher again on Thursday    And indeed it was  up another 5 66  for a bullish trigger on a descending RTC exit  Add in a bullish stochastic crossover and these two white soldiers look ready to march higher still on Friday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 48 AM EDT with ES down 0 07     ES on Thursday did pretty much the same thing as the Dow so my comments above for that go here too  And the new overnight isn t doing much to dispel that either   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2105 67 to 2099 58  So ES remains below its new pivot and this indicator just continues bearish   Dollar Index  Last night I wrote  this one looks lower again on Thursday  and indeed it was  but just barely with a 0 03  squeaker  But this little doji star moved the stochastic closer to a bearish crossover and so this chart still looks bearish to me   Euro  And on Thursday the euro had a similar doji star as it consolidates at the base of Tuesday s big dump  But indicators have finally gone oversold and the stochastic is about to give us a bullish crossover so I d guess this one goes higher on Friday   Transportation  Last night I figured the Trans had gone about as low as they were going to go  and I was wrong  On Thursday they were stopped only by their lower BB at 8240  The last time we closed this low was last October 8th  And the indicators are still a ways from oversold so with two red marubozus on the record  there s still nothing bullish here  Thanks  Greece  Thanks for nothing 

Thursday s action only provided bearish confirmation of Wednesday s charts  If we didn t get a reversal Thursday I don t think we re going to get one Friday as the charts are looking generally ugly  Now Russell rebalancing could conceivably throw a monkey wrench in the works and I d love to see a move higher  but I m afraid I m going to have to call Friday lower  That s all she wrote  See you again Sunday night Single Stock TraderVerizon  NYSE VZ  was one of only a handful of Dow stocks that managed to rise on Thursday but it was on a red inverted hammer with a bearish stochastic crossover  trading outside its rising RTC again for a bearish trigger  So VZ remains most definitely not a swing trade buy ",2015-06-26,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-lower-256328,256328

Recap  I know I said I was going to take the rest of the week off after last night   but this action was too good  or too bad  to let pass without comment  The Night Owl has seen this before  Some deadbeat promises to repay you by the end of the month  consolidating everything into one payment  Then the end of the month comes along and instead of a check he wants more time  Then he s got some excuse where he ll ask a friend and then pay you in five days  Uh huh  Time to face the facts  Jack  The Greeks ain t never gonna pay you  The Grexit is as good as done  The other fact is that none of this will amount to a hill of beans  Look  in the first week of August 2011  the VIX hit 48  Forty eight   And that was because  Because   Right   I can t remember either  And back then the Dow was at 11 000  So four years from now no one will remember the Greeks and their 2015 fiscal melodrama  Next crisis   The technicals  The Dow  For all the drama of Monday s 350 point swan dive in the Dow  it pales compared to the 875 point drubbing the Dow took in January 2014 for example  Absurdly overdone  IMNSHO  In one day the Dow broke support at 17 764  broke through its lower BB  and then kept right on going crashing through its 200 day MA  stopping only because the bell finally rang at 4 PM  That was more than enough to send it oversold and drive the stochastic to a level from which reversals come  This chart is looking ripe for a relief rally or at least a DCB   The VIX  Holy moly  On Monday the VIX exploded like a SpaceX shuttle supply rocket  gapping up 34   vaulting right over its 200 day MA and trading mostly entirely above its upper BB for its highest close since January 28th  Some talking head on CNBC was sniffing that the VIX is still below 20 ignoring the magnitude of the one day delta  Anyway  give it time  Whenever Mr  Market goes off his meds like this  the one and done rule of the VIX falling after hitting its upper BB is suspended  Vicious moves like this seem to have lots of inertia behind them so it s still possible we could see another day or two of moves higher  Then watch for the inevitable VIX collapse   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 15 AM EDT with ES up 0 23   On Monday ES had the biggest gap down I think I ve ever seen in 10 years  hitting 2047 to send the indicators all oversold  The stochastic is now moving into position for a bullish crossover but not there yet  But the overnight seems to be suggesting some sort of retracement for Tuesday   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot crashes from 2094 25 to 2060 33  And even after that ES remains below its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish   Dollar index  The dollar also had an outsized move lower Monday  down a big 0 73   though not more than we ve seen multiple times in the past 30 days  But it was enough to peak the indicators at overbought and form a bearish stochastic crossover so this chart looks lower for Tuesday   Euro  Mr  Market seemed to cheer the effect of the impending departure of the Greeks from the euro as the currency just rose throughout the day while the rest of the market got pounded  It completely retraced a big gap down the day before  and then some  So after all the noise  the euro closed at 1 1265  exactly where it was four days ago  But these big one off moves tend to distort the charts so I m not touching this one tonight   Transportation  On Monday the Trans moved in lockstep with the Dow so everything I wrote there applies here too 

Just as the futures pointed the way lower last night at this hour tonight they seem to be suggesting a bounce on Tuesday  I note too that the SPX Hi Lo indicator hit 9 on Monday  its lowest reading of the year by far  These are the levels from which reversals spring  The previous low  on March 10th was 32 and the next day began an 8 day rally  As the markets open and traders discover that the earth is still spinning on its axis  we could attract some bargain hunters so I m going to go ahead and call Tuesday higher Of course  that could change if the Greek finance minister suddenly announces he s going to play Angela Merkel and the ECB board of governors a round of Texas Hold  Em for the Greek debt  then all bets are off Single Stock TraderVerizon  NYSE VZ went oversold on Monday but there s no telling what s going to happen next so we re just continuing to sit on the sidelines here ",2015-06-30,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-256686,256686

Recap  Those freakin  Greeks  As I write on Sunday evening it is apparent that Greece has evidently decided to sow the wind by voting  no  on their crazy referendum  And just as surely they will reap the whirlwind  The Grexit is in my view now inevitable  I am absolutely astounded at this naked display of unabashed hubris  The Greeks are crowing about their  dignity  but seem to have forgotten that when you re bankrupt  the first thing you forfeit is your dignity  Hey  I ll have to try that next year when my property taxes are due  I ll just tell the town I can t pay but I have my dignity so they have a responsibility to share my pain  Let s see how far that gets me  Perhaps Angela Merkel can loan Mr  Tsipras a few euros so he can buy himself a tie   Apparently the Greeks would rather go down with their ship and take the rest of the world with them  And judging by the futures this evening  that s exactly what s going to happen on Monday  So there s no point to even bother doing individual charts tonight as Monday s close is already a forgone conclusion  This Greek drama is getting rather tiresome  Note to Greece  would you please just go away   The technicals  ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dips from 2070 00 to 2067 33  And that still leaves us well below the new pivot so this indicator is nwo bearish   very bearish

Recap
After falling over the edge out the gate Monday morning  the Dow quickly recovered the entire loss  only to retrace most of it before finally ending just 47 points lower  as Mr  Market displayed more common sense than he usually does in the face of  major crises   So that s that  Let s see if it s even possible technically with the barrage of contradictory and confusing comments coming from Europe lately  where Tuesday might be headed 
The Technicals
The Dow  After trading above its 200 day MA on Thursday  the Dow plunged back below it on Monday  only to pop right back up again and finally settle just a few points below it with the mother of all hammers  Though we now have two red days in a row  they both traded outside the last descending RTC and that s a bullish trigger  The indicators remain oversold and the stochastic has completed a bullish crossover  So overall  I d have to say this chart now looks bullish 
The VIX  After finding support right on its 200 day MA last Thursday  the VIX continued higher on Monday  But after hitting the rarefied air around 19  where it petered out twice before in the last 5 days   it came right back down to end with a tall dark cloud cover that bounced off its upper BB  Indicators remain overbought  and we have a completed bearish stochastic crossover  so this chart looks lower Tuesday 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 54 AM EDT with ES up 0 31   ES opened Monday way down  in fact below its lower BB and right down to its 200 day MA  But then it was up  up and away from there for a nearly 30 point gain  Even at that  the indicators are still just barely oversold  and the stochastic has just completed a bullish stochastic crossover  So with the overnight confirming that  this one looks higher for Tuesday 
ES daily pivot  Tonight  the ES daily pivot plummets from 2070 00 to 2056 42  That now leaves ES way above its new pivot  so this indicator is quite bullish 
Dollar index  The dollar took a 0 19  bounce on Monday  no doubt as all the Greeks sought refuge for their cash  But that drove it to its upper BB and left the indicators just off overbought with a red hanging man  This is a pretty good reversal sign  so I d not be surprised to see the buck go lower on Tuesday 
Euro  I m a bit surprised that the euro managed to actually post a gain on Monday  given all the Greek drama going on  In the overnight  it s virtually unchanged  but given all the uncertainty around Europe right now  I m not touching this one with a ten foot Grecian urn 
Transportation  The transportation have been in a ragged descending trend since the middle of March  one that accelerated after giving up the 200 day MA in mid May  The trend is even more pronounced on the monthly chart  where you can clearly see the peak in November 2014  But on a monthly basis  we are now oversold  and that doesn t happen often  The last time was September 2011  and a month later  the transportation took off on a four month rally  In daily terms  we ve ricocheted off the lower BB with oversold indicators and a stochastic lying on the floor  but gearing up for a bullish crossover  So with some clear support established at 8080  I d have to guess the next move is higher 

What a difference a day makes  Tonight the charts are pretty much in agreement  with some good bullish technical signs  so I ll just go ahead and call Tuesday higher  With the usual caveat about the Greeks  of course

of ISIS in nearly every country of the paradise known as the Middle East  Nope  Let s concentrate on what really matters to the citizens of the globe  You got it  that is right  the crucial variable we all have to pay attention to  and that is the interest rate on the 10 Year Treasury Bond  It shattered the astronomical rate of 2 39  yesterday  closing at a demanding 2 40   If you really want to

these are actually some of the thoughts which are reflected in actions of investors who believe interest rates are headed to 20   Clearly  they forget about the first grade math number line where there are a few places between 2 and 20  unless my teacher had it wrong  Whoops  She had it right  Just checked with my daughter  Anyway  when the May jobs report came in at 280 000 jobs yesterday  it was confirmation for many that the economy is strong and the due date for interest rate lift off will be September  As such  the sell off on Thursday was validated  at least for those who sold Gazing

neglected the stock market  My attention span is not as good as it once was  When you turn 48  things get hazy   Anyway  equities have run into a slumbering patch over the last few weeks  As usual

Recap  After a brief attempt to break above its pivot at 3 AM last Friday  ES never threatened again and the market closed lower as I had predicted with my patented conditional call  A Friday close lower is a bearish sign and a subsequent Monday close lower would confirm it  So let s figure out if that s going to happen  pronto  The technicals  The Dow  The Dow has now been falling basically for two weeks and it finally hit its lower BB on Friday with a stubby red spinning top that left the indicators oversold  though not wilding so  That s a reversal sign in my book but one which requires confirmation   falling knife etc   The VIX  Last Thursday night I wrote that  200 MA touches usually mark tops for the VIX and this time doesn t look any different    And that was true  with the VIX falling 3 4  on Friday on a tall red bearish engulfing pattern after making one last stab at its 200 day MA  And that gave us one of those unusual cases where the VIX and the market were both down the same day  It was also enough to drive the stochastic lower so overall I d say the VIX looks lower again on Monday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 34 AM EDT with ES down 0 06    On Friday ES gave us a far red spinning top that tested its lower BB and drove the indicators oversold  The Sunday overnight is doing pretty much the same  with a second unsuccessful test of the BB so there seems to be an attempt at bottoming here  Whether or not its successful remains to be seen as this sort of action requires confirmation  particularly given the general weakness of the paste two weeks  ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2102 25 to 2092 83  That still leaves ES below its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish  Dollar Index  As might be expected  the dollar shot up nearly a percent on Friday to bust out of its descending RTC with a bullish setup  form a bullish stochastic crossover  and cause the indicators to bottom at oversold  That all points to more upside Monday  Euro  And just reverse everything above for the euro which is now looking lower again for Monday  Transportation  And finally on Friday the trans gave us a bit of bullish divergence by rising a hefty 0 86  on a day the Dow and SPX were both down  The resulting bullish engulfing candle keeps them in a rising RTC though the indicators have begun moving lower just before reaching overbought  And with the trans sitting right on three day resistance now  it s not clear they have enough gas in the tank to move higher Monday 

Much like last Thursday night ES is once again sitting just below its daily pivot with a number of reversal signs present in the other charts  That makes tonight another candidate for a conditional call  If ES can break above its pivot by mid morning Monday we ll close higher  If not  we close lower Single Stock TraderOK  I was wrong  Just when I thought Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  couldn t go any lower     it did  plunging another nearly 2  on Friday  Holy moly  RSI has now hit the big Z   that s zero  zilch  nil  nada  the square root of nothing  The last time RSI was this low  well it isn t even on my chart  It traded entirely below its lower BB  If this doesn t dive any further Monday morning  I m in ",2015-06-08,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-depsned-on-es-pivot-254245,254245

Recap  I guess just hitting the lower BB  isn t always the panacea  as Monday proved  The Dow sank another 0 46  on another red marubozu again trading mostly below its lower BB  Things are looking pretty grim right about now but the current decline is still less than what we got back in early March  Is there a reversal in out future  Only the charts can say   The technicals  The Dow  The Dow finished right on session lows Monday and with three black crows  it ain t looking good  Indicators are now oversold but not extremely so  So there s really nothing technically bullish about this chart   The VIX  And the VIX really surprised me on Monday  Instead of moving lower it jumped nearly 8  to close above its 200 day MA  So much for the big bearish engulfing pattern  However  in its stead  we now have a big dark cloud cover plus overbought indicators  Usually when the VIX gets overbought like this it s headed lower  So I still think we re due for some relief here   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are finally higher at 12 46 AM EDT with ES up 0 08   On Monday ES extended it losing streak to three  remaining in a steep descending RTC and punching right through its lower BB and leaving the indicators all oversold  That all looks bad  The only ray of hope is that ES is actually rising in the overnight  the first time we ve seen that in several days now suggesting that maybe bargain hunters are stepping up to the table   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2092 83 to 2082 58  And even that still leaves ES below its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish   Dollar index  I also missed the dollar on Monday which instead of moving higher just collapsed  giving up all of Friday s gains and then some  Indicators aren t even oversold yet so it s too early to call a move higher from here   Euro  And so of course I was also wrong about the euro which instead of moving lower posted a big gain all the way back to 1 1278 on Monday on a big bullish engulfing pattern  But indicators remain quite overbought and the euro is now at weekly resistance so it s not clear it can sustain this momentum into Tuesday   Transportation  Last night I was reluctant to call the Trans higher Monday because  it s not clear they have enough gas in the tank to move higher Monday   And holy moly  the tank was on E as the trans fell a giant 2 06  Monday  dropping right out of their rising RTC for a bearish setup  forming a bearish stochastic crossover  and sending the indicators lower  That all looks bad for Tuesday 

We re starting to see some technical signs that the selling may be abating  particularly in the futures and the VIX  I ll also note that the Morningstar Market Fair Value Index has now hit 1 00  indicating a lot of foam has come out of the market  The last time we were at this level as May 6th and the next day began a two day rally  But we remain in a long downtrend and the Dow chart is pretty ugly right now  So I m just going to go out on a limb  cover my eyes  and call Tuesday higher Single Stock TraderLast night I blessed Verizon  NYSE VZ  as a swing buy and it did indeed move higher on Monday  with a green spinning top that suggests bottoming  And after that it still looks like a reasonable entry point ",2015-06-09,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-254402,254402

Recap  These counter trend calls are always risky and I acknowledged that last night  calling Tuesday higher  And it almost worked too but for yet another late afternoon sell off that ended with the Dow down all of two and a half points  Still that beats the recent triple digit losses we ve been getting  Does this mean a reversal is at hand  We scour the charts for clues  The technicals  The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow continued its skid down the lower BB  but unlike the past two days it ended with a perfect doji star  Along with indicators quite oversold and a very low stochastic about to form a bullish crossover indicators  I give this better than even odds of being a valid reversal sign   The VIX  Last night I wrote that  I still think we re due for some relief here   And it sure arrived  in the form of a 5 36  drop in the VIX on Tuesday and some bullish divergence for the market  I always say that the VIX tends to retreat after hitting its upper BB and this was no exception  One day after closing above it and boom  down we went  So with indicators still overbought there s no reason to believe the VIX selling is done yet   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are finally higher at 12 40 AM EDT with ES up 0 13   On Tuesday ES put in a tall doji star trading entirely below the lower BB at the lower end of Monday s big dump  Indicators remain oversold and the stochastic has just made a bullish crossover so I d hazard we go higher on Wednesday   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2082 58 to 2077 83  That drop plus and overnight rise in ES finally puts it back above its new pivot so this indicator now turns bullish   Dollar index  Last night I wouldn t commit to a higher dollar Tuesday and it was just as well as the buck sank another 0 16   The only things to suggest a reversal at this point are oversold indicators and being near support   Euro  Last night I wrote that  it s not clear  the euro  can sustain this momentum into Tuesday    And indeed it couldn t  ending where it began with a perfect doji star  So now we have resistance and a reversal sign  I d still not be going long the euro here   Transportation  They were making all sorts of noise over on CNBC today about the dismal state of the Trans  and rightly so  IMAO  Last night I pointed out a bunch of stuff that  all looks bad for Tuesday   And it wasn t a disaster  but the Trans still moved another 0 33  lower  And if you back out to the monthly chart you ll see that the Trans peaked way back last November and has been in a downtrend ever since  This is part of the reason why I switched my TickerSense monthly SPX direction poll from bullish to bearish two weeks ago  Even short term doesn t look that good  we have a hammer but also a completed bearish stochastic crossover and falling indicators 

Tuesday had the feeling of a washout low  Also the Morningstar Market Fair Value Index has hit 0 99 for the first time since last December 15th and that marked a bottom  We have some decent reversal signs on the charts tonight so I m going to go ahead again and call Wednesday higher Single Stock TraderOn Tuesday Verizon  NYSE VZ  lost a bit on a dark cloud cover but overall it looks like it still has much more upside potential than downside risk remaining quite oversold ",2015-06-10,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-254538,254538

Recap  The market popped nicely on Wednesday with a broad based advance as the Dow gained 236 points  Now this definitely changes the picture so let s query the charts and see what they have to say   The technicals  The Dow  Last night the Dow was showing the perfect setup for a rally with a tall doji star sitting on it slower BB  with oversold indicators  And sure enough on Wednesday we got a big pop to propel the Dow right out of its descending RTC for a bullish setup and its best day in over a month  There s nothing bearish about this other than the fact that the Dow usually likes to rest up a bit after a big move up and I think hat may be entirely possible here   The VIX  Last night I wrote that   there s no reason to believe the VIX selling is done yet   And that was true  with the VIX dumping 8 64  in Wednesday with a gap down marubozu that drove the indicators off overbought and rejecting the 200 day MA in a big way  And that still leaves nothing bullish to be seen on this chart   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 21 AM EDT with ES down 0 11   On Wednesday ES had its best day since April 6th to zoom right out of its descending RTC for a bullish setup  The bullish stochastic crossover is now complete  Tuesday s doji is confirmed  the bounce off the lower BB is confirmed  all the indicators are rising off oversold so there s really nothing technically bearish here   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot jumps from 2077 83 to 2098 33  But even that move wasn t enough to put ES below its new pivot so this indicator remains bullish   Dollar index  Last night I mentioned support as being the dollar s only savior and on Wednesday that gave way like a balsa wood bridge with a gap down star for a half percent loss  But with indicators now oversold this is 2 3 of a bullish morning star so we need to see how this ends  I wouldn t go short the dollar right now though   Euro  Huh   I didn t think the euro could do it  but on Wednesday it rallied to break resistance and close at 1 1317  But is was on a tall lopsided spinning top  almost inverted hammer and the new overnight is guiding lower so with indicators continuing overbought I m still not on board the euro   Transportation  I don t know why I wasn t willing to commit to the Transs last night  On Friday they confirmed Tuesday s hammer with a nice 0 68  jump  The resulting spinning top is misshapen though and the indicators are confused  so once again it s not clear where this one is headed 

All the charts are bullish tonight   too bullish  It is of course common for the market to pause after a big run up and this case looks typical  I m expecting a small move  possibly a doji and as such the logical course of action is to call Thursday uncertain Single Stock TraderI said last night Verizon  NYSE VZ  was still worth buying and it did indeed gain a bit more on Wednesday though its backing its way higher  with two successive red spinning tops  But that double spinning top is certainly a warning so I m moving this one from a buy to a hold ",2015-06-11,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-uncertain-254692,254692

A down Friday followed by a down Monday is a well known bearish sign and we already saw that a week ago  Now we have yet another down Friday and the technicals sure don t look very positive tonight  Also  the Morningstar Market Fair Value Index continues to lag at 0 99  A reading below 1 can be bullish  but not if it drags on too long  Then it becomes bearish  With no real bullish signs to speak of on the charts tonight and the futures unambiguously guiding lower  I have no alternative but to call Monday lower Single Stock TraderWell I guess that s the end of this trade  Verizon  NYSE VZ  fell out of bed on Friday  along with the rest of the Dow  That put a quick end to this rising RTC  erasing a week s worth of gains  So we re back to square one  waiting for a likely buy point ",2015-06-15,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-lower-255007,255007

Recap  Last night things were looking bleak and I called the close for Monday lower  And sure enough  the Dow ended with another triple digit loss  This was particularly concerning since it makes a down Friday followed by a down Monday for the second week in a row  That s a particularly negative pattern  So keeping that in mind  is there any relief in sight  The charts will speak when they get good and ready   The technicals  The Dow  On Monday the Dow gave us a 108 point drop for a fat hammer but also a bearish stochastic crossover  There s support at 17 757 that was successfully tested on Monday but with the 200 day MA at 17 633 hoving into view I d expect a retest  This pattern is certainly not bullish   The VIX  Last night I wrote of the VIX that  more upside is possible Monday    And it came to pass  with a giant 11 68  gap up pop that blasted it right through its 200 day MA  But in the end it was a classic hanging man looking a lot like an evening star in the making  200 MA hits are the third rail for the VIX and I expect all the bots know it  particularly with a yawning gap now below us   I m looking for a move lower on Tuesday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12  AM EDT  On Monday ES confirmed Friday s spinning top with a 50  retracement of Thursday s gains on a big gap down hammer that forced a bearish stochastic crossover  But it also touched the lower BB  And six of the last six times that s happened  we got a move higher within two days  That may not be Tuesday though as the overall larger trend remains down and the overnight is sagging   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2097 50 to 2081 67  ES remains below its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish   Dollar index  Last night I wrote that  there are no bullish signs on this chart tonight   And what happens in that case  The dollar goes down  Another 0 14  Monday  The indicators are all dead in the water and there are still no bullish signs on this chart   Euro  Well of course I did miss the euro on Monday which went higher to 1 1297  not lower as I expected  But that still leaves it in a narrow congestion zone around 1 277  a level we ve hit for eight straight days now  The current pattern  hammer followed by bullish engulfing suggests higher  but tempered by indicators now overbought  As far as I can tell the euro has a bit more sideways motion to go before a break   Transportation  Like the Dow the Trans gave us a red hammer on Monday but not quite a bearish stochastic crossover  Still  this would be an exceedingly risky point to go long the trans 

Well after careful consideration I m afraid there aren t a whole lot of bullish signs on the charts tonight  Only the VIX looks bullish on a reversal candle but it could still take one more stab higher before falling back  So I m afraid I ll just have to declare Tuesday lower Single Stock TraderVerizon  NYSE VZ  just continues to be part of the overall market decline  It broke support at 47 24 on Monday with a gap down spinning top so there s just no telling when it might be a buy again  Short form  stay away ",2015-06-16,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-lower-255170,255170

Recap  Last night the Dow had given us a reversal warning in the form of a hammer but that wasn t too convincing to me  Too bad too  because the Dow gained triple digits Tuesday  apparently on pre Fed second guessing  Well I won t be fooled twice  It s my standard policy to never make predictions ahead of Fed days and that goes double for this one as this Wednesday s announcement is more widely anticipated than most  So we ll just skip the chart run downs tonight  No point to them  Less for me to write  less for you to read   The technicals  ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot finally rises from 2081 67 to 2088 75  ES did well enough Tuesday to rise above its new pivot so this indicator now turns bullish 

I won t be playing the game Wednesday morning  not ahead of a big Fed announcement  There might be some great scalping opportunities as soon as it comes out for the fleet of finger but I ll leave that to those more adventurous than me  In the meantime  the call is simply Wednesday uncertain Single Stock TraderOn Tuesday Verizon  NYSE VZ  took something of an unexpected pop that helped establish 47 as support  I think I might stick a limit buy just above that and see what happens ",2015-06-17,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-uncertain-255296,255296

Recap  Huh   well there were some nice day trading opportunities around the Fed announcement at 2 PM Wednesday but by the time it was all over the market was little changed  the Dow gained a mere 31 points So with that excitement finally out of the way we move on to Thursday  The technicals  The Dow  In the end  Mr  Market couldn t figure out what to make of the Fed announcement  ending with a symmetrical spinning top above Tuesday s jump  But we also got a new bullish stochastic crossover so this chart remains conflicted   The VIX  True to form  the VIX bounced off its upper BB  and fell back under its 200 day MA on Tuesday to set up another loss on Wednesday  But this is also a spinning top so no call here   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 18 AM EDT with ES down 0 20   On Wednesday ES put in a long legged doji star with about Tuesday s close  The overnight seems to be confirming that with a move lower so this chart is looking bearish now   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2088 75 to 2097 17  And that combined with ES sagging in the overnight now puts it back below its new pivot so this indicator goes back to bearish   Dollar index  The dollar continued its month long slide Wednesday closing in on its lower BB with indicators now oversold  But there s still no reversal sign here yet   Euro  Looks like the euro may finally be breaking out of its sideways trading range with a pop back to 1 1347 Wednesday  its highest close since May 15th  And with a bullish stochastic from a high level and the overnight guiding higher  I d say more upside is possible Thursday   Transportation  The Trans made it four losers in a row Wednesday but this one was a hammer that touched it slower BB respecting support at 8297 so there s a chance this one could reverse Thursday 

We have a bunch of reversal signs about tonight after the post Fed rally fizzled and the broader month long trend remains down so I m going to call Thursday lower Single Stock TraderI take back what I said about Verizon  NYSE VZ  being a swing buy  With a red hanging man Wednesday  fuggedaboudit ",2015-06-18,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-lower-255433,255433

Recap  Hmm   apparently Mr  Market is still not over his Fed induced snit from last Friday as the selling continued unabated on Tuesday  ending just off session lows  At least it was not entirely unexpected as we pointed out last night  So now let s continue on to Wednesday and see when we might sound the all clear   The technicals  The Dow  The Dow took a nasty little 190 point dump on Tuesday and it was enough to send the indicators from overbought to oversold in a single day  a fairly rare occurrence  In fact the last time was saw this was August 11  2010  And at that time there was a bunch more downside to go  though we also had a 200 day MA cross going which is not the case now  Still  this drop s got  falling knife  written all over it so until I see at least a reversal candle  I m not touching it   The VIX  Last night I wrote that the VIX  looks primed for more upside   And was it ever  with a nearly 16  gap up pop on Tuesday that took the indicators from oversold nearly to overbought  The resulting inverted hammer is a reversal sign and there is a gap now that ll be wanting filling but we need some confirmation  A move lower on Wednesday would form a bearish evening star   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 33 AM EDT with ES down 0 07   ES had a bad day Tuesday though no worse than just three weeks ago on May 5th ending five days of congestion with a big sneeze downward  That was enough to send all the indicators off overbought though not quite to oversold  So we still can t call a reversal and the overnight isn t showing much enthusiasm either   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2126 08 to 2085 92  So we remain below the new pivot and therefore this indicator continues bearish   Dollar index  Like everything else on Tuesday the dollar had an outsized move  gapping up a huge 1 35  to trade entirely above its upper BB    highly unusual  That drove the indicators quite overbought and flattened out the stochastic to make way for a bearish crossover  But we re not there yet  And as we saw back in March when the dollar spent three weeks climbing its upper BB  just because it s gone up doesn t mean it can t go higher  So we need to wait a day for confirmation  I d expect a move lower soon but it might not be Wednesday   Euro  And on Tuesday much noise was made about the euro s fall back to 1 0874  But the fact is  we ve been here six times already this year  This time though we hit the lower BB and the indicators are highly oversold  RSI 3 79   Still we remain in a descending RTC with no sign of a reversal candle so until then I just have to wait   see   Transportation  The Trans  which have been having a hard time lately had an even harder one Tuesday  tanking 1 55  to cascade down their lower BB  this move has flattened out the stochastic in preparation for a bullish crossover but the indicators are still not oversold so it s still too soon to call a reversal 

On Tuesday the market fell far enough and fast enough to make a relief rally or at least a DCB not out of the question  However  technically there are still no signs of a reversal and all the charts continue to look bearish  But because there s some doubt here I m going to settle for calling Wednesday uncertain Single Stock TraderLast night I recommended staying away from Verizon  NYSE VZ  and that proved to be a good idea since it fell along with the rest of the Dow on Tuesday  The resulting spinning top touched its lower BB which has been a good reversal sign in the past though the indicators are still not quite as oversold as I d like to see  If this one looks to be finding support at the open on Wednesday  an event I ll never see   it might be looking attractive  For now though I m still waiting ",2015-05-27,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-uncertain-253012,253012

Recap  Last Thursday night I wasn t at all sure which way we were going on Friday but I sure didn t expect a 115 point dump in the Dow  That makes things interesting so let s go right to the charts to evaluate the implications   The technicals  The Dow  On Friday the Dow confirmed a hanging man with a triple digit loss to break support at 18 047 and just barely hang on to 18K  But this big drop had the feel of a washout tome  driving the indicators well into oversold and curving the stochastic very close to a bullish crossover  Though this isn t a bullish candle  this is the zone from which rallies come   The VIX  And on Friday the VIX tried to rally but in the end managed only a meager 4  gain on a tall inverted hammer  That also caused the indicators to top just short of overbought and left the stochastic about to form a bearish crossover  That makes this chart look lower for Monday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 17 AM EDT with ES up 0 17   ES dropped on Friday but it continues to find support right around 2105  Note that this is actually YTD support  not just from the past week  And that seems to be holding into the Sunday overnight  I d be wary of going short at these levels   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2118 33 to 2085 92  So that still leaves ES below its new pivot but now only just barely and this indicator is now only marginally bearish   Dollar index  The dollar has been mirroring the trans lately  see below   Everything I wrote there applies here too   Euro  Last Thursday night I wrote to look for  a higher close on Friday for the euro  and indeed it managed to push higher again  to 1 0983 but with a spinning top  Fortunately  we ve got some Sunday overnight action to help us out here and that is guiding lower  confirming the spinning top  So despite oversold indicators and a bullish stochastic crossover  I d not be surprised to see a lower close on Monday   Transportation  After a big move lower Thursday  the Trans hit the brakes on Friday to end with a perfect doji star  though one hanging right above a yawning gap  with overbought indicators and a completed bearish stochastic crossover  This is the sort of reversal candle that absolutely requires confirmation before calling higher 

The first day of most months is generally bullish and June is no exception despite its overall crappy reputation  And while they re not a screaming buy  technically the charts tonight are at least entertaining the possibility of a reversal soon  So I m just going to go ahead and call Monday higher Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications  NYSE VZ  remains unsettled with two inverted hammers and then four spinning tops in a row  I can t really bless this unless and until I see a better edge than this  Patience  as always  is the key ",2015-06-01,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-higher-253500,253500

Recap  After a decent start  the bears made a valiant attempt to knock  em down into the close on Monday but in the end history prevailed and the Dow managed to finish up 30 points  Hey  we ll take it   we have to  So  sell in May  was a bust   will it now be  swoon in June   Only way to tell is by grilling the charts  So let s light the Kingsford and look towards Tuesday   The technicals  The Dow  Despite a modest gain on Monday  the Dow remains in a nearly two week long downtrend  We now have a fat spinning top that is a reversal sign but one which requires confirmation  So it s no go here   The VIX  Wow   on Monday the VIX put in the supernova of all doji stars  hitting 14 86 before collapsing back to 13 97  Sitting on top of Friday s action with indicators nearly overbought  this makes me want to give better than even odds we go lower on Tuesday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are essentially unchanged at 12 18 AM EDT with ES down one whole tick  On Monday ES gave us a tall spinning top at the lower end of Friday s dump  just touching its lower BB   Indicators are mixed though  But that BB touch has been a good reversal sign lately so a move higher from here is not out of the question  The overnight though doesn t seem to be supporting that forming a dark cloud cover at the moment   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dips from 2110 33 to 2109 08  An odd late evening dive for no immediately apparent reason now puts ES below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish   Dollar index  Last night I noted the possibility of a reversal in the dollar but insisted on confirmation  Well we got it on Monday with a nice 0 50  gain  Unfortunately  that gain was so big it brought us nearly back to resistance so with the indicators remaining overbought and the past week really range bound we need to wait again for some definitive sign of movement   Euro  On Monday the euro fell out of a short rising RTC for a bearish setup  Last night I wrote that  I d not be surprised to see a lower close on Monday    And I wasn t  as we went back down to 1 0935  We re also getting a stochastic curving around for a bearish crossover from a low level and those are generally good for at least a day of continued lower  The overnight seems to be supporting this   Transportation  Here s something interesting   after underperforming for the last three centuries  the Trans on Monday beat the pants off the Dow with a monster 1 14  pop to zoom out of their long running descending RTC for a bullish setup and force a bullish stochastic crossover  Indicators have now bottomed at oversold so this all looks higher on Tuesday to me 

The second day of June is historically even better than the first day according to the Stock Traders Almanac  But what we re getting tonight is a series of reversal signs that all require confirmation  And right now the futures are taking a turn south  And I always hate to bet against the futures  But we are so close to the ES pivot that this seems like a good time to make a conditional call  if ES can break back above its pivot by mid morning Tuesday  we ll close higher  If not  we close lower Single Stock TraderTurns out I was right to wait on this one  Verizon  NYSE VZ  went down another 22 cents on Monday after days of noodling about  It just managed to touch its lower BB which is interesting but the indicators have yet to hit oversold so I m still sitting on the sidelines ",2015-06-02,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-depends-on-es-pivot-253670,253670

Recap  Last night I made a conditional call  the condition being ES managing to get above its pivot by mid morning in order for the market to close higher  Well it did make a breakout but it wasn t til noon which was too late and the market did indeed close lower  This doesn t always work but it works often enough to keep in the toolbox  So on we go to Wednesday to see what s what   The technicals  The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow put in a nice doji star at the lower end of Monday s big dump  That s a decent reversal sign modulo the indicators which are still aways from oversold  So I d prepare for a reversal  though it s not a given at this point   The VIX  Well I was certainly wrong about the VIX on Tuesday  It did not go lower on a spinning top  instead it rose another 1 93    on a second spinning top   But this one very nearly touched both its upper BB and 200 day MA  coincidentally both around 15 20 before falling back  That  along with now overbought indicators is a decent topping sign in my book   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 38 AM EDT with ES up 0 09   On Tuesday ES followed Monday s spinning top with another  even larger spinning top  There s no guidance from that but I do note a stochastic about to form a bullish crossover and the overnight seems to be supporting that  at least for now   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2109 08 to 2105 58  And that was enough to put ES back above its new pivot so this indicator turns back to bullish again  Dollar index  The dollar got hammered on Tuesday with a tall gap down 1 63  marubozu that sent the indicators off overbought and moving towards oversold  Nothing bullish on this chart  Euro  And correspondingly the euro had a major boost on Tuesday taking me completely by surprise to close back to 1 1169  Indicators continue to rise but are still a ways from overbought so this one looks like it s still got room to run  Transportation  The trans have seen a week of choppy losses that have been dribbling down the lower BB  Tuesday may have been the end as the trans rose in a bit of bullish divergence on a day the rest of the market was down  It was a spinning top but also a bullish trigger on a falling RTC exit  We also got a bullish stochastic crossover so I d hazard this one looks higher for Wednesday 

Hmm  the crystal ball isn t 100  clear but what I am seeing is signs of a reversal so I m going to go out on a limb and call Wednesday higher Single Stock TraderLast night I still wasn t ready to get on board NYSE VZ and good thing too because it was down again on Tuesday  This time with a spindly spinning top that just about touched its 200 day MA before bouncing off  We remain in a downtrend but the indicators are getting quite oversold  These are levels from which reversals happen but I m still a bit cautious here  If it s not going lower again at the open on Wednesday  it might be worth putting on a small position ",2015-06-03,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-253824,253824

Recap  We called Wednesday higher and I consider myself fortunate the Dow did just that given that it spent most of the day moving lower after a big jump out the gate  But that was then and this is now  so let s look at the charts as usual and think about Thursday   The technicals  The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow confirmed Tuesday s spinning top by moving higher   but did it with another reversal sign  a giant lopsided spinning top  Aside form that though we exited the descending RTC for a bullish setup  got a bullish stochastic crossover  and the indicators are still oversold  So the balance of all that is a bullish bias   The VIX  Last night I spotted  a decent topping sign  in the VIX and down it went on Wednesday  off 4  on a gap down doji star that still left the indicators overbought and formed a bearish stochastic crossover  That leaves plenty of room to run lower   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 42 AM EDT with ES down 0 14   Last night I noted a bullish stochastic crossover and that played out nicely on Wednesday sending ES higher for its best day in a week  Indicators are still a ways from overbought but the overnight seems to be having trouble advancing so I m not sure about Thursday here   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2105 58 to 2114 50  And that plus an overnight sag in ES is enough to put it back below its new pivot so this indicator now turns bearish   Dollar index  Last night I wrote about the dollar that there s  nothing bullish on this chart   Which was true  with a 0 38  drop on Thursday for two black crows  That was enough to send the indicators oversold but not enough for a bullish stochastic crossover so until I see a reversal sign  I ll have to go with more downside here   Euro  And last night I also wrote  about the euro  that  this one looks like it s still got room to run   Which it did nicely on Wednesday  closing at 1 1260 to keep the uptrend alive but also sending the indicators very overbought  We re right on a resistance line but I d be cautious here  This one could go either way on Thursday   Transportation  Last night I wrote that  this one looks higher for Wednesday    And that s where the Trans went  up 1 22   That was the payoff on the bullish RTC trigger  So with indicators still rising and no bearish signs in sight  I d say there s still room for further gains 

On the surface  things are looking fairly bullish tonight  I m a bit concerned though that the indicators may have been a bit distorted by the early market advance and subsequent sell off  I also note that the futures are trending lower in the overnight  But that alone isn t enough to make be turn bearish particularly in the absence of any other overtly negative signs  Therefore I will have to content myself to call Thursday uncertain Single Stock TraderLast night I mentioned the need for caution here and while Verizon  NYSE VZ  did move higher on Wednesday  it ended lower following up a spinning top with an even bigger spinning top  This one actually pierced the 200 day MA and we remain oversold  But that leaves us where we were last night   show me the reversal ",2015-06-04,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-uncertain-253932,253932

Recap  The market took a big jump on Friday propelled by some jobs number Mr  Market evidently found quite appealing  That changes the picture once again so let s take a step back and see what this all means for Monday   The technicals  The Dow  On Friday the Dow had its best day since way back last December 18th by the looks of it with a rocket ship that zoomed it right past resistance at 18 111 and clear to it supper BB  And amazingly  even that wasn t enough to send the indicators overbought  And the stochastic is still finishing up its bullish stochastic crossover  So with the all time high not too far away  I see no reason why the Dow would not want to revisit that level on Monday   The VIX  Last Thursday night I wrote that   a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo  makes it look like the next move is likely lower   And was it ever  with the VIX gapping down a monster 15   its biggest gap lower since the very same December 18th to crash right back through the 200 day MA in a move that just barely nudged the indicators off overbought and also formed a bearish stochastic crossover  Support isn t til 12 04 so there s still room to run lower on Monday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 29 AM EDT with ES down 0 05   ES had a great day last Friday handily confirming a double hammer pattern and popping right back up to its resistance at 2111  Indicators are all rising now and we have a completed bullish stochastic crossover so everything looks great   except that the overnight is drifting lower a bit   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot leaps from 2076 50 to 2102 00  And even with that jump ES is still above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish   Dollar index  Last Thursday night I wrote  this chart now look s  bullish for Friday   And it was  up another 0 16  on a bullish engulfing pattern  With rising indicators only recently off oversold  that makes the US Dollar Index look to continue higher for Monday   Euro  And last Thursday night I also wrote of the euro that some pretty persuasive stuff  adds up to lower on Friday   And that s just where the euro went  back down to 1 1210  And the selling doesn t appear to be over yet either with the euro down even more in the Sunday overnight  With falling indicators  a completed bearish stochastic crossover and three black crows  it looks like a lower close on Monday   Transportation  Like everything else the Trans was higher on Friday but unlike everything else it put in an inverted hammer sitting on its 200 day MA  We have rising indicators and a freshly minted bullish stochastic crossover but there is a note of caution here 

Often the day after a big run up the market takes a breather  That was certainly the case on December 19th after the Dow s last similar size gain as Friday s  So while there really aren t any bearish signs about  I m expecting something of a doji day on Monday and those are by definition uncallable  Therefore I simply have to declare Monday uncertain  I m not expecting a big move either way Single Stock TraderLast Thursday night I cautiously recommended Verizon Communications NYSE VZ  as a swing buy and it did indeed rise along with the rest of the Dow on Friday but it did it with a gap up doji that looks like 2 3 of an evening star  And though it also formed a bullish stochastic crossover it s enough of a reversal warning for me to go back to neutral on this one ",2015-05-11,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-uncertain-251244,251244

Recap  I was right last night in refusing to call the market higher despite a dearth of bearish signs  Turns out record high Dow resistance was too much for it this time sending stocks lower though a bit more than I d expected  Anyway  let s see how this sets up for Tuesday as yet another op ex week rumbles on   The technicals  The Dow  On Monday the Dow dropped 86 points stopping right about recent support at 18 110  But indicators are now nearly overbought   we closed at session lows  we ve bounced off the upper BB and the candle is real close to a dark cloud cover so I m not optimistic on this chart for Tuesday   The VIX  And the VIX on Monday began filling in Friday s huge gap down with a 7 7  advance establishing Friday s 1 286 close as new support  Indicators are only recently off overbought but the VIX may be wanting to do some more gap filling Tuesday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12  26 AM EDT with ES down 0 05   On Monday ES retraced about half of Friday s gains with a classic dark cloud cover  With indicators close to overbought that makes this chart look bearish again for Tuesday  The lack of enthusiasm in the overnight tends to support that view   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot ticks up from 2102 00 to 2102 33  ES is now below the new pivot so this indicator turns bearish   Dollar Index  Last night I wrote that  this chart look continued higher for Monday  and so it was  up another 0 20  but on a gap up little red spinning top  That s 2 3 of an evening star  It s still too early to call a move lower particularly since the indicators aren t yet overbought but I d definitely not be buying dollars at this point   Euro  And last night of the euro I also wrote  it looks like a lower close on Monday   And that was right too  leaving the euro now back down to 1 1161 with three black crows and a new descending RTC  But the euro seems to be finding some support it he overnight so I hesitate to call it lower again on Tuesday   Transportation  Last night I turned on the yellow caution light based on the inverted hammer and that was confirmed Monday as the Trans fell 0 14  on a second  taller inverted hammer  It also just exited a steep short rising RTC for a bearish setup  That all makes it look like there s still more downside left here 

Last night I wasn t sure the market could push past resistance but also didn t see much in the way of bearishness  Tonight I m even less sure the market can push past resistance but I m starting to see some bearish signs  So I m going to go ahead and call Tuesday lower  I ll be happy to be proven wrong Single Stock TraderAs I suspected last night  Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  came in on Monday completing a bearish evening star that trumped the bullish stochastic crossover  And I don t think it s done going down so still no buy call here ",2015-05-12,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-lower-251409,251409

Recap  I called Wednesday higher  though I apparently forgot to hit  publish  late Tuesday night so it didn t go out until noon on Wednesday  but no matter  the Dow 30 had a tiny range day and finished well inside the noise band with just an eight point loss  So let s move on to the day before op ex to figure out what if anything any of this means   The technicals  The Dow  After several large excursions both down and up the previous two days  the Dow did next to nothing on Wednesday in something that could be construed as a symmetrical triangle   or maybe not  I don t know if it s op ex week jitters or what but there are very few technical clues at least that I can see in this chart tonight  So no call here   The VIX  Last night I wrote that the VIX  looks bearish to me    And while it was in fact down  it was only 0 72  and on a green spinning top at that  We also just barely squeaked out a bullish stochastic crossover so I guess this one looks higher for Thursday but it s far from crystal clear   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are mixed at 12 10 AM EDT with ES up 0 04   ES had the day traders pulling their hair out Wednesday  going basically nowhere by the close  With two opposing dojis now   a hammer followed by an inverted hammer   where this goes next is anyone s guess  The overnight isn t helping either  basically going nowhere at the moment   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2091 75 to 2097 50  That gain plus a lackluster ES in the overnight now places it below the new pivot so this indicator turns bearish   Dollar index  Last night of the dollar I wrote that it  looks like lower again on Wednesday   And that s what happened  down a big 1 02  to form a bearish stochastic crossover even as RSI is oversold  With the lower BB  yet to be hit  this sort of bearish momentum is not to be toyed with  I d not go long the dollar here   Euro  And so also last night I wrote of the euro that  this chart looks higher Wednesday    And that s also just what happened as the euro popped right back to its resistance at 1 1365 for a bullish setup on a descending RTC exit  Indicators continue to rise but it s not clear the euro can clear this resistance   Transportation  And finally last night I wrote that it  all adds up to continued lower  and that s just where the Trans went on Wednesday  down a big 1 04  to close right on support and just short of the lower BB  That move forced the indicators way down  now just off oversold  So a reversal is looking likely based on S R lines but not on the candles just yet 

The market has been pretty conflicted all week long swinging one way and then the other with little to show for it in the end and the technicals reflect that  Against this backdrop there s little I can do so I will just have to call Thursday uncertain   Single Stock Trader  Last night I noted a possible reversal in Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  and it did in fact rise on Wednesday  though only by an anemic 11 cents and with a spinning top at that  That flattened out the indicators too so once again  I m not on board  I m still waiting for my preferred setup ",2015-05-14,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-uncertain-251710,251710

Recap  I didn t call last Friday just because it was op ex but based on the big gain from Thursday  the puny 20 point advance in the Dow was about what you d expect  So nothing ventured  nothing lost  Therefore  let s move on to the third full week of May and see if it s time to sell yet or not  So far that hasn t been a winner   The technicals  The Dow  Last Friday the Dow advanced a bit more but the candle was decidedly bearish   a hanging man and dark cloud cover combined sitting right on the upper BB with overbought indicators cross the board just short of resistance  That all spells lower in my book   The VIX  The VIX meanwhile broke its recent support to close at 12 38 on a gravestone doji with oversold indicators now on YTD support  I d have to guess that means higher next  It did the last time we say this  see 4 24 15    Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 42 AM EDT with ES down 0 07   ES had a little symmetric spinning top on Friday that just touched its upper BB  right at record highs  That a decent reversal warning and the Sunday overnight seems to be supporting that so I m not optimistic about Monday   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2109 25 to 2118 33  And that was enough to now put ES below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish   Dollar index  On Friday the only recently seemingly unstoppable dollar non confirmed Thursday s fake out doji with a tall bearish engulfing pattern for a 0 35  loss  That leaves the indicators still oversold but it also doesn t look like the bottom is in yet   Oh  and I should add for the benefit of everyone crying about the  strong dollar   I remember the days when a dollar was worth 360 yen and also more than four Swiss francs   and I m not that old  So don t tell me the dollar is so  strong    Euro  Meanwhile the euro continued its upward course after bottoming last month to close at 1 1442 on Friday and stopping right on YTD resistance  And that may have been a resistance too far as the overnight is now moving lower again and forming a bearish stochastic crossover to boot  So the euro might just close lower on Monday   Transportation  And finally on Friday the Trans confirmed Thursday s hammer with a nice nearly one percent advance  This tall green marubozu also gave us a bullish stochastic crossover and sent all the indicators higher  That all looks bullish to me for Monday 

Aside from the trans  the charts tonight seem to be looking rather negative  so I m just going to have to call Monday lower Single Stock TraderLast Thursday night I said that Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  was no longer a buy and that was true with an 18 cent drop on Friday on a bearish engulfing pattern  So tonight it s still not a buy ",2015-05-18,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-lower-252030,252030

Recap  Well Tuesday was probably the biggest snoozer of a record breaker in history  The Dow hit new highs but ended up just 14  What does it all mean for Wednesday  Let s check it out   The technicals  The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow continued to play tag with its upper BB  ending with a perfect spinning top  Add in an RSI that s still overbought but now off its peak and a fresh bearish stochastic crossover and I d say the Dow s next move is lower   The VIX  Last night I was leery of relying too much on the VIX and indeed on Tuesday once again we saw a VIX rise on a day when the Dow was higher too  Oddly enough we now have four red candles in a row for the VIX  We re still just off YTD support and the indicators are still oversold so I still have to think the VIX goes higher from here   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 1 12 AM EDT with ES up 0 04   After touching new highs on Tuesday and punching through its upper BB  ES fell back to end with a red spinning top and a reversal warning  Indicators are now quite overbought and we ve got a new bearish stochastic crossover  And with the overnight looking anemic I d guess the Wednesday s looking lower   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2122 33 to 2126 58  But that gain was enough to put ES back below its new pivot so this indicator goes back to bearish   Dollar index  Holy moly  after a decent gain on Monday the dollar just exploded on Tuesday with a giant skyrocket gap up 1 16  pop for a descending RTC bullish trigger  The recent downtrend is now dead  And indicators are still not overbought so more upside is possible  assuming the dollar doesn t want to take a rest after such a big move   Euro  And last night I wrote that the euro  looks lower again Tuesday   That was looking good as the euro took an even bigger dump than Monday to close at 1 1159m right on recent support  And the selling s still not over according to the overnight as the indicators are still nowhere near oversold  Look for support to fail on Wednesday and another lower close   Transportation  Here s some bearish divergence   on Tuesday the Trans was unable to capitalize on Monday s 200 day MA breakout  falling right back through it for a big 0 75  loss that erased all of Monday s gains  That looks quite bearish to me so I think the trans go lower on Wednesday 

It s feeling more like the dog days of August than the middle of May lately  I don t know if all the Byg Wygs have already helicoptered off to the Hamptons for next week s holiday or what but we ve now had three days of next to no action at all  And I m not expecting much different for the rest of the week  Technically things are looking just bearish enough for me to call Wednesday lower but I m not looking for any major moves   Single Stock Trader  Last night I said I still wasn t in on Verizon  NYSE VZ  and it lost another nickel on Tuesday  But this one was on a hammer with oversold RSI  The stochastic though made a bearish crossover so I m still not in ",2015-05-20,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-lower-252352,252352

Recap  I hope everyone had a safe and relaxing Memorial Day weekend as we took time out from our daily activities to honor those who gave their lives for our country  But now it s time to get back to work  We note a disappointing  Fed inspired decline last Friday and check the charts to see how that may affect this holiday shortened week   The technicals  The Dow  With three down days in a row and indicators only just now moving off overbought it looks like there s still more downside available here for Tuesday   The VIX  Meanwhile the VIX continues to hover just barely north of 12 near yearlong support  With a hammer on Friday and oversold indicators it looks primed for more upside   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 32 AM EDT with ES down 0 20   On Friday ES put in a dark cloud cover that started the indicators moving lower from an overbought peak  The overnight is confirming that so I d say this chart looks lower for Tuesday   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2125 00 to 2126 08  After falling below the old number ES remains well below the new pivot so this indicator turns bearish   Dollar index  The dollar took a huge pop on Friday with a big green bullish engulfing marubozu that took the indicators clear to overbought but still short of the upper BB  So in the absence of a bearish candle I d have to think the dollar could go higher again Tuesday   Euro  And the euro disconfirmed Thursday s bullish piercing pattern with another leg down on Friday  And with the Sunday overnight the gapping down huge  already to the lower BB at 1 0942 it looks like a lower close on Tuesday  though most of the damage is probably already done   Transportation  And finally here s an ominous sign   on Friday the Trans dropped a big 0 81   far more than the rest of the market  And they gave away support at 8802 with indicators hovering just above a lower BB that s now dropping away  That all looks fairly negative in my book 

The first day after a long weekend holiday is always problematic to call  However  tonight the charts are all pretty much in agreement and the verdict is bearish so I m calling Tuesday lower Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications  NYSE VZ  got caught up in the general negativity on Friday and moved lower  With two inverted hammers in a row and indicators no longer oversold this stock is no longer a swing buy ",2015-05-26,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-lower-252862,252862

Recap  So let s see   Sunday night I said the market would go higher on Monday  so it went lower  Then Monday night I said it would go lower on Tuesday   so it went higher  Grrr  This is getting ridiculous  At least one thing I do know   Wednesday is a Fed day and it is my policy to always call these days as uncertain  so that s what I m going to do  Accordingly  we ll skip the detailed chart run down tonight as there s no point to it  Less for me to write  less for you to read   The technicals  ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2108 25 to 2104 25  That still leaves ES above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 

The general expectation seems to be that the Fed isn t going to say anything on Wednesday we haven t already heard and I completely agree with that  A June rate hike in particular looks completely off the table  Still you never can tell  so I m just calling Wednesday uncertain Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  has bee climbing its upper BB  for four days now  It can keep doing that for all I care   that is not a buy signal  Not in anybody s book that I know of  So we just let this one slide for now ",2015-04-29,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-uncertain-249988,249988

Recap  Well that was sure a non event  The Fed announcement at 2 PM Wednesday wasn t even the biggest mover of the day  And when all was said and done the Dow ended down 75 points marking the fourth up down daily alternation in a row  I ll be really happy to see the end of April so let s just see what Thursday has in store   The technicals  The Dow  The Dow on Wednesday put in its seventh reversal warning in a row   with no reversal happening  This is getting to be rather frustrating  This time we got a second hanging man in a row  We have overbought indicators and a bearish stochastic crossover but none of that has been working all month  Will the end of April be any different   The VIX  On Wednesday the VIX put in a textbook classic long legged doji star above Tuesday s decline  So with the VIX only now just off oversold we at least have a warning of a move lower but not a good one  At the risk of sounding like a broken record  this requires confirmation   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 16 AM EDT with ES down 0 05   ES put in its fourth day in a row of alternating gains and losses on Wednesday though each day featured lower highs and lower lows  That s got the indicators finally off overbought though it also dropped ES out of its rising RTC for a bearish setup  All in all this chart looks more negative than positive a the moment   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2104 25 to 2100 67  That still leaves ES below its new pivot so this indicator turns bearish from last night   Dollar index  The dollar is now in a downtrend apparent even to Stevie Wonder  falling all the way back on Wednesday to where it was on February 26th as it continues to cascade down its lower BB   Indicators are now majorly oversold with RSI at 1 52  its lowest level since September 18  2013  But note that back then there was still another whole month of downside to come  So is this the end of the current downtrend  Can t say just yet  This is one falling knife I ll take a pass on   Euro  Meanwhile  the euro had a great day  closing at 1 1118  punching right up through its upper BB for its best close since March 4th  But the indicators are now massively overbought  RSI just hit 100   it doesn t go any higher than that  That all makes the euro look ripe for some profit taking on Thursday  Just look at the chart   would you rather be buying here or selling here  QED   Transportation  The Trans got hit hard on Wednesday  down triple to loss of the Dow and saved only by their 200 day MA  The indicators are now off overbought and the last time we were here the trans rebounded the next day  But that s a crap shoot at this point  I can t call this one 

I m so tired of being wrong essentially all month long I just want to call Thursday uncertain  But the preponderance of technical evidence looks bearish so I guess I ll just close my eyes and call Thursday lower Single Stock TraderWell Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  finally put an end to a six day winning streak proving that the longer it goes on the less likely you need to get on board  And with a perfect doji star sitting on its upper BB we have a good sign of a move lower next  I d not buy here ",2015-04-30,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-lower-250144,250144

Recap  After two days of ugly losses to end April it was gratifying to see my call for a higher start for May last Friday come true  Of course May is always tricky but we have some tricks of our own up our sleeves so let s check those charts and figure out which way Monday s headed   The technicals  The Dow  On Friday the Dow gave us a big inside harami and a stochastic that s curving around for a bullish crossover and sent all the indicators higher  It requires confirmation but this might be a sign of a move higher   The VIX  Last Thursday night I noted that this VIX touching its upper BB  was  a reversal sign worth watching    And indeed it was as the VIX dropped a big 12 71  on Friday  The double touch of the 200 day MA and the upper BB is always a good sign of a move lower   But even that didn t form a bearish stochastic crossover and the indicators are still a long way from oversold so there s still room to run lower here   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 54 AM EDT with ES down 0 06   ES did well on Friday with a bullish one white soldier that was enough to set up a bullish stochastic crossover too  thought that is now in jeopardy from the slight overnight sag we re getting  So this chart is only weakly bullish at this point   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot jumps from 2083 75 to 2094 83  That now puts ES back above its new pivot so this indicator turns bullish   Dollar index  Last Thursday night I wrote  I d have to hazard that the next move is higher    Good guess too because on Friday the dollar snapped a six day losing streak to pop out of its steep descending RTC  We remain quite oversold so there s plenty of room to run higher here   Euro  And last Thursday night I also wrote of the euro   This one looks ripe for a fall any day now   Ad the very next day the euro fell back to 1 1198 on a bearish inverted hammer harami to break a seven day winning streak  It s still in a rising RTC  just barely  but indicators have now peaked at overbought and the overnight is guiding lower so I d say it looks good for a lower close Monday   Transportation  The DTrans had a great day Friday up 1 68  on a backwards bullish piercing pattern that punched through their 200 day MA  sent the indicators higher after hitting oversold and curved the stochastic around in preparation for a bullish crossover  That all makes this chart look bullish 

The overall tenor of the charts is mildly bullish so I guess I m just going to have to call Monday higher  but more in the absence of any clear bearish signs than the presence of bullish ones  Monday could be a doji day Single Stock TraderAfter two matching stars Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  finally put in a clear bearish signal on Friday with a tall hanging man and a stochastic moving lower  This one looks ready to fall again Monday ",2015-05-04,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-higher-250485,250485

Recap  Last night I opined that  Monday could be a doji day    That certainly seems to have been the case as the Dow rose 46 points on an inverted hammer  It s an interesting pattern so let s take a closer look  chartwise   The technicals  The Dow  OK  so the inverted hammer is one thing but we also got a completed bullish stochastic crossover around levels from which the market has then proceeded higher  But we did nearly touch the upper BB   so I m going to say that s a wash and we re just waiting to see which side of the fence this one s coming down on   The VIX  The VIX had one of those odd days where it gained 1 18  Monday but on a red candle  Last night I thought we d move lower but Monday s candle still makes me think that  especially now that we ve got a bearish stochastic crossover going   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 37 AM EDT with ES down 0 07   ES had a decent day on Monday  pushing right up to its record resistance before falling back a bit  But that leaves the indicators in disarray  with money flow and the stochastic rising but RSI and momentum falling  That makes this chart too tough for me tonight   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2094 83 to 2107 42  That leaves us in the rare position of ES sitting right on top of its new pivot therefore this indicator is mum tonight  neither bullish nor bearish   Dollar index  Last night I wrote of the dollar   there s plenty of room to run higher here    And so it did  up another 0 20  Monday to trade outside its descending RTC for a bullish trigger  It s a small hanging man but with indicators still oversold I d say more upside isn t out of the question here   Euro  And the euro similarly fell on Monday  down to 1 1145 just outside its rising RTC for a bearish setup  With a completed bearish stochastic crossover  indicators still overbought but now falling and an overnight move lower  I d say the euro s closing lower on Tuesday   Transportation  On Monday the Trans put in a giant gap up evening star but also completed a bullish stochastic crossover  Eh  Ya got me there  pal  I don t know what that s all about 

Tonight we re seeing some conflicting signs in the charts and that s reflected in ES which is sitting right on its new pivot  So that sounds like a perfect chance to make a conditional call  if ES breaks above its pivot and remains there by mid morning Tuesday  we close higher  If it falls off below the pivot  we close lower Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  stubbornly refuses to fall but still only managed a meager 11 cent gain on Monday with yet another reversal warning candle  So basically nothing s changed and we just continue to wait for a suitable entry point ",2015-05-05,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-depends-on-es-pivot-250625,250625

Recap  My mom once told me that if you don t have anything nice to say about someone  don t say anything at all  That s something Auntie Janet should have remembered when she bad mouthed Mr  Market Wednesday morning which sent him into a triple point snit  A late afternoon rally helped to assuage his feelings only a little and the Dow still finished off 86  taking my call for a higher close with it  Oh that and some crummy ADP numbers  This was one of those days when the news trumped the technicals  Not much I can do about that  Let s finish off the week now and figure out Friday   The technicals  The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow had its one minute of glory right out the gate and then that was that   though it did manage to avoid ending at session lows  So technically this is quite bearish with a clear break under week long congestion  Indicators are now off overbought but not yet to oversold so it s too soon to call a reversal higher   The VIX  Last night I wrote  there seems to be enough gas in the tank for another leg higher on Tuesday   And whadaya know  that s just what happened with the VIX  up 5 87  on Wednesday  Interestingly though  it tried punching through its 200 day MA but fell back to close right on it  More often than not though these failed breakout attempts end up succeeding the next day so I d not be surprised to see the VIX go one more day higher  especially since the indicators are still not overbought   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 15 AM EDT with ES up 0 07   On Wednesday ES put in a hammer that pierced its lower BB  and left the indicators just short of oversold  This is a fair reversal indicator and ES seems to be finding some support in the overnight   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2092 42 to 2076 42  That now leaves ES sitting right on its new pivot for the second time in the past week so this indicator is mum tonight   Dollar index  The dollar had its biggest gap down on Wednesday since April 15th confirming Tuesday s bearish engulfing pattern  And I said as much last night  though I wasn t expecting this big a decline  We ve now touched the lower BB but with it falling away it s not clear a bounce off it is imminent   Euro  I was wrong last night in thinking the euro would continue consolidating  It shot up to 1 1357 on Wednesday and despite overbought indicators the trend seems to have resumed higher   Transportation  The Trans found support around 8600 on Wednesday and ended with a slight gain on a doji star that with oversold indicators is a decent reversal sign  I d say there s more upside potential than downside risk at the moment 

Tonight we re seeing a variety of reversal signs but they require confirmation  The fact that ES is sitting on its new pivot supports the lack of directions here so I m going to do another conditional call  if ES breaks above its new pivot by mid morning Thursday  we close higher  But if it breaks to the downside and stays there  we close lower Single Stock TraderAt least I was right when last night I wrote of Verizon  NYSE VZ    I expect more selling   And that  just what we got on Wednesday with another nice 79 cent drop  That was the payoff on the bearish engulfing pattern  The indicators continue to fall and we re still not at buyable levels but we re  finally  getting closer  The 200 day MA is at 48 99  call it 49  so I wouldn t feel bad at putting in a buy limit there ",2015-05-07,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-depends-on-es-pivot-250926,250926

Recap  Though my official call was uncertain I did last night express my bias to the downside and that s where the Dow went to close out the quarter  off 200 points  We now look ahead to April  no fooling   The technicals  The Dow  The primary effect of Tuesday s downturn was to stunt what looked like the beginning of another cycle up as RSI turned lower and the stochastic s bullish crossover flattened out  And the candle is a bearish harami so Wednesday s not looking all that promising right now   The VIX  I was wrong about the VIX last night  The hammer prevailed and the VIX moved higher Tuesday despite being overbought  on a bullish setup from a descending RTC exit punching back up through its 200 day MA That now becomes support  though the candle was a spinning top indicating a lack of conviction here   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 27 AM EDT with S P 500 down 0 79   On Tuesday ES was unable to capitalize on Monday s gains and in fact put in a bearish harami  And the decline in the overnight has just canceled Monday s bullish stochastic crossover  turning it into a bearish one from a low level  These are rare events and generally not good   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls from 2068 17 to 2064 58  That now puts ES below the new pivot and so this indicator turns bearish   Dollar index  It was good I waited for confirmation of Monday s suspected evening star since it didn t come  Instead the dollar gapped up again and put in yet another star leaving us right back where we were  once again needing confirmation before making any calls  One thing s clear   we re now in a new rising RTC   Euro  And similarly the euro remains in a descending RTC  closing back down to 1 0754 on Tuesday  We didn t reach parity in March but that s still on the table for sometime this year   Transportation  The Trans mirrored the Dow on Tuesday so they re not looking so hot either right now 

April is generally bullish and the first day of April is traditionally quite bullish  But right now that s about the only thing it s got going for it  The futures are looking fairly ugly in the overnight  no doubt on late news that the Iran nuke talks are on the rocks  and the rest of the charts are indecisive at best  So despite it being the first  I m going to have to call Wednesday lower  Perhaps I will be Fooled Single Stock TraderI was a bit surprised to see Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  drop right back through its 200 day MA on Tuesday  Chalk it up to end of quarter shenanigans I guess  It does call into question whether VZ has the chops to put in a further advance so I m going to hold off on this one for now ",2015-04-01,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-lower-246943,246943

Recap  Ha  April couldn t fool the Night Owl as the market defied history and moved lower on Wednesday just like I said it would last night  Now let us atone for that little bit of hubris by attempting to figure out whither Thursday   The technicals  The Dow  On April Fool s the Dow dug itself a deep hole early on and then spent the rest of the day trying to climb back out but didn t quite make it  The result was a nice hammer that  with oversold indicators  suggests a move higher on Thursday   The VIX  In a highly unusual move  on Wednesday the VIX not only fell on a day the rest of the market did too but it put in a giant inverted hammer propped up by its 200 day MA  With the momentum downward and overbought indicators  I d say the next move here is lower again   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 19 AM EDT with ES down 0 11   ES gapped down on Wednesday but put in a tomahawk  my name for a hammer that has a bit of an upper shadow sticking out   Indicators remain oversold and support at 2049 held nicely so there is a possible reversal higher here though the overnight action doesn t really support that idea   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot fives from 2064 58 to 2049 08  Thanks entirely to the size of that drop  ES is now back above the new pivot so this indicator  for what it s worth  now turns bullish   Dollar index  We ve been pondering evening stars for the dollar for two nights now and on Wednesday got a result with the dollar losing 0 19  on a gap down spinning top to complete a bearish evening star  With indicators overbought and a stochastic about to form a bearish crossover I d say the dollar is looking lower on Thursday   Euro  The euro managed a gain on Wednesday but it was a stubby green spinning top at the lower end of Tuesday s big plunge so the latest downtrend remains intact  Calling the euro higher remains risky business  one I m not undertaking right now   Transportation  And finally the Trans were hammered again on Wednesday  They made a test  successful  of the 200 day MA to end with a 0 79  loss and a fat hammer  With oversold indicators this is a half decent reversal sign  though one that requires confirmation 

Meh   the charts seem a bit jittery to me tonight and I m not getting a good read on them  We have a number of reversal signs but they all require confirmation  So in the absence of a definitive read one way or the other I guess all that leaves is for me to call Thursday uncertain Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  redeemed itself on April 1st with a nice bullish piercing pattern  So although we now have three descending candles  this one looks ready to move higher ",2015-04-02,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-uncertain-247092,247092

Recap  With a holiday shortened week last week and a low volume day last Thursday  tonight the charts are more mumbling than talking to me  I don t like calling Mondays in general because of the intervening two days off  Friday holiday weeks just make that problem harder  I also don t like working off three day old charts so I m going to omit the chart details tonight  We ll resume the usual run down on Monday night  The technicals  Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 19 AM EDT with ES down 0 69   Most of that decline came early on Friday s rump session just before the market closed  There s been a bit of a drift higher in the Sunday overnight but it doesn t convince me   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot falls again from 2058 57 to 2053 75  We re now below the new pivot so this indicator turns bearish 

Historically the Monday after Easter is weak according to the Stock Traders Almanac and I don t see anything tonight that would contradict that so I m just going to call Monday lower Single Stock TraderLast Wednesday night of Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  I wrote  this one looks ready to move higher   And that s just what it did on Thursday  up 55 cents to punch right through its 200 day MA  So with indicators sill moving towards overbought and the upper BB  not til 50 02  I d say there s more upside left here on Monday ",2015-04-06,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-lower-247395,247395

Recap  Well that was interesting  Last night I spent the entire evening figuring out a nasty issue with my PC instead of studying the markets  I rebooted because it had been an entire month and things were getting pretty slow  but after that I discovered I couldn t open any programs  I d click on an icon and nothing would happen  It took me a long time to realize that something w happening after all  it was just really s l o w  like 20 minutes to start a program  Complicating matters was the fact that I couldn t do a System Restore   that was 100  fail  Finally I figured out that a recent upgrade to ZoneAlarm was the culprit  I uninstalled that and then life was good again  Freakin computers   Anyway we re back baby  so let s see if we can now do some real work instead of wasting time on that nonsense   The technicals  The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow put in a rare classic gravestone doji  With indicators nearly overbought  I d say this is a good sign of lower to come   The VIX  And contrariwise  on Tuesday the VIX rose a scant 0 27  on a nice hammer stopping just under its 200 day MA  Indicators are closing in on oversold so this is a decent sign of a move higher next  though one that requires confirmation   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are completely unchanged at 12 18 AM EDT with ES  NQ  and YM all dead even  ES did some retracing Tuesday of Monday s big gain with a bearish inverted hammer  The indicators are all over the place  some rising  some falling  and OBV continues to be a concern  now running at negative 3M  Overall though  this chart is too tough to call  It happens sometimes   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2064 00 to 2072 17  That move now leaves ES below the new pivot so this indicator is bearish   Dollar index  On Tuesday the dollar completed a bullish morning star with a big 1 12  gap up  That was enough to cause the indicators to start rising again before even getting near oversold and cause the stochastic to start curving around for a bullish crossover from a high level  That all looks positive for Wednesday   Euro  Monday s doji star for the euro neatly telegraphed Tuesday s decline that brings us right back to 1 0839 and a fresh bearish stochastic crossover  There s something of a rally going on in the overnight but I think the daily outlook for Wednesday is lower   Transportation  After breaking the 200 day MA two days ago on Tuesday the Trans gave us some bullish divergence by gaining 0 48  on a day the rest of the market was lower with an inverted hammer following a bottoming spinning top  With indicators rising but still not yet off oversold  this chart seems to have more room to run 

Note  I m not incrementing the counters for days when I wasn t able to put out a post    And the winner is      Hmm  I did a bit of hand wringing over this one but you know what I m seeing  A symmetrical triangle is developing in the Dow and it looks to be near completion so that would be bullish later this week  But it s not clear there isn t one more leg down coming  These nervous small range doji ish days don t give you much meat to chew on  I could just go ahead and call it lower but that would just be guessing so officially I m going to have to call Wednesday uncertain   Single Stock Trader  OK so let s get caught up here too  On Monday Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  put in a spinning top warning of an impending reversal  On Tuesday we got confirmation in a big way with a giant red bearish engulfing marubozu that stopped the indicators  climb just short of overbought  VZ is definitely not a buy on this chart ",2015-04-08,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-uncertain-247636,247636

Recap  I think I was right to call Wednesday uncertain since we finished with just a 27 point gain in the Dow on a spindly spinning top that continues to indicate indecision in the market  The Fed minutes didn t help much either  Some people want rate hike in June  some in September  and some not til 2016  Who knows  I have my hands full just worrying about the charts  So let s take a peek at them right now and see what s what   The technicals  The Dow  After a tall inverted hammer on Tuesday we got anther reversal candle on Wednesday in the Dow  With indicators now nearly overbought it looks like the Dow is signaling an impending move lower here   The VIX  For the second time in a week  the VIX has given us some divergence  this time falling significant 5 41  on a day the rest of the market rose That now makes four read candles out of five and three lower highs and lower lows in a row But indicators are still not yet oversold  I thought after yesterday s hammer we d see a move higher but I was wise enough to mention that this required confirmation   which we did not get  So now it s looking lower again until we see some sort of bottoming candle   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 12 AM EDT with ES down 0 06   On Wednesday  ES disconfirmed Tuesday s spinning top with a decent gain though it s still having trouble with resistance around 2077  Indicators are now near overbought so it s not clear there s enough gas in the tank to make much more headway on Thursday  And the overnight isn t showing much enthusiasm at this point either  ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises a tad from 2072 17 to 2073 58  That leaves ES above the new pivot but just barely so this indicator is now only weakly bullish  US Dollar Index  Last night I wrote of the dollar   a bunch of technical jargon  all looks positive for Wednesday    And whadaya know  the dollar rose with a big green candle belying the small 0 06  gain  This bullish engulfing pattern also gave us a bullish stochastic crossover so I d say it looks good for more upside on Thursday  Euro  Last week some idiot money manager at a place whose name I will not mention  except that their initials are Wells Fargo  told me that he couldn t predict the future and I couldn t either  Well as far as the euro on Wednesday goes  he was half right because last night I wrote  the daily outlook for Wednesday is lower    And just like that the euro took another leg down to close at 1 0808  OK  it was a spindly spinning top but the new overnight is disconfirming that and moving lower once again  Indicators are still a ways from oversold so I epect a retest of last month s lows at 1 0733 in short order  Transportation  After a decent 071  gain Wednesday the trans are now in a new rising RTC that stopped just short of their 200 day MA  But with a bullish trigger on a descending RTC exit  a bullish stochastic crossover and indicators still just barely off oversold there seems to be plenty of gas in the tank for another move higher Thursday 



Once again we have some sort of wishy washy charts that seem to be wanting to do something  only they re not quite sure what it is  Well that seems to call for another conditional call  if ES manages to remain above its new pivot by mid morning Thursday  we ll close higher  If on the other hand it drops below the pivot and stays there  we close lower Single Stock Trader Huh   I wasn t expecting Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  to claw its way back above its 200 day MA on Wednesday after opening below it  But it s still a bearish exit on the rising RTC and a bearish stochastic crossover  so I m still on getting on board at this point ",2015-04-09,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-depends-on-es-pivot-247797,247797

Recap  Well now that I can finally see again  what I see is that not much happened while I was gone  We ve had a three day run of up down up with the Dow ending just under where it was Friday afternoon  So let s just pick up where we left off and move on to Wednesday   The technicals  The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow put in some modest gains but this makes the third day of lower highs while the indicators continue overbought as we inch closer to the right edge of the current rising RTC  The Dow s looking kinda tired right now is all I can say   The VIX  A more decisive note came from the VIX though on Tuesday with a strong dark cloud cover good for a 1 94  decline  The indicators are only just off oversold but the candlestick case looks more compelling here and I d not be surprised to see the VIX lower on Wednesday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are slightly lower at 12 11 AM EDT with ES down 0 05   Despite ES s green hammer on Tuesday the overbought indicators and bearish stochastic crossover make this chart look bearish for Wednesday  The lack of any positive movement in the overnight supports this theory   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot drops from 2091 00 to 2086 50  That puts ES back above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish   Dollar index  On Friday the dollar looked to be setting up a bearish evening star  Well it took one extra day but the payoff came Tuesday with a big 0 83  fall to drop right out of the rising RTC for a bearish setup and a bearish stochastic crossover  That s enough for me   I say the dollar goes lower again Wednesday   Euro  And you can just mirror image all of the above for the euro  Looks higher on Wednesday after bouncing off its lower BB   Transportation  On Tuesday the trannies put in a very tall hammer for a small 0 10  loss on a successful test of the 200 day MA  But this was also arising RTC exit for a bearish setup and a bearish stochastic crossover  So we have conflicting indicators here but overall I m going to guess there s more downside to come 

The overall impression tonight is bearish so I m just going to have to call Wednesday lower Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications  NYSE VZ  continues to be haunted by indecision with Tuesday s doji star the latest example  Propped up only by its 200 day MA  I still can t get on board this bus  These trades are only for when all the stars align  and so far they re not ",2015-04-15,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-lower-248464,248464

Recap  Oh great  Sometimes I get on these wrong streaks and this is one of them  I called Wednesday lower so of course it went higher  Perhaps I did not give enough credence to the futures and the VIX  Well we won t make that mistake again  at least not soon  So let s see what lessons we an apply here for Thursday   The technicals  The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow completely ignored a bearish harami and overbought indicators to gain another 76 points  That keeps the rising RTC intact and to heck with the indicators which are now all broken at overbought  The next key point is the upper BB at 18 215 and I expect to touch that on Thursday   The VIX  At least I was right last night when I wrote  I d not be surprised to see the VIX lower on Wednesday   That dark cloud cover yielded a 6  drop on Wednesday  With two black crows cawing away now we see the lower BB and support both at 12 37 next up and I expect to hit them on Thursday   could be a bottoming day   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12  10 AM EDT with ES up 0 10   ES had a nice day on Wednesday climbing back to resistance around 2100  Indicators are all way overbought but broken at these levels  There s new resistance at 2107 and then the upper BB  at 2111 but after being so overbought for a week now  does ES have to mojo to reach that  The overnight pin action seems to suggest it might   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2086 50 to 2097 50  That still leaves ES above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish   Dollar index  Well I was right about this one too last night when I wrote  I say the dollar goes lower again Wednesday   And down we went  off another 0 42   That s two black crows  a bearish trigger on a rising RTC exit and a completed bearish stochastic crossover  And that all spells lower again in my book   Euro  Meanwhile the euro continued its bounce Monday off its lower BB with another gain Wednesday  It was a hanging man but the new overnight seems to be dis confirming that and with indicators still only just barely off oversold  there seems to be plenty of room to run as the Parityville Express suddenly moves into reverse   Transportation  Whoa   the Trans has been positively psychopathic the past few days  On Tuesday we got a giant hammer and on Wednesday we got an equally large inverted hammer  After a two day swing between 8586 and 8784  we finished nearly unchanged  What we did get was a bearish RTC trigger  overbought indicators and a bearish stochastic crossover  Hey  I can t be wrong forever and technically this spells lower to me 

I ve been finding this choppy action lately tough to deal with but I guess we ll take another stab at it  With a more or less general uptrend in place and in the absence of any topping candles or negativity from the futures  I guess I ll just go ahead and call Thursday higher Single Stock TraderWith its stochastic having suddenly threaded out halfway between overbought and oversold  Verizon  NYSE VZ  is no longer oscillating nicely the way it had been all the way back to last December  This is definitely not my ideal swing trade setup  though that doesn t mean VZ couldn t continue to go higher from here ",2015-04-16,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-higher-248604,248604

Recap
In a model of understatement last Thursday night I wrote  the charts seem a bit negative tonight   And on Friday we got hammered across the board for whatever excuse you like  options expirations  the Chinese  the Iranians  and of course the ever popular Greeks  Despite a late afternoon rally attempt  some technical damage was done so let s take a look at that now as we begin a new week 
The technicals  The Dow  The Dow provided scant warning on Thursday in the form of a small doji star of its massive plunge on Friday when it dove right out of its rising RTC for a bearish setup off a rising RTC  It also gave us a fresh bearish stochastic crossover and sent the indicators right off overbought  That leaves this chart looking full on bearish  The only saving grace here is something of a tail int he lower shadow  That s the sort of thing we ve seen before reversals in the last two big dumps we ve gotten in the past month   The VIX  And on Friday the VIX took a big gap up 10  jump to nearly hit its 200 day MA but ending with almost a tall gravestone doji   It send the indicators off oversold but also qualifies as 2 3 of a bearish evening star  We ve seen this pattern before though and I d give better than even odds this one goes lower on Monday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 25 AM EDT with ES up a non trivial 0 40   This is a significant bounce off Friday s close and while that drop gave us a bearish setup on a rising RTC exit  the overnight seems to suggest a move higher on Monday   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dives from 2098 17 to 2085 92  That dump plus the rising overnight now puts ES back above the new pivot so this indicator turns bullish   Dollar index  On Friday the dollar gained 0 10  on a green bullish piercing pattern  Indicators have been falling for a while now and are nearly oversold so I d say the dollar is due for a bounce  maybe Monday but if not then then more likely Tuesday   Euro  The euro spent last week in a tight rising RTC but on Friday finally failed to make a higher high  closing at 1 0800  We re now back to overbought for the firs time in a month and the Sunday overnight while gapping higher is forming a red hanging man making me think there s a warning here of a move lower on Monday   Transportation  The Trans of course fell on Friday too though only half as much as the Dow  Still  they sliced right through their 200 day MA and sent the indicators off overbought and continued a bearish stochastic crossover  There s nothing bullish on this chart 

While we have now exited a two week long rising trend  I think that last Friday s action was somewhat overdone  When the traders all wake up Monday morning and discover that the sun is still rising in the east and the earth has not stopped turning  they may very well step in to pick up some bargains  That still leaves Tuesday in question but I think for now I m going to call Monday higher Single Stock TraderOn Friday Verizon  NYSE VZ  fell back under its 200 day MA with a perfect red gap down spinning top that also caused a bearish stochastic crossover and sent the other indicators lower too  This is what I ve been waiting for  I think there s still more downside to come but we re now getting ready for the next swing trade entry  probably sometime this week ",2015-04-20,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-higher-248942,248942

Recap
 The recent mean reversion sort of action we ve been seeing after big gains the past few days asserted itself again on Thursday and trumped my call for a higher close  I even mentioned it when I wrote  Ordinarily I d say that after such a sudden large one day move we d be due for a pause    Too bad I didn t stand by it  Oh well   one more day to go and this crazy week is done The TechnicalsThe Dow  The Dow has alternated up and down in an odd sort of stair step rise that has consistently dragged the indicators higher  On that alone there s not much to go by  The only thing I see that s cause for concern is the stochastic which has now flattened out in preparation for a bearish crossover  I d be cautious here on Friday The VIX  The VIX yesterday moved just 0 72  higher on a day the Dow fell triple digits in a sort of bullish divergence  unable to break back above its 200 day MA  Nevertheless we are now oversold so it s reasonable to assume the next VIX trend will be higher Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12 00 AM EDT with ES up 0 11  On Thursday  ES put in a vague approximation of a dark cloud cover along with sending indicators overbought  The stochastic is primed for a bearish crossover so despite a small run up in the late evening hours  this chart has at least the suggestion of a reversal ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose from 2089 58 to 2094 25   That s enough to put ES back below the new pivot so this indicator now turns bearish  Dollar index  The dollar on Thursday recouped about 2 3 of its losses from Wednesday in a move that sent the indicators off overbought  That still leaves us in an official descending RTC though  the first downtrend I ve seen here since last October  What does this mean for the market  Hard to say   the dollar has seemingly decoupled from the stock market lately  It s also still not clear that the current trend means anything in a larger monthly context Euro  The euro by contrast advanced nicely on Thursday to close at 1 0753 but it appeared last night like it was giving it all back  suggesting that the action of the last three days was nothing more than a multi day fake out Transportation  The trans were completely unchanged Thursday after a long legged doji that coupled with highly overbought indicators and a stochastic just inches away from a bearish crossover all suggest a move lower today  Friday 

There are some indications of a move lower for Friday but they generally require confirmation  But with this being a triple witching day with no doubt all the usual accompanying gyrations  my usual policy is to stay away  So I m just calling Friday uncertain  Single Stock TraderAt least I was correct in staying away from Verizon Communications yesterday  NYSE VZ  which moved a bit lower Thursday and is now hovering just above its 200 day MA  With a spinning top  overbought indicators  and a stochastic that just formed a bearish crossover  I d say there s more downside coming for VZ ",2015-03-20,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-uncertain-245651,245651

Recap
 Well Friday proved to be entertaining enough with a big pop out the gate and then a nice ballistic arc to finish off the day in style  And the up down see saw continued  making now eight straight days of alternating gains and losses  and 12 of the last 13  Anyway  now that we ve got the Fed follies and the triple witching worries out of the way for a while  perhaps we can get back to some more predictable market action  So let s get right to it and figure out where today  Monday  is headed 
 The Technicals
 The Dow  The Dow remains in a bizarre stair step uptrend  The indicators still aren t quite yet overbought but based on recent history  you d have to go with a move lower on Monday  It s been a sure thing for seven in a row   The VIX  Now here at least we have a slightly more rational chart  On Friday the VIX gapped down 7 46  nearly touching its lower BB  with the tail of a hammer  With oversold indicators there s a good suggestion of a move higher form here but one which requires confirmation on Monday   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were higher at 12 41 AM EDT with ES up 0 17   On Friday ES had a nice day putting in a bullish engulfing candle but still unable to make any headway past YTD resistance at 2102  Indicators are now overbought but the stochastic has threaded out and thus lost its predictive powers  or mojo as we like to say   But ES seems intent on scouting out the record territory here so it s a bit premature to call it lower   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2085 67 to 2094 58  ES remains above its new pivot so this indicator turns bullish  We are now running the  M  contract   Dollar index  On Friday the dollar continued its recent decline with a big 1 42  decline  The daily rising RTC is now clearly down  But moving out to the monthly chart we see a big developing inverted hammer with a stochastic that has just formed a bearish crossover  I m starting to wonder if maybe the dollar has seen its top right around the 2009 highs  Hey monthly RSI is at 100 now  There s nowhere to go but down from there   Euro  Meanwhile it looks like my call for the euro to pull into the Parityville station by the end of the month was derailed as someone threw a switch that sent the euro higher last week  We ve now the shortest descending RTC and the daily indicators are not yet overbought so there could still be some more upside left there   Transportation  The trans were giving out a reversal signal Thursday night with a doji star but that was rejected Friday in a big way with a 0 32  gain to keep the rising RTC intact  That leaves the indicators overbought but no bearish signs left   just resistance around 9179  And it seems like we ll be headed that way in a day or two 

According to the Stock Traders Almanac  the Dow is up seven of the last 11 following March triple witching  We also remain in an uptrend  albeit an on again off again one and the futures were higher in the overnight  And the  ARCA TLT  is looking toppy  and copper recently bottomed which implies higher stocks  But the VIX looks getting ready to move higher which implies lower stocks  What to do Overall I think I m going to have to go with the bull case so with a fair amount of trepidation and going way out on a limb  I m calling Monday higher Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications  NYSE VZ  managed to advance last Friday but until I see its RSI and stochastic scraping the bottom and not bumping against the ceiling  I m not getting on board ",2015-03-23,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-higher-245848,245848

Recap  Things were looking great for my call for a higher close Monday   until the Dow fell off a cliff in the very last minutes of the session to end down 10 points  What the heck  Oh well   it almost worked out  Now let s see how that changes the picture for Tuesday   The technicals  The Dow  The Dow s last second dive resulted in a tall inverted hammer that looks quite bearish when combined with indicators turning lower just before reaching overbought and a stochastic on the brink of a bearish crossover   The VIX  Last night I wrote  there s a good suggestion of a move higher from here  so at least I got that right as the VIX gained 3  on Monday  Indicators have bottomed and the stochastic is primed for a bullish crossover so this one looks higher again on Tuesday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 25 AM EDT with ES up 0 05   ES had its own tall inverted hammer on Monday and is back to overbought but remains in a rising RTC  And it does seem to be trying to rally in the overnight  so this one is too tough to call right now   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2094 58 to 2098 33  And that was enough to put ES back below the new pivot so this indicator is now bearish    Dollar index  After a meteoric rise last month  the dollar is now putting in an equally spectacular fall  gapping down 0 89  on Monday in what now looks like an exponential crash  The indicators are finally oversold but the stochastic is not yet ready for a bullish crossover so we might still have some more downside left here  But with this waterfall curve  it looks like a blow off that is close to completion   Euro  And the euro had a big day Monday gapping back up to 1 0954  But it is now overbought and the overnight is moving lower again  But remaining in a rising RTC  we need confirmation before calling this one lower for Tuesday   Transportation  Big bearish divergence here as the Trans was slaughtered on Monday  down nearly two percent for their worst day since January 30th  That sent the indicators way off overbought and completed a bearish stochastic crossover  And with the lower BB  still far away  this chart doe not look good for Tuesday 

With a close call on Monday and ES close to its pivot I m going to do yet another conditional call  if ES stays below its pivot by mid morning Tuesday  we close lower  but if it breaks above the pivot and stays there by mid morning  we close higher Single Stock TraderWith a red hanging man and overbought indicators  VZ is looking fairly toppy tonight  No way I m buying it here ",2015-03-24,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-depends-on-es-pivot-246001,246001

Recap  Yow  I m sure glad I called Wednesday lower as the Dow tumbled 293 on some bad economic news  That leaves the charts at an interesting junction so let s put them on the 5 15 to Glendale and see where they get off   The technicals  The Dow  Even this big fall for the Dow wasn t enough to send the indicators oversold  The lower BB  would seem to be the next logical destination at 17 719 and I think that s where we re headed   The VIX  Last night I wrote of the VIX that   a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo  all adds up to a move higher on Wednesday  and wouldn t you know it  the VIX popped over 13  on a tall green marubozu that punched right through the 200 day MA  completed the bullish stochastic crossover and sent all the indicators rising off oversold  With this kind of steam behind it  more upside is not out of the question   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are slightly lower at 12 22 AM EDT with ES down just 0 02   ES fell right out of its rising RTC Wednesday for a bearish setup and its indicators also fell to nearly oversold levels  But we re still not near the lower BB at 2029 18 and in four of the last five big  sudden drops ES has had  it didn t reverse until it touched the BB  I m expecting the same thing here   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dives from 2089 67 to 2065 08  And even with that we remain well below the new pivot so this indicator continues bearish   Dollar Index  The dollar continued its sell off on Wednesday down another 0 24  but putting in a hammer and its second green candle in a row  That  plus oversold indicators and a stochastic about to form a bullish crossover  suggest that a reversal is at hand  Like I said last night  I still think the dollar moves higher by the end of the week   Euro  And similarly  the euro s recent rally appears to be running out of steam in the 1 0986 neighborhood and with overbought indicators and a stochastic about to form a bearish crossover  I d look for lower here soon   Transportation  The Trans was hit even harder than the Dow on Wednesday  down just over 2  on a red marubozu that s nearing the 200 day MA at 8642  Indicators have gone oversold but the stochastic is not yet forming up for a bullish crossover  so I think we could hit the lower BB  which coincidentally is also a support line  on Thursday 

I d love to be proven wrong since I m always net long but I m just not feeling the love from thee charts tonight so I m just going to have to call Thursday lower again Single Stock TraderI called Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  lower last night and it was  right back through its 200 day MA with falling indicators and a full blown bearish stochastic running  I think the selling is not done here yet ",2015-03-26,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-lower-246293,246293

Recap  Looks like everyone was worn out after a few exciting days last week as the Dow put in a relatively sedate session Friday with a range of only double digits for a change  Made for some interesting patterns too  And it should be an interesting week coming up as we end the quarter and it being a new month  so let s get right to it on this Sunday night   The technicals  The Dow  The Dow spent much of Friday trading in a tiny range propped up by its daily pivot  The net result was a bullish piercing line which left the indicators oversold  curved the stochastic around in preparation for a bullish crossover  and left us near the edge of the descending RTC  With another reversal candle last Thursday that bounced off the lower BB   this chart looks ready to move higher Monday   The VIX  Last Thursday I also pointed to a reversal sign in the VIX and that came to be with a 4 62  decline on Friday to complete a bearish evening star  The VIX is now nearly overbought having bounced off its upper BB and propped up only by its 200 day MA  With indicators much closer to overbought than oversold  it looks like it could go lower again on Monday   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 16 AM EDT with ES up 0 38  On Friday ES put in a green spinning top harami with oversold indicators and a stochastic about to make q bullish crossover  The overnight is now outside the descending RTC for a bullish setup but oddly is also moving lower   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2046 83 to 2050 42  That keeps ES above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish   Dollar index  Well the dollar fooled me  Last Thursday night I thought it was looking higher on Friday  Instead it dropped 0 17   perhaps in a simple mean reversion after Thursday s big gain  In any case we remain oversold and have just exited a descending RTC for a bullish setup so I have to once again think the dollar goes higher on Monday   Euro  Similarly my call for a lower euro didn t work either on Friday but the resulting spinning top at overbought levels hanging right on the edge of the rising RTC makes me think the euro s going lower on Monday  That theory is supported by the overnight action  headed non trivially lower   Transportation  On Friday the Trans put in a bullish piercing pattern good for a 0 24  gain that snapped a four day losing streak and formed a new bullish stochastic crossover  After bouncing off their 200 day MA last Thursday and with now oversold indicators this chart looks ready to move higher on Monday 

Tonight the charts are generally bullish so the clear technical call is for Monday higher   Single Stock Trader  Last Thursday night I said Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  might be nearing a reversal and that s now looking more likely with a green spinning top harami on Friday that left the indicators oversold  brought the stochastic down into the region form whence bullish crossovers come and send OBV higher for the first time in a week  We just need a bullish RTC exit to sound the all clear  In the meantime  I d say it s now a buy for the adventurous ",2015-03-30,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-higher-246643,246643

Recap  Yup  Monday was one of those days where the technicals asserted themselves in a big way  Everything looked bullish last night and pow zoom  up we went right out of the gate 264 Dow points just like that  Now let s see if Tuesday will be that easy  I kinda doubt it    The technicals  The Dow  If you missed the first five minutes of Monday morning  you also missed most of the day s gains  it was over that fast  The resulting tall green marubozu shot out of the descending RTC for a bullish setup and completed a bullish stochastic crossover while sending all the indicators higher  though still just barely oversold  This all looks continued bullish   The VIX  Last night I wrote of the VIX   it looks like it could go lower again on Monday   And indeed it fell another 3 72  to gap right down through its 200 day MA and form a new bearish stochastic crossover  The candle though is a hammer but the overall momentum suggests lower to come   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 15 AM EDT with ES down 0 14   ES had a great day Monday  blasting out of its descending RTC for a bullish setup and neatly completing a bullish stochastic crossover  My only worry here is the tendency of ES to retrace after big one day gains  and the overnight sag isn t helping matters any   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises again from 2050 42 to 2068 17  We remain above the new pivot so this indicator remains bullish  though not quite so much as before  Dollar index  Last night I wrote  I have to once again think the dollar goes higher on Monday  and it was good thinking because the dollar took an Olympic high jump sized gap up 0 78  in a move that nicely completed its bullish stochastic crossover and provided a bullish trigger on the descending RTC exit  The month long downtrend is now officially over  Only caveat here is that the pattern is now 2 3 of an evening star  So we need to wait for confirmation Tuesday to see if that is confirmed or not   Euro  And last night I also wrote   I  think the euro s going lower on Monday   And hey presto  down it went  to close at 1 0834  a level not seen in a whole week  With the indicators all falling towards oversold  a bearish stochastic is full effect and a bearish trigger on a rising RTC exit this chart looks continued lower   Transportation  Last night I wrote  this chart looks ready to move higher on Monday  and the Trans on Monday were a virtual carbon copy of the Dow so everything I wrote there applies here too  It all looks good 

Tonight the overall look of the charts remains bullish but I am concerned that after such a big one day gain the market may want to take a break  Tuesday is also the end of the month and the quarter and that could lead to assorted profit taking and or rebalancing  Also the last day of March is historically weak  So with these two counter currents operating tonight  I m afraid I m going to have to settle for officially calling Tuesday uncertain  though I personally believe that the bias is lower  Single Stock Trader  Last night of VZ I wrote  it s now a buy for the adventurous    And it was an excellent adventure as Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  gained 1 15  to pop back up through its 200 day MA and complete a bullish stochastic crossover  As indicators are still just barely oversold and OBV continues to rise  I d say there s more upside evaluable here on Tuesday ",2015-03-31,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-uncertain-246796,246796

Recap
Whoa  I m sure glad I called Tuesday lower because Mr  Market had a major snit and dumped 333 Dow points in a cascade that ended only because the bell finally rang at 4 PM in Wall St  s equivalent of the Mercy Rule  And all this because of the strength of the dollar  interest rate fears  phase of the moon  blah blah doesn t matter  all we need to do is pay attention to the charts  So let s see how this sets us up for Wednesday 
 The Technicals
 The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow had its worst day since October 9th with a 1 85  swan dive that plunged right through the lower BB  with a giant angry red marubozu taking out two support lines in the process  And even at that we re still not yet down to extreme oversold levels  There s nothing on this chart to call a reversal right now   The VIX  Bang zoom  The VIX took off like a skyrocket Tuesday with a gap up 10 82  pop to remain firmly in a steep rising RTC  Indicators have now hit highly overbought levels but we ve not yet hit the upper BB at 17 13  We have a hanging man but that requires confirmation so I can t call this one lower yet  I ll note though that VVIX punched up through its 200 day MA   not a good sign   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were higher at 12 37 AM EDT with ES up 0 31  ES of course was pounded badly on Tuesday breaking key support at 2056 and continuing right on down through its lower BB  But that has driven all the indicators quite oversold and the stochastic is finally starting to come around into position for an eventual bullish crossover  And there was a hint of a rally in the overnight  though we ve already seen that movie twice before in the past week   a leg down followed by a small bounce  lather rinse repeat  But this time we re a lot more oversold than back then so the selling may be nearing the end   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot tanked from 2075 42 to 2053 75  And even after that massive dump  we re still below the new pivot so this indicator remains bearish   Dollar index  The dollar just keeps on its inexorable trend to infinity   and beyond with another 1  gap up yesterday  We ve now broken all 2009 resistance lines  In fact  the dollar is now so high  I can t even scroll back far enough in eSignal to find the last time it was higher   the chart ends in 2007  It does look like it s starting to go exponential though but there s no telling when the blow off top will come   Euro  And of course the euro took another big hit Tuesday  closing this time down to 1 0698  Less that seven cents left to Parityville  At its current rate  we re still on track to pull into that station by the end of March  Look out below   Transportation  Everything I wrote about the Dow applies here too  Big downtrend  no reversal in sight 

The SPX Hi Lo index at 31 5 is now down to levels from which previous reversals have come  And all the charts are looking bearish with the exception of the VIX which is showing a reversal warning and ES which made a non trivial move higher in the overnight  I never like to go against the futures and I think the current move lower may be have been overdone  It s possible we could get  if not an actual bottom  then something of a DCB on Wednesday so I m going to go way out on the limb and call today  Wednesday  higher Single Stock TraderMonday night I wrote of Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ    I m not quite ready to get back in just yet    Good thing too because VZ was down another 72 cents Tuesday in action that traded entirely under the lower BB  This is starting to look like early last December so we re not getting back on this bus until we see some sign that it s going our way   and that isn t just yet  Still  I ll be watching this one intraday on Wednesday  If it looks to be turning around and the rest of the market is up  I may hop on board for the quick swing ",2015-03-11,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-244592,244592

 The Dow  The Dow tried to recover from Tuesday s triple digit swoon and almost made it  but not quite  Oh well  We re still left with an inverted hammer on highly oversold indicators and a stochastic that s primed and ready for a bullish crossover  This chart now looks like it s got more upside potential than downside risk   The VIX  The VIX sent some mixed messages on Wednesday  putting in a 1 08  bullish engulfing candle but also just touching its upper BB   That BB is the third rail of the VIX  The VIX rarely spends much time moving higher after hitting it  That thesis is supported by highly overbought indicators  RSI 93  and a stochastic just primed for a bearish crossover  The trade was also just outside the rising RTC for a bearish setup  All in all  I say the VIX is lower Thursday  Market index futures  Last night all three futures were higher at 12 36 AM EDT with ES up 0 23   on Wednesday  ES traded almost entirely below the lower BB with an inverted hammer  Indicators moved even lower into extremely oversold territory and the stochastics have just about fallen off the bottom of the chart  This just has to be near a reversal in my book   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2053 75 to 2043 33  But that s enough to put ES back above the new pivot so this indicator is back to bullish   Dollar index  The incredible helium dollar just kept rising on Wednesday with a second gap up candle in a row for another 1 16  gain  The dollar is now clearly going exponential so a pullback has to be coming soon  But for now it s still up  up and away   Euro  And of course the euro just kept going lower on Wednesday closing this time at 1 0535  It was January 2003 the last time we saw this  And of course the Parityville Express is still on track for an on time arrival by the end of the month  We re only five cents away now  Given recent moves  that could be accomplished in a single day   Transportation  In a bit of bullish divergence  Dow Theory wise  the trans advanced on a day the Dow declined a bit  up 1 12  with a green marubozu that formed a bullish stochastic crossover and exited the descending RTC for a bullish crossover after bouncing off its lower BB  This one now looks higher for Thursday 

We ve now hit some pretty oversold levels and I m seeing signs of bottoming  particularly in the VIX  the trans and the futures so I m just going to go ahead and call Thursday higher Single Stock TraderWell Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  gained a bit on Wednesday with a green spinning top  and a stochastic that just eked out a bullish crossover  We dont  yet have the descending RTC exit for confirmation but I m blessing this one anyway as a buy  I took a small position at 47 91   not the best entry point of the day for sure  but I have other things to do than sit in front of a screen staring at VZ all day ",2015-03-12,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-the-hoot-244767,244767

Recap
Sunday night I called Monday as uncertain  adding  My personal bias is that I m not looking to go long the next few days    Well with a meager 24 point move in the Dow   uncertain  seems about right  and with the move to the downside  not going long seems about right too  So let s see if we can get any action going here on Tuesday  Chart  em up  Jack   The Technicals  The Dow  We got a good reversal warning in the form of a red hanging man from the Dow on Monday  It also closed just outside its rising RTC for a bearish setup and remains overbought  That all makes this chart look lower for Tuesday   The VIX  Sunday night I said the VIX looked lower and while the candle on Monday was indeed red  we ended with a 1 82  gain to close just under the 200 day MA after an attempt to break above  The result is a bearish harami but the indicators all remain quite oversold  With four red candles in a row though and remaining below the 200 MA I m going to guess there s more downside available here   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were barely higher at 12 57 AM EST with ES up just two ticks  ES put in a narrow doji star on Monday right at the top of Friday s pop  Indicators remain quite overbought so this is a good reversal warning   but one which requires confirmation   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2099 33 to 2104 92  We remain above the new pivot so this indicator continues bullish   Dollar  The dollar gained 0 34  on Monday but on a red hanging man near the top of Friday s candle  The indicators remain confused but there s at least a suggestion of a move lower here on Tuesday   Euro  And the euro continued its long string of dojis with a lopsided spinning top  This all indicates indecision except for the fact that each doji is lower than the one before  It s a tiny little beginners slope descent but the trend is nevertheless still lower   Transportation  On Monday the trans eked out a 0 14  gain with a green spinning top above Friday s big push  But with indicators now at extreme overbought levels  a bearish RTC exit  and the stochastic actually on the decline for four days  I d say this one looks lower on Tuesday 

Despite some highly overbought conditions and my expectation of a top soon  I m starting to feel like a tape fighter here and that s never a good thing  So with the VIX moving back under its 200 day MA and ES seeming to show no signs of wanting to move lower  I m going to go out on a limb and just call Tuesday higher Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications  NYSE VZ  lost a bit of ground on Monday  but the overall bullish thesis remains intact with two hammers in a row  extremely oversold indicators and a stochastic about to form a bullish crossover ",2015-02-24,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-242877,242877

Recap
 Well what do you know about that  Monday night I went out on a limb calling Tuesday higher   but sometimes my best calls come from that location as the Dow gained a respectable 92 points on Tuesday  Alright then  So now we plod on to Wednesday as the bleary month of February winds down 
 The Technicals
 The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow convincingly rejected Monday s hanging man  that s why you generally need confirmation for these candles no matter how tempting they look  to hit yet another record close and remain in a rising RTC even as the upper BB  continues to scoot away  now at 18 400  So last night there were not any bearish signs   The VIX  Monday night I wrote  I m going to guess there s more downside available here    Good guess because the VIX lost another 6  on Tuesday crashing right through its 200 day MA with a tall red marubozu  The VIX is now in full on sell off mode in a steep descending RTC with no end in sight and the lower BB still a long way from here at 12 92  So we can t call a reversal just yet   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were a bit lower at 12 22 AM EST with ES down 0 04   Like the Dow  ES on Tuesday rejected Monday s reversal candle by continuing higher  There s nothing bearish in the candle but ES has been prone to pausing after one day moves higher lately and I note the indicators are continuing to drift slowly lower while remaining overbought  So I m a bit cautious here   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2104 92 to 2110 75  And once again we remain above the new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar  Monday night I wrote of the dollar  there s at least a suggestion of a move lower here on Tuesday    And it wasn t a bad suggestion as the dollar dropped 0 10  on an inverted hammer after a failed attempt to break a three day resistance  But there s an interesting pattern going on YTD   we re forming a symmetrical triangle and it s very close to completion  Having entered from below I d guess the dollar is due for a breakout pretty soon   maybe sometime this week   Euro  On Tuesday the euro surprised me by putting in its first higher high in seven sessions  It was a small move though and I ll need to see more than this to declare the current downtrend over   Transportation  The trans chart on Tuesday looked just like the Dow so my comments there apply here too   nothing bearish 

The last week of February is historically not so hot  My predicament here is that while we remain in an uptrend and I don t see any particularly bearish signs on the daily time frame I still see some toppishness on a slightly longer interval as I mentioned a few days ago  I m reluctant to call the market higher on that basis but have no real grounds to call it lower so once again I guess that adds up to Wednesday uncertain Single Stock TraderMonday night I wrote that for Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ   the overall bullish thesis remains intact   And that was that  Jack as VZ gained nearly a percent on Tuesday  If anything  it looks even better now  with a bullish engulfing pattern  a completed bullish stochastic crossover  a bullish trigger on a descending RTC exit  RSI still oversold but with a bottom in  and a 200 day MA breakout  What s not to like  I m back in at 49 22 ",2015-02-25,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-uncertain-243017,243017

Recap  As sometimes happens  events conspired on Wednesday to put me way behind  Accordingly  tonight is a Night Owl Lite   just conclusions  no blab 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  Still overbought  still in a rising RTC  A spinning top might be a reversal but needs confirmation   The VIX  Rose Wednesday on bearish divergence  A tall doji nearly hit the lower BB   With oversold indicators  this could move higher Thursday   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were higher at 12 18 AM EST with ES up 0 09   A fat red spinning top Wednesday suggests indecision and possible topping  Little clarity from the overnight  Indicators continue overbought   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2110 75 to 2111 75  Barely above new pivot so nominally bullish   Dollar index  Big gap down offers bearish confirmation of a hanging man and inverted hammer  Bearish stochastic crossover too   looks bearish again Thursday   Euro  Tuesday s doji confirmed with a green candle  Positive follow through in the overnight suggests more upside Thursday   Transportation  More bearish divergence   fell while the Dow rose  Near bearish engulfing candle sent the indicators lower  Looks bearish 

The overall look last night is bearish but ES isn t participating  Because of its proximity to the pivot  I ll make it a conditional call  IF ES remains above its pivot by mid morning Thursday we close higher  else lower   Single Stock Trader Verizon  NYSE VZ  little changed  200 day MA should provide support ",2015-02-26,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-depends-on-es-pivot-243155,243155

Recap  Once again  the conditional called worked nicely with ES wandering about the pivot indecisively until the open at which point it busted through and never looked back   and we closed higher  It doesn t always work but this time it did  So after a nod to the NASDAQ for finally recapturing 5000 on Monday after 15 long years  let s move on to Tuesday 
 The Technicals
 The Dow  The Dow had a monster opening day of March  up 156 points on a big green marubozu for another record close that totally quashed the previous negative outlook  And with the upper BB  now floating at 18 417  there s still good deal of upside available here   The VIX  On Monday the VIX put in a second lower red marubozu for a 2 25  loss to remain in a descending RTC  No bullish turnaround signs here at all and the lower BB is way down to 12 09  It s not out of the question we visit that level before moving higher   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were lower at 12 10 AM EST with ES down 0 05   On Monday ES convincingly put the kaibosh on what was looking like a bearish pattern to bounce pout of a new descending RTC and form a bullish stochastic crossover from a high level  Those are generally good for a day or two of further gains  Note though that we are now hard up on week long resistance  so I m not too sure that will work this time  And the overnight didn t seem too enthusiastic about it   ES daily pivot  TLast night the ES daily pivot rose from 2104 83 to 2110 00 even  But we remain above the new pivot so this indicator continues to be bullish   Dollar  On Monday the dollar continued higher as it gripped the upper BB like a mountain climber scaling an icy escarpment  Three green candles and no signs of reversal from the indicators   looks like we re not done going higher   Euro  Sunday night I wrote  More downside is in store here   And we went lower  And last night was lower again  And we re not done yet   Transportation  The trans had a great day Monday with a bullish engulfing candle that exited their descending RTC fore a bullish setup and bent the stochastic around in anticipation of a bullish crossover  Bottom line   this one just looks higher from here 

The theme lately has been for a pause after big one day moves  We don t have any outright bearish signs right now but I m concerned about the shape ES is in  Also we re not getting much direction from the indicators which are bumping up against extreme overbought levels  nor from the daily candles which have been wandering for four days now  So breakout or fake out  Hard to say  Too hard for me in fact so I m just going to wimp out and call Tuesday uncertain Single Stock TraderSunday night I wasn t too keen on Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  and while it did eke out a tiny gain Monday  it still faces strong resistance at 49 44  Meanwhile the indicators remain overbought and the stochastic is ominously about to form a bearish crossover  Don t buy here ",2015-03-03,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-unertain-243631,243631

Recap  I thought something seemed fishy about this market Monday night so I called Tuesday as uncertain instead of following the trend higher  Good thing too because the Dow lost 85 points and was unable to push any higher at all  So what does this all mean for Wednesday  We go to the charts as always for the answer 
 The Technicals
 The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow put in a fat hanging man for a 0 47  loss  It has apparently given up on the idea of hitting its upper BB  at 18 377 and with indicators still overbought  it ain t looking good for the Dow  Period   The VIX  With two black crows  I was vaguely guessing that the VIX might hit its lower BB Tuesday  Bzzzt  Instead it zoomed to ring the gong of its 200 day MA before retreating for a 6 29  gain  It s still a bullish RCT exit and indicators are all rising off oversold now so I d have to think the bottom is in 
Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were lower at 12 11 AM EST with ES down 0 07  On Tuesday ES  gasping for air  gave up nearly all of Monday s attempt to crack the powerful line at 2114  Not this time  ain t gonna happen  And with all the indicators in a headlong rush off overbought to oversold  and the overnight guiding lower  this chart just looks lower Wednesday   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell from 2110 00 to 2104 92  That puts us below the new pivot so this indicator now turns bearish   Dollar index  After tickling its upper BB for three straight days the dollar had enough on Tuesday losing 008  on a tall doji star despite what I thought  That also curved the stochastic around for a bearish crossover so it looks like we have a decent reversal warning here  albeit one that requires confirmation   Euro  On Tuesday the euro continued grasping at straws as it just blub blub blubbed lower and lower on three consecutive doji stars  We re back below 1 1200 and still on track  as far as I m concerned for an express trip to Parityville   Transportation  It was a 0 49  loss for the trans on Tuesday with a red hanging man  But oddly enough it was also a bullish trigger on a descending RTC exit and we also got a stochastic curling around very near a bullish crossover  So I ll take a wild guess that the trans go higher on Wednesday 

Meh  I could be wrong  and Lord knows I am often enough  but things were looking just sufficiently bearish last night for me to nervously declare Wednesday lower Single Stock TraderVerizon Communications  NYSE VZ  eked out a tiny gain on Tuesday but my topping thesis remains intact as this spinning top teetering on the edge of a rising RTC with overbought indicators demonstrates  Still no buy here ",2015-03-04,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-lower-243804,243804

Recap  Last Thursday I made a conditional call for the Dow based on ES s proximity to its pivot  That worked very well on Friday with ES noodling about the pivot in the wee hours until breaking decisively below at 8 25 AM as the jobs numbers came out and that was that  Mr  Market was not amused and down we went  The question now becomes  after such a quick dump  where s the reversal  We ll scout the charts for signs   The Technicals  The Dow  On Friday the Dow started shedding points faster than my German Shepherd sheds hairs in the opening minute  And then it got worse  Mercifully  the bell finally rang to put an end to the carnage  with a broad based 279 point loss  giving up the 18 support like it wasn t even there    That tall red marubozu took the indicators oversold though the stochastic has yet to begin forming a bullish crossover and the lower BB  is still over 100 points away   The VIX  I was a bit surprised to see the VIX up only 8 26  on Friday though it admittedly did blast right back up through its 200 day MA to remain in a rising RTC  Indicators also rose and are now close to being overbought  But not there yet which suggests that the VIX may have enough gas left in the tank to rise further on Monday   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were lower at 12 40 AM EDT with ES down 0 16   ES took a pounding on Friday to drive its indicators all oversold though the stochastic still hasnt  started curving back around for a bullish crossover  And until I see that and a bullish reversal candle  this chart just looks ugly  And the overnight didn t help either   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2098 83 to 2079 92  We remain under the new pivot so this indicator is now plainly bearish    Dollar index  Holy moly   the dollar made a moon shot on Friday  up a whopping 1 26  with a gap up green marubozu that traded entirely above its upper BB  And it is clearly going exponential now  And we all know how that ends  Every time  So look for a break lower soon  Maybe not Monday but sometime this week   Euro  Jeez   did I say the euro was going to parity in the fourth quarter  Well judging by its action on Friday  down to 1 0849  it s looking more like by the end of this month  I m not pulling these numbers out of thin air either  I simply intersect the current regression trend channel with the 1 000 line and that s where it s landing now  Remember back a few years ago when big rock starts were demanding to be paid in euros rather than dollars  You don t hear much about that anymore do you   Transportation  And finally the trans got hammered just like everything else on Friday with a big red marubozu that sent its indicators oversold  We re now near the lower BB so I think we may see a bottoming candle here soon  like in a day or two 

We let a lot of hot air out of the market last week but I don t think we re quite done just yet basically based on a bevy of bearish charts so I m just going to go ahead and call Monday lower Single Stock TraderLast Thursday night I wrote of Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ   I don t think the selling s done yet here  and hey presto  boom  down we went 1 29  on a big gap down that closed under its lower BB and sent all the indicators oversold  I have to admit that at 48 36 it s starting to look attractive again  OTOH I m also mindful of the old saying that you never buy a stock just because it s down  So we wait for this falling knife to whizz by  We will definitely miss the bottom  but we won t get all hacked up ",2015-03-09,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-lower-244293,244293

Recap
 My conditional call for Tuesday worked perfectly  Just look at the ES chart  It dropped back below the pivot at 3 35AM but then fought back up above for a positive open  Then it made one brief stab at the pivot right at 10 45 AM but that failed and it was up up and away from there  As I say  the conditional call doesn t always work but it works often enough to be useful  So now we move on to Wednesday 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  Monday night pretty much all the technicals were wrong  I kind of had that idea in mind when I made it a conditional call  In any case  the Dow had a nice 0 79  pop to more than retrace Monday s losses and approach YTD resistance  But that still leaves us overbought and with a stochastic more likely to form a bearish crossover than anything  So I just had to abstain from this chart last night   The VIX  Silly me   I said the VIX was going higher on Tuesday in the face of 2 3 of a bearish evening star  Well that star was out in full force Tuesday with a 7 12  gap down drop in the VIX to complete this pattern  That makes this chart bearish  despite being oversold   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were lower at 12 42 AM EST with ES down 0 11   ES had a very nice day Tuesday making back two days worth of losses and breaking resistance at 2057  We re now officially overbought but with the upper BB  at 2077 29 and with being in a rising RTC  I think ES might want to have a look at that number today  Though ES certainly wasn t showing much enthusiasm for that idea last night   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose from 2043 58 to 2056 42  That still leaves us above the new pivot so this indicator is still bullish   Dollar  The dollar posted a 0 29  gain on an unusual red hanging man  With indicators still not yet overbought there s enough uncertainty here to keep me from making a call   Euro  The euro fell just a bit on Tuesday on a nice little star  With indicators nearly oversold that seems to imply some bottom formation and our current level around 1 13 is indeed a support line  But we also have a bearish RTC trigger so this chart isn t clear at all  Hey  sometimes that happens   Transportation  And finally the trans defied my predictions to gain a healthy 0 86  on Tuesday with a nearly bullish engulfing pattern to retrace all of Monday s losses and keep us overbought  We re still outside the last rising RTC though so technically that s a bearish trigger  We ll see 

The market is at something of a crossroads right now  The charts in general look fairly bullish but they re near key resistance lines  It also seems that the recent rally has largely been fueled by oil  and right now oil seems to be running out of gas  sorry  couldn t resist   I think the next move is going to be lower  I m just not sure if that will be on Wednesday  It could be a doji day  So on that note I will just have to call Wednesday uncertain  Wednesday should provide more clarity

Recap
 Tuesday night I called Wednesday as uncertain saying that  it could be a doji day    And that s exactly what it was with the Dow down 7 points and the SPX down 0 06 points  I think we also got some of the clarity I was looking for so let s get right to it  
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  On Wednesday the Dow put in a tall doji right on the upper end of Tuesday s gains  The indicators moved even more overbought and I take this failure to advance as a bearish sign   The VIX  I also wrote Tuesday night that  a bunch of mumbo jumbo makes this chart bearish  despite being oversold    Right again  as the VIX fell another 1 57  Wednesday completing the bearish evening star  But there s no reversal sign yet so it s not out of the question that there could be more downside here today  Thursday   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were mixed at 12 40 AM EST with ES down 0 05  but YM up 0 02   Call it basically flat  Tuesday night I wrote that  I think ES might want to have a look at  the upper BB   on Wednesday  and that s just what happened with ES just touching the upper BB before falling back to form a nice doji  The new overnight took a big pop right after the close but then gave it all back leaving us with a fat red hanging man yesterday   though it did start drifting slowly higher in the late evening   We ll have to see now if it has the requisite mojo to bust through its pivot   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose from 2056 42 to 2066 17  That was enough to just put ES below the new pivot but it seems interested in mounting an attack on it as I write  So it s bearish now but only weakly so   Dollar  The dollar was too tough for me Tuesday night to call but ended putting in a decent 0 25  gain on Wednesday  right back to a month long resistance   Euro  I also couldn t call the euro Tuesday night and it s not surprising given that the euro has been putting in tiny little spinning tops for three days now  seemingly stuck around 1 1321  We re oversold but it s looks like last night s breakout attempt has failed leaving us right back where we started  Given this lack of direction  still no call here   Transportation  The trans rose 0 28  Wednesday in a bit of bullish divergence  But the inverted hammer  overbought indicators and a bearish stochastic crossover all suggest lower to come  Rising indicators not yet overbought and a rising RTC all suggest the trans might still have enough gas in the tank to motor higher today 

With ES so close to its new pivot and looking like it s serious about trying to break through in the early morning hours  last night looked like another good choice to do a conditional call  If ES can break above its pivot by mid morning Thursday  we ll close higher  If not  we ll close lower   Single Stock Trader  VZ extended its gains Wednesday  While it s annoying to see the bus pull away without you on board  well just wait for it to come back  There s no law that says you have to trade ",2015-02-12,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-depends-on-es-pivot-241696,241696

 The Dow  The Dow s 110 point advance on Thursday negated Wednesday s doji amid rising volume and handily broke through resistance at 17 889 for its best close YTD  While we re now oversold  the proximity of the upper BB  at 18 069 makes me think the Dow s going to want to take a sniff of that number today Friday   The VIX  Well whadaya know about that  Wednesday night I wrote  there could be more downside here on Thursday  and the VIX obligingly fell nearly 10  on a gap down red marubozu yesterday  That leaves us within sneezing distance of the 200 day MA at 14 51  The momentum is clearly down at this point so I m going to hazard that the VIX takes a peek at the MA today   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were modestly higher at 1 11 AM EST with ES up 0 04  ES had a nice gain on Thursday  just touching its upper BB at the close  But that also leaves us right on the edge of the rising RTC and also pretty overbought  That makes me think it might be time for some sort of retracement  But so far at least  ES doesn t seem interested in moving lower   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2066 17 to 2076 00  We remain above the new pivot so this indicator remains bullish   Dollar index  Wednesday night I noted some strong resistance for the dollar and that proved to be simply too much to overcome so we ended down nearly a full percent  That move was enough to form a new bearish stochastic crossover and drop us out of the rising RTC for a bearish setup  It all adds up to continued lower on Friday   Euro  Well the euro managed a small gain on Thursday but it remains mired in its recent congestion zone of 1 1281 to 1 1500  So there s nothing to say here until we see a breakout and there s no way to tell which way it will be  If I were trading the euro right now     I wouldn t   Transportation  Wednesday night I wrote  the trans might still have enough gas in the tank to motor higher on Thursday  and it turned out they had a secret extra reserve tank that was good for another  078  to easily clear resistance at 8971  With this big green marubozu on the tape  there s nothing bearish at all here unless we encounter some typical Friday profit taking 

The charts were pretty uniformly bullish last night so despite the fact that the Friday before the President s Birthday  ie  Washington s Birthday  holiday is historically pretty bearish  it s not clear that will be the case this year  So I m just going to go ahead and call Friday higher  Single Stock TraderHuh    NYSE VZ  finally put in a red candle in the form of a dark cloud cover  I d look for more downside here  Eventually we ll find another buying opportunity ",2015-02-13,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-higher-241838,241838

Recap
 Yaaawn  Is this three day weekend finally over  Time to wake up and get back to the markets I guess  Though I have to admit I kind of enjoyed a three day break  That makes me consider that there s no holiday in March  But the evil major corporation I used to work for offered something called  floating holidays   You got a day off and could pick which day to use it on  So I see no reason not to be at least as generous with myself as those cheapskates  So I m declaring Monday March 16th to be Night Owl Day  There will be no Night Owl the Sunday night before the 16th  One of the nice things about being your own boss   Uh  so anyway  let s see where this new holiday shortened week might be headed 
  The Technicals 
  The Dow  Way back last Friday the Dow gained 47 points on a small green candle that nonetheless continued closing in on its upper BB   Indicators are now overbought but not so much that touching the BB on Tuesday is out of the question   The VIX  And also back in ancient history  the VIX on Friday gapped down another 4 24  to come within a hair of its 2200 day MA at 14 62  We re still fairly oversold but the last time we were in a similar situation  the VIX bounced right off the MA and moved higher  So I was looking for some support to kick in here yesterday  
Market index futures  Last night all three futures were lower at 12  AM EST with ES down 0 47  ES had another good day last Friday with a record close that again touched its upper BB  But we re pretty overbought by now and ES may be wanting to rest a spell  In any case  the new overnight is forming a bearish harami   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rose again from 2076 00 to 2090 00  That plus the overnight drop in ES now put it below the new pivot so this indicator turned bearish   Dollar  After a big drop last Thursday the dollar found some support Friday with a small hammer  But the stochastic rolled over big time for a bearish crossover  That leaves this chart sort of a tossed up but overall it looks more negative to me   Euro  And so the euro on Friday produced a mirror image inverted hammer on Friday  We do have some real time action Sunday night for this and it s very negative  off half a percent  That makes a lower close Tuesday look likely   Transportation  And the trans made it four in a row with a quarter percent gain on Friday that leaves the indicators just short of overbought and still in a rising RTC  So in the absence of any bearish signs  this one looked higher again Yesterday 

It s op ex week once again with all the lunacy that implies  And the first day after Valentine s Day is historically quite bearish  Last night the charts and the new overnight both seem to be confirming that so I m just going to go ahead and call Tuesday lower   Single Stock Trader VZ is another issue that touched its 200 day MA on Friday and the bounced off with a doji  But we re still quite overbought and we have a rising RTC exit so I d definitely not be going long here ",2015-02-17,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-lower-242108,242108

Recap
 Well Mr  Market sure got over his Greek existential malaise in a hurry  We indeed opened lower in a big way on Tuesday  as I expected  but by the end of the day the Dow was actually up all of 28 points  Go figure  It s all Greek to me  So let s forget about all this drama and move right on to the charts  At least they always play it straight 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  It wasn t a big move higher  yesterday  but it did result in a tall hanging man teetering right on the edge of record territory  And with the indicators still overbought one has to wonder how much gas is left in this tank  We do have at least a reversal warning here   The VIX  Monday night I wrote  I m looking for some support to kick in here on Tuesday    Well I wrote  Monday  but I meant Tuesday   And the 200 day MA kicked right in sending the VIX bouncing with a gap up 7 56  star to form 2 3 of a bearish evening star  But it was also enough to exit the descending RTC for a bullish setup  so this is a chart to watch on Wednesday  With oversold indicators  the bull case seems to be stronger here  It s an unusual divergence where the VIX and Dow were both up on the same day   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were barely higher at 12 55 AM EST with ES up just one tick On Tuesday ES continued creeping up its upper BB  to remain in a steep rising RTC but with a hanging man  Indicators remain quite overbought and the overnight is trading outside the RTC for a bearish setup   but is this a top  Can t really tell  unfortunately  And with the overnight flat  there s no help there   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose a bit from 2090 00 even to 2091 83  But that still leaves us above the new pivot so this indicator is now bullish   Dollar index  So much for Monday night s hammer  The dollar lost another 0 14  on Tuesday to remain in a steep descending RTC with a lopsided spinning top  And we re still not yet oversold  So this is a reversal sign that requires confirmation as we sit this one out   Euro  After something of a bump last Thursday the euro has gotten bogged down again  this time around 1 1406  a level we ve seen for four days in a row now  And with indicators wandering about neither overbought nor oversold  there s little direction to this chart and indeed there has been none since we bottomed on January 26th   Transportation  Yesterday the trans put in an unremarkable small spinning top  Still not yet overbought not much to learn here  I take a pass on this chart 

The Dow is now hard up against all time high resistance and its RSI has actually been falling for a week now while remaining overbought  But all our reversal indicators are ones that require confirmation  And on top of that we ve got FOMC minutes today  Wednesday  And it s op ex week  To me  that all sounds like a good excuse to call Wednesday uncertain and live to trade another day Single Stock TraderVZ indeed dropped right back to its 200 day MA on Tuesday  Will this provide support  It didn t the last two times we were here and we were a lot less overbought back then than now  So I don t think the selling is over and I m not yet looking to buy in again ",2015-02-18,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-uncertain-242252,242252

Recap  Well the conditional call last night simply did not work out  ES broke over its pivot on Thursday but due to bad economic numbers  those freakin  Greeks  or whatever  we ended lower anyway  It s still a good play  just not 100   So with that excitement out of the way  let s take a gander at op ex Friday  always a good time   The technicals  The Dow Jones 30  On Thursday the Dow lost 44 points on a second hanging man in a row and one that closed outside the rising RTC for a bearish setup We now have three hanging men in a row making me think Mr  Market is trying to tell us something  And with indicators remaining overbought  it looks like what he s saying is that there s more downside to come   The VIX  In continuing divergence  on Thursday the VIX lost 1 04  on a day the Dow was also down  It also caused a bearish RTC setup  The overall gestalt of this chart makes it look like it just wants to move lower   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are mixed once again just like last night at 12 30 AM EST with ES down 0 05  but NQ up 0 04  ES is clearly having trouble advancing from these elevated levels with now three dojis in a row marking failed attempts to move higher  RSI hit 98 61 on Thursday  the other indicators have actually begun to move lower  and we got a bearish trigger on the rising RTC exit  The blah overnight suggests little appetite for any push higher on Friday   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dips from 2094 17 to 2094 00 even  After crossing the pivot multiple times on Thursday we re now just barely above the new number  so this indicator is slightly positive   Dollar index  Last night I wrote  this one looks vaguely bullish   Turns out I could have been more assertive since the dollar gained a fair 0 25  on Thursday  Now it was with a gap up hanging man  OTOH  we have a stochastic on the verge of a bullish crossover  That all leaves this chart too tough to call once again   Euro  Last night I noted that the euro seemed to be congesting and wrote  I m going to guess that the break when it comes will be lower    Well on Thursday  it was with the euro closing at 1 1368  its lowest lose in four days  With three lower highs in a row now and indicators still a long way from oversold  I d say the selling s not over here yet   Transportation  On Thursday the trans put in a massive topping indicator in the form of a big gravestone doji that just touched their upper BB before closing right on the edge of the rising RTC  just short of a bearish setup  We remain highly overbought so I d have to say the next move is lower form here 

Friday is op ex and historically bearish  And I have to say the charts now seem to be leaning in that direction with the lone exception of the VIX  However  the past two days the VIX has traded in direct correlation with the market   highly unusual  So overall it looks like I have to call Friday lower  That s all  she wrote  See you again Sunday night Single Stock TraderLast night I wrote  there s more downside to come here  about Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ   And there was  down another percent as we gapped down under the 200 day MA  That also took the indicators off overbought though we remain in a descending RTC  I think we re nearing a short term bottom here which would be a good buying opportunity  But I need to see the reversal first  So we continue to watch and wait ",2015-02-20,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-lower-242529,242529

Recap
 In a good example of how news trumps technicals  on Friday we got some positive news about those Greeks and their perpetual money troubles and so the markets jumped  Not that I m complaining since I m always net long  As long as I m making money I m happy  So let s see how happy I m going to be Monday at 4 PM as we begin the last week of the miserable month of February 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  Last week I thought for sure the Dow would break lower following a whole week of hanging men  But the Greeks put the kaiboash on that idea and up we went to the tune of 155 points for another record close and reclaiming the 18K level  Indicators are all now overbought broken and have lost their predictive power so all I can really see here is the upper BB  at 18 296 and the rising RTC  IOW   nothing bearish here   The VIX  The VIX is now back in gear  falling when the market rises  And on Friday it fell a good 6 47  out of its rising RTC for a bearish trigger and then right on through its 200 day MA leaving us with three black crows all cawing  lower lower    Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were mixed at 12 31 AM EST with ES down 0 05   On Friday ES smashed through resistance at 2098 to move back into record territory  The indicators remain highly overbought but ES has shown an ability for over a year now to keep that up for a long time before moving lower  That leaves nothing really to call this chart lower Monday   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose from 2094 00 to 2099 33  We re still above the new pivot so this indicator continues to be bullish   Dollar  After early gains Friday the dollar ended with a 0 16  loss on a red bearish engulfing pattern  It does appear to me that after peaking on January 23rd the dollar seems to have lost its way  I m looking for some directionless trading the next day or so   Euro  The euro is also befuddled  putting in five dojis in a row with no end in sight  Indicators continue to wander between overbought and oversold so to be honest I have no clue where this chart is going   Transportation  After a gravestone doji Thursday the trans motored higher on Friday anyway  though with a hanging man this time  We ve now touched the upper BB and the indicators remain extremely overbought  and we re hanging on the very edge of the rising RTC for a bearish setup  So it looks like there s at least a chance of a move lower on Monday 

One thing that concerns me is that the Morningstar Market Fair Value Index has now hit 1 06   its highest level in a year  The last time we hit 1 06 was December 26th and that marked the exact top of a nasty week and a half long slide  And the chart recently are looking a lot like the run up to the December high too  modulo the Greek pop on Friday which might be a one off  So I m kind of torn between calling the market higher because of the absence of any outright bearish signs and calling it lower because of some slightly longer term toppishness I see  Oh well  what the heck   I ll just split the difference and call Monday uncertain  My personal bias is that I m not looking to go long the next few days Single Stock TraderLast Thursday I wrote that   we re nearing a short term bottom  regarding Verizon Communications VZ  And if you check the chart  that s about how it played out with a tall green hammer and oversold indicators   It s now looking like a near term buy again ",2015-02-23,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-uncertain-242705,242705

 I wasn t quite sure about last Friday  It did look to me like we were running out of gas but I ended up calling it uncertain  The resulting 141 point red marubozu wasn t quite the doji I was expecting but it was a bearish sign anyway  Last night I found myself running short on time so we re going to have another of my famous Reader s Digest Condensed Night Owls  Less for me to write  less for you to read  I did the research  I m just not writing abut every chart  We ll get back on track Monday night 
 The Technicals 
ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2045 00 to 2049 58  After falling below the new pivot this indicator now turned bearish 

We had some bearish signs in the charts last Friday and that direction got a big boost from Sunday s Greek elections  It seems the Greeks now want to welsh on their debts raising again the specter of the dreaded Grexit and the subsequent unraveling of the euro  Personally I think the handwriting has been on this particular wall for a while now  But Europe seems to prefer pulling the bandaid off agonizingly slowly instead of just getting it over with with one sharp yank  Either way  the situation over there isn t looking too encouraging   Uh where was I  Oh yes  I m calling today  Monday lower   Single Stock Trader VZ looks continued bearish ",2015-01-26,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday-lower-239654,239654

Recap
 Well that was interesting  All the major averages opened sharply lower on Monday  exactly in accordance with my theory of Mr  Market being scared stiff of the Greeks  But then he apparently thought better of that idea and by the close we were just barely in the green  Go figure  So with this interesting candle int he books  let s see how that factors in for Tuesday   
The Technicals 
 The Dow  After a bearish marubozu on Friday the Dow put in a nice hammer on Monday that was just enough to remain in its latest rising RTC  It also kept the indicators rising and they ve yet to hit overbought  So forget all the bearish warnings from Friday   this one now looks bullish again   The VIX  Significantly  on a day the Dow was essentially flat  the VIX fell 6 84   canceling a doji from last Friday  While we re now oversold there s no support until the 200 day MA at 14 38 so I d say more downside is possible here   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were modestly higher at 1 10 AM EST with ES up 0 04   After a lower open Monday ES spent the rest of the day slogging higher and that was enough to keep it in its ascending RTC  But we re also fairly overbought now and the stochastics are on the brink of a bearish crossover  And ES has been unable to break resistance at 2057 for three days now so it s not clear to me there s enough gas in the tank for a move higher Tuesday   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2049 58 to 2044 67  We broke above the old pivot just before the close Monday and remained above the new one so this indicator now turns again bullish   Dollar  The dollar followed a big advance last Thursday with another gap up jump on Friday  so it s not too surprising to see a lower high on Monday but even that still constituted a 0 06  advance  There s just no stopping the mighty dollar lately   Euro  Meanwhile  the euro continues to lose around one to two cents a day  If this keeps up  we ll hit parity even sooner than my August forecast  We re now back to September 2003 levels  We ve come a long way from the days when rock stars started demanding to be paid in euros instead of dollars   Transportation  The trans also outperformed the Dow on Monday  up 0 65  to retrace about 1 3 of Friday s losses  But we re still overbought and the stochastic s next move can only be bearish  We re also hanging on to the ragged right edge of the rising RTC so a bearish setup is possible at any moment  I m not convinced this one can move higher 

I m getting some mixed messages tonight  There really isn t enough clarity or consensus in the charts to make any call so I ll just have to call Tuesday uncertain   Single Stock Trader

Recap
 Wow   I m glad I called Tuesday as uncertain because I sure wasn t expecting a nearly 300 point plunge in the Dow yesterday  That erases almost all of last week s rally and leaves us close to YTD lows  This is a significant move so let s go right to the charts to see how it changes the picture 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  Yesterday  the Dow dumped over 200 points in its opening five minutes and then kept going lower  An anemic rally effort left us down  only  291 but technically this move did a lot of damage  We fell decisively out of the rising RTC for a bullish setup  we sent all the indicators turning lower  and we got a clear bearish stochastic crossover  This chart now looks distinctly negative   The VIX  I blew this one badly Monday Night when I said the VIX looked lower  Instead it shot up 11  on Tuesday with a gap up spinning top that sent all the indicators higher from oversold and formed a new bullish stochastic crossover  We just missed a bullish exit from the descending RTC though and the candle is 2 3 of a bearish evening star  With mixed messages  this chart is too tough to call   Market index futures  Last night all three futures were higher at 12 10 AM EST with ES up a significant 0 70   On Tuesday ES put in a bullish harami   haven t seen one of those in quite a while now  Indicators have come off oversold and Monday night s bearish stochastic crossover has fizzled out  So there s at least a suggestion of a move higher here  particularly with last night s strong action   ES daily pivot Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2040 67 to 2032 67  However  we are now once again above the new pivot so this indicator continues bullish   Dollar  The dollar put in a third red candle in a row  the first time that s happened in nearly a month and the biggest three day loss in two months  And even at that we re still overbought  We finally have a fresh bearish stochastic crossover I really have to bite my tongue but I d hazard a wild guess that we could see more downside here on Wednesday  You will note that it wasn t too long ago I mentioned the possibility that the dollar might be topping soon  Is this it  Who knows   Euro  Holy moly  the euro managed to put in two consecutive green candles for the first time since December 9th  But with such strong downward pressure  it will really take an RTC exit for me to declare a reversal  This is one downtown express bus you don t want to be standing in front of   Transportation  The trans also got hit hard on Tuesday  down a percent and a quarter to remain in a new steep descending RTC  Even so indicators here yet to leave overbought and we have a new completed bearish stochastic crossover  So this chart looks still bearish 

The charts in general continue to look fairly bearish with the exception of the futures which seem to be reacting to news that the central bank of Singapore has jumped on the QE bandwagon  It was just last Friday I wrote  there s still a bunch of central banks we ve yet to hear from  It s still not too late to join the race to the bottom   OK then  that s one more down  And following the usual pattern  I m going to take a wild guess and claim that we close today  Wednesday higher   Single Stock Trader VZ still in a steep descending RTC  The reversal indicator will be strong when it comes but patience is the key  Wait for it ",2015-01-28,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-239944,239944

 Holy moly  Things sure went south in a hurry on Wednesday  I was confident enough Tuesday night to call Wednesday higher in the face of a Fed announcement  and as usual every time I go against my rule of calling such days as uncertain  I got my head handed to me  Ouch  Oh well  We live to trade another day  And that would be Thursday so let s see what s cooking there   
The Technicals 
 The Dow  The Dow actually ws positive most of the day yesterday until it fell off a cliff in the final hour to end down nearly 200 points  In any case we blasted right through support at 17 315 like buttah  stopped only by the lower BB at 17 198  And now the 200 day MA at 17 045 is within easy one day striking distance  Our next support line is oddly enough right at the same spot  Indicators continue falling but are not yet oversold and the stochastic is in full on bearish mode  So there s nothing bullish about this chart last night   The VIX  Zoom  So much for what looked like an incipient bearish evening star Tuesday night  It turned into jolly green giant marubozu on Wednesday up a whopping 18 90   That was good for a bullish setup on a bearish RTC and a completed bullish stochastic crossover  With indicators now smartly coming off oversold  this chart just looks flat out bullish  Oof   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12 14 AM EST with ES up 0 20   ES had its worst day since  uh  let me scroll back here  uh well let s just say quite a long time on Wednesday giving up the 2K mark and tumbling to 1991 50  The lower BB  is not too far off and the 200 day MA is just beyond that  And amazingly  we re still not yet oversold  So there s nothing technically bullish on this chart last night   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dives from 2032 67 to 2009 75  And even that massive plunge wasn t enough to put ES back above the new pivot so this indicator is now distinctly bearish   Dollar  Tuesday night I wouldn t commit to a move lower on the dollar which was just as well since it resumed it s climb to the stratosphere on Wednesday  Forget everything I said about a dollar topping   we ain t done yet   Euro  And of course that means the euro put a quick end to its two day rally with a bearish dark cloud cover Wednesday  Looks like we re right back to the old march to zero here  The negative overnight pin action supports that idea 
Transportation  Tuesday night I wrote  this chart looks continued bearish  and was it ever  down another 1 46  on Wednesday leaving us in a steep descending RTC with the indicators all falling off overbought  This one still looks outright bearish 

Yesterday s action did a lot to take the charts closer to a reversal point but it doesn t look like we re quite there yet  And yet with the Dow sitting on its lower BB and ES pretty close  there also doesn t seem to be all that much downside available from here  But with the SPX Hi Lo index nowhere near a reversal point and the NYSE A D line continuing to put in lower highs  I just was not feeling the love last night so I m going to call today Thursday lower  I ll be happy to be proven wrong   Single Stock Trader VZ is now just off its lower BB and fairly oversold but remains firmly in a descending RTC  It s getting close to a buy but isn t quite there yet ",2015-01-29,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-lower-240092,240092

 The Dow  Despite the easy conclusion that since we were up on Monday we should go down on Tuesday  the stochastic has given us a good bullish crossover and we ve now exited the descending RT for a bullish trigger  So I have to vote higher from here on Tuesday   The VIX  Sunday night s spinning top was confirmed yesterday with the VIX losing 7 34  on a big inverted hammer that just tickled the upper BB  and curved the stochastic around very close to a bearish crossover  That spells lower in my book   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were lower at 12 14 AM EST with ES down 0 42   ES  like the Dow  has been bouncing around like a pinball lately between 1990 and 2018  We re now at the upper end of that range  The difference is that this time the indicators are a lot more oversold than they were before  effectively putting more oomph behind the chart  Ahh but there s that resistance at 2018 to get by and it didn t look like ES was too interested in testing it last night   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose from 1998 42 to 2003 08  That still leaves us about five points above the new pivot so this indicator turns bullish   Dollar  Sunday night I was loathe to call the dollar lower just because that s been a losing proposition for  uh  a long time now  Nevertheless  the dollar did in fact drop 0 28  on Monday  confirming two spinning tops in a row  That s also a bearish setup on an exit of the latest short rising RTC so all other things being equal the dollar looks lower again from here   Euro  Last night I noted that when the break comes  it should be higher   I don t know if it was exactly a break but the euro did advance on Monday to close right on resistance at 1 1350  Indicators are all now clearly rising off oversold and we ve got three days of higher lows  However with this resistance  Tuesday is make or break for the euro  I think there s enough gas in the tank for a move higher  but I m just not that certain   Transportation  The trans are also in good shape after a nice 1 44  gain Monday  After bouncing off their lower BB we re now clearly oversold with a stochastic just about to form a bullish crossover  This one looks to have more upside potential than downside risk to me 

The charts generally looked pretty bullish last night with the lone exception of the futures which are were lower by non trivial amounts  Also of concern was this crazy down up down up daily action and the fact that we ve been putting in lower highs for three days now  On the other hand  recall that Sunday night I wrote  Dr  Copper looks like he might be getting ready for a move higher  and whadaya know  the ISE Global Coppe   ISC  rose nearly 2  on Monday  So to my mind that all just adds up to a great big nothing and therefore I call Tuesday uncertain   Single Stock Trader  Sunday night I declared Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  a buy and ka ching  it paid off nicely on Monday  The faint of heart might want to bail here  but I think this trade isn t done yet

Recap
 Monday night I let myself get scared away from making a bullish call largely on the basis of some sagging futures  opting instead for a wimpy cop out of  uncertain   Lesson learned as the Dow shot up over 300 points on Tuesday  So the roller coaster ride goes on and on  Which way will we wend on Wednesday  The charts hold the answer 
 The Technicals 
The Dow  I got this much spot on Monday night when I wrote  I have to vote higher from here on Tuesday    And that was the winning vote with a 1 76  jump in the Dow  That was also a bullish RTC trigger  a completed bullish stochastic crossover  and it sent all the indicators rising off oversold  So nothing bearish here last night   The VIX  And Monday night I also wrote  a lot of technical mumbo jumbo spells lower in my book   And it was a good spelling lesson as the VIX dumped nearly 11  on Tuesday to fall out of its rising RTC for a bearish setup  formed a new bearish stochastic crossover and sent all the indicators scurrying lower  I think there s still more downside available from here   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were mixed at 12  16 AM EST with ES down 0 07  but YM up 0 05   ES had a great day Tuesday  But after all the recent turbulence  we re still just right back where we were a week ago  The momentum is clearly higher at this point   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot jumps from 2003 08 to 2031 00  We remain above the new pivot so this indicator remains bullish   Dollar  Monday night I wrote  dollar looks lower again from here   And so yesterday it gapped down for a huge 1 06  loss and a bearish RTC trigger  And a bearish stochastic crossover  RSI just went oversold but I don t think that s enough to save the dollar just yet   Euro  Monday night I was uber cautious on the euro  claiming only that  I think there s enough gas in the tank for a move higher   Well that tank was brimming full with the euro powering to a 1 1491 close on Tuesday  That was also good for a bullish setup on a long running  12 17 14  descending RTC exit  It also drove RTC to overbought but the other indicators aren t quite there yet so it s not impossible that we go higher again today  Wednesday   Transportation  The trans pretty much mirrored the Dow on Tuesday so all of my comments there apply here too  It s looking bullish 

After two strong days the temptation is to call for a pause but with the VIX back under 20 and no real bullish signs about  I guess I just have to go ahead and call Wednesday higher   Single Stock Trader  With a nice pop in Verizon  NYSE VZ  on Tuesday I unloaded it at 47 79  Verizon has now just paid me for a month and a half of their service  nyah nyah  VZ might go even higher on Wednesday  or it might not  Either way  we now sit back and await the next entry point  It s a swing trade  not part of my retirement portfolio  though it would be a great component for that too  ",2015-02-04,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-240744,240744

Recap
 The roller coaster ride continued Wednesday as we were up 100 and then down 60 and in the end the Dow finished all of 7 points higher  Crazy stuff  So let s see how this changes the charts as we look forward to today  Thursday 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  After all the sturm und drang was over  the Dow ended just about where it started on Wednesday  forming a perfect doji and last night a star position  With indicators now approaching overbought this is a reversal warning worth heeding   The VIX  Ya  the VIX got me Wednesday  Instead of continuing lower  it gained 5 77  on a green hammer  But the indicators are wandering  RSI and momentum were higher but the stochastics continued lower  This one was too tough to call last tonight   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were lower at 12 17 AM EST with ES down 0 15   ES gave up ground on Wednesday with a fat red spinning top on a vaguely dark cloud cover candle  But the indicators remain confused with momentum and OBV moving lower but RSI and money flow moving higher and none of them at either extreme  That all leaves this chart a conundrum   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose from 2031 00 to 2034 00   But now we re below the new pivot so this indicator turns bearish   Dollar  Tuesday night s bearish stochastic crossover came to an end as on Wednesday the dollar ended gaining 0 47  on a bullish harami making me wonder if that s all there was to this recent pullback  And all the indicators have started rising off oversold  So the next logical move is higher   Euro  And the euro put in a hanging man on Wednesday giving up a quarter of Tuesday s gains  and forming a bearish stochastic crossover  That all looks bad and indeed last night it was already gapping down 0 57  making a lower close look likely on Thursday   Transportation  Like the Dow  the trans put in their own star Wednesday implying a possible reversal here too 

The charts are being particularly opaque tonight  We have some topping warnings but they all require confirmation  So while my personal bias is negative at this point I m going to have to officially call Thursday uncertain  Let s just say I m not going long from right here   Single Stock Trader
VZ also put in a topping star yesterday  making me think I was right to exit on Tuesday  I left a bit of money on the table but the alternative would be to sit in front of my computer all day waiting for the top and I just have too much other stuff to do for that  That becomes day trading  not swing trading  Anyway  I m expecting a move lower from here ",2015-02-05,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-uncertain-240907,240907

Recap  Another night where time has caught up with me so another abbreviated Night Owl  The research is done but the text  which does take a while to put together  is condensed   The technicals  The Dow  A strong and surprising gain here  Not yet overbought but near the upper BB so probably a bit more upside left but not much   The VIX  Last night s uncertainty resolved to the downside  Still not oversold so more downside left here   Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12  16 AM EST with ES down 0 06  ES put in a big bullish engulfing candle Thursday but stopped right on resistance at 2056   ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2034 00 to 2044 83  Tonight we remain above the new pivot so this indicator switches back to bullish  This pattern now looks toppy to me   Dollar index  Half a percent dump on Thursday plus oversold indicators plus a stochastic near a bullish crossover but without a reversal candle  still can t call this one higher yet   Euro  Transportation  No reversal here either  Star was non confirmed with a decent gain  No resistance hear and indicators continue rising but not overbought so now looks bullish 

I think a move lower is coming soon but it requires confirmation   the same thing I was saying last night  Only this time I mean it  So I m just going to call Friday uncertain  That s all she wrote  See you again Sunday night   Single Stock Trader  Inverted hammer  hanging man  overbought   still looks toppy to me   not an entry here ",2015-02-06,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/friday-uncertain-241036,241036

Recap
 It was looking really good for my conditional call on Tuesday as the Dow exploded right out the gate for 266 points after ES broke above its pivot  But then things started to unravel and by the bell the Dow ended down 27 points  Oh well  It s a good play but not perfect and it s not entirely clear why it didn t work So anyway now let s move on to Wednesday 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  On Tuesday the Dow produced the biggest spinning top I think I ve ever seen  stretching from 17 923 to 17 572  a 351 point intraday swing  But that action was enough to complete the bearish crossover I spoke of Monday night  So this chart looks even more bearish now   The VIX  On Tuesday the VIX gained another 5  exiting a descending RTC for a bullish trigger and a completed bullish stochastic crossover so it just looks like higher again on Wednesday  Note also that RSI has begun moving higher before ever getting near oversold   another bearish sign   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were lower at 1 21 AM EST with ES down 0 47   ES now has a clear new falling RTC going  a completed bearish stochastic crossover  OBV ran a crazy low negative 3 3 million  and some non trivial bearish knock on last night looking to make it a four day losing streak  There was zip  zero  nada bullish about this chart last night   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2028 67 to 2022 92  After a brief run higher ES has now fallen back well below its new pivot soe this indicator is once again bearish   Dollar  The dollar got its mojo back on Tuesday punching 0 34  higher on a bullish engulfing candle back to near its recent highs  It looks to me like its gearing up for another assault on those levels   Euro  After Monday s tall hanging man the euro rolled over on Tuesday saved only by recent support around 1 1769  It staged something like a comebacklast night  Calling the euro higher today  Wednesday  on that basis isn t catching the falling knife  it s catching the falling Acme safe  and that never ends well   Transportation  The trans put in a red spinning top Tuesday but with a new bearish crossover from a low level  this looks continued bearish 

Whatever uncertainty I had Monday night looks to have been resolvedlast night and the resolution is negative  Accordingly I m just calling Wednesday lower   Single Stock Trader VZ was one of only 11 Dow stocks that managed a gain on Monday  but did it on an ugly red gap up spinning top  Since VZ s rallies have been shorter than its pullbacks lately  at 47 18 I m calling this one a swing trade sell ",2015-01-14,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-lower-238408,238408

Recap
 It was another wild day on Wall Street Wednesday as the Dow plunged 128 points in the opening sixty seconds and kept on going lower until a post lunch rally kicked in to end  only  down 187  You can t blame oil  which actually rose for once  Who knows  maybe it was the Charlie Hebdo Put  whatever that is   Bottom line   that was then  this is now  And today is the only thing that matters  So it s back to the charts as we devine the future yet again   The Technicals   The Dow  Making it a four day losing streak  the Dow put in a fat hammer Wednesday  But it also made a bearish stochastic crossover  So hmmm   what s up with that  Well we got the lower BB  not too far away at 17 190 and support before that at 17 363 so right now I d say we could see more downside but it s limited  and a reversal is due soon   The VIX  The daily VIX is often the most telling chart of the day and so it was on Wednesday as the VIX gapped up 4 47  but on a red marubozu that just touched its upper BB at 23 12  While we still have a completed bullish stochastic crossover this sort of candlestick action looks distinctly bearish to me   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12  36AM EST with ES up a respectable 0 49   On Wednesday ES put in a nice hammer that nearly touched its lower BB intraday  Last night s rally  which had a bullish piercing pattern position moved the indicators back higher  Also  OBV is coming off its crazy low values  negative 4 2M   This provides some minor confirmation of the hammer and gives at least a suggestion of a move higher on Thursday   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2022 92 to 2002 75  That  plus an evening rally in ES was enough to put us back above the new pivot so this indicator now turns bullish 
Dollar  The dollar put in a tall doji  neither hammer nor hanging man on Wednesday as it continued to congest around 62 40   USDUPX   The bounce off the upper BB and indicators about to fall off overbought suggest that the next move is lower   Euro  Whereas the euro on Wednesday simply put in a classic star near the lower end of Tuesday s action  seemingly looking for support itself  Given that the last monthly close lower than this was November 2003  I d have to think a move higher is on the way  Or maybe the euro is just doing a Kodak and marching inexorably towards zero   Transportation  On Wednesday the trans dropped another 0 86  but on a red hammer that just touched its lower BB at 8585 intraday  The last two bottoms formed that way so I m going to guess there s at least even odds that we go higher on Thursday 

What a difference a day makes  Tuesday night things were looking bearish  and last night I was seeing a lot of positive signs  Enough in fact for me to change course and call today  Thursday higher Single Stock TraderI called a top in VZ at 47 18 Tuesday night and it indeed moved lower Wednesday to 46 97  But it s still not a buy again so for now we re on the sidelines watching ",2015-01-15,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thursday-higher-238521,238521

Recap
 Well after a three day weekend  there s not much to recap  However  we ll cut right to the chase because the big news this week is the imminent announcement of QE from the ECB and that s sure to be a market mover  So just bear in mind that my call right now is entirely modulo ECB 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  On Friday the Dow had a nice day with a bullish engulfing pattern that just touched its lower BB   The stochastic is close to a bullish crossover   The VIX  On Friday the VIX put in a classic bearish engulfing pattern that just touched the upper BB for a 6 43  loss and a bearish stochastic crossover   So this one looks lower Tuesday   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12 18 AM EST with ES up 0 15   perhaps in anticipation of an ECB move   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose again from 1999 17 to 2011 75  Even at that we remain above the new pivot so this indicator remains positive   Dollar  On Friday the dollar broke out of a seven day congestion zone but with an inverted hammer that just touched its upper BB  This might be a sign of a move lower  but lately that s always a risky call   Euro  The euro just keeps right on sinking  Nothing to see here  move along     Transportation  Like everything else the trans on Friday made a big bullish engulfing candle  up 1 25   turning all the indicators upwards  This one looks like there s more upside left 

Technically  I m seeing enough positive signs to call Tuesday higher  But that s all pending whatever the ECB announces  QE comes out  we look like heroes  No QE and we re zeros  For that matter  it may not happen Tuesday at all  It s just wait and see right now Single Stock TraderVZ had an unexpected breakout on Friday that took it right to its upper BB  We missed that move  But seeing as we re now overbought and at resistance  I want to wait and see what today brings here ",2015-01-20,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-higher-239002,239002

Recap
 I don t like Monday holiday weeks  They throw me off for the rest of the week  In any event  Tuesday s indecision reflected  I think  a general feeling that everyone must be on ECB watch  With that in mind  let s see if we can make any sense of Wednesday 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  The Dow had a big day Tuesday  down early triple digits  But the traders must have had a good lunch because soon thereafter it began moving higher  to end the day up a whopping 4 points  The resulting star is a reversal warning   but one which requires confirmation  So we re left to wait   wonder   The VIX  Monday night I wrote  this one looks lower Tuesday  and danged if that isn t just what happened  with the VIX down another 5   It s a gap down star but is also a bearish stochastic crossover so I don t think we re done going lower   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12 25 AM EST with ES up 0 17  on Tuesday  ES put in a small green spinning top but it was enough to break out of a descending RTC for a bullish setup  Indicators now rising just off oversold  a completed bullish stochastic crossover  rising OBV and positive pin action last night all point to continued higher today  Wednesday   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose from 1999 17 to 2013 58  And even with that jump we re still above the new pivot so this indicator continues to be bullish 
Dollar  I refrained from calling the dollar lower Monday night in the face of an inverted hammer  Good thing too because the dollar just kept right on climbing yesterday  up another half percent  The last time we had a monthly close this high was way back in March 2009  And still no end in sight despite impossibly overbought indicators   Euro  And naturally the euro remained in free fall Tuesday  this time closing at 1 1554  Extrapolating the descending RTC  it looks like the euro will hit parity by the end of the year  Remember  you heard it here first   Transportation  Monday night I wrote  This one looks like there s more upside left  and indeed there was with the trans up a nice 0 96  on Tuesday  This green marubozu also broke out of the descending RTC for a bullish setup  completed the bullish stochastic crossover  and sent the indicators higher  except for RSI which in an unusual move  went a bit lower   But it looks like the rally isn t over yet 

All the positive signs from Monday night remained in place last night so  ECB or no  I m just going to go ahead and call Wednesday higher Single Stock Trader
VZ gained a bit more on Tuesday but hit its upper BB  again though on a tall dragonfly doji  With overbought indicators  I d not buy here  If anything it might be time to start thinking about a quick short except that this isn t a good week for it  not with the ECB in the wings ",2015-01-21,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-higher-239165,239165

Recap
 The market just continued treading water on Wednesday as everyone awaits the big announcement from the ECB today  Right now the only question is whether or not it s already been baked in  Personally I don t think that s entirely the case  But perhaps the charts will shed some light on this subject as we continue on to the end of the week  
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  Just more uncertainty from the Dow on Wednesday  this time in the form of a lopsided spinning top that after another triple digit excursion resulted in just a 39 point advance  Technically though this chart remains bullish  probably reflecting the market s expectation of QE from the ECB   The VIX  Tuesday night I wrote  I don t think we re done going lower   Good thinking too because after a doji day the VIX just kept right on descending  down another 5 23  yesterday on a giant bearish engulfing candle  That s still nowhere near enough to drive the indicators oversold and the stochastic is still in full on bearish crossover mode so there are still no bullish signs on this chart   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12 22 AM EST with ES up 0 20   Tuesday night I wrote   a bunch of things  all point to continued higher on Wednesday   And sure enough  ES had a decent day yesterday   continuing out of its descending RTC for a bullish trigger  Indicators are now off oversold but continue rising and there was some more positive pin action last night  so it looks like the traders are expecting good news from the ECB today  Thursday   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot rose again from 2013 58 to 2021 50  Once again we remain above the new pivot so this indicator remains bullish   Dollar  The dollar had a rare down day on Wednesday but even so managed a green hanging man  What it does today will depend in large measure on the ECB  so no call here   Euro  Amazingly  the euro actually closed higher on Wednesday  its first green candle in seven sessions  But two inverted hammers does not make a rally  so we ll just have to wait and see what the ECB says today  That s sure to move the euro   Transportation  Tuesday night I wrote  it looks like the rally isn t over yet     And indeed it wasn t as the trans packed on another 0 45  on Wednesday with three white soldiers and a bullish trigger on the descending RTC exit  Indicators still not yet overbought though so I m going to guess there s still room to run here today 

Obviously the big news today is the ECB s QE announcement  Right now the technicals are looking like the market is gearing up to move higher so I m just going to assume that someone knows something I don t  not hard to do  and call Thursday higher

216723,438239,VZ,S P 500 Weekly Earnings Update  Core Growth On Track,opinion,"At breakfast this morning  while perusing John Butter s weekly Factset missive on S P 500 earnings  John noted that the expected Q4  14 earnings growth rate for the key benchmark is now nearing the post 2009 low that we saw in Q3  12 of flat to  0 1  year over year growth 
Per Thomson Reuters This Week in Earnings  as of Friday  January 23rd  2015  Q4  14 earnings were expected to increase 3 5   which if you have been tracking our prior blog updates from earlier this month where I noted that Energy is likely costing the S P 500 3    4  in quarterly earnings growth  Ex Energy  Q4  14 S P 500 earnings growth is likely 6    6 5  
And therein lies the issue  normally by this point in the quarter  the S P 500 earnings growth starts to tick higher  after the undue pessimism that seems to grip analysts the last month of each quarter and then the first few weeks of each quarter  dissipates and the cold light of actual earnings reports shows that the world isn t falling completely apart 
There is no question though  with the Financial sector negative revisions  many non operating and depending on how litigation expenses are treated  the 4th quarter and 2015 earnings outlook has become murkier 
That said  with the number of large cap Technology and Industrial companies poised to report this coming week  I do think Q4  14 earnings growth will be closer to  high single digits  than low single digits 
By the end of this coming week  about half of the S P 500 will have reported Q4  14 earnings 
For 2015  the Energy sector earnings  per Thomson Reuters   is a drag on the current S P 500 s  5 7  expected growth rate by  40   Assuming Energy is close to the 10  earnings weight   market cap of the S P 500  that means Energy is a 4  drag on expected S P 500 earnings growth  as it stands right now  Does that number get better or worse from here   Ex Energy then  2015 expected earnings growth  is still close to 10  at  9 7   at this point in time 
However  we are still quite early in 2015  and that expected earnings growth number will likely come down as we progress through the year 
So what s the point   The earnings picture is more clouded and murky than normal  given Energy s influence  We hear from a number of commodity   Basic Materials companies this coming week which has been a tougher sector than Energy 
The forward 4 quarter earnings estimate this week  fell to  123 49 from  124 91  which is a sharp drop of  1 42  which  combined with last week s sequential drop of  1 44  means that the forward estimate has declined by  1 86 over just the last two weeks 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate is 16 6 x 
The PEG ratio is now 4 36 
The earnings yield on the S P 500 is 6 02  versus last week s 6 19 
The y y growth rate of the forward 4 quarter estimate as of Friday  1 23 15 was 3 81   also down sharply over the last two weeks 
Since January 1  the sectors which have shown upwardly revised earnings expectations for the 4th quarter of 2014 are 

Consumer Staples to  0 2   from flat growth expected on January 1  15
Health Care to  18  expected growth from  17 6  growth expected in January 1  15
Industrials to  11  growth from 9 9  on January 1  15
Basic Materials to  0 6  from  2  as of January 1  15
Technology to  10 8  from  8 9  as of January 1  15

This is the more normal pattern we expect to see at this point in the year 
For full year 2015  only Telecom has seen better expected earnings growth for the full year after this week  than on January 1  15  to  5 7   from  4 9   which I consider somewhat important since Verizon  NYSE VZ  reported this past week  and the conventional wisdom is that there is a price war now occurring in the cellular business  Both Verizon and AT T  NYSE T  were slightly positive on the week 
AT T s weekly chart is poised at a very critical level  A break below  31 75    31 90 on this week s earnings report and the stock could be done  That being said  the 5 5  dividend yield on T is very inviting  and we ve actually used the stock as a bond proxy within client accounts  We exited that trade this week  and await T s earnings report this week 
Our largest sector overweights for clients remain Technology and Financials  the leaders from the 1980s and 1990s bull market  simply because relative to their expected growth rates  in my opinion  Tech and Financials offer the best value  and they  in my opinion  remain steeped in the stigma of the tech bear market in the early 2000s and the 2008 Financial recession ",2015-01-24,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/s-p-500-weekly-earnings-update:-core-growth-on-track-239532,239532
216739,438255,VZ,Telecom Stocks Down On Fears Of Lower Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Telecom stocks took a beating yesterday after leading wireless carriers  AT T Inc  NYSE T  and Verizon Communications Inc    hinted at expectations of lower profits in the ensuing fourth quarter owing to intense competition 

Yesterday  AT T s chief financial officer expressed fears of facing considerably wider fourth quarter churn rate than the year ago quarter  However  the company expects to add customers in spite of this  AT T also expects higher promotional expenses to hurt wireless service margins in the said quarter  Nevertheless  the company expects full year 2014 wireless service margins to remain flat or show an uptick in comparison to 2013 

On Dec 8  2014  Verizon Communications announced expectations of lower earnings in the final quarter of 2014 owing to higher promotional expenses and price cuts  These strategies are likely to impact the company s wireless segment EBITDA and EBITDA service margin as well 

Following these developments  investors  apprehensions surrounding the fourth quarter earnings of telecom companies have increased considerably  This is evident from the consequent share price slump of 2 9   4 1   3 8  and 8 3  for AT T  Verizon Communications  Sprint Corp  NYSE S  and T Mobile US Inc  NYSE TMUS   Inc  respectively 

Pricing War Intensifies

In an effort to expand customer base  telecom companies are spending heavily on promotion and are also offering lucrative discounts  For a limited period  AT T offered its Mobile Share Value customers a 15 GB shareable data plan for  100  Before this  AT T customers could avail only 10 GB of data for the same amount  This marks the second data plan price cut by the company in two months 

In the beginning of December this year  Sprint Corporation further intensified the wireless pricing war in the U S  after the company claimed that it will reduce the phone bills of AT T and Verizon Communications customers by 50  if they switch to Sprint s network 

On Dec 9  2014  T Mobile unveiled a new family plan   Simple Choice  Under this new scheme  the company is offering unlimited 4G LTE data at only  100 a month on a shared basis for two people  It also includes the option of adding a maximum of 10 users for charges of  40 for each extra line 

Our Take

We believe earnings and wireless service margins of telecom companies will be affected in the coming quarter owing to increased marketing expenses and higher churn rate  Moreover  lucrative discount will intensify competition among carriers as retail customers will have more options to choose from  However  the continuous shift of customers to high margin 4G LTE network and availability of more bandwidth after the completion of AWS 3 spectrum are some positives for big telecom operators ",2014-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/telecom-stocks-down-on-fears-of-lower-q4-earnings-235377,235377

Recap  It s always nice to have my first call of the year be correct and while I would have been happier if the market had been up 331 points instead of down  my analysis proved correct  Oil apparently is back to ruling the market s the black liquid took another dive on Monday  So let s take a look at the charts and see where we re going next 
 The Technicals 
 The Dow  It s looking a lot like a re run of last month as the Dow tanked 1 86  on Monday  I was right to be cautious about the reversal here  But last night we were quite oversold though the stochastic had yet to start curving around for a bullish crossover  So I d say the reversal is near  but maybe not Tuesday   The VIX  The VIX similarly ignored its own reversal sign Friday with a 12  pop on Monday  It s now gone overbought and the candle is an inverted hammer so there s more of a chance the next move could be lower from here   but it isn t a slam dunk   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were lower once again at 12 45 AM EST the ES was down 0 06   Yesterday the ES took another big leg lower and that was finally enough to drive all the indicators quite oversold  Notably  the stochastics has begun that characteristic curve around that signals its intent to form a bullish crossover  though we re not quite there yet  Meanwhile we re still in a descending RTC so it s too soon to call the all clear   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2050 75 to 2024 58  After a disastrous day Monday we remain well below the new pivot so this indicator remains bearish   Dollar  Last night I thought the dollar might take a rest after a big gap up  Nope  Instead it took another gap up to levels not seen since July 2010  And on the monthly chart  the current candle looks nothing like the inverted hammer that marked the 2010 top  So it continues to look like there s more upside left here   Euro  Meanwhile the beleaguered euro just kept doing what it does best   digging itself a hole  A very very deep hole  Last night I wrote  there s still no sign of an end to the current slide   not a very hard call to make  and wouldn t you know  we gapped down to close this time at 1 1947  I also wrote  Next support is 1 1763  a number I d not be surprised to see fairly soon   and I m sticking by that   Transportation  Last night I wrote  This is a fairly bearish chart   That proved to be the case indeed as the trans cratered 2 66  on Monday in a move I feel was overdone  It was enough to drive the indicators oversold but not to set up the stochastic for a bullish crossover  But this chart now has the look of a reverse exponential and that always means the end is near  Always 

I think we re getting near a reversal point but it doesn t look like the selling is done quite yet  Oil in particular seems to have no support at all  I do think we ll see a move higher later this week but not right away  Accordingly  I call today  Tuesday lower  I ll be happy to be proven wrong Single Stock TraderOK  in 2015 I m going to try something new   I call it the Single Stock Trader   I pick a stock and make buy sell calls on it  And the stock I pick is     Verizon  NYSE VZ   Why Verizon  Well I m a customer of Verizon  so I know something about the company  I also think they re overcharging me so I d like to get some of my money back   from them  Right now we re on the sidelines waiting for an entry point  VZ has just gone oversold but I don t see my favorite reversal signs  bullish stochastic crossover and RTC exit  yet  So we wait ",2015-01-06,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-lower-237483,237483

Recap  Yep  I figured as much  The Dow dumped another 130 points on Tuesday to make it five in a row lower for the broader market  But the interesting thing is that the market is actually easier to call when it s moving up or down than when it s just drifting sideways  So let s take a gander at how Tuesday s dive changes the picture   The Technicals   The Dow  The Dow just kept on tumbling Tuesday  enough to drive its indicators extremely oversold  Though we re not yet near the lower BB   the stochastic is in prime position to form a bullish crossover  I m over the catching the falling knife business so the most I ll say is that it looks like we re nearing a reversal here   The VIX  On Tuesday the VIX emitted what I believe to be a good reversal sign  It gained 6  but did it on a tall spinning top that just touched its upper BB along with quite overbought indicators and a stochastic that is ever so close to a bearish crossover  I give it better than even odds of moving lower today  Wednesday   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12  AM EST with ES up On Tuesday  ES extended its losing streak to five  giving up 2000 in the process but also driving the indicators extremely oversold  Meanwhile we actually saw an uptick overnight which caused a bullish stochastic crossover  This was different from lately so perhaps the selling is about over for now   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2024 58 to 2000 75  This time that was just enough to leave ES sitting right below the new pivot  A break above would be bullish   Dollar index  After a big gap up red candle Monday the dollar gained more on Tuesday but with a doji sitting right on the upper BB  Considering how overbought the dollar is short term  this just might be a sign that the dollar will take a rare break on Wednesday though the overall trend is still inexorably higher   Euro  And nothing new in euro land as we closed down again Tuesday  this time to 1 1921  The bots are shorting the euro hard in a  kick  em while they re down  effect with OBV now running an amazing 3 million  And last night was  surprise  still lower   1 1883  The 1 1763 I ve been talking about isn t so far away now   Transportation  What is it with the trans  You d think that of any sector  lower oil would help this one  But nooo  the trans continued to underperform in a big way on Tuesday down a big 1 65  to break support at 8747  Indicators are now quite oversold but we remain in a steep descending RTC  However  it s encouraging that we bounced off the lower BB  I d say that a reversal is at hand here  if not today then more likely Thursday 

We re getting a bunch of reversal signs in the charts  However  oil continued to move lower last night and the SPX Hi Lo index was only down to 68   not the level from which reversals come  The Morningstar Market Fair Value Index has though come way down from a year long high of 1 06 on 12 26 to 1 02 but I think we still need to wring out another tick or two here before turning bullish  So the picture is mixed  And because of the proximity of ES to its pivot I m going to try a conditional call  if ES can break above its pivot by mid morning Wednesday we ll close higher  else lower   Single Stock Trader  Recall that we re watching Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  here now  and only Verizon  And interestingly  VZ was one of the few Dow components that rose on Tuesday  And in fact it triggered all my classic indicators  So at yesterday s close at 47 18  I am now officially calling VZ a swing buy ",2015-01-07,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wednesday-depends-on-es-pivot-237616,237616

Recap
 Sometimes being nervous is a good thing  I called Monday lower in the face of some bullish candles and it paid off with a 97 point decline in the Dow  This market continues to run on oil but we ll look at the rest of the charts just in case 
 The Technicals
 The Dow  On Monday the Dow produced a fat red spinning top that only briefly managed to trade above Friday s close  The indicators have begun moving lower before ever hitting overbought   a bearish sign  And the stochastic is squeezing its lines in preparation for a bearish crossover Net net  this chart now looks bearish   The VIX  I didn t want to commit to this chart last night but the bullish piercing pattern prevailed and the VIX shot up 11 68  on Monday putting an end to its recent  and short  downtrend  The indicators have stopped moving lower and the stochastic is gearing up for a bullish crossover  Same story with VVIX so I d say we have a good shot at more upside today   Market index futures  Last night  all three futures were higher at 12 21 AM EST with ES up 0 15   ES looks bearish on a daily basis after Monday s fall as the stochastic just made a bearish crossover  The other indicators are confused though with RSI and OBV rose but momentum and money flow fell  Go figure   ES daily pivot  Last night the ES daily pivot fell again from 2042 83 to 2028 67  We remain about 3 5 points below the new pivot so this indicator remains bearish   Dollar index  Sunday night I called the dollar lower but it still managed to eke out a 0 04  gain  though admittedly on a stubby red candle  The indicators remain crazy overbought and this candle peeled off the upper BB  and it s in evening star configuration so I m going to hazard a guess that the dollar  gasp  goes lower on Tuesday   Euro  Sunday night I thought the euro might go higher yesterday  Silly me  It was one and done for that as the euro just gave up all of Friday s gains  though on a lopsided doji  But indicators are still oversold and still rising so I m taking a pass here today   Transportation  Falling about the same as the Dow yesterday  everything I wrote about that applies here too  End of story 



We now have a down Friday followed by a down Monday and that s a bearish sign  And with no sign of any new support in oil  the overall gestalt was fairly bearish last night  Which made me wonder why the futures were all moving higher  And with ES so close to its pivot  that makes it a good time to try another conditional call  So we re going to claim that if ES can break above its pivot by mid morning today  Tuesday   we ll close higher  otherwise lower Single Stock Trader Sunday night I wrote that  I still see more upside potential than downside risk at 46 76   And indeed VZ was one of the few gainers in the Dow yesterday  That was enough to generate a bullish RTC setup  And indicators continue to rise so this stock remains a buy  We ll sell when a sell signal appears  Right now  47 08 ain t it ",2015-01-13,The Night Owl Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tuesday-depends-on-es-pivot-238229,238229

216775,438291,VZ,Connecting Africa To The World,opinion,"Africa is the most promising investment destination of the next 20 years   And it won t be foreign development aid or Western generosity that makes the continent boom but rather the doggedness and ingenuity of its own people   As an investor  you want to be part of this by owning shares of some of Africa s world class companies 
Looking at Africa today  you see the same pioneering spirit that defied all odds to settle the American West in the late 1800s   Consider   a phone and internet infrastructure company based in southern Africa   Liquid has done something that no Western company would have the audacity to do  String fiber optic cable from South Africa  through Botswana and Zimbabwe  and across the Zambezi river into Zambia  a landlocked country deep in Africa s interior   All work had to be completed by day  as using work lights attracts wild animals  and a section of cable was dug up by elephants and had to be reburied   These are not problems faced by Verizon  NYSE VZ   or AT T  NYSE T    to say the least 
Liquid  unfortunately  is not a publically traded company   But my favorite play on the rise of Africa most certainly is  South African mobile phone operator MTN Group Ltd  JO MTNJ  which trades in the U S  under the OTC ticker symbol MTNOY 
MTN Group can be thought of as Africa s AT T or Verizon Wireless   It is headquartered in South Africa  but it has more than 200 million customers spanning 22 countries across Africa and the Middle East  And roughly a quarter of its subscribers are from Nigeria  Africa s largest economy and one of its fastest growing 
Why invest in African mobile phones  Let me count the reasons 
The mobile phone is the single most important possession of the emerging global middle class   We may think of our phones as primarily a source of entertainment   But in much of the developing world  a mobile phone is a vital lifeline to the connected world and even an important medium for money transfers   Africa will have its booms and busts along the way  but I do not see demand for mobile services abating any time in the foreseeable future 
Looking at the fundamentals  there is a lot to like about MTN Group stock  Revenues and earnings are up by more than a third since 2008  a period in which growth has been hard to come by in most markets  MTNOY trades at a reasonable price earnings ratio of 14 5 and pays a respectable  growing dividend currently yielding 4 6   In the past five years  it has grown its dividend by about 40    Though fair warning  Exchange rates can skew ADR payouts  
Is there anything not to like here 
Well  first I should state the obvious  MTN Group is based in Africa and does business in the world s most dangerous hotspots  It s a leading provider in Syria and Iran  for crying out loud  This is a company that is constantly exposed to macro risk 
But it s also a company that has proven very capable of operating in those environments over its history  There could be short term bumps  but overall  MTNOY should be able to navigate whatever unexpected surprises come its way  And its willingness to jump into markets that would give most executives heartburn gives it a first mover advantage in the countries with the fastest potential growth rates 
Currency fluctuations are also a problem  and weakness in the South African rand have been a major drag on the returns of U S  investors   But here too  I expect to see improvement   The rand is one of the cheapest currencies in the world  according to the    U S  investors should get a nice one two punch in the next year  a rising stock price in South Africa combined with a rising currency value should make the U S  traded ADR shares a solid performer

I ve made no secret of the fact that I m a major Africa bull over the long term  and I m serious when I say that  Africa is the new China   With Chinese labor costs rising and with India a chronic dysfunctional mess  the African continent is the only large geographic bloc with the potential for  Chinese like  growth in the decades ahead  It s the last major investment frontier 
African growth is real  Per capita GDP has more than doubled in the past decade  And   7 of the 10 fastest growing countries in the world are in Africa  The Economist noted last year that  Lion Economies  such as Ghana and Rwanda are reminiscent of Asian  Tiger Economies  South Korea and Taiwan at an earlier stage of development 
Importantly for my investment thesis  Africa is developing a robust middle class for the first time in its history  According to estimates by the African Development Bank and the World Bank  Africa s middle class is already well over 300 million people  or about a third of the population  It s a block of consumers comparable in size to the middle classes of China and India  More conservative estimates put the number closer to 120 million people  but we don t need to split hairs  Whichever estimate you use  we re talking about a lot of consumers 
Of course  not all African consumers spend their days sipping lattes and playing on iPads  Africa is a frontier market in the truest sense of the word  much of the continent is at a very low level of development  But the companies investing there today are the ones that will deliver a massive payoff for their investors down the road 
In his history of the world Why the West Rules For Now  Ian Morris writes about the  advantage of backwardness   and the logic applies to Africa today  When you are starting at zero   and let s face it  much of sub Saharan Africa is about as close to zero as you can get   you have little in the way of sunk costs and legacy technology to deal with  You can leapfrog existing technology and embrace the new  Why would you invest billions of dollars stringing phone lines across your country when you can skip that step altogether and just build cheaper cell towers

216792,438308,VZ,Will T Mobile Take Down Telecom Stocks ,opinion,"The latest buzz taking the wireless industry by storm is T Mobile US  Inc  s  MetroPCS Communications  NYSE TMUS   decision to abolish overage fees  unfolding the company s latest strategy under the Un carrier move it started last year  This implies that customers of T Mobile US will no more be required to pay extra charges for using voice  text or data service beyond their subscribed plan  
While the strategic decision is a welcome change for wireless users  it also calls for heightened competition and price war against major national players like AT T  Inc   NYSE T   Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE VZ  and Sprint Corporation  NYSE S   Further  it also presages a radical change in the pricing model of the industry  as these charges contributed significantly to the top line of the carriers 
T Mobile in its attempt to fortify its position in the U S  telecom industry eliminated annual service contracts  With the introduction of its Simple Choice plan last year it began gradually axing overage fees 
The company in its press release mentioned how 20 million Americans were affected by overage charges in 2013 and the top three players made around  1 billion by levying these fees 
T Mobile CEO John Legere  in his statement  took a clear stance on discarding overage fees and highlighted it as a predatory practice undertaken by wireless carriers  He also challenged other big players to abolish their overage fees that impose an added cost burden on consumers  
However  the street remains wary of T Mobile s strategic step as the company s share price went 1  down to  26 74 at the end of trading on Monday  We believe that in a market where prices remain highly competitive and every pricing strategy is imitated by close competitors  it will be difficult for other players to remain unaffected by T Mobile US s new move 
This indicates that we are to see more such changes in pricing policies of other companies in the coming days  which are likely to affect their overall revenue models  Especially for small carriers  the decision will mean a drastic change  which can hardly be affordable given the scale of operation and revenue generating abilities of these companies  As a result  we see a significant headwind hitting the market valuation of some of these telecom companies in the near future 
How the new changes will be accommodated by other carriers will presumably decide the market movements of these stocks  We believe that while T Mobile US has set a new trend by axing overage charges to lure customers  following it as an industry norm and adopting a new pricing model by all telecom carriers will depend upon the long term viability of such changes

216803,438319,VZ,Ordinary Americans Targeted In Government s Anti Terrorism Crosshairs,opinion,It s one of the most explosive national security leaks ever  And we re guessing that Edward Snowden  the whistleblower who ripped the lid off the story  is holed up in a dingy Hong Kong basement  sleeping with one eye open  The former CIA employee just revealed that he was the inside source behind shocking revelations about the level of government surveillance  a k a   snooping  on American citizens  Specifically  how a secret government court order demanded that Verizon  VZ  pass on details of millions of people s phone calls  Snowden also gave insights into the National Security Agency s murky intelligence gathering system  PRISM  which has obtained people s personal data from tech companies  He told The Guardian   The government has granted itself power it is not entitled to  There is no public oversight  The result is people like me have the latitude to go further than they are allowed to  My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them   Mission emphatically accomplished  Mr  Snowden  With the story blowing up  our nation s bureaucracy is already busy doing damage control  insisting that such surveillance methods are vital to America s national security  They re emphatically claiming that all the federal dollars pouring into cyber security efforts are incredibly worthwhile  I ll concede the feds this point  They sure know how to spend money  Cyber Spending Gone Mad It s no secret that high profile  damaging cyber attacks against governments and corporations are rising  In fact  defense officials recently warned that cyber attacks now pose the greatest risk to U S  national security  Former Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  says that  a cyber attack perpetrated by nation states or violent extremist groups could be as destructive as the terrorist attack of 9 11   In response   and totally lost among the Snowden headlines yesterday   the Pentagon just announced a new cyber security budget  It calls for  23 billion in spending through 2018  That includes cyber terrorism spending of  4 6 billion in the next fiscal year   up 18  on the  3 9 billion allocated this fiscal year  In fiscal 2015  the spending rises yet again   to  4 7 billion  Now  according to the U S  Cyber Command  more attention will be directed this year toward cyber attacks from China and Iran  Really  Or is it going into more spying on the American public  At the Forefront of National Security With the government allocating more money toward cyber security  it bodes well for companies working to safeguard sensitive government and corporate data  plus consumers  personal details  But some companies will fare better than others  As I ve explained to our WSD Insiders  the investment case is compelling for one particular company that s involved in a host of national security missions   from establishing secure networks to managing intelligence  Case in point  Its sales recently spiked almost 50   and it expects similar growth for the rest of this year  WSD Insiders are enjoying the ride  too  as the stock is up over 30  since the initial recommendation  There s still plenty of room to run  too ,2013-06-11,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ordinary-americans-targeted-in-government’s-anti-terrorism-crosshairs-170756,170756
216804,438320,VZ,SP 500 Earnings  Expect  3  to  5  Growth In Q1  14 ,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuter s This Week in Earnings  the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate for the S P 500 fell  0 16 last week to  118 65 from  118 81 
The P E ratio on the forward estimate now 15 6 x   which is slightly higher than what Factset says is the 10 year average P E of 13 8 x  
The PEG ratio as of Friday  3 28 is now 2 57 x   in line with where it has been over the last year  In the 2nd quarter of 2013  the PEG s 2013 max value was 3 71 x  and in December  13 the low print on our spreadsheet was 1 88 x  for the year 
The year over year growth rate of the forward estimate is now 6 09   down from last week s 6 12  and the prior week s 6 19   As readers know  I would like to see that growing rather than  contracting 
Our Q4  13 S P 500 earnings growth estimate of 10  was a pretty decent prognostication  the quarter looks like it will finish up at  9 9  y y earnings growth  i e  close enough for government work  While 5  S P 500 growth would very good for Q1  14  I expect the quarter will be between 3    5  
Difference between  top down  and  bottoms up  estimates  
In our recent post on S P 500 operating EPS from March 17th  2014 we explained to readers what the difference was between  top down  and  bottoms up  EPS estimates for the S P 500  Ive struggled with this for years  since I constantly have to remind myself that what we see and hear in the daily financial media is the  top down  estimate  which from what I can tell through the years is the lower of the two numbers  while once the quarter is reported and the numbers are  clean  the bottoms up estimate is locked and is the final number 
The point we are trying to make  is let s look at the top down and bottoms up estimate for 2013 and 2014 are currently  just to give readers a feel for the real numbers 
2013 top down S P 500 EPS estimate   108 85
2013 bottoms up S P 500 EPS estimate   109 69
2014 top down S P 500 estimate   117 37
2014 bottoms up S P 500 estimate   119 03
  Source  Thomson Reuters as of 3 28 14
Here is critical point that I think needs to be made about S P 500 earnings for 2014  when we get the quarterly bump on Tuesday  April 1  my guess is that the final 2013 S P EPS  actual  number will be  110 or just above  Versus the actual 2012 EPS of  103 80  the actual EPS percentage growth for 2013 will be 6   versus the 4 9  which is the 2013  actual  versus the 2013 top down estimate of  108 85 
My final point regarding this subject  is that I fully expect 2014  final  EPS to be  120 or greater  but we wont get the final number until this time next year  If we do  120 in EPS for the S P 500 in calendar 2014  that is  9 1  earnings growth for the year and will be the best rate of growth since 2011 s 15  
Again the point to be made is that mixing bottoms up and top down gets a distorted view of earnings growth  We have to compare apples to apples 
To conclude  S P 500 earnings and expected growth is NOT the problem with the market today  While Q1  14 earnings growth of 2  per Thomson Reuters  and  0 4  per Factset  we will likely wind up in the  3  to  5  range by the time we get to June 30th or so  even with the weather issues in Q1  14  While the big issue was weather in Q1  14  and we could see some pent up retail demand in q1  14 that was simply transferred from the first quarter  quarterly earnings growth will likely gain strength through 2014 
Q1  14   2 1   est  
Q2  14   8 3   est  and we will see normal erosion over next few months  
Q3  14   11   est  JP Morgan took huge charge in q3  13  thus Financials will lap easier comp s  
Q4  14   11 2   4th quarters have been strongest of the year for earnings growth since  08  
Bottom line  expect 9    10  S P 500 earnings growth for 2014  However the S P 500 rose 32  in 2013  on what will likely be 8  earnings growth  Market cap  sectors selection   style  selection  value vs growth  all matter too in generating excess return for client accounts 
Ranked from best to worst  expected  sector earnings growth for 2014 
Telco  15 9    Could be distorted by Verizon  Per Factset  if Verizon  NYSE VZ  excluded from Telco sector for Q1  14  earnings growth falls from  23 8  to  2   
Cons Disc  10 1   still a leadership sector

216840,438356,VZ,AT T  Reliable Blue Chip ForThis Rough Market,opinion,Here we go again  Market volatility is picking up  and it s causing an upset stomach for many an investor    There is an excellent remedy  though    tilt the equity portion of your portfolio toward large  high quality companies that provide essential products and services and pay strong dividends  Shares of these companies typically display well below average price volatility because investors can count on them  so a painful sell off is much less likely in rough markets  True  these stocks tend to be well beyond the fast growth phase  but you d be surprised at how many manage to pace or outperform the overall market over time  which is a notoriously hard thing to do  To find such a stock  you need only scan a list of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average  The one I d like to tell you about currently pays a dividend of  1 76 a share  which translates to a very attractive yield of just under 6  based on recent share prices    And talk about a stock that helps you sleep better at night    The price tends be much more stable than average  typically fluctuating only about half as much as the overall stock market  You can tell this from the beta coefficient  a simple statistic that compares a stock s price movement to that of the market  If the beta is 1 0  it means the stock moves with the market  The Dow stock I m referring to    AT T Inc   NYSE  T     has a beta of 0 46  so it s usually 54  less volatile than the market    For those of you worried about AT T s ability to compete and pay high dividends after last December s decision to abandon a  39 billion deal to acquire 4G wireless provider T Mobile USA Inc   don t let the setback deter you from owning this safe  high quality stock  Yes  owning T Mobile would have contributed greatly to AT T s profit making ability if the government hadn t foiled the deal with an antitrust lawsuit  But the fact is AT T will be just fine without T Mobile    For one thing  it s still the second largest U S  wireless carrier  with 101 million customers    89 million traditional wireless users and 12 million users of e readers and other non cellphone devices  And it s still the No  1 local phone company in 22 states  serving 40 million phone lines and 16 million Internet users    As a mature telecommunications firm  AT T doesn t grow revenue very quickly anymore  so I m satisfied with the 3  growth rate of the past decade  and I expect about the same growth rate going forward  Still  at this point in the firm s long history  revenue is astounding in plain dollar terms  It topped  126 billion in 2011 and is on pace to reach  129 billion in 2012  Assuming growth continues at 3   revenue will hit  146 billion in 2016    With plentiful free cash flow of  14 5 billion  AT T comfortably handled the  3 billion payment it had to make in the fourth quarter of 2011 to T Mobile s owner  Deutsche Telekom  OTC  DTEGY PK   for dropping the T Mobile merger  Analysts project free cash flow will climb by 4  annually for the next three to five years  rising to  17 7 billion in 2016    That s a reasonable estimate  in my opinion  because AT T can really rake it in    even without T Mobile  Remember  it still has a huge and growing base of wireless customers and a substantial base of traditional phone customers  Together  these customers account for about 70  of revenue  with wireless now contributing around 50  and landlines about 20   The rest comes from things like wireless data access and directory advertising    Clearly  the move toward wireless has hurt the landline division  but that business is still a cash cow  And AT T should continue to benefit from fast growth in demand for iPhones and other wireless handsets  The latest sign of this  In the first quarter of 2012  the company activated 4 3 million iPhones  a 19  increase compared with the first quarter of 2011  when it activated 3 6 million  Handsets should become even more profitable    analysts predict AT T and other wireless providers will cut back on subsidies  the practice of offering the actual phone for free or at a deep discount in hopes of more than making up the cost through user charges    AT T is also looking to spur growth through bandwidth acquisitions  like the  1 9 billion worth of 700 MHz frequency it purchased from Qualcomm on Dec  22  2011  Large amounts may soon also be purchased cheaply from Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE  VZ   which is seeking to sell its 700 MHz frequencies in order to pursue other acquisitions  The added 700 MHz capacity will help AT T expand its burgeoning Long Term Evolution  LTE  network  LTE is widely considered the obvious successor to current wireless technology    Risks to Consider  Competition is intense  and it could become even more so if small wireless carriers decide to compete aggressively on price  A price war would almost certainly hurt cash flow  and this could slow or stagnate dividend growth  Since there s no impending price war  I m confident AT T will remain the safe  reliable dividend payer investors have come to expect  Estimates for the dividend to climb by 3  a year going forward are easily achievable  in my opinion  considering AT T s strong cash position today and the high likelihood of maintaining that position in the future    by Tim Begany,2012-04-29,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/at-t:-reliable-blue-chip-forthis-rough-market-121602,121602

all stocks with a yield over four percent Two industries are strongly represented  The domestic and foreign telecom services industry  In my view  these industries offer values for investors but for
