ll now turn the call over to Luc to provide an overview of the quarter  Luc Luc Seraphin    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Rahul  and good afternoon everyone  2019 was a year of tremendous progress  propelled by strong execution across the company  Guided by our strategic objectives  we continue to focus on our core strength in semiconductor to optimize the company for operational efficiency and to leverage our strong cash generation to reinvest for growth As a result  we had an excellent performance in Q4 and exceeded expectations with revenue of  59 9 million  delivering  224 million for the full year  We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet  generating  35 4 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter  This brought our total cash from operations for the year to  128 5 million  which is up  41 4 million or 48  over 2018 In 2019  we redefined our perimeter with significant M A activity throughout the year  focusing the company on silicon IP and chip solutions for the semiconductor market  We ended the year strong  completing both the sale of our Payments and Ticketing business to Visa  as well as the purchase of the secure silicon IP and protocols businesses from Verimatrix  formerly Inside Secure Much like the purchase of digital controller company  Northwest Logic  earlier in the year  the Inside Secure teams and offerings augment our portfolio and expand our market position in data center  AI  networking and automotive  As we have mentioned previously  neither acquisition materially impacted our 2019 results  but we expect both to have a positive impact on the business and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2020 In addition to the successful closing and integration of our acquisitions  we continue to execute and demonstrate success across our product lines throughout the year  2019 was the second consecutive year of record revenue from products  with combined results from our chip and silicon IP businesses  delivering over 64  growth year over year from 2018  Memory interface chips was the fastest growing segment of the business  with revenue almost doubling year over year  Driven by increased OEM and data center qualifications  we saw steady gains in our DDR4 memory interface chip market share and delivered the third consecutive quarter of record revenue Silicon IP also delivered record revenue in Q4 and drove sustained growth throughout the year  up 29  from 2018  We had numerous design wins at Tier 1 SoC customers across our target markets for both interface and security IP solutions  Most recently  we announced the win at Enflame for both our HBM2 PHY and controller as part of their next generation AI training chip  In addition  the team continues to build out our portfolio of solutions  addressing the fast growing and demanding applications in AI and 5G and data center with the launch of our comprehensive PCIe Gen 5 interface solution in Q4 In closing  Q4 was a fantastic quarter  We delivered record revenue from both chip and silicon IP and robust cash from operations  For 2019  we executed on our strategic objectives and successfully realigned the company around our core strength in semiconductor  while strengthening the product portfolio  Now looking forward  we will continue to capitalize on high growth market trends favorable to Rambus  with market share gains for chips  alongside the memory cycle upswing and growth in the strong semi IP market capitalized by AI and 5G  we will be very well positioned for continued success in 2020 and beyond With that  I ll turn the call to Rahul to discuss the quarterly financial results  Rahul Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Luc  I d like to begin with our financial results for the fourth quarter  Let me start with some highlights on Slide 6  As Luc mentioned  we continue to execute on our product businesses and delivered solid financial results above our revenue and earnings expectations We ve adopted ASC 606  using the modified retrospective method  which does not restate prior periods  but rather runs the cumulative effect of the adoption through retained earnings as a beginning balance sheet adjustment  Any comparison between our results under ASC 606 and prior results under ASC 605 is not an accurate way to track our Company s progress  We will continue to provide operational metrics such as licensing billings to give our investors better insight into our operational performance We delivered revenue of  59 9 million and licensing billings of  63 8 million  Revenue was higher than our expectations due to strong buffer chip sales  We have a very strong balance sheet and ended the year with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  408 million  up from the previous quarter  For the year  cash from operations was  128 5 million  up nicely from last year  with  14 9 million of capital expenses  Free cash flow for 2019 was  13 7 million Our continued execution on our strategy and our operational discipline has yielded excellent financial results and a strong balance sheet that afford us the flexibility on our strategic initiatives  We continue to leverage our high margin historic businesses to fuel growth in adjacent areas where we have strong technical and market expertise  with a focus on chip and silicon IP Now let me talk you through some revenue details on Slide 7  Revenue for the fourth quarter was  59 9 million  Above our expected range due to market share gains in our buffer chip business  Royalty revenue for the fourth quarter was  19 4 million  while licensing billings was  63 8 million  The difference between licensing billings and royalty revenue primarily relates to timing  as we don t always recognize revenue the same quarter we bill our customers Going into additional detail  our product revenue was  26 6 million  consisting primarily of our buffer chip business  Our contract and other revenue was  13 9 million  consisting primarily of our silicon IP business  As we expected due to the timing of the close  our acquisition of the silicon IP  secure protocols and provisioning business from Verimatrix did not have a material impact on the fourth quarter For the year  our product revenue was  72 9 million  almost doubling year over year  Similarly  our contract and other revenue was  41 7 million  up 29  year over year  Our growth of these areas underlies the benefit of our focus and strategy  We recorded  0 9 million of revenue and  2 3 million in operating costs and expenses associated with our payments and ticketing business in Q4 prior to the sale to Visa Let me walk you through our non GAAP income statement on Slide 8  Along with our solid revenue performance in Q4  we met our profitability targets on a non GAAP basis  Cost of revenue  plus operating expenses or what we refer to as total operating expenses for the quarter came in at  62 3 million  This was toward the high end of our expectations due to higher COGS related to record buffer chip revenue  With higher revenue and disciplined execution on spending  our profit was nicely above our expectations We ended the quarter with headcount of 685  down from 840 in the previous quarter primarily due to the divestiture of our Payments and Ticketing Business  We added approximately 65 employees through our acquisition of the silicon IP secure protocols and provisioning business from Verimatrix  Under ASC 606  we recorded  4 5 million of interest income related to the financing component of our fixed fee licensing agreements for which we ve recognized revenue  but not yet received payment  We incurred  0 6 million of interest expense related to the convertible notes issued in Q4 2017  This was offset by incremental interest income related to the return on our cash portfolio After adjusting for non cash interest expense on our convertible notes  this resulted in non GAAP interest and other income for the first quarter of  5 5 million  Excluding the interest income related to the significant financing component related to ASC 606  this would have been  1 million  Using an assumed flat rate of 24  for non GAAP pre tax income  non GAAP net income for the quarter was  2 4 million Now let me turn to the balance sheet details on Slide 9  We are very pleased with the strength of the balance sheet  Cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  407 7 million  up significantly from the previous quarter as cash from operations of  35 4 million and the proceeds from the sale of our Payments and Ticketing Business to Visa was offset by cash used for the acquisition of the silicon IP secure protocols and provisioning business from Verimatrix Year over year we ve grown cash by  130 million  Our strong balance sheet allows us the flexibility to invest strategically in our patent portfolio and our growing product programs  as well as provides firepower for additional inorganic activity At the end of Q4  we had contract assets worth  528 million  which reflects the net present value of unbilled AR related to licensing agreements toward the company has no future performance obligations  I expect this number to continue to trend down as we bill and collect for these contracts  It s important to note that this metric doesn t represent the entire value of our existing licensing agreements as several customers have royalty based agreements that allow us to recognize revenue each quarter under ASC 606 As the sale of our payments and ticketing business did not close until October 21st  at the end of Q3  we classified the assets and liabilities for this business as held for sale  The net carrying amount of this business as of the third quarter was  86 5 million  considering assets  liabilities and cumulative translation adjustments After considering the  75 million purchase price and transaction costs  we recorded a recovery of  1 9 million in Q3 that offset the impairment charge in our Q2 GAAP results  In Q4  we recorded another recovery of  7 7 million upon the sale of this business  which resulted in a cumulative year to date loss of  7 4 million after considering the net carrying amount of this business of  86 1 million and net proceeds of  78 6 million Fourth quarter capex was  6 4 million and depreciation was  4 9 million  Full year 2019 capex was  14 9 million and depreciation was  15 2 million  As I mentioned earlier  we delivered  113 7 million of free cash flow in 2019 Looking forward  I expect roughly  16 million of capex for the first quarter and roughly  26 million for the full year of 2020  half of that total amount is related to the relocation of our headquarters facility  I also expect depreciation of roughly  5 million for the first quarter and roughly  20 million for the full year of 2020  Overall  we have a strong balance sheet with limited debt and expect to continue to generate strong cash from operations in the future Now let me turn to our guidance for the first quarter on Slide 10  As a reminder  our forward looking guidance reflects our current best estimates and our actual results could differ materially from what I m about to review  In addition to financial outlook under ASC 606  we ve also been providing information on licensing billings  which is an operational metric that reflects amounts invoiced to our licensing customers during this period  adjusted for certain differences As you see in the supplemental information we provided on Slide 15 of our earnings deck  licensing billings closely correlates with what we have historically reported as royalty revenue under ASC 605  With that said  under ASC 606  we expect revenue in the first quarter between  44 million and  50 million  We expect royalty revenue between  7 million and  13 million  We also expect licensing billings between  60 million and  66 million We expect Q1 non GAAP total operating expenses  which includes COGS  to be between  64 million and  68 million  Under ASC 606 non GAAP operating results for the first quarter is expected to be between a loss of  24 million and  14 million  For non GAAP interest and other income and expense  which excludes interest income related to ASC 606  we would have expected  1 million in income  which includes  0 6 million of interest expense related to the notes due in 2023 Based on the new tax legislation passed at the end of 2017  we expect our pro forma tax rate in 2020 to remain consistent with our 2019 pro forma tax rate of roughly 24   The 24  is higher than the statutory rate of 21   primarily due to higher tax rates in our foreign jurisdiction  As a reminder  we pay roughly  20 million of cash taxes each year  driven primarily by our licensing agreements with our partners in Korea  We expect non GAAP taxes to be between a benefit and    of  6 million and  3 million in Q1  We expect our Q1 share count to be roughly 115 million basic and diluted shares outstanding  This leads you to between a non GAAP loss per share of  0 15 and  0 09 for the quarter Looking ahead to 2020  I expect Q2 down 2   because of our typical seasonality and then modest growth in Q3  I expect Q4 to be roughly flat with Q3 due to the structure of our licensing agreements  As we ve communicated previously  structural step downs in several of our long term licensing agreements impacted our 2019 revenue Last year our excellent product growth and operational efficiencies offset the structural step downs  In 2020  we had the last of structural step downs under our current license agreements  after which patent licensing billings will level off  As we look to the future  I expect subsequent revenue growth in our product businesses to provide growth on both the top line and bottom line We expect to deliver gross margins in the 55  to 60  range  From an expense perspective  we expect COGS to move in line with product shipments through the year  We anticipate operating expenses will come down gradually through the year due to the operational efficiencies we ve already implemented  All told  these changes reflect  5 million of higher revenue and  0 02 of higher EPS than current analyst consensus estimates    expectations for 2020 Let me finish with a summary on Slide 11  We re proud of the solid performance by our team and the progress we continue to make against our strategic initiatives to drive long term profitable growth  We ve had a significant amount of M A activity as we refocused our company and are very pleased with our execution on organic and inorganic growth  While we understand that ASC 606 added a level of complexity to our financial reporting  it s important to reiterate that the underlying financial strength of our business remains strong  reflected in our demonstrated ability to generate cash We have refocused our product portfolio around Rambus  core strengths in the semiconductor industry  improved our operational efficiency and profitability  generated solid cash from operations and leveraged our strong balance sheet to support our strategic initiatives  We continue to focus on our core markets and are well positioned for 2020 and beyond With that  I ll turn the call back over to Christine to begin the Q A  Could we please have our first question Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  Rahul   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  Thank you and congrats on the solid results and guide  My first question is  your licensing billing is better for both Q4 results and Q1 guide  Can you talk about what s driving the upside other than maybe timing of some of the contracts  And related to that  I appreciate you going through    Rahul  going through the quarter by quarter for the next few quarters  but as you kind of look past beyond    look past 2020  I think you talked about being    licensing billing being roughly flat after seeing structural step down in 2020  Are there any other steps down that we should be aware of going forward and what type of licensing structures are you seeing in recent deals Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Thanks  Sidney  And let me see if I can answer your question  First in terms of the trends of licensing billings and back and forth  it s really just related to the structural agreements that we signed over the last several years  Our existing agreements all have disparate terms and conditions in terms of how we bill and invoice our partners  In some cases  they are royalty based and that will show up in our reported revenue  In other cases  they re fixed payments that are consistent on a quarterly basis and that may just show up in our licensing billings  And in other cases  the payments are structured in a stair step faction either going up and down or coming    going straight or even coming down in some cases In any case  I wouldn t read too much into the quarterly changes between royalty revenue and licensing billings  I d refer you back to the guidance that we provided at our Analyst Day  where I think we said at the midpoint  licensing billings for us in 2020 would be about  230 million  So that s what I kind of anticipate over the course of this year  If I recall your other questions  you specifically talk about what that means look like going forward  As I mentioned in prepared remarks  after 2020 we expect this to be very stable over the next several years  We now see the last of the structural changes in 2020 and that was part of the quarterly guidance that I gave in my prepared remarks where I expect Q4 to be roughly flat with Q3  otherwise I would have expected Q4 to be up nicely from Q3  due to increased product revenue Looking forward  most of our licensing billings are related to the three big agreements with the DRAM industry and I think we can talk certainly there in terms of our expectations for renewals out in the future  but we feel very confident that our patent portfolio and the investments we make there and our ability to maintain that very profitable business for us in the future Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  That s super helpful  My follow up question is on 5G infrastructure  in the past  you talked about benefiting from the deployment of 5G infrastructure  especially based on the PCIe Gen 5 interface  Can you give us an update on that market  What you re seeing there  especially after a very strong build in the second half of last year  And do you have any issues  given the big portion of that build is coming from one big Chinese customer there Luc Seraphin    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Hi  Sidney  This is Luc  So we continued to see traction from the 5G infrastructure development and deployment  And as we explained in earlier calls  the reason is that  we are further down in the value chain  We actually provide IP to people who build the chips for that 5G infrastructure  We kind of see the revenue before the others do  One of the things that has happened to us over the last year is the acquisition of Northwest Logic allowed us to develop a complete solution for 5G  We have combined our PHY with their controller to have a complete 5G PCIe Gen 5 solution and we continued to see traction with several customers as we move forward Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  Maybe one last question  Sticking with the 5G chipset side    memory chipset side  I think you mentioned revenue in the  75 million to  95 million range and that s up from roughly  70 million in 2019  which doesn t seem like a lot of growth  How much DDR5 revenue are you expecting in the 2020 outlook  And can you talk about your market share expectations based on the design wins    design win activities for the next generation 40 nanometers and 10 nanometer server products  Any color would be helpful  Thanks Luc Seraphin    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Great question  Sidney  So I think the revenue from DDR5 is going to be very modest in 2020  We will see the very initial shipments toward the end of the year in the volumes  So 2020 is still going to be a DDR4 market for buffer chip  The growth will depend on a couple of factors  We see the upswing of the market after a soft year last year  in general terms  In addition to that  the speed of the growth will depend on how fast the market is going to transition from  you know  the current Intel platform to next generation platform  So we certainly see growth potential for our business  which we give you    we gave you    we just gave you guidance Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  Thank you so much Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Sidney OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse  Your line is open John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystYes  Good afternoon guys  Thanks for letting me ask the question  Well  I guess  for my first question  I think you said in your prepared comments that the Verimatrix acquisition added very little to the calendar fourth quarter  I m wondering how we should think about its contribution both to the calendar first and to the full year Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  That s a great question  John  And yes  because of the timing of the close  there was minimal impact to our Q4 financial statements regarding the Verimatrix acquisition  What we said at our Analyst Day is that we expected roughly  20 million of revenue associated with that acquisition in 2020  And I think both that as well as the acquisition of Northwest Logic we said would be marginally accretive for us in 2020  Right now  I would just simply anticipate a roughly linear trend in terms of how much additional revenue we d see in 2020 associated with that acquisition of the Verimatrix assets  So I d say anywhere from  4 million to  5 million a quarter through 2020  Hopefully  that helps answer your question John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystIt does  And then maybe as a follow up to Luc  just given the cash flow generation of the business model  Should we think about 2020 as being another year of additional tuck in acquisitions  Or is this a year where you  kind of  try to rationalize and exploit the acquisitions you did last year  And if the former    how should we think about the acquisition strategy and potential targets Luc Seraphin    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thank you  John  So in terms of rationalizing the acquisitions we just made  we re moving really fast  the integration of both companies is going quite well and fast  And I think both are up and running  I would say  at this point in time  So we re quite pleased with that  It went really  really fast in terms of integration and focused on growing the business Now we will continue to look very actively at possible acquisitions to strengthen our position either in the memory interface arena or in the embedded security arena  This is very  very active activity that we had internally  And because we do have this ability to generate cash  we have the ability to move fast if any of these opportunities comes to us with a high level of interest  So we will continue to do what we do  and we ve been very fast in integrating the two we did last year  so no change there John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks a lot guys Luc Seraphin    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  John OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Suji Desilva from Roth Capital  Your line is open Suji Desilva    Roth Capital    AnalystHi  Luc  Hi  Rahul  Congratulations on the progress you re showing in the strategy of focusing on the core  so congrats on that  Rahul  I just wanted to sharpen my pencil here on some of the    maybe the 605 kind of equivalent numbers here  Fourth quarter  19  I was getting  104 3 million and EPS around  0 28   0 29  Does that sound like it s in the ballpark Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo Suji  we can t produce 605 numbers anymore  But I think what you re doing is you re substituting licensing billings for what we reported as royalty revenue  And I think when you make that substitution and run it through  I d get the same numbers that you would get Suji Desilva    Roth Capital    AnalystGreat  And most importantly  for the guidance  I think you re coming in    it s implying something around  100 million  a slight sequential decline  and  0 23 as you start out the year  I think that s kind of    I want to just make sure that that s also ballpark  It sounds reasonable as well Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  And again  that s not numbers that we provide  But if I were to do the same math that you did  I d get in the same place  And that decline is really just seasonal between the Q4 and Q1  We were delighted with our Q1 results  both on the top line as well as from a cash perspective Suji Desilva    Roth Capital    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  And then switching to some of the business segments  the silicon IP business up 29  year over year  How much of that is organic versus inorganic  Was that all organic  And if so  what s a more normalized growth opportunity that s sustainable for that business  It sounds like it s on a tear really from a design ramp perspective  So curious how that can flow through the next year or two Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  no  that s a great question  So as I mentioned  we had minimal revenue from the assets we purchased from Verimatrix  We did have a couple million dollars of revenue associated with the acquisition of Northwest Logic that closed in Q3  I think even without the acquisition  though  it was a very strong growth year over year  and we re very pleased with the performance  Our memory IP business has grown very nicely over the last several years and delighted with that growth rate  And I think we have a great opportunity to have growth in our security business as well  Looking forward  I would expect both of those to continue to grow  And with the acquisition of those businesses  we could be in a similar growth rate in 2020 over 2019 Suji Desilva    Roth Capital    AnalystYes  that s helpful color there  And then on memory buffer  you started to talk about this  but where    what do you think your share is now  And where do you think it can go as you ramp up here in 2020  Obviously  the size of the market would be a factor there  And then is there any concentration in your current revenue run rate from a hyperscale customer or two  Or is it diversified kind of from the end customer perspective  not the memory customers Luc Seraphin    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  great question  Suji  Look  we estimate our share in 2019 to be around 15   and it keeps growing  We ll surely go to 30  when we go to DDR5  because we were the first in DDR5  so we expect to have at least one third of the market  And between now and then  we will continue to increase share  In terms of the structure of our customers  over time  our end customer profile has diversified  So the risk to the business has diminished  As we grow the business  the end customer has diversified  and as such our risk has diminished in that area Suji Desilva    Roth Capital    AnalystOkay  great  Congrats again guys  Thanks Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Suji OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is open Gary Mobley    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHey guys  Congrats on a strong quarter  strong finish to the year  Rahul  I wanted to go back to some of your comments about fiscal year  20 guidance  If I recall correctly  at your Analyst Day in September  you gave sort of preliminary 2020 outlook  which included billings of  230 million contract and other revenue of  80 million and product revenue of  85 million for a total of  395 million  I just wanted to clarify  you re suggesting that perhaps now we re starting the year out and maybe just looking  5 million better  And if so  where does it come from in that three different categories Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  And again  Gary  we don t add those numbers up  because that wouldn t be something you do it from a GAAP perspective  But what I said in our prepared remarks is we think we re going to be about  5 million better than where our current analyst estimates are  And I think that s going to come predominantly from buffer chip and silicon IP  As I mentioned previously  the structure of our patent licensing agreements are fairly set  So those are largely predictable  But I think it s going to come from buffer chip and potentially the silicon IP businesses Gary Mobley    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  I want to switch gears and talk about the profitability of everything other than your patent licensing business  And so in the just reported fourth quarter  using that billings number as a substitute for royalties  you would get to roughly non GAAP operating income of  42 million  In years past    in quarters past  even maybe as recently as the midpoint of this past year  I would imagine that 90  of your operating profit came from the patent licensing side  But seemingly  now you re getting a lot    much larger contribution presumably from your buffer chip business  So can you speak to the profitability of that business  where it sits today  where you see it materializing in 2020 Luc Seraphin    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So I ll start  Thanks  Gary  We re pleased with the performance of our buffer chip business as we grew the business and that business would become profitable  And this is a high leverage business  So we can marginally invest in that business to continue to generate growth  As we move forward and look forward  that business is going to continue to be profitable and more profitable On the IP side  what we ve done over the last year is  we have refocused our portfolio of offerings on to products and solutions that show high demand in the market  We mentioned earlier the PCIe Gen 5 solution using our PHY and our controller  So by focusing the portfolio and making portfolio decisions  we re going to accelerate the profitability of that IP business  That s the way to look at it Gary Mobley    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  And related to that  I think in the second half of fiscal year  19  your product gross margin was around 65   And that s about 10 percentage points higher than the first half  And so I m curious to know how much of a trend line is the buffer chip business running  compared to what you had most recently been guiding for  And can you give us sort of an update on how you view the gross margin profile of that business in 2020 Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Gary  That s a great question  I think what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is I expect that gross margin for our product business to be in the 55  to 60  range in 2020  We had some quarters with particularly high margins  and that s just simply a function of product mix as well as how much we were shipping  I think as we become larger and larger and I hope to beat the estimates that we provided today  but as we become larger and larger  then any small variation in mix will have a muted impact in terms of what the gross margins look like But I feel pretty comfortable with the 55  to 60  gross margin  And as Luc mentioned earlier in your question about leverage on the product portfolio  because we have that product portfolio and as we ramp  there s minimal incremental investment  and so there s a pretty nice fall through then to the bottom line  And I think that s what you saw also in Q4 Gary Mobley    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  I had a sort of final off the wall question about IP protection  So as part of the phase one US China trade agreement  we had some IP protection clauses built into the trade agreement  So I m wondering if that changes any enforceability of your patents as it relates to some of the developers of China memory Rahul Mathur    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo Gary  it s an interesting question  I think it s something that s still continuing to develop in terms of really what s going to happen with China and the trade balance  The way I look at it is that we are unique in that our direct exposure to China is actually relatively small  though  obviously  anything that impacts our customers long term will impact us  I think for us  China is actually an opportunity from a patent licensing perspective  What we see is  as the tech industry in China continues to grow and diversify and we re making great progress in our business areas  that it becomes an opportunity Now specific to licensing  China is investing tens of billions of dollars in the semiconductor industry  And as the industry grows  so does our relevance and opportunity in the market  So there are strategic options we have for patent licensing  and I think engaging earlier will actually yield benefits to us as well as our partners  I think one of the things that we see is that for our partners  taking an early license provides credibility and allows them to compete in the global marketplace So all told  we re actively engaged in China and continue to monitor the geopolitical environment  Technical Issues  optimistic that our business will continue to grow  I think one of the things that I would see is that if we are able to announce a license agreement in China    typically  our license terms are five years to seven years  and that s an early demonstration that the ongoing global relevance and validity of our portfolio will be there for many years to come  well beyond the terms of our existing licensees  And I think that would be a nice external validation  But to what you said earlier  I think we also continue to monitor what happens from a global macroeconomic perspective  but continue to invest in our portfolio and feel we re going to be very well positioned to take advantage of China  as well as to continue to maintain our patent portfolio renewals going forward Gary Mobley    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay

189157,410673,RMBS,Has Applied Optoelectronics  AAOI  Reached Value Stock Territory ,opinion,"Shares of Applied Optoelectronics   NASDAQ AAOI   surged about 2 3  in late afternoon trading Tuesday a rare sign of life for a stock that has been battered over the past several months  Even with today s gains  AAOI is down about 75  from its mid summer highs  including a nearly 20  dip in the month since its latest earnings report 
Nevertheless  Applied Opto s slump have led some investors to consider buying the trendy stock on the dip  But has AAOI really entered value stock territory  or should investors continue to avoid this volatile pick  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Earnings
Applied Optoelectronics reported its latest quarterly financial results on Feb  21  The company posted non GAAP earnings of  0 89 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 82  That type of surprise typically pleases investors  but there were a number of negatives to focus on as well 
Notably  Applied Opto saw quarterly revenues of  79 9 million  which came in well below our consensus estimate of  86 2 million  Management also said that it expects 1Q18 revenues in the range of  67 0 million to  71 0 million and non GAAP earnings in the range of  0 28 to  0 34 per share  Heading into the report  our consensus estimates were calling for Q1 revenues of  88 4 million and earnings of  0 74 per share 
That lackluster guidance was enough to send investors fleeing in the aftermath of the report  and AAOI has yet to recover from this post earnings slump 
Current Valuation
Applied Opto s post earnings slump has made its shares look awfully cheap compared to its industry peers 
 
AAOI s peer group is a Zacks defined set of companies that includes similar tech suppliers like Ambarella   NASDAQ AMBA    Lattice Semiconductor   NASDAQ LSCC    Rambus   NASDAQ RMBS    and Impinj   NASDAQ PI    These companies are not directly comparable with Applied Opto  but they help show how investors are valuing these types of tech firms right now 
AAOI clearly has an attractive valuation compared to these other stocks  The company also has a  B  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  and on top of its attractive Forward P E  the stock s P S of 1 3 and PEG of 0 8 make it look undervalued at its current levels 
However  our Style Scores are best used in tandem with the Zacks Rank  In other words  the strongest value opportunities are those that present both a great Value grade and a strong Zacks Rank  AAOI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   so we know that it is not one of these strong value stocks 
But why is Applied Opto sitting at such a low rank right now  Let s take a closer look at the company s latest earnings estimates to find out 
Estimate Revision Trends
The Zacks Rank focuses on an analyst estimates and estimate revisions to determine which stocks have an improving outlook and which stocks are trending in the wrong direction  Here s a look at the revision trend for AAOI 
As we can see  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down significantly on the back of universal downward agreement among revising analysts 
While some might think the worst is over for AAOI  analyst estimates actually tend to come down gradually over time  That means that AAOI could continue to see more volatility as its outlook worsens  The stock might have interesting valuation metrics right now  but now all stocks that have been sold off deserve to be bought on the dip

RMBS Technical Analysis



RMBS opened trading yesterday at  13 76 which was down from the previous day s trading close of  13 89  RMBS closed trading yesterday at  13 98 and crashed down after market to  13 22  equivalent to a 5  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time RMBS traded below these levels we have to go back to December 5th  2016 when it traded at  12 98 

Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down RMBS had already been in an overall upward trend dating back to December 9th  2016 when it traded at  14 27  RMBS has a float of 109 71 million shares and traded 1 58 times the normal daily trading volume on Monday  For trading purposes  I would like to see RMBS open trading on Tuesday below  13 50 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 15 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

189191,410707,RMBS,Rambus To Buy Certain Serial Link IP Assets From Semtech,opinion,"Technology licensing company Rambus Inc    NASDAQ RMBS   inked a definitive agreement to buy certain serial link assets of Semtech Corporation s   NASDAQ SMTC   Snowbush IP for about  32 5 million in cash plus  additional payments based upon specific new product sales through the end of 2022  
Rambus expects the deal to be wrapped up by the third quarter of fiscal 2016  The completion of the buyout is subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions  Post acquisition  the purchased assets will be included in Rambus Memory and Interfaces Division  With this strategic purchase  Rambus will be able to expand its portfolio to better serve its customers 
The Snowbush IP business is a part of Semtech s Systems Innovation Group  Semtech is an analog and mixed signal chipmaker for high end consumer  enterprise computing  communications and industrial equipment  
With the fast growing server  networking and data center market  the need for high reliability products and solutions is fast gaining traction  Semtech s solution is a perfect fit for Rambus to tap this market demand  The acquisition of Semtech s Snowbush IP will enhance its product offerings  thereby boosting its top and bottom line performance over the long run  in our view 
Semtech on the other hand agreed to sell the assets  shift its focus toward its core business and exit production of those items that no longer align with the company s plan of providing analog mixed signal product platforms  This in turn will de leverage its business and strengthen its financial position  Therefore  the transaction is a win win scenario for both the companies 
It is worth mentioning that Rambus is going through a restructuring phase and we expect it to yield favourable results  Additionally  licensing agreements   the result of successful monetization of Rambus  patents   remains a recurring revenue source 
Going forward  Rambus is poised well to capitalize on the rising popularity of energy efficient lighting  LED products in the latest architectural  retail  commercial and residential lighting fixtures 
However  competition from companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp    NYSE SMI   and Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   and customer concentration remain headwinds for the company

189204,410720,RMBS,Rambus  Price And Vol Rise  Something Happening In This Decimated Stock ,opinion,Rambus Inc   RMBS  is an intellectual property and technology licensing company  It is engaged in the design  development and licensing of memory and logic interfaces  lighting and optoelectronics  and other technologies  The Company s primary focus is the creation  design  development and licensing of patented innovations  technologies and architectures that are foundational to all digital electronics products and systems  Its patented innovations and technologies are provided to customers  products  components and systems offered and used in semiconductors  computers  mobile applications  gaming and graphics  consumer electronics  lighting displays and general lighting This is a vol and stock price movement note in a company that was absolutely decimated in Nov of last year ANALYSISLet s start with the Charts Tab  twelve months   below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red  On the stock side  we can see the drop in Nov of last year  Here s the news that drove that cataclysm which saw the price dip from  18 04 to  7 11  61   on 11 16 2012 The long running legal wars between Rambus and Micron Technology finally reached a verdict  After eight weeks of deliberations and high level testimonies from industry giants Intel and Dell  a split jury arrived at a  not guilty  verdict and no damage awards The jury found that Rambus  did not meet its burden of proving its case against the two defendants   Micron and Hynix  This antitrust case could have resulted in a  4 billion damage award  to be automatically tripled under California law for a total of  12 billion  Instead  Rambus gets nothing Of course  this was just the Superior Court in San Francisco County and not the Supreme Court of the United States  Rambus is  reviewing our options for appeal   and I wouldn t be surprised to see one filed very soon  The amount of potential payouts makes this a make or break case for the memory patent wrangler  Having pursued this case for seven years already  Rambus isn t likely to just give up at this point   written by Anders Bylund I ve also highlighted the recent run up in RMBS stock from  4 21 to  5 43  29   since 5 18 2012 On the vol side  I ve highlighted the annual high in the implied of 200 18  on 9 22 2012  as well as the heightened level today  It s difficult to see the rise of late given the scale of the one year chart  so I ve included the six month chart  vol only   below So  while the level today isn t much to speak of relative to the annual high  it is a six month high as the stock has moved up nearly 30  in less than a month  Oddly  with all this recent movement  I don t really see any news on RMBS to justify it Let s turn to the Skew Tab Really not a lot going on here  The front month  which is really 2 5 days  is substantially elevated to the back months  but that s just a single strike and doesn t necessarily mean very much  Ultimately  it s simply a nickel bid in the  6 strike calls  There is a noticeable upside skew in the Jul options relative to Aug  For whatever it s worth  the options reflect greater upside risk  potential  in Jul than they do in Aug SUMMARYFinally  let s turn to the Options Tab  for completeness We can see the vols by expiry across the top  Looking to the actual options chain  we can see that Jul and Aug ATM vol are about equal  but the OTM calls are in fact more elevated in Jul  note the  8 strike  for example  DISCLAIMER  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-06-14,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rambus:-price-and-vol-rise;-something-happening-in-this-decimated-stock-126463,126463
