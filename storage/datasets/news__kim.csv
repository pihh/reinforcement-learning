172938,394454,KIM,Is Kimco Realty a Great Dividend Stock ,news,"Retail investments may strike fear in some investors these days given the trends in the brick and mortar retail industry  which some have dubbed the  retail apocalypse   Select retail chains and malls are having an increasingly tough time  as the shift toward online retailing becomes increasingly popular 
It s a macro trend to factor into your buying decisions  but the investment reality on the ground is a bit more complicated 
Not all areas of retail are underperforming  Most of the damage is being done to clothing retailers like Macy s  Gap  and J C  Penney  Thus  investors shouldn t just outright avoid the entire sector without first looking for some of the success stories  
This brings us to Kimco Realty  NYSE KIM   a real estate investment trust  REIT  based in New York  that owns and operates about 420 open air shopping centers across in the United States 

Kimco s properties are not enclosed shopping malls  which are struggling more  on average   rather they are mixed use  open air shopping centers  This includes strip malls  which usually contain a grocery store or a Walmart  perhaps a Gamestop or a Supercuts  maybe a movie theater and a wireless phone outlet store or two  a dollar store  and others  Compared with enclosed malls  these shopping centers are performing relatively well  
With 74 million leasable square feet of space  Kimco is one of the largest shopping center owners in the country  Should it be on your radar  As a potential dividend stock  the answer is yes 
A decade of delivering dividends
Kimco has rewarded investors with fantastic dividends over the years  It currently pays out a quarterly dividend of  0 28 per share  generating a yield  of 5 6   That s  1 12 per year per share  The dividend has climbed every year from 2010 through 2017 but has been flat the last two years at  0 28  
The payout ratio of 76 64   meaning Kimco pays out that percentage of its earnings in dividends  That s considered a very high ratio for regular stocks  but not so much for REIT s  which are required to pay out 90  of taxable earnings to shareholders  For REIT s it only becomes a problem when payout ratios are 100  or over  which means the company is paying out more than it brings in  So  Kimco is definitely in the right range for REIT s  One concern  however  is that dividends have flattened out the past two years  likely related to the uncertainty in the overall economy  
Restructuring has been key to growth
So what does the future hold for Kimco  The company had a good year in 2019  with the stock up about 41 4   But in the last month  it has declined about 7  and is down 6 5  year to date  However  analysts forecast a solid 8 4  gain in 2020 overall  which is promising in an uncertain year for stocks  particularly those in the retail shopping sector  
Kimco has been restructuring over the past decade  whittling down the number of properties it owns from more than 800 properties in 2010 to its current 420  In the third quarter alone  the company sold eight shopping centers for a total price of  166 7 million  with  70 9 million going to Kimco  as some were joint ventures   
For the year  Kimco will make in the range of  200 million to  300 million in dispositions  property sales   company officials said on a third quarter earnings call  The company has focused its portfolio on the top 20 markets    where more than 80  of its properties are located    as the supply and demand dynamics there are more favorable  It has employed a strategy of reinvesting the assets gained from selling off the lower quality assets into its strengthened portfolio  As a result  Kimco s demand is high  with occupancy rates in the third quarter at 96 4   an all time high for the company 
Funds from operations  or FFOs  the measure REITs use to determine cash flow   was  146 9 million  or  0 35 per diluted share  for the third quarter of 2019  up 6  from the third quarter of the previous year  It s evidence that portfolio restructuring efforts are starting to pay off 
 We feel like the developments and redevelopments are all now starting to deliver what we anticipated   Chief Executive Officer Conor Flynn said on the earnings call   So  we re on the right path  We feel like we ve still got a lot of work to do  but we re starting to get rewarded for all that work that we ve been putting into the portfolio  
Given the company s track record of delivering dividends and the positive earnings trend the company is on  Kimco is on solid footing for the new decade  Buying at the currently lowered price could get you in on the stock at a discount ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgrd7,2057405

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day and welcome to Kimco s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  Operator Instructions Please note that this event is being recorded  And now I d like to turn the conference over to Mr  David Bujnicki  Senior Vice President  Please go ahead David F  Bujnicki    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations   StrategyGood morning and thank you for joining Kimco s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call Joining me on the call today are Conor Flynn  Kimco s CEO  Ross Cooper  President and Chief Investment Officer  Glenn Cohen  our CFO  Dave Jamieson  our Chief Operating Officer  as well as other members of our executive team that are present and available to answer questions during the course of this call As a reminder  statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward looking  and it s important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a variety of risks  uncertainties and other factors  Please refer to the company s SEC filings that address such factors  During this presentation  management may make certain references to non GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco s operating results  Reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations website With that  I m going to turn the call over to Conor Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Dave  and good morning everyone As we begin the final year of our 2020 Vision strategy  our 2019 results are particularly satisfying  These results reflect both our commitment to our plan and our determination to stay the course  We finished 2019 with strong operating metrics and improved balance sheet  a higher quality portfolio and a development and redevelopment pipeline that continues to produce long term growth I will begin today s remarks with an overview of our operating metrics  our view of the retail landscape  and an update on our Signature Series development and redevelopment projects  and a view into how we think about ESG and our efforts  Ross will follow with an update on transaction activity and observations on general market conditions  and Glenn will discuss our activity in the capital markets  balance sheet metrics and our 2020 guide The repositioning of our core portfolio within the top 20 markets  where we see a favorable supply and demand dynamic continues to pay dividends  The team produced strong metrics across the board with  1 44 NAREIT FFO per share and  1 47 FFO per share as adjusted for the year  a great result  We achieved 3  same site NOI growth for the year  exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the year  Our occupancy remains at an all time high  finishing the year at 96 4   Anchor occupancy hit a new high at 98 9   while small shop occupancy finished slightly down at 89 3  due to recent closings of Dress Barn  Avenue and Charming Charlie  Activity on our small shop vacancy remains strong and we view this as a source of FFO growth for 2020 The spread of physical to economic occupancy sits at 240 basis points  which is primarily the result of anchor boxes yet to open  Typically once the anchor becomes activated  the small shops usually follow  driving higher rents and strong annual increases  Our spreads for the quarter were healthy with new leasing spreads at 12 5  and renewals and options at 4   The increase in spreads for new leases represents the 24th consecutive quarter in which spreads increased over 10   Our positive spreads for the year of 20 8  for new deals and 5 4  for renewals and options  highlights the mark to market opportunities embedded in our portfolio  Our intensive asset management platform and investment in technology has enabled us to be more proactive in monitoring and quickly addressing existing and potential vacancies  reducing downtime and driving faster rent commencement dates While our portfolio continues to perform in this era of retail Darwinism  we recognize the challenges confronting our sector in some of our legacy retailers  We see our customer continue to gravitate toward convenience  service  experience and value  Not all retailers will successfully make the pivot necessary to service the demands of today s consumer  Bankruptcies  store optimization plans  downsizing  store saturation  automated distribution facilities and e commerce penetration are all risks we must acknowledge and face head on  Our 2020 Vision strategic plan was designed with these challenges in mind  Our tightly clustered portfolio in the top markets where we have efficiencies of scale and significant barriers to entry  our mixed use platform  our tremendous access to capital  and our world class team put us in a great position to embrace the inevitable change and create significant long term shareholder value Our Signature Series pipeline continues to produce large quality flagship assets with stronger NOI and higher growth  We believe we have elevated the Kimco brand  with customers and in the communities we serve  Our focus on long term value creation  together with our commitment to sustainability has helped established trust with local governments and community groups  and which in turn helps us with our master planning and entitlement awards  Phonetic   We now have entitlements for over 4 500 apartment units  over 800 hotel keys  over 1 2 million square feet of office space  and we are only just getting started We believe our investment in developing a mixed use team  second to none  has created a platform premium that will allow us to develop an optimal plan for every asset in our portfolio and to acquire assets with untapped redevelopment potential  Retail will always be the driving force for Kimco  but recognizing the untapped potential of our asset base is a critical and defining aspect of our strategy going forward  At the end of 2019  we placed Mill Station into service  And out of the gate  our anchors were exceeding pro forma sales  Dania Pointe is making enormous strides  where we recently cut the ribbon for the ground breaking of Spirit Airlines s new headquarters  Spirit will be investing over  250 million and bringing over 1 000 employees to the site where they will enjoy the campus feel of our amenities and retail offerings The Boulevard is also moving closer to activation  as our first tenants plan to open later this year  We will also be activating the second residential tower at our Pentagon City National Landing asset later in 2020  as we look to benefit from the Amazon HQ effect in the area  The residential leasing records we set at Witmer  our first residential tower at Pentagon  highlights this one of a kind of asset  With entitlements for nearly 2 million of additional square feet  Pentagon will continue to create value for years to come In closing  our 2020 Vision strategy was primarily focused on our portfolio quality and balance sheet strength  As we continue to move forward in 2020 and beyond  the challenges we face are not limited to the changing nature of retail and real estate  To be the best  we need to continue to listen to all of our stakeholders and the issues that concern us  We need to be vigilant and responsive to issues  Phonetic  impacting corporate governance practices or diversity and refreshment  director skill sets  shareholder engagement and sustainability  While we have already made large strides in all of these areas  we can do more  Of particular note  our recent NAREIT award as a Leader in the Light given to the ESG Leader in all of retail real estate is something we are proud of and don t take for granted  and shines a light on all of our efforts in making Kimco such a special place  Ross Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerThank you  Conor  and good morning Our 2019 transaction activity  which we reported earlier this month  reflects another excellent year of execution and the redeployment of capital into our future growth opportunities  To recap  for the full year  we sold 32 properties for a gross value of  542 million  with  375 million as Kimco s respective share  Factoring in the acquisition of the three grocery stores through a sale leaseback transaction in January of 2019  our net shopping center dispositions were  341 million  Of note  a significant portion of the sales activity occurred in the fourth quarter as we accelerated several asset sales that were originally slated for 2020 closing  We had a total of 12 properties on the market for sale in the second half of the year and we closed 100  of them  Our transaction success reflects both our dedicated team and the quality of our upgraded portfolio As a result of the dispositions completed in 2019  we now own a portfolio of 409 shopping centers  tightly concentrated in our top 20 markets with substantial growth potential and densification opportunities that will continue to strengthen our asset base for years to come Now to our outlook for 2020  We intend to continue selling at a modest level  pruning between  200 million to  300 million of operating properties at Kimco s share  We anticipate cap rates to blend in the 7  to 7 5  range  Proceeds from the sales will help fund our Signature Series redevelopment program and potential acquisition opportunities within our targeted markets  As for the latter  we intend to go back on offense in 2020 and selectively add properties that fit our strategy  We plan to acquire between  100 million to  200 million of assets with cap rates in the 5  to 6  range  We have demonstrated our disciplined approach over the past several years with no new shopping center acquisitions in the summer of 2017 With our reshaped portfolio and improved cost of capital  we believe it is the appropriate time for us to selectively acquire high quality properties which offer future value creation potential  when the opportunity presents itself  While these are hard to find  we have already identified one particularly exciting asset that we re currently evaluating and hope to share additional details with you in the second quarter As for market activity generally  cap rates continue to be aggressive for institutional quality assets in our core markets  We saw transactions in California  Texas  Florida and Pennsylvania in the high 4s and low 5s in the fourth quarter  And with interest rates remaining at their current low levels  there is no shortage of investor capital both debt and equity interested in pursuing our product type  We look forward to building additional long term value as we move through 2020 And now to Glenn  for the financial results Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerThanks  Ross  and good morning We finished 2019 with strong fourth quarter operating results  We maintained our occupancy level at an all time high  delivered another quarter of double digit new leasing spreads  and generated positive same site NOI growth  In addition  we further fortified our balance sheet with the issuance of common equity utilizing our ATM program  As a reminder  in connection with the NAREIT FFO definition clarification  we no longer include gains and losses from land sales  marketable securities and preferred equity investments in NAREIT FFO  We are presenting prior periods to conform with this election  These transactional items were already excluded from FFO as adjusted and therefore have no impact on that calculation  Also  as previously communicated  beginning of this year  we will only be reporting on NAREIT FFO  And in the event  we have a unique transactional gain or charge  we will be sure to point it out Now for some additional color on our fourth quarter results  NAREIT FFO was  151 9 million  or  0 36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2019  as compared to  149 6 million or  0 36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2018  Net transactional charges for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled  3 4 million  or  0 01 per diluted share  comprised of  7 2 million of preferred stock redemption charges  offset by  3 8 million of transactional income from Puerto Rico insurance claims and forgiveness of debt  NAREIT FFO for the fourth quarter 2018 included  2 2 million of net transactional income FFO as adjusted  which excludes transactional income and expenses  and non operating impairments  was  0 37 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019  as compared to  0 35 per diluted share for the same period last year  The primary drivers of the increase were higher NOI of  3 1 million  lower financing costs of  2 2 million and higher management fee income  Full year 2019 NAREIT FFO was  1 44 per diluted share and includes  11 7 million or  0 03 per share of net transactional expense  primarily from  18 5 million of preferred stock redemption charges  Full year 2019 FFO as adjusted came in at  620 1 million  or  1 47 per diluted share  which hit the upper end of our guidance range  Full year 2018 FFO as adjusted was  613 million  or  1 45 per diluted share  The primary drivers of the increase were lower financing costs of  13 2 million  lower income tax expense  and higher management fee income  The full year increase was further impacted by lower NOI of about  9 million attributable to the full year impact of 2018 and 2019 dispositions  and higher G A expense resulting from the lease accounting change and the effect of no longer capitalizing indirect leasing costs Our high quality property portfolio continues to produce positive results  During the fourth quarter  we signed 263 leases totaling 1 4 million square feet at a weighted average ABR of  18 63 per square foot  further improving our pro rata portfolio ABR to  17 99 per square foot  Our year end occupancy held steady at an all time high  up 60 basis points from the beginning of the year  This increase was driven by positive net absorption and the positive impact from dispositions   Indecipherable  spreads for new leases  options and renewals signed were a positive 6  for the fourth quarter and positive 7 9  for the full year 2019  Same site NOI growth was positive 2 7  for the fourth quarter 2019 and includes 10 basis points from redevelopments Full year 2019 same site NOI growth was positive 3  with no impact from redevelopment activities  The primary drivers of the same site NOI growth were increases in minimum rents from continued lease up  contractual rent bumps and rent commencement starts  Our same site leased occupancy stands at 96 4  and same site economic occupancy is 94   which bodes well for continued same site NOI growth Turning to the balance sheet  we were active again in the capital markets  We utilized our ATM program opportunistically to issue 9 5 million shares of common stock at a weighted average net price of  21 03 per share  raising over  200 million  We used the proceeds to redeem  225 million of 5 5  preferred stock  As a result  we reduced our look through net debt to EBITDA by 0 3 times to a level of 7 2 times  and reduced our fixed charges by  12 4 million annually  We remain focused on reducing look through net debt to EBITDA further over time  Our liquidity position is excellent with over  2 billion of immediate liquidity available  Our debt maturities for 2020 are quite manageable with only  90 million of consolidated mortgage debt due  and approximately  150 million due in our joint ventures  Our weighted average debt maturity profile is 10 6 years  continuing to be one of the longest in the REIT industry We successfully executed on many fronts throughout 2019  meeting or exceeding our targets  I want to thank our associates for their commitment  dedication and effort to produce these results  We are enthusiastic about the future  but know full well there is more to be done in this ever changing retail landscape Moving on to 2020 guidance and the underlying assumptions  Our initial NAREIT FFO guidance range for 2020 is  1 46 to  1 50 per diluted share  This per share guidance range assumes a growth rate range for same site NOI of 1 5  to 2  including redevelopments  and 100 basis points for credit loss  includes incremental NOI growth of  12 million to  14 million from development projects  and lowered NOI by  21 million associated with the full year impact of 2019 net dispositions  Other assumptions include reduced financing costs of  11 million to  17 million  primarily from the redemption of  575 million of preferred stock during 2019  flat to lower G A in 2020 as compared to 2019  and the impact of the increased share count from the equity issuance in 2019 In addition  as Ross mentioned  our disposition target ranges from  200 million to  300 million  and our acquisition target is  100 million to  200 million  Lastly  our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range assumes no transactional income or expense  and no additional common equity issuance And with that  we d be happy to take your questions David F  Bujnicki    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations   StrategyBefore we start the Q A  I just want to offer a reminder that you may ask a question with an appropriate follow up  If you have additional questions  you are welcome to rejoin the queue  We re happy to take the first question Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions Our first question comes from Christine McElroy from Citi  Please go ahead Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystHi  thanks  Appreciate it  Good morning  Just wanted to follow up on your initial same store NOI guidance  1 5  to 2   I think everyone is sort of trying to figure out in the context of the deceleration from last year  how is that sort of an initial conservative range or is that realistic in the context of what you re expecting for fallout  There is what you know right now in terms of fallout versus what you may be anticipating as far as unknown buffer or bad debt reserve  And I think we re just trying to get our arms around    is that an initial conservative range or is it disappointing based on what you are currently expecting  And I know that there is a lot of moving parts  there are some properties that are expected to join the pool this year that are potentially accretive to that growth rate  So just wanted to get some color around that  Thank you Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerHey Christine  Yeah  we re very much focused on that  and it s very early in the year  as you know  We re focused on outperforming  We ve got 11 months to do so  And if appropriate  we will hopefully outperform and raise it throughout the year  but we do have 100 basis points reserve for credit loss  We think it s an appropriate range to start the year  It s a very fluid environment as you know  We ve made some assumptions and believe that it s a good place to start  and continue to believe that the transformed portfolio will continue to shine Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystAnd then just on the comment around the properties adding to the same store pool like Boulevard  how much is that expected to be accretive Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerThe Boulevard would add in a range of around  3 million to  5 million as part of it  So on     900 million  it s helpful but it s modest Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerRedevelopments  Christy  should be about somewhere between 20 to 40 basis points within the same site guidance range Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystOkay  And that 1 5  to 2   that s excluding redevelopment  or that s including that impact Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerIncludes    it s including that Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystThat s included  Okay  thank you OperatorNext question comes from Craig Schmidt  Bank of America  Please go ahead Craig Schmidt    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI wonder how much of the 100 bps of reserve you had last year  you needed to use in 2019 Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerHi Craig  it s Glenn  So we used a total of 44 basis points for all of 2019  So we came in ahead  and again as part of that  we were able to continue to increase same site NOI guidance as we went through 2019 Craig Schmidt    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  And then how much and how active will you be in terms of rent restructuring  And how much of that is a drag on your    the sequential decline in NOI  19 versus  20 David Jamieson    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating OfficerHi Craig  it s Dave Jamieson  It s not really rent restructuring  so I just want to be clear on the question  What we re always doing is proactively looking ahead  identifying opportunities to upgrade the quality of the tenancy  drive market rents through new deals  renewals and discussions with tenants that have options  So something that we do day in and day out  I definitely wouldn t classify it as restructuring of rents  But when we look ahead and the opportunities  obviously small shop activity is very robust  In the back half of 2019  there were some known events on bankruptcies that drove that number down  About 130 basis points of that was contributed to the bankruptcy of the tenants that Conor already mentioned  We really identify that as an opportunity to fuel future growth through the end of  20 and into  21 as well So we re very optimistic about the environment and where we have with our quality of our portfolio and with the new anchors coming online as well  and you start to see the lease    the physical occupancy starts to compress throughout the balance of the year  that will continue to drive small shop growth Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Craig  the nice part is  is where we sit at 96 4  at an all time high occupancy is we do need a little bit of churn in order to get those mark to market opportunities  So we re active on being    pre leasing and looking for opportunities to improve the tenant credit of our portfolio  So we think that there is a lot of opportunity that s here to become    really another driver of mark to market opportunities for us Craig Schmidt    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystJust given the record high occupancy  has that limited your ability to push rents Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerNo  again it s the    on the spread side  it s always dependent on  Speech Overlap  Craig Schmidt    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystNo  I just mean  the fact that you re not able to add new occupancy to same property Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerNo  I think    again  when you look at the anchor opportunities  there are renewals that are coming due that will continue to drive that mark to market  As you know  we have substantially below market anchor portfolio that we ve continued to realize the benefit of  In addition  on the small shop side  our small shops currently are over  29 a foot in rent  And when you look at 2020 the rollover schedule is at the lowest rate  current in place rent than the next five years  So when you look at the opportunity to push rents  there is still very much room to do so Craig Schmidt    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  I guess    you sound pretty positive when we get to the details  but the macro guidance is so much less  I guess I m not really able to reconcile that Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerCraig  I think if you look back the past few years  you ll see we ve been consistent  It s a fluid environment as you know  We want to be realistic  understanding that it s very early in the year  We re focused on out performing like we have been doing and we have 11 months to do so Craig Schmidt    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Well  thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust  Please go ahead Ki Bin Kim    Suntrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThanks  good morning  Your renewal spreads of 4   we ve seen it hover around the 4  mark for three consecutive quarters  Is this somewhat of a newer run rate that we should expect going forward Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerYeah  it s    again it s all dependent on the population of any given quarter  Between the renewals and options over the last few quarters  there are several options that were flat on some of our large ground lease anchor boxes that maintained a lower blended spread  And in addition to that  as you know with our anchor occupancy being as it is  the small shops are slightly closer to market  So this quarter in particular almost 90  of our new deals were small shop deals  around    under 5 000 square feet  So that s sometimes is a closer mark to market equation  which can have an impact on your spreads  But as I mentioned in my earlier comments  when you look forward  there s opportunities to continue to push the new lease spreads on a go forward basis Ki Bin Kim    Suntrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystOkay  And just going back to a prior question on rent restructuring or just rent cuts  Just if you can give us a sense of how often that is actually happening at Kimco  And following up to that  is there just a larger concern that even tenants that don t need a rent cut start to look more increasingly at the landscape  whether they are a tenant with you or a different owner  And sorry to ask for something similar  because if you re a strong tenant  maybe the mindset starts to shift from what    paying rent based on what I could pay to what I should pay Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerThere s so many variables that go into any discussion  Everything s a negotiation  It s a case by case analysis both on the tenant side and the landlord side  The value with Kimco is the high quality of our portfolio  Someone could look for a lesser quality property  maybe pay slightly less rent  But if you want to have the full benefit of our tenancy  our location  our real estate and the markets in which we operate  then that starts to weigh into the final decision that s made  So it s always a case by case  and that s something that we do on an ongoing basis Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerWe really haven t done any restructuring  If you look through the portfolio and look at our occupancy  we d like to get some spaces back so we get the mark to market opportunities  So that s what s given us the ability to have confidence in the transformed portfolio  because typically if a tenant misses an option or wants to leave  we have the opportunity to backfill at a much higher rent  So that s what s driving our 20  plus new store leasing spreads  when we get those spaces back  It s a nice position to be in  because it all comes down to the competitive set when your shopping center is placed in the corridor  And we feel like we ve got below market rents in great locations and the right balance of supply and demand Ki Bin Kim    Suntrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystAll right  thank you OperatorOur next question is from Alexander Goldfarb  Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Alexander D  Goldfarb    Piper Sandler   Co     Analyst Technical Issues  Christy s questioning  If we look at your last year s    sorry  NOI guidance  you said in response to Craig that you only used about 45 basis points  And yet you exceeded the top end of your NOI by 50 basis points  This year  you re talking about 100 basis points  which again seems pretty darn conservative  So just sort of curious  as you guys look to 2020  how much is already in your same store that s    one  based on legacy what closed in 2019  Second  like Pier 1 or what you know is going to close this year  And then three  the sort of unknown factor you re budgeting of X   So is the 100 basis points sort of that X  and therefore Pier 1 and the legacy from last year are the deltas that we re all trying to solve for  as to why the same store looks so low relative to what you produced last year Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerHey Alex  Yeah  so what we do is for all known closures  we take those out of our budget  So the sites where we know tenants are going to be vacating  we take them out of the budget  And then on top of that  we put in 100 basis points of credit reserve  And so we feel that gives us the cushion to understand that it s a very fluid environment  The last few years obviously  we ve been able to raise throughout the year  It s very early in the year  We re focused on outperforming  We ve got 11 months to do so  and we ll continue to    if appropriate  we will raise throughout the year Alexander D  Goldfarb    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystSo Conor  how much is already in there  Like is there already    so the 100 basis points of cushion  there is already an extra 100 basis points from closure  I m just trying to understand what the actual closure amount that s already in there in addition to what the 100 basis points cushion is Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerIt s Glenn  There s roughly 30 basis points that we re aware of  So we re starting with that as a kind of the beginning point  And then the balance is really for what s unknown  So again  we are trying to take the approach to deal with again an environment that is sometimes is fluid and has its challenges  and we want to just set the stage for us to be able to go through the year and hopefully outperform Alexander D  Goldfarb    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystOkay  And then next is just an update on   Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerThe other thing  just one    sorry  the other thing to just bear in mind  we actually have a very tough comp in the first quarter  The first quarter of last year was 3 7   So just kind of bear that in mind as we go Alexander D  Goldfarb    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystOkay  And then just    Albertsons obviously was in the newspaper  potential IPO  Just what you can share with us as far as potential for timing if it will go  won t go  what the latest is Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  With regard to the rumor on the S 1  we really can t comment on that  For us  what we do understand and know is that for the last couple of years  the management  the Board and the investors have really been focused on giving the company the tools to really succeed  And that includes reducing debt through sale leasebacks and cash by  3 billion over the last two years  improving the operation of the company  bringing in a new CEO  who has really invigorated the management team there  And we re kind of    as we ve said on the call last couple times  really working to set the company up to execute at the right time  at the right value Also to understand  for Kimco  we have about 35 locations with Albertsons across the banners  We want this to be a very successful company for the long term  So we re not going to rush into anything that it doesn t make sense for the long term or that business Alexander D  Goldfarb    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystThank you OperatorNext question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore  Please go ahead Samir Khanal    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  guys  Can I ask    I guess  Glenn  can I ask you to go over the sources and uses  I m just trying to understand  you re funding the  225 million of redevelopments  And you have  100 million coming from dispositions  You will have free cash flow  But I think you will still feel    you ll be a bit short of the  225 million of redevelopments  Just maybe address the capital plans  what you re assuming for guidance  maybe on the debt or even the equity side Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerSo in terms of the capital plan to be able to fund the balance  we actually have some contracts in place on some of our preferred equity investments and some land parcels that will also help to fund that  So that s not part of Ross s guidance in terms of disposition  And that amount can be  50 million to  75 million  So that s one piece of the bridge  The other thing is  again  we re going to watch the capital markets closely  It s not baked into our numbers  using the equity markets  but again  similar to what we did in 2019  we will always look to be opportunistic  And then the balance comes from    we have enormous liquidity between cash and our line of credit  And if need be  the bond market is quite favorable at the moment too  So we have a lot of different options on a lot of different places to be able to create the funding mechanism Samir Khanal    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  great  And then I guess my second question is on Dania Pointe  I know you ve got the Forever 21 box there  you ve got the Lucky s grocer  I guess an update on those two tenants  And then I guess is there some co tenancy risks that can impact the income coming through that development in the event that those stores close there Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s good question  So starting with the Forever 21 box  to step back  this is a lease we signed almost three years ago  And when you look at the evolution of the project  we couldn t be happier with the opportunity to backfill this location  with the recent signings of Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie  to anchor the other two locations on Main Street complemented by the Tommy Bahama s  What it s going to do is create a new opportunity for us to backfill  Initially that lease was a somewhat of a loss leader  This brings others into the project  and now we re able to bring that closer to market  So that s an opportunity for us and we already have strong activity  It s one of the best locations in the center itself As it relates to Lucky s  it s a Kroger background lease  So again  this is another opportunity where we had a grocery component in there on the low ground rent  We re now able to bring that closer to market and with Kroger currently    is currently on the lease Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerWe have recaptured the Forever 21 space  And we re actively marketing it right now  The ground lease that s backed by a Kroger  we have yet to recapture Samir Khanal    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Thanks for the color  guys OperatorNext question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotia  Please go ahead Greg McGinniss    Scotiabank    AnalystHey  good morning  everyone  Conor  I was just hoping to dig into the expected growth a bit more  So guidance implies 1  of earnings growth  which is similar to 2019  But in 2020  we re not expecting a drag from the lease accounting change  there s fewer prior year dispositions  and seemingly there s a greater contribution from development  So considering these items  can you just help us bridge the gap on why growth may be appears a bit low versus what was achieved in 2019 Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean I think    to your point  look  it s very early in the year  We feel like we ve got a transformed portfolio  The developments and redevelopments are starting to come online  but it s a very fluid environment  We recognize that retail is changing daily  and we feel like we have to position ourselves to be able to recognize that if we are able to outperform  we ll be able to hopefully appropriately raise throughout the year  We feel like the 2019 accomplishments shine a light on how far we ve come  But that being said  we ve got a lot of work to do  There s a lot of projects that need to come online  There s a lot of leasing that needs to get done  And there is still some retailers out there that we have our eyes on that may not be able to pivot and meet the needs of the consumer  So we have to take that into consideration and that s what s really sort of creating the range that we put out there Greg McGinniss    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  And then thinking about that drag from dispositions a bit more  Ross  if you could help me with this one  So the messaging on dispositions going forward has been consistent at this  200 million to  300 million range  But we came in  75 million above the expected range in 2019  You still expect  200 million to  300 million in 2020  Just wondering if there is some deterioration in operating performance of certain assets  which led you to be slightly more aggressive on dispositions  And then potentially what could lead to an increase in the dispositions range for 2020 Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerYeah  I certainly wouldn t characterize it as deterioration in the operations  There were a few assets that closed in the last 10 days of the year that we initially had anticipated would be 2020 dispositions  So that s certainly factored into it  As it relates to the overheads on the guidance in  19  that guidance was always a net transaction guidance  So when you factor in the the sale leaseback that was achieved in the early part of  19  it was really about  40 million  So it was a little bit less than the  75 million  But again it was really just having a very robust demand for the assets  We typically  in years past  had about 80  to 85  success rate on the assets that we had in the market to closing  The second half of  19  everything single asset that we put into the market closed  including ones that we thought would have been a few months delayed  So that elevated the the range a bit for  19  But we re very comfortable that we ll be sticking within the range for 2020 And we have no desire or anticipation that we would move that range or ramp up our desire to sell more Greg McGinniss    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Ross OperatorNext question comes from Haendel St  Juste from Mizuho  Please go ahead Haendel E  St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystHey there  good morning Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerGood morning Haendel E  St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystSo hey  Glenn  maybe you can help me with the the build versus occupied  How should we be thinking about your opportunity for narrowing that  sounds like 270 basis point gap this year David Jamieson    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating OfficerThis is Dave  It s 240 basis points currently  So it compressed from 270 basis points to 240 basis points  When we look at the 2020 and the flow of that route  we expect anywhere from  10 million to  15 million to come from that 240 basis points  and it will be heavily weighted toward the back half of  20  So when we look on the outlook  whether or not it will expand or contract  right now I think we feel good about the range  We do know if some additional space does come back when we started signing those new leases  it could expand a little bit  But feel like right now we are in the range  and we ll continue to open new stores and work on compressing it Haendel E  St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystAppreciate that  Thanks  And then a follow up  I wanted to go back to The Boulevard for a second  Glenn  I think you mentioned  3 million to  5 million of NOI coming online this year  which is I guess pretty far below what I was thinking just going through the quick math   214 million   Indecipherable  I guess around  6 million   6 5 million NOI  So maybe you could walk me through what I might be missing there and some color on that number Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I m going to let    Dave will take you through the timing David Jamieson    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating OfficerSure  Right now we re going through the process of preparing the retailers for opening and we ll look to start opening them toward the back half of  20  There are items when you deal with Burrow development in the New York Tri state area or the New York area related to inspection  the utility companies that you continue to manage to work through  So we re just    as we re continuing to finalize the construction phase of this project  there will be influence on the timing of tenancy  So that said  when you    look  at the end of the day  project stabilization  we still feel very  very confident about where this is going to    where this is going to end up and the quality of shop rate  etc   but it s really just a matter of the timing of the openings as we start to look out toward the back half of  20 and  21 Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerRight  Stabilization for the asset should be toward the end of  21 OperatorNext question is from Brian Hawthorne  RBC Capital Markets  Please go ahead Brian Hawthorne    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  can you talk about your expectation for the timing of dispositions in 2020 Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerSure  I think the first quarter will certainly be on the lighter side  as I mentioned  A few assets that we thought would close in Q1 previously  ended up closing at the end of last year  So we ll see a little bit of a ramp up in Q2  Q3 and Q4  And at that point  it should be somewhat ratable  but Q1 will be light on the disposition side Brian Hawthorne    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And then do you have your anchor mark to market for the leases expiring in 2020 Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Currently on our list  you have 89 leases that are expiring  some of which have options and that s currently at  11 a foot   11 54  When you look at our current anchors to date  we are just about  14 a foot Brian Hawthorne    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorNext question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGood morning  guys  A couple of clarification questions  Maybe going back to the beginning  When you talked about the headwind from redevelopment to same store NOI  was that 20 to 30 basis points  Did I hear that right Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerIt s 20 to 40 basis points  not as a headwind though  It s just embedded in the number that we re using Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystNo  no  I    sorry for using the wrong term  I just want to make sure I understood what impact redevelopment was having on same store NOI  And then on the loss reserve  you mentioned 100 basis points  which I completely understand and our math as part of the supplement agrees with your 44 basis points  But when you talked about the known 30 basis points  is that included in the 100 basis points  Or should we be thinking about the loss reserve as closer to like 130 basis points versus the 100 basis points Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerWe take out  as Conor mentioned  we take out known tenants that are not going to be there  So those are out of it  There are other pieces that make up that where we see this of the 30 basis points  So I would say if no one else went out  we would expect 30 basis points of credit loss  but we know that s not going to happen  So we have this extra 70 basis point that is built into our budget process for all the other unknowns  So I would say  no  it s not 130 basis points  It s a total of 100 in our budget process Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  That s very helpful  Thank you for the clarification  And then just thinking about the sort of the trajectory of same store NOI throughout the year  obviously 1Q  19 was a really good year with  I think 3 7  same store NOI  Could you maybe just revisit how you think about the trajectory of same store NOI throughout 2020  Do you expect 1Q  20 to be maybe as strong as 1Q  19 or was there something    is there something specific that we should be thinking about on a year over year basis Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerAlthough we don t give quarterly guidance  I will tell you that it s our expectation that the first quarter would probably be the low point in terms of what we would report for the year  And you ll see it ramp up as we go throughout 2020 Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Thank you  guys  That s very helpful clarification for me  That s it OperatorNext question is from Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point  Please go ahead Floris van Dijkum    Compass Point    AnalystA quick question on    clarification I guess on Pier 1  I think you have 30 locations  about 50 basis points of a rental impact  What is your expectation if you were to get that back  I know that the average rent is around  22 a square foot  which is well in excess of your average anchor rent  Are you actively looking to market that lease or already marketing that space right now Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we ve been proactively looking to pre lease the Pier 1 boxes for a period of time  And just to clarify  Pier 1 ranges in size  and actually    a sizable majority of them are actually below what we deem as an anchor  which is anything over 10 000 square feet  So using the anchor average rent is not necessarily the most appropriate way to determine a mark to market benefit Some will be up  some will be down  but I feel like we have a good opportunity there  In addition to that  we obviously will be upgrading the quality of the tenancy and bringing in thriving retailers to help occupy those spaces  So as we continue to look out into  20  we re monitoring the situation very closely and we ll continue to actively pre lease those boxes Floris van Dijkum    Compass Point    AnalystGreat  thanks  That s it for me OperatorNext question from Linda Tsai of Jefferies  Please go ahead Linda Tsai    Jefferies    AnalystOn the 2020 acquisitions  the 5  to 6  cap rate  what upside  do you expect in rents and what does the same store growth profile look like relative to the in place portfolio Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerI think that they are slightly different between the two  When we re looking at acquisition opportunities  we anticipate given the market that    and the locations and the quality of what will be buying that the cap rates will be in the 5  to 6  range in year one  But any opportunity that we look at would certainly have a pretty significant growth opportunity  whether it be with below market leases  redevelopment opportunities  So we think that anything we look to acquire over time will have a growth rate that s outsized compared to the existing portfolio and would continue to be accretive to the quality and the growth of the portfolio long term But I can t really comment on the specifics of a particular acquisition at this time Linda Tsai    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  And then it looks like straight line rent was higher on a quarter over quarter and year over year basis  Why did this go up a bit  And what s the more realistic run rate for 2020 Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerSo again  straight line is somewhat tied to leases that are getting signed and the leases being in the    the box being ready for opening or delivery to the tenant  It s just a matter    that s really what s driving it  You have a lot of new leases that were signed in places  like Mill Station  You have a lot of leases that are getting signed in Dania  So there s a lot of free rent tied to those  where you start straight lining that in  The run rate is lower than what you see in the fourth quarter Linda Tsai    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And then I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks  flat to lower G A in 2020  What s driving that Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerMore efficiency  for one thing  If you look what we ve done  we ve reduced the size of the portfolio Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerAnd also the leasing costs from a year over year perspective Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerIt s really    we do a very    we spend a lot of time monitoring where G A stands and try to do everything we can to keep it measured  And again  as the portfolio is reduced in size  we have reduced the size of some staff over the years Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerWe ve updated our systems as well  We switched over to MRI and made a lot of investment there  So we think there s going to be significant efficiencies and synergies coming from that investment Linda Tsai    Jefferies    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities  Please go ahead Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystGood morning  guys  Ross  a real quick one  Do you have anything under contract right now as far as acquisitions go Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerNo  nothing under contract Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystOkay  And then please be patient with me  I do need to go back to same store  on the clarification  just so I fully understand  So bear with me  Last year  you did 3  both with and without redev  the guidance  the 1 5  to 2  is    includes the redev  Do I understand to say then that without redev  the guidance would have been  what 1 3  to 1 6  or something  Is that how I should be thinking about this Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerWithout redev  yes  that would be correct Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystOkay  Thanks  Glenn Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerAgain    Chris  again  it s a starting point for us when we look at it Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystUnderstood Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerAnd you re baking in 100 basis points of credit loss  A little over  Indecipherable  Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystYeah  so let me go to the next point  which is that known fallouts that you had from 2019  the Dress Barns and all that  that s 130 basis points that you know going into this year  correct Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerThat s already built in to our guidance Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystCorrect  right  So that s an initial drag  you know that going in  So that s already 130 basis point  So now we re looking at going into this year  You have 100 basis points of essentially reserve and 30 basis points of it  you already kind of know about  So there s 70 basis points left of sort of whatever for the rest of the year  Is that correct Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerChris  I think what you re trying to get at is  what s the initial headwind from the lost rents of some of those retailers that went bankrupt at the end of last year  That s somewhere about 40 basis points  That is factored into the initial guidance  And that s not part of our    for a starting point guidance of the credit loss of 100 basis points Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerSo  Chris  just to clarify  It s not 130 basis points that s baked into it  That s 40 basis points from Dress Barn  Avenue   Speech Overlap  Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystOkay  there we go  Okay  That s the number I was looking for  Thank you Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive Officer Speech Overlap  Chris  I think it s just that a headwind that we know is lost rent that s already out  Credit loss is for those that we anticipate going bankrupt over the course of 2020 Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerRight  Said differently  if those tenants were all still there  the guidance would be 40 basis points higher  We know they re out  So we started with that out of the number already Christopher Lucas    Capital One Securities  Inc     AnalystPerfect  Glenn  Thank you  That s what I needed to hear  That s all I have Operator Operator Instructions Next we have a follow up from Christine McElroy of Citi  Please go ahead Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystHey  so sorry  just to continue that conversation a little bit  So of that unknown  right  you mentioned 30 basis points and 70 basis points of the 100 basis point reserve  Is the 30 basis points all Forever 21  And where does sort of Pier 1 fall into that  I assume that s in the 70 basis points  And any    what are your expectations around how modals plays out  like is that impacted in the 70 basis points  Maybe you can just give a little bit more detail on what you re expecting for the individual retailers in that Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerSo we ve seen the Pier 1 closing list and we ve modeled in    again  we just got the list prior to what we were doing  So we know that some of those stores we expect to close  That s part of that 30 basis points that I was saying is known  It s not being driven by Forever 21 Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystWhere does Forever 21 fall in  Is that in the    that s not even in the 100 basis points because it s already in the range Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  In Forever 21  we had a very small exposure  So when you re talking about Dania  it s Dania  the Phase 2 is not in our same site pool  So that wouldn t be part of it Ross Cooper    President  Chief Investment OfficerAnd it was only one location Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So that s not part of the issue  I think as you mentioned  Christy  that    hey  when we go through  Pier 1 put out initial closing list  We know that there is some number of those stores that we have right away that factors into the 100 basis points  And then for some of the other names that you mentioned in some of the other ones out there  if we factor in that impact  we look at the sensitivity of maybe potential timing of when during the course of the year  that could happen  It s early  We ll have better visibility after maybe the first quarter and that s when    typically when we reevaluate everything going forward Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystOkay  And then just a follow up on Linda s question around the non cash rents  Should we be aware of any sort of write off of straight line rent receivable related to some of the questionable on collectability or any sort of acceleration of FAS 141 this year based on any early space recapture that you re expecting Glenn Gary Cohen    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer   TreasurerOkay  Last year  we had some below market rents  which were certainly helpful within the number  There is less amount the below market rent benefit modeled in our plan for this year than we had in 2019  As it relates to writing off of straight line rent  again  it s going to depend on the tenant  So we run through tenant by tenant  their credit quality  And if the tenant goes out  we immediately would write that off  But that is a modest amount of that modeled in the plan for this year Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystOkay  And then just thinking about free cash flow after dividend  How are you thinking about    sorry if I missed this  how are you thinking about sort of recurring capex spend this year relative to the last few years in terms of leasing  capex and landlord costs  and sort of recurring maintenance capex as it relates to sort of growing year free cash flow Conor C  Flynn    Chief Executive OfficerI would say in total between capex  leasing commissions  EIs  it s a similar range for 2020 than what we incurred in    or we spent in 2019 Christy McElroy    Citi Investment Research    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  Thank you OperatorThis concludes our question and answer session  I d

A quarter ago  it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of  0 36 per share when it actually produced FFO of  0 37  delivering a surprise of 2 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates just once 
Kimco Realty  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Retail industry  posted revenues of  284 87 million for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 83   This compares to year ago revenues of  289 38 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters

What s Next for Kimco Realty 
While Kimco Realty has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Kimco Realty was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

For KIM  shares are up 2 18  over the past week while the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Retail industry is up 1 03  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 85  compares favorably with the industry s 0 91  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Kimco Realty have risen 4 74   and are up 16 2  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 2 32  and 5 42   respectively 
Investors should also take note of KIM s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  KIM is averaging 4 028 324 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with KIM 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KIM s consensus estimate  increasing from  1 46 to  1 47 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that KIM is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Kimco Realty on your short list ",2019-06-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kimco-realty-kim-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200432496,200432496

173069,394585,KIM,What s In The Offing For Kimco  KIM  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Kimco Realty Corporation   NYSE KIM   is slated to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 25  before the market opens In the last reported quarter  this New Hyde Park  NY based retail real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive performance of 2 78  in terms of funds from operations  FFO  per share  Particularly  the company registered new leasing spreads of 17 4   which marked the 21st straight quarter in which spreads on new leases were up more than 10   It also indicated the highest quarterly increase since third quarter 2017 Over the trailing four quarters  Kimco beat estimates on two occasions and posted in line results in the other two  recording an average beat of 1 39   The graph below depicts this surprise history Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayThe recent  from Reis shows that the vacancy rate of neighborhood and community shopping center fell 10 basis points sequentially to 10 1  in the second quarter  denoting its first decline since the first quarter of 2016  The Regional Mall vacancy rate was flat in the second quarter at 9 3   Store closures continue to affect Regional Mall vacancy  Nonetheless  both  national average asking rent and effective rent  which nets out landlord concessions  inched up 0 4  in the quarter and 1 7  from the year ago quarter The retail real estate market continues to be affected by store closures and is in fact  undergoing structural changes  However  the latest stability in the vacancy rate and rent levels reflect that the sector has been able to weather such challenges to some extent Amid this  Kimco is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high quality assets concentrated in major metro markets  which offer several growth levers  In fact  despite transformation in the retail landscape  the company remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues  with focus on service and experiential tenants and omni channel players Moreover  the company is focused on expanding its small shops  portfolio  These shops basically comprise service based industries  such as restaurants  salons and spas  personal fitness and medical practices  The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant  Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics  this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit operating and leasing risks Simultaneously  the company is making significant disposition of assets  In fact  as part of its efforts to fine tune the company s portfolio  Kimco announced second quarter 2019 disposition of three properties and one land parcel  aggregating 875 000 square feet for  103 7 million  The company s share of these sales amounted to  65 8 million It disposed 12 properties and one land parcel  so far this year  for a gross price of  226 1 million  which aggregated 1 9 million square feet of space  Further  with  145 3 million worth of properties currently under contract  Kimco is well on track with its planned dispositions for the year  The company s share of the sales would be worth  86 6 million In addition  with a decent strength in the job market and still resilient consumer sentiment  the company may experience high occupancy and healthy leasing spreads in the to be reported quarter  Also  the company is expected to maintain a strong balance sheet on the back of its strategic measures to boost the capital structure  It also remains focused on growing its unencumbered asset pool  which is encouraging Nonetheless  despite all these efforts  the choppy retail real estate environment might curb its growth momentum to some extent  This is because secular industry headwinds  including retailer downsizing and tenant bankruptcies keep dampening industry fundamentals  Moreover  though disposition efforts are encouraging for the long term  these will likely have a dilutive impact on its near term earnings Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues of Kimco is currently pinned at  282 5 million   reflecting a 2 4  estimated decline from the prior year period  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share of 36 cents for the quarter also indicates a year over year drop of 2 7  In addition to the above  Kimco s activities during the April June quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 36 cents for the quarter under review remained unchanged over the past month Here is what our quantitative model predicts Kimco Realty has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or

173077,394593,KIM,Key Factors To Impact Digital Realty s  DLR  Q2 Earnings,opinion,Digital Realty Trust   NYSE DLR   is scheduled to release second quarter 2019 results on Jul 30  after the market closes In the last reported quarter  this San Francisco  CA based data center real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 4 85  in terms of funds from operations  FFO  per share  Results were supported by growth in revenues The company has a decent surprise history  In fact  over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all four occasions   the average beat being 2 30   This is depicted in the graph below Digital Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderWith growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  Also  the estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence  autonomous vehicle and virtual augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five to six years  In fact  demand is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy  the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Additionally  according to a forecast by Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   global data center to data center IP traffic is anticipated to witness a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 25  over 2016 2021  while global cloud IP traffic is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 27  over 2016 2021  Further  per Gartner s reports  worldwide IT spending growth is projected to increase 3 2  in 2019  while worldwide server shipments are expected to be up 4  in 2019  These are anticipated to drive demand for data centers Such strong fundamentals of the data center market are likely to help Digital Realty ride on its growth curve in the to be reported quarter  The company is also banking on strategic acquisitions and development efforts  which are expected to boost its top line growth During the second quarter  Digital Realty expanded in Dublin with the official launch of its second data center on the company s Profile Park campus  This brought the company s total investment in Ireland to more than  200 million  indicating its focus to strengthen regional footprint  given the long term local demand  Also  in an effort to expand its presence in Japan  Digital Realty announced that its 50 50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation   MC Digital Realty   has opened the second facility  KIX11  on its Osaka connected campus Furthermore  the company has enhanced its presence in Europe  Australia and Asia in recent years through the development of high quality facilities  We believe such expansion efforts will drive the company s top and bottom lines in the quarter under consideration  Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter total revenues is  808 7 million  indicating 7 1  year over year growth However  competition has intensified  given the solid growth potential in the data center real estate market  This is likely to have led to aggressive pricing pressure in the quarter under review  In addition to this  interest expense burden remains a concern  with the company having a substantial debt position As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of  1 63 indicates a decrease of 1 8  from the prior year reported figure  Also  the estimate has witnessed a marginal downward revision in the past two months  Here is what our quantitative model predicts Digital Realty does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold

173152,394668,KIM,Is It Wise To Keep Realty Income  O  Stock In Your Portfolio ,opinion,It has been a rough phase for Retail REITs in the wake of dwindling mall traffic  shift of consumers toward online channels  store closures and bankruptcy of retailers  This has widely affected the price performance of several  including the likes of Kimco Realty Corp    NYSE KIM    Taubman Centers  Inc    NYSE O   and Macerich Company   NYSE MAC   However  Realty Income Corporation   NYSE O   has been able to differentiate itself by deriving more than 90  of the company s annualized retail rental revenues from tenants with a service  non discretionary  and or low price point component to their business  Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions  as well as competition from Internet retailing  Its portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant  industry  geography  and property type  In addition  besides retail properties  the company s portfolio comprises industrial  office  as well as agricultural properties The company is focused on external growth through exploring accretive acquisition opportunities  In fact  solid property acquisitions volume at decent investment spreads aided its performance  During the nine month period ended Sep 30  2018  Realty Income invested  1 47 billion in 591 new properties and properties under development or expansion  situated in 37 states  The assets are fully leased  with a weighted average lease term of around 14 4 years and an initial average lease yield of 6 3   The company remains confident of achieving its 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately  1 75 billion Furthermore  Realty Income s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition has helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently  In fact  since 1996  the company s occupancy level has never been below 96   Also  as of Sep 30  2018  portfolio occupancy was 98 8   expanding 10 basis points  bps  sequentially and 50 bps year over year  Management expects occupancy to remain in mid 98  for 2018  Additionally  its same store rent growth depicted limited operational volatility The company continues to maintain a conservative capital structure  It has modest leverage  robust liquidity  and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital  Further  solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders  and Realty Income remains committed to that  In September 2018  the company announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend  denoting the 98th dividend increase since Realty Income s NYSE listing in 1994  Thereafter  the company has retained its dividend rate The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase  The Monthly Dividend Company  and the October 2018 dividend payment marked its 84 consecutive quarterly increases  as well as payment of more than  5 7 billion throughout the company s 49 year operating history In three months  time  shares of Realty Income have outperformed the  it belongs to  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s shares have gained 8   while the industry has declined 14 9  Nonetheless  despite Realty Income s efforts to diversify the tenant base  its tenants in the convenience stores and drug stores industry accounted for around 12 1  and 9 9  of the company s rental revenues in third quarter 2018  This makes the company s results susceptible to any adverse changes in these industries  Also  the choppy environment and tenant credit issues remain concerns for the overall retail real estate industry Hike in interest rate is a concern for Realty Income  Essentially  rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company  which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well  Moreover  amid rising rates  not only will financing costs increase  but common stock buyers will also demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock Realty Income has a substantial exposure to single tenant assets  In fact  of the company s 5 694 properties in the portfolio  as of Sep 30  2018  5 666  or 99 5   are single tenant properties and the remaining are multi tenant assets  Nonetheless  single tenant leases involve specific and significant risks associated with tenant default  Thus  in case of financial failure of  or default in payment by  a single tenant  the company s rental revenues from that property  as well as the value of the property suffers significantly The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says

173261,394777,KIM,What s In The Offing For Kimco Realty  KIM  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Kimco Realty Corporation   NYSE KIM   is slated to report third quarter 2017 results on Oct 25  after the market closes  Both its revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share are anticipatedto be up year over year Last quarter  this New Hyde Park  NY based retail real estate investment trust  REIT  reported in line results with respect to FFO per share  The company also recorded the strongest leasing volume in the past decade Over the trailing four quarters  Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in line results in the other three  recording an average beat of 30 9   The graph below depicts this surprise history Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   However  the stock has lost 23 7  year to date versus the  s loss of 4  Note  All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations  FFO  per share Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsKimco has been taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision  The company has been purchasing premium assets in key U S  markets and carrying out joint venture buyouts  Its efforts included exit from Canada as well as exodus from secondary markets In fact  in July  Kimco announced the purchase of Jantzen Beach Center for  131 8 million  This is the company s eighth property in the Portland Vancouver Hillsboro MSA  The move comes as part of Kimco s strategic 2020 Vision that envisages portfolio quality upgrade with premium acquisitions in selective locations  financed by proceeds reaped from dispositions Further  the company is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost the capital structure  and enhance its growth profile and tax efficiency However  the increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot com bandwagon has created pressure on the top line figure for this REIT  A number ofretailers are filing for bankruptcy and opting for store closures  as mall traffic has been shrinking due to the soaring online purchases  Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing the omni channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers  it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results Furthermore  as part of its portfolio upgrade strategy  Kimco is aggressively disposing non core assets  While such efforts are encouraging for the long term  the earnings dilution led by high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term  Therefore  these moves are expected to hurt the company s growth momentum in the to be reported quarter Kimco s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations for the third quarter remained unchanged at 38 cents  over the past month Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Kimco is 0 00  Zacks Rank  Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around The Macerich Company   NYSE MAC    scheduled to release earnings on Oct 30
