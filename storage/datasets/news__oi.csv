147984,369500,OI,U S  glass firm sues Venezuela to collect  500 million expropriation award,news," Reuters    U S  glass container maker  Owens Illinois Inc   NYSE OI  has sued Venezuela and state owned companies as it seeks to collect a  500 million arbitration award over the 2010 nationalization of two plants  according to a lawsuit filed on Monday 
Owens Illinois was granted the award in 2015 by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  which said the company was entitled to  372 million plus interest  the filing in the U S  District Court in Delaware showed 
The lawsuit names state oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA PDVSA and its U S  refining unit Citgo Petroleum Corp  claiming that they are  alter egos  and mere instrumentalities of Venezuela itself  
The cash strapped Venezuelan government has little in the way of offshore assets  which has encouraged creditors to consider creative ways to collect 
In November  Venezuela reached a deal with Canadian mining firm Crystallex International Corp that had sought to collect an arbitration award against Venezuela by seizing Citgo via a court order  The government agreed to pay  1 2 billion in installments to protect Citgo 
PDVSA in August agreed a  2 billion settlement with ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  after the U S  producer had seized PDVSA Caribbean assets in an attempt to enforce its claim 
Previous agreements by the Venezuelan government and its state run companies over dozens of arbitrations and legal claims related to late socialist President Hugo Chavez s nationalizations have mostly ended in renegotiations and legal disputes 
PDVSA and Citgo did not respond to requests for comment outside regular working hours 
It is unclear whether the case could be affected by U S  sanctions against PDVSA  amid an intense power struggle for control in Venezuela between President Nicolas Maduro and self declared head of state Juan Guaido

OperatorThank you for standing by  and welcome to the O I Glass Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions  Please be advised that today s conference is being recorded  Operator Instructions  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today  Mr  Chris Manuel  Vice President of Investor Relations  Thank you  Please go ahead  sir Chris Manuel    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Vincent  and welcome everyone to the O I Glass Year End and Fourth Quarter Earnings Call  Our discussion today will be led by Andres Lopez  our CEO and John Haudrich  our CFO  Today we will provide key business developments and provide a review and outlook of our financial results  Following prepared remarks  we ll host a Q A session Presentation materials for this earnings call are available on the Company s website at o i com  Please review the safe harbor comments and disclosure of our use of non GAAP financial measures included in those materials Some of the financials we re presenting today relate to non GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings  adjusted free cash flow  segment operating profit and net debt  which exclude certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations  A reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP items can be found in our earnings press release and in the appendix to this presentation I d now like to turn the call over to Andres Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerThanks Chris  good morning  and thank you for your interest in O I Glass  O I made solid progress improving its operating performance over the course of the second half of 2019  despite a very challenging start to the year  While faced with these challenges  the Company continued to execute its strategy  These included taking a number of bold structural actions to change O I s business fundamentals As we will discuss shortly  this includes efforts to optimize our business portfolio and capital structure  including critical efforts to address our legacy asbestos liability  Likewise  we initiated a number of important turnaround initiatives to improve our business performance With an eye on the long term  we continued to advance MAGMA and create a new business model for glass  We are confident that these efforts will improve our business performance and cash flows in 2020 and beyond Turning to some details on Slide 3  Last night  we reported fourth quarter 2019 earnings of  0 50 per share  For the full year  earnings were  2 24 and O I generated  133 million of adjusted free cash flow  Earnings were at the high end of our most recent guidance range and adjusted free cash flow exceeded our expectations Fourth quarter segment profit was down modestly from the prior year and was flat with 2018 when excluding the impact of foreign currency and a few temporary items  Operationally  the benefit of higher net pricing and sales volumes offset elevating operating cost linked to rebalance that s linked to the plant capacity curtailments implemented earlier this past quarter As I said a moment ago  we ended the year on a positive note with good momentum heading into 2020  At a high level  we expect 2020 adjusted EPS will range between  2 10 and  2 25  Operationally  this is a 3  to 10  improvement adjusted for the impact of divestitures and temporary items  We expect cash flow will significantly improve following actions to address our legacy asbestos liabilities  While 2019 free cash flow was slightly negative  we expect to generate  300 million or more in 2020 On Slide 4  I will expand on my previous comments on the bold actions we are taking to change our business fundamentals  First  we are improving our structure  We are expanding in attractive growing markets  supported by long term contracts with the strategic customers and we are exiting areas that are not core to our strategy We are very pleased with the Nueva Fanal acquisition and recent expansion efforts in South America  Both of these efforts increase our presence in the premium beer segment  As part of our tactical divestiture program  we monetized our soda ash JV at an attractive evaluation  Likewise  our strategic portfolio review is under way  which includes review of alternatives for our Australia and New Zealand businesses  Recent refinancing efforts have improve our liquidity and financial flexibility In 2020  we will continue to expand our business in attractive markets and segments  This includes the first brownfield expansion in Europe in the past 20 years and starting the fifth furnace at our JV with CBI early in the year  Likewise  we will advance our tactical and strategic portfolio review  This review includes several aspects of our business and we expect to have a resolution on ANZ by mid 2020 In late December  we completed our corporate modernization initiative that supported the Chapter 11 filing of Paddock in January and set in motion efforts to finally resolve our legacy asbestos liability  Overall  we are laser focused on improving our cash flow generation and reducing debt After our challenges last year  we are highly focused on turning around our operating performance  Fortunately  we did see improving trends in the back half of 2019 and we have momentum heading into 2020  Consistent with seasonal trends of our business  we generated a strong cash flow in the second half of the year  supporting nearly  1 billion of debt reduction by the year end Following recent challenges  adapting to mix changes in a handful of plants in North America and Europe  I m happy to report our focus factories have exhibited marked improvement in recent months  We expect these headwinds will abate over the next few quarters  We have also introduced three turnaround initiatives to further boost performance  which I will discuss in a moment Importantly  we have taken actions in the fourth quarter to shut down capacity in North America to align capacity with demand  In 2020  execution of our turnaround initiatives will be critical to improve performance along with ongoing efforts in the footprint in North America Finally  our aim is to revolutionize glass  This means addressing the historic constraints that glass has faced and leveraging key trends like sustainability  These actions should create new growth opportunities  MAGMA represent the future of glass manufacturing  The technology should enable dramatic reductions in capital intensity  improve speed to market and significantly enhance flexibility We have achieved all key milestones at our initial pilot plant and we are expanding magma to a second location in Germany which should be operational near the end of 2020  Overall  we are taking a number of bold actions as we build on our recent momentum to change O Is business fundamentals Turning to Slide 5  admittedly 2019 was not the year we expected  as organic sales volumes were down and operating costs were elevated  In response  we initiated our turnaround initiatives to directly address these challenges  In total  we are targeting  35 million to  50 million of net benefits in 2020 from these actions  As we are currently ramping up activity  the run rate savings exiting this year will exceed this net benefit amount Over the three years  we expect the initiatives will generate  150 million or more of net benefits  Revenue and mix optimization is our first initiative  We are taking a holistic approach to growing the top line  I ve already discussed expansion initiatives to grow our business In addition  we expect to drive higher price and improved mix in select markets and categories  building on the success we have achieved in the past two years in Europe  While we have seen good growth in certain markets  we have also experienced base erosion in some pockets of our business With enhanced focus  we intend to mitigate this pressure points  This focus also applies to customer payment terms  which are essential for improved cash flow generation  Finally  we are commercializing a suite of new innovative product offerings that can serve a changing market landscape  particularly in North America Factory performance is our next initiative and builds on total system cost approach over the past few years  In addition to targeting cost improvements  we are improving operating performance and efficiency across the network  As we ve seen with our focused factory effort in the back half of 2019  greater intervention and enablement at the plant level can have a quick and meaningful impact on operating performance This initiative expands that concept across our network with a clear set of priorities per plant supported by global resources  Likewise  we are evaluating our plant portfolio and will be making footprint adjustments to keep supply matched with longer term demand trends  primarily in North America Cost transformation is our third initiative  Supported by Accenture  we are implementing a zero based approach to reduce SG A and evolve our operating structure in line with our current strategy  We are confident that these three initiatives will help turnaround O I s performance in 2020 and beyond On Slide 6  we have depicted a historic review of our organic sales volume trends  On the top right  you will see O I Network volumes that have exhibited a stable to improving levels over the past five years  including 2019  Legacy volumes which include O I consolidated operations have been flat to modestly down  Recognizing the challenge we have seen intentionally    we have been intentionally building our position in key strategic JV s focus on attractive markets in Mexico and Central America Each of our regions face their unique market trends with tailored strategies  Europe was able to grow with the market in earlier periods until they became capacity constrained in 2018  As such the region  quite successfully focus on mix optimization toward segment profits  Our brownfield expansion should restore growth in 2020 The Americas network has posted consistent volume improvement aided by expansion in our strategic JV s and a strong growth in Latin America  However  the Americas legacy trend has been under pressure  This reflects the net effect of a strong growth in Latin America  which has been more than offset by a significant decline in beer across North America To put this into perspective  North America beer declined about 14  in 2019 and now represents just 9  of O I s total legacy volume  We have address these head on by stopping two furnaces in the fourth quarter and a total of five furnaces since 2015  Likewise  we have closed or repurposed 17 machine lines over the past several years  Overall  these actions have effectively reduced our North American beer capacity by 35   We stand ready to take further actions as conditions warranted As I touched on earlier  we are focused on introducing new product innovations for the changing market needs in North America  As we discussed elements of our Asia Pacific region are on the strategic review Let s advance to Slide 7  where I will outline our expectations for future volumes  In summary  we anticipate 2020 total sales volume will be flat to up 2  including Nueva Fanal an expansion initiatives  This chart illustrates the sale volume trends by key geographies for 2019 and our outlook in 2020  For comparative purposes  we have provided market forecaster Euromonitor for those geographies As you can see  we expect our sales volume will be stable or growing across nearly all geographies and our performance should be in line with market trends  Overall North America is expected to be down mid single digits and is the only market we expect to be below the prior year  driven by a double digit decline in beer In some geographies  we expect to outperform market trends  supported by capacity expansion initiatives anchored by new supply agreements  Increasingly  our customers see the strategic value in working with O I  as well as the strong brand building and sustainable attributes that glass offers Now  I would like to turn the call over to John who will address the specific financials and outlook John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Andres  and good morning  By now  I m sure you ve all seen our financial details in the materials posted last night  So  I will focus on the key points of our recent performance in 2020 outlook  As we announced  fourth quarter adjusted EPS was  0 50  which was at the high end of our guidance range of  0 45 to  0 50 As illustrated on the chart  total segment operating profit was  200 million  While profits were down from  211 million in 2018  results were in line with the prior year after excluding temporary items that benefited 2018  but did not repeat in 2019  such as the resolution of indirect tax matters in Brazil Overall  our average selling prices improved strongly  outpacing cost inflation and added  21 million to segment operating profit  Volume and mix contributed  1 million to profit  which is the net effect of the benefit from Nueva Fanal and the impact of slightly lower organic volumes Higher net price and volume offset higher operating costs driven by market related downtime in the U S   Mexico and China that impacted results by  13 million Looking below the operating line  our tax rate was around 30   which was up significantly from 15  last year and a more normalized rate of around 25   The higher rate reflects changes in regional earnings mix  Overall  our operating performance was in line with the prior year  while results were impacted by temporary items and the higher tax rate Moving to Slide 9  let me share a little color on regional performance during the quarter  In the Americas  segment profit was  115 million  which was down  12 million from the prior year as elevated operating costs more than offset the benefit of higher net price and sales volumes Shipments were up 3 5  due to the Nueva Fanal  while organic volumes were flat  South America continued its trend of strong growth  However  Mexico was down low single digits due to macroeconomic conditions and North America was down mid single digits on continued lower beer demand  While the region made good progress addressing operating mix complexity  higher costs mostly pertain to market related downtime Europe s operating profit was  69 million  up  13 million despite headwinds from FX and temporary items  Higher earnings reflected strong price realization in conjunction to the region s mix improvement strategy  Volumes were down nearly 2   but this is mostly a comparison issue due to customer pre buying in late 2018 ahead of an SAP conversion in January of 2019 In Asia Pacific  segment profit was  16 million  which was down from  28 million in the prior year  Prices were down slightly amid moderate cost inflation in the region  Shipments were up  there was    but there was significant market related downtime in China to rebalance supply Moving to Slide 10  let me recap our 2019 performance  For the year  O I reported adjusted earnings of  2 24  toward the top end of our guidance range  Likewise  adjusted free cash flow was  133 million which was solidly better than our outlook of approximately  100 million  As illustrated on the chart  our results were down from  2 72 in 2018 Importantly  non operational items represented a  0 49 headwind  which was greater than the overall decline in EPS  This includes FX  temporary items and a higher tax rate  Looking at business performance  the benefit of higher price was more than offset by slightly lower sales volume and elevated operating costs Higher operating costs impacted results by  0 25  which is made up of three factors that are each about equal weight  Commissioning costs  operating complexity and market related downtime  These factors were more than offset by corporate cost control efforts  lower management incentive expense and other items as illustrated on the chart Looking at cash flows  the Company generated  133 million of adjusted free cash flow in 2019  and as I mentioned  this exceeded our guidance of  100 million  We achieved this higher result despite reducing AR factoring by 10  or  61 million as we rebalanced our liquidity position  By comparison  factoring was a source of cash in 2018 Working capital was an overall headwind to cash flow this past year  yet results were better than we anticipated as we sharpened our focus on working capital management in the second half of the year  We view 2019 as an aberration  As I ll review shortly  we expect significantly improved cash flows in 2020 Let me spend a moment discussing capital allocation  I m now on Slide 11  Our priorities remain the same  We intend to improve our balance sheet  fund our strategy and return value to shareholders  With that said  debt reduction remains our top priority driven by operating cash flow and proceeds from divestitures As illustrated on the chart  seasonality plays a big role in the timing of cash flow generation  The first part of the year is a use of cash and the second half is a strong source  As you can see  the Company generated over  900 million of adjusted free cash flow during the second half of the year  Strong cash flow as well as the proceeds from divestitures enabled about  1 billion of debt reduction in the second half of 2019 Net debt ended the year at  5 billion  which was favorable to our guidance  As Anders discussed earlier  we continue to advance our tactical divestiture program and strategic portfolio review efforts  While we intend to fund our strategy  2020 strategic capex will be directed to advancing MAGMA  while acquisitions remain deprioritized Finally returning value to our shareholders is essential  In addition to initiating a dividend in 2019   400 million is available on our share repurchase authorization  However  this will be de emphasized until leverage approaches 3 times or to potentially offset the impact of divestiture dilution Moving to Slide 12  I will share more details on asbestos  First  let me put this in context  asbestos related liabilities have profoundly impacted O I  Over the past 10 years  cash payments have consumed about 40  of adjusted free cash flow  While we are committed to honoring our responsibility  this cash drain has materially hindered the Company s ability to invest in the business With Paddock s Chapter 11 filing  definitive action has been taken to establish a final  certain and equitable resolution to the legacy asbestos related liabilities  Building on the materials shared January 6th  let me provide some further information  First  the Chapter 11 court proceedings are progressing as expected  Second  in conjunction with our annual review process  we did update our year end 2019 asbestos related liability  The estimate now stands at  486 million and we expect this will remain fixed until there is a final court determination Third  Paddock was deconsolidated after the January filing  For modeling purposes  the deconsolidation of Paddock s cash will be reflected in the investing section of the cash flow statement  Finally  all asbestos related settlement payments are suspended pending the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings 2020 will be the first year in decades that all of the Company s free cash flow is available to fund value for the Company and its shareholders  As I mentioned  debt reduction remains our top capital allocation priority Shifting gears  let me touch base on our 2020 outlook  as depicted on Slides 13 and 14  Overall  we expect 2020 adjusted earnings will be between  2 10 and  2 25 per share  and full year free cash flow should be approximately  300 million or greater  While our earnings outlook is at or slightly below our 2019 results  we do face about  0 20 of known headwinds including temporary items and foregone earnings from sold assets  Absent these items  we expect base earnings will improve about 3  to 10  Earnings will benefit from continued favorable net price  Sales volumes that are flat to up 2   and improved operating costs  Shipments will benefit about 1  from a full year of Nueva Fanal and inorganic volumes should be plus or minus 1  While we still see some residual effect of mix complexity and commissioning costs  the benefits from the turnaround initiatives will more than offset these ongoing costs  Non operating items include lower interest expense  given recent refinancing as well as higher corporate cost to support MAGMA advancement and resetting of management incentives Shifting to cash flows  overall  we expect free cash flow of approximately  300 million or greater  It s important to note that starting in 2020 our guidance will include free cash flow and not adjusted free cash flow since asbestos payments had been suspended  This represents a significant improvement from the prior year  as illustrated on the chart  Higher cash flow reflects no asbestos payments and lower capex  which should be in the range of  350 million to  375 million Working capital will remain a use of cash  given the ongoing shift in regional and customer mix that affects accounts receivable levels  However  it will be less of a drag  representing a benefit of  75 million or more on a year over year basis  Overall  we expect better core earnings and significantly improved cash flow generation  Additional regional details are on the next page Let me conclude on Slide 15 with our perspective on first quarter  Overall  we expect first quarter adjusted earnings will be in the range of  0 40 to  0 45 per share  While this is down from  0 51 in the prior year  results should be in line with last year  adjusting for divestitures and temporary items  such as the Italian energy credit We expect higher prices will more than offset cost inflation and volume should be flat to up 2  supported by Nueva Fanal  Elevated operating costs will continue through the first quarter but moderate thereafter as we absorb some market related downtime and our furnace maintenance activity is skewed to the first half of the year We will also incur some commissioning costs at Gironcourt ahead of the second quarter start up  With that said  these elevated costs will be partially offset by continued improvement in addressing mix complexity and the initial benefits from turnaround initiatives  As we all know the Coronavirus outbreak could potentially affect economic activity  Fortunately  our plant in Southern China is currently operating without issue  However  this is a fluid situation  which could impact our outlook as events unfold In summary  the first quarter results will be muted by temporary items and elevated operating costs  but we are setting the stage for improved results in subsequent periods Now  I d like to turn the call back to Anders to make a few closing remarks Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  John  Let me conclude today s discussion by reiterating the bold structural actions we are taking to change our business fundamentals  First  we are optimizing our structure  This includes ensuring we have the right business portfolio for evolving markets After a few recent acquisitions geared to increase exposure to attractive growing markets  we are now focused on divesting assets that are not core to our strategy  Proceeds from divestitures along with decisive actions to address legacy liabilities will improve our balance sheet health  All of these actions are well under way Second  we are focused on turning around our business performance  Executing our turnaround initiatives is a top priority in 2020  In total  we expect  35 million to  50 million of net benefits will be achieved this year with a run rate totaling  150 million or more to be unlocked in coming years Considering unfavorable secular beer trends in North America  we expect continued footprint adjustments as well as introduction of innovative new products  Success will be measured by generating higher free cash flows  redeployed for debt reduction Third  we intend to revolutionize glass and MAGMA will be a game changer in our business  Coupled with important trends like sustainability  glass is well positioned for future growth  Thank you for your interest in O I Glass  We will now welcome your questions Chris Manuel    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Vincent  we re now ready for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  First question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird  Your line is now open Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystHey guys  good morning  how are you John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Ghansham Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystHey  Andres  you know  as you consider further North American capacity optimization  I guess how are you preparing for the inevitable increase in manufacturing complexity related to some of the production struggles you ve had post previous closures in North America And then second  on the capex of  350 million to  375 million  that would be the lowest levels since 2014  and after 2014  capex stepped up quite a bit  Just trying to get a sense as to whether the capex you re citing for 2020 is sustainable going forward  Thanks Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you  With regards to complexity  We ve been working along    in the last few years in pulling together things like lower manufacturing fundamentals  We have in place a standard work system for factories which we are deploying  We have about 30 factories at this point in time implemented  So we  are very quickly  increasing the number of factories that have it in place  We are deploying resources globally  We are increasing visibility of performance  We improved reporting  We improved the accountability in the system  We have better governance overall So we feel that after having the issues we had last year  we ve been able to bring together all the things that we developed over the last few years to be able to better sustain and improve performance in factories that is    that are exposed to complexity  Now over the last two  three years we on boarded a large volume within North America of diverse mix to be able to offset beer We have slowed down that on boarding lately  so we give the factories the chance to improve too  So at this point in time  we feel very comfortable  we have the right system in place  We have the right resources  We are deploying them to the largest opportunities and we should be able to sustain operations going forward  even though complexity will continue to increase  because of the changes in the end market When it comes to the capex  I think the most important thing to watch is the asset stability and asset stability has improved over the last few years  We monitor this very closely and we feel comfortable for the 2020 period  This is the right level of cash to be deployed to assets in the maintenance side and we will evaluate as we get closer to 2021 the needs of capex for that particular year John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI would add here Ghansham is that in our system  we spent about  300 million a year on maintenance related capital and we will continue to do that this year too  So that reduction we would see on a year over year basis  as I mentioned before  is more on the strategic capital side So that s  50 million to  75 million of strategic capital and most of that  as we said  is MAGMA and ramping up some projects we were doing such a Gironcourt and other things  And important to note is going forward  you know as MAGMA evolves  we would look for potentially deployment of that down the road  and we do expect that to be at lower capital intensity than legacy assets and furnaces OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America  Your line is now open George L  Staphos    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  everyone  Good morning  thanks for all the details  And actually  really appreciate some of the reconciliation table that you had in terms of bridging to  20 and the quarter  So thank you for that  I want to piggyback a little bit off of Ghansham s question  We ve all been covering the Company for a long time and there are always these episodic plans to improve operations  performance  volume I mean  I think you touched on it a little bit  but what one or two things  Andres  tangibly make you confident about the fact that this turnaround program will actually lead to sustained improved performance as opposed to    in a few years we ll have to true it up again  What one or two things tangibly make you positive on volumes for O I which have never been something that can be    growth has never been able to be sustained for the Company and that s maybe the biggest issue for the Company And when we think about that transformation and the buckets  how do the three contribute both to 20s numbers and then over the rest of the  150 million program  Thank you Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So the    when I look at complexity  we had the issue we had last year  As I mentioned before  we ve been developing several tools and several approaches to our production process that we re now deploying across more factories to be able to be    able to evaluate  Phonetic  complexity better  What gives me confidence is the progress we re making  We re in fact seeing quite a good progress in what we call the focus factories  which are the ones directly impacted by complexity  So that s going quite well We have the right system  We have the right people in the right roles  We have the right reporting system in the company  The right analytics  The right accountability  So I feel comfortable we re making good progress and I think we re going to be able to deliver in our commitments for 2020 in that regards  When it comes to volume  again in 2019  we had quite a few issues  many of them    functional issues We saw the wear issue in Europe  We saw the slowdown of wine in France  in exports to China  slowdown in Mexico in NAB s  we saw a slowdown in the U S  in NABs growth  So  now when we look at this year  there are three  Phonetic  assignable things that we are considering as we look at our volume performance for the year There are inorganic volumes kicking in and there are organic volumes  Inorganic is Nueva Fanal which is now going to have a full year  Organic  we have decreased sales in Brazil because now we re enjoying the capacity that we added Last year  We have increased volume too in Colombia  We re seeing incremental volume in Mexico  Mexico is exporting in 2020 to various countries in Americas and in Europe  And that is supporting our volumes  And we are having the incremental capacity in France  which is going to kick off in the second quarter  So that should give us incremental volume too And one more item that we re factoring in is the incremental line    production line that we put in place in Europe in the last quarter of the year  So now we re going to enjoy that capacity to move forward John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI can build on that and on the back half of that question  George  I mean just to piggyback on what Anders was saying  I mean on the volume side  when we invest in growth  in capacity constrained markets  like we did in Brazil and Colombia this year  We see that solid growth coming through double digit growth in some cases However it s when we don t have the capacity for growth that is when we hit head rooms in that regard  and then there is exposure to some other markets that are more pressured  So going forward  having the ability to keep on top of that and ideally down the road with MAGMA and to do that at less capital intensity  will allow us to be able to fund growth and keep ahead of that curve as opposed to behind it And then on the transformation  the three buckets  To put them in level of financial priority for 2020  the factory profitability is probably the largest of those three buckets  it is really building on the TSC work that we ve already been doing  but also a lot more intensity at profitability at the plant level The cost transformation is probably the next largest bucket  but it will take a little bit time to ramp up  because those are newer initiatives that are kicking off and then the revenue optimization side is the third bucket and that has more to do with more price and mix management and ultimately trying to work the volume pipeline that we ve been building over a period of time Over time  that will continue to progress  where I think the cost transformation elements will start to pick up steam as  on a relative basis  to the whole population OperatorNext question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Brian Maguire    Goldman  Sachs   Co     AnalystGood morning  guys  Just wanted to get some more details on the cash flow guidance  And also kind of related to that  the  150 million of turnaround improvement  I wasn t clear if the  150 million was an EBITDA  EBIT number or a free cash flow number  Just wondering if there are some maybe one time working capital benefits included in that  But on the cash flows  it seems like the working capital will be a big use of cash again in 2020  I think about a  100 million use of cash  It sounds like as it s down  75 million year over year Wondering if there is also some one time restructuring cash costs in there that may go away or I don t know if maybe they recur again in  21  But just getting a sense of like that free cash flow guide if there are some unique one time items in there for 2020  Thanks John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  sure  Let me build it out a little bit further  but on the    first point on the  150 million of turnaround  that is targeting EBIT and so it s not mixing and matching EBITDA  free cash flow or anything  That is an EBIT number  And so on the free cash flow and if I    I believe on Page 13 is where we have the full year guidance  we work off of where we started in  19 and then we have kind of a sub total there of  95 million  which includes the adjustment  four  Phonetic  things discrete items  Tata  the soda ash divestiture  as well as the Paddock So building off of that  obviously you can model in your own view of operating performance  but we would expect some level of EBIT improvement  Capex at  350 million to  375 million is something like a  50 million to  75 million year on year improvement to cash  Working capital  as we mentioned before  is going to be  75 million or higher  You are right  working capital was a use of cash this last year  It will be less of a use of cash Importantly  what I would say is that factoring was historically a source of cash as factoring was increasing  We elected to reduce factoring this year to rebalance our liquidity position  So there was actually a  61 million hit to working capital  so to speak  in our numbers this year So    then moving down the levers  dividends  we do expect will be higher  say   20 million to  30 million more  Some dividends in our joint ventures were suspended in the last year or two because of building out of furnaces and things like that  We did a lot of refinancing this last year  So interest is down from an expense standpoint  but also say  30 million to  40 million on the    on the cash side  giving especially the timing of payments Now  on the flip side  we expect cash taxes to be up a little bit higher  10 to  20 million  We ll have about another  15 million of higher pension contributions  And there are a number of other things that are  say   30 million in total  How much we spend on returnable pallets  things like that that will also flip over a little bit into next year So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on some of the details behind free cash flow and the movement into next year  The last question you had was on restructuring  We spent a little over  50 million of restructuring in 2019  This model assumes that that remains flat and that takes care of what we said as  we would anticipate footprint activities as well as ongoing other restructuring activities within the business OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank  Your line is now open Debbie Jones    Deutsche Bank Securities Inc     AnalystHi  good morning  I wanted to focus on Slide 7 and some of the growth highlights that you mentioned  Very specifically  can you talk about what you re seeing in Europe that supports the low single digit growth rates that the market is expecting  And I m assuming for you it s contracted volume from a line extension and that shown in that slide  And then  for Asia Pacific  can you just remind us what s kind of holding back the Australia New Zealand market  And then  just kind of the disconnect between year 2020 outlook of low single digit growth in the market which is a bit higher  Thank you Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  When we look at Europe  we are expecting solid demand in this region  So we re expecting their volumes to be flat to up 100 basis points  Beer is expected to be quite a strength because we are going to enjoy the new capacity  We have a long term agreement in place for that capacity  So that is going to kick in in Q2 Wine is expected to be slightly positive for the year  The reaming line of wine in Italy is very strong  France is a little softer but is still in a very good level of demand  Important to watch closely if there is any change in tariffs with the United States going forward because that might imply changes in France  But at this point in time  we re very comfortable  this will be a normal year for French And the spirits demand in Europe is expected to grow around mid single digit  So that is going to support our volume  So all in all  we have additional capacity for Europe  which we re going to enjoy now and demand remains very solid over there When we look at APAC  demand is around flat    about flat for every one of the geographies in which we are  including Australia New Zealand  they re pretty much flat  China  which has growth potential obviously has been impacted by the economy and now we have the Coronavirus that is kind of slowing down activity over there too  So we won t be able to enjoy that growth at this point in time  Indonesia  they    we had some growth  but altogether we are expecting that we ll have from flat to slightly up volumes in APAC going forward OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal  Your line is now open Mark Wilde    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGood morning  Andres Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Mark Wilde    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystAndres  I wondered if you could just give us a little color on what we might expect in terms of just downtime in 2020  And then maybe if you could talk about kind of the retrenchment in both North America and whether there is anything further to come in China Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So  we are expecting a normal year in downtime  We re seeing a little bit of a heavier than normal quarter this time in Q1 when it comes to asset repairs  That is just timing within the year that for the total year it s expected to be the same  When it comes to capacity in the United States  we already took the actions we needed to take  The capacity that needed to be down  is down already  So we are balanced at this point in time But as we said in the opening remarks  we re going to watch this closely  If something warrants either a change  we ll move forward with that change  but everything we have at this point in front of us in terms of information tell us we re balanced for the year  When it comes to China  we just got to watch closely what s emerging over there and see what that implies  As you know many businesses have been shutting down because of the Coronavirus  In our case  our business is operating  but we need to  again  monitor that very closely John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  the only thing I would add on the downtime on the front end of the comments is that we have a    we have different types of rebuild activities  major rebuild activities where every 10 to 15 years  we replace the furnace and then we also have these minor repairs that periodically go in and extend the life of the furnaces  The schedule this year of those major furnace rebuilds is very ratable over the course of the year  It s the minor rebuilds that are a little bit front end loaded in the year and that s why we re seeing a little bit of expense here in the first quarter OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is now open Gabe Hajde    Wells Fargo Securities  LLC    AnalystGood morning  gentlemen  I ll try to attack the capacity question from a different angle  you mentioned in the prepared remarks and the presentation  you ve closed about five facilities since 2015  And I think that somewhat coincides with the number of furnaces that have been opened up in your joint venture down in Mexico  So  I was curious if you can give us maybe a sense for what the net capacity adjustment has been within your legacy system and then maybe where utilization is today and if we continue to see kind of beer decline  I think you put it again in your prepared remarks  maybe upper single digits  What that would imply in 2020 and  21 Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerSo the    well that capacity that has been shut down over this period of time all relates to a local demand in the United States  The share of the various tiers of the beer categories obviously has changed over time  The category has moved toward premium  Premium is made up of several brands  Corona is very    is a very important brand there  So that has an influence in the total demand in the United States When it comes to the JV with CBI we already build four furnaces  the fifth furnace is going to operation early this year  And with that  that s the    these all we have planned  Now there is no direct connection right now between that furnace and the capacity balance we see in the United States  So for our purposes  we are balanced right now We re going to have the last furnace going into operation in Mexico for CBI and we ll continue watching very closely the capacity here  And if something changes beyond what we have reflected  which is the fastest decline rate we ve seen so far  is what is reflected in our projections right now  then we ll make a change  but we don t expect any of that at this point John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJust to give you a sense of sensitivity here is  for example  if there would be another follow on 10  to the decline in North American beer  that represents about one large furnace of volume  just you know as far as the sensitivity of the degree of activity Operator Operator Instructions  Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi  Your line is now open Anthony Pettinari    Citigroup Global Markets Inc     AnalystGood morning John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Anthony Pettinari    Citigroup Global Markets Inc     AnalystGood morning  I had a follow up question on complexity  I think on the last call you talked about a  0 10 to  0 12 hit from complexity issues for full year  19  a  0 10 hit from start up costs  Just wondering if you can talk about the extent to which you expect those costs to drag into 2020  How much of a hit you anticipate them being or how much of a hit you have to offset in other places John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I can touch base on that  With where things ended the year  we had profiled in one of our charts a  0 25  EPS hit for operating costs for the full year  of which about one third of it each was around complexity  commissioning costs  and then market related downtime  So that number ended up being a little trimmed down from that previous estimate there Now  keep in mind that we are also doing the turnaround initiatives that are looking to address this  So understanding the turnaround initiatives are something like  35 million to  50 million  But we re also going to have some of this residual complexity and other commissioning costs coming through  we probably think that the net of    improvement in net operating cost line  understanding those moving parts is probably  0 10 to  0 15  so to speak on a net net basis That means that we get the turnaround benefits and then you have some of that residual effect of complexity still there and some residual commissioning costs with Gironcourt  So  hopefully that provides a little bit of context OperatorNext question comes from the line of Mike Leithead from Barclays  Your line is now open Michael Leithead    Barclays    AnalystThanks  good morning guys Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Michael Leithead    Barclays    AnalystJust a quick    just a quick question on divestiture program  I believe you re targeting  call it  405 million to  500 million in the soda ash sale gives you about  200 million  So I guess for the remaining  250 million or so that you re targeting  can you just give us a rough updated timeframe of when you d expect to execute on that and should we expect there to be another one to two sizable announcements like soda ash or are we taking five or six smaller things left John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI ll address that  So you re right  So we have something like  200 million to  300 million left in that program  when we originally initiated that program  which was at our Investor Day over a year ago  We said it was a three year program  of which we re going to get  200 million in the first year  We have a number of irons in the fire  probably the largest individual one did represent the soda ash transaction  although there are a few more in there that are of size It s going to be a combination of non core elements  kind of like that soda ash transaction is a good example  but there is also a number of property sales that are    that are under way right now  In fact  we have a number of them that are getting inked up as we speak That are going to be    probably be spattered across the time horizon  I do think we ll probably make good progress here in 2020  But I don t want to commit to a specific dollar amount  because then it effect the negotiating position of the company  So again  good progress this year a number of different items in the hopper right now OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc  Your line is now open Adam J  Josephson    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystAndres  John  good morning  And thanks for taking my question Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerHi  good morning Adam J  Josephson    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  John  just a couple on cash flow  So assuming your asset sales go as you expect over the balance of the year and given your earnings forecast or cash flow forecast  What do you expect your net leverage to end the year at  So is 4 0 at year end  19  What are you expecting roughly at year end  20 And just on a related topic  you talked about  you re reducing your factoring in  19 to rebalance your liquidity and I m not sure what exactly you mean by that  Obviously factoring means debt  So maybe you didn t want to increase your debt  I m not sure  But can you just  kind of in plain English  talk about why you reduced your factoring last year after addressing the other question about net leverage  Thank you very much John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  sure  So first on the net leverage so with what s laid out here in the outlook  which does not have any divestitures in it  that brings the leverage down to around 3 8 times versus 4 0 at the end of 2020  Obviously anything that is incremental to that  as far as divestitures will continue to bring that down  and obviously our longer term goal is to bring it down to three times leverage through the combination of these divestitures as well as operating cash flows  obviously So we think that we ll end the year if we re able to execute these divestitures and the strategic reviews as we ve been talking about with making more progress obviously than that 3 8 number  But I don t want to give a specific dollar amount to that So let me touch base on liquidity  So  as you may recall  around mid 2019  we renegotiated our bank credit agreement that increased our line of credit from  1 billion to  1 5 billion  And then we also were taking a look at other things that were out there and the factoring was one of them  So factoring at the end of 2018 was around  600 million or in excess of 50  of total receivables And so taking a look at how    what is the total liquidity on lines as well as uncommitted lines of credit for example as factoring represents  we wanted to rebalance that off and we ended the year in 2019 making about a 10  reduction or around 40  of receivables being factored So it s really just kind of balancing that off  also keeping in mind that on factoring it s  in many ways  the lowest cost of debt that we have and financing for the company  But we also want to make sure that we don t find ourselves factoring in higher cost markets that obviously increase the interest cost of the business  And so I think where we landed right now is a pretty good place for balancing that off OperatorNext question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  thanks  good morning Andres Lopez    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystI guess another question I guess on the longer term cash flow outlook  When you think about that  300 million or better and then  you mentioned about  300 million of maintenance capex  I mean  looking out a couple of years  how do you expect capex and cash flow to trend  Would you consider 2020 kind of the inflection point to continued free cash flow growth  Thanks John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would say that it will be and intentionally meant to be an inflection year to growth  So as we look at the operating leverage of the business you know we ve spend a fair amount of time talking about the turnaround initiatives  things like that  So that s an important component of improving the operating performance of the business The capital levels  we did    again this  300 million on the maintenance related side of the fence is one piece of the pie  Ultimately  we will probably need to put some more capital into strategic growth  But as we go even longer term in the future  as I talked about before is MAGNA comes online that becomes at a lower capital intensity  not only for the maintenance side of the house  but also to be able to do more on the strategic side of lower capital intensity So obviously  as we look to reduce debt  interest payments and things like that will also go down  The working capital management practices that we ve been talking about and focused on that should yield fruit also Chris Manuel    Vice President of Investor RelationsI think we have time for one last follow up  Vincent OperatorNext question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America  Your line is now open George L  Staphos    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi guys  Thank you so much for taking the follow on  Really quickly  can you update us on what the next steps for the Paddock process are  Thank you and good luck in the quarter John Haudrich    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Yeah  George  as you can imagine right now there is    the process has started  It s proceeding as expected  the initial motions and the formation of the creditor committee activities  I think what we re going to go into is a period of lot of administrative activities that require set up and things like that  So there s probably not a lot that we can update for the time being  although it s following as we would expect and obviously we intend to be constructive through the process as we ve noted Chris Manuel    Vice President of Investor RelationsAll right guys  thank you  I would like to note that    thank you for participating in O Is call today  Our first quarter conference call is scheduled for April 29th 2020 and it s always an

147994,369510,OI,Analysts Estimate O I Glass  OI  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when O I Glass  OI  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

148061,369577,OI,Is Owens Illinois  OI  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Owens Illinois  Inc    NYSE OI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Owens Illinois has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 94  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 06  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Owens Illinois  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 33  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Owens Illinois has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 48  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Owens Illinois stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings   Right now  Owens Illinois has a P S ratio of about 0 43  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  OI is near the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Owens Illinois currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Owens Illinois a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Owens Illinois is just 0 88  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 98  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  the P CF ratio for Owens Illinois came in at 3 19  which is a bit lower than the industry average of 4 50  Clearly  Owens Illinois is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Owens Illinois might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives OI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the full year estimate has seen two down and one up in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 20 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Owens Illinois  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineOwens Illinois is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 42  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Glass Products industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017

148062,369578,OI,Analysts Estimate Owens Illinois  OI  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Owens Illinois  NYSE OI  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This glass container manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 64 billion  down 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Owens Illinois 
For Owens Illinois  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 58  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Owens Illinois will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Owens Illinois would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering a surprise of  3 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

	Industrial production rebounded in September from a decline in August  adding to the tally of encouraging economic data signifying improvement in the U S  economy during the third quarter  The Federal Reserve reported that the increase in industrial production during the third quarter was the best in the year so far  Rise in manufacturing and mining outputs played a crucial role in boosting overall industrial production last month 

Rebound in Industrial Production

	Industrial production rose 0 1  last month  rebounding from 0 5  decline in August on the back of 0 2  gain in manufacturing and 0 4  increase in mining productions  Moreover  industrial production during the last quarter rose at an annual pace of 1 8   the highest since the third quarter of 2015  Strong gains in utilities production despite a decline last month and a rise in manufacturing output primarily boosted industrial production last quarter  Utilities and manufacturing outputs registered gains of 0 9  and 6 2  during the third quarter  respectively 

	Among the major market groups  it was non industrial supplies that primarily led industrial production higher  It was also boosted by a strong rebound in construction output  After falling 1 4  in August  production at the construction segment rose 0 8  last month  Separately  capacity utilization rose to 75 4  last month from 75 3  registered in August  While capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector rose 0 1  to 74 9  in September  the same in the mining segment increased 0 5  to 75 5  

Will the Rebound Sustain 

	Though up slightly in September  capacity utilizations remain significantly below the long term  1972 2015  average of 80 0   This is an indication that there is enough room for the economy to expand its capacity in order to boost industrial production further in the days ahead  However  it will entirely depend on near term prospects of the U S  economy  Recent economic data including ISM Manufacturing Index and factory orders signal toward improvement in the U S  economy in the second half of the year 

	The ISM Manufacturing Index increased 2 1 percentage points to a level of 51 5  during the month of September  The reading exceeded the level of 49 4  registered during the month of August  Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing activity  Strong gains in new orders led manufacturing activity to rebound last month  Additionally  factory orders rose 0 2  in August after advancing 1 4  in July  Though non farm payrolls decreased last month  the labor market remained on a strong footing 

	Separately  other economic data including nine year high consumer confidence and strong gain in retail sales also indicate that the economy is rebounding  These positive indications along with a recovery in oil prices in recent times have left little doubt about the sustainability of last month s rebound 

4 Industrial Stocks to Buy

	Banking on this impressive backdrop  selecting potential stocks from the industrial products domain might be a prudent option for investors  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 

	This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 

	We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and a VGM score of  A  

Worthington Industries  Inc     NYSE      is one of the leading diversified metal processing companies  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 27  for the current year compared with the industry average of 1 8   Its earnings estimate for the current year has surged 18 9  over the last 30 days

Owens Illinois  Inc   NYSE      is involved in production and selling of glass container products  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 15 9  for the current year  The P E ratio for the current financial year  F1  is 7 35  lower than the industry average of 11 33

148233,369749,OI,Owens Illinois  Korn Ferry  AbbVie And Johnson   Johnson Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   July 01  2016    highlights Owens Illinois  NYSE OI     as the Bull of the Day and  Korn Ferry    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV      and  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ     

Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  

  

Owens Illinois    has met or beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last seven quarters  Over that span  there were only two meets and more importantly to aggressive growth investors  the last two reports saw solid beats on the top line  The stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and today it is the Bull of the Day 

The Numbers

OI beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 40 by  0 08 for a 20  positive earnings surprise  The topline was equally as impressive with the company reporting revenues of  1 588B and that was  60M more than expected for a 3 9  positive revenue surprise 

As a result of the great performance Wall Street sent shares of OI higher by more than 4  in the session following the release 

Description

Owens Illinois makes glass containers  The Company s principal product lines are glass containers for the food and beverage industries  Owens Illinois was founded in 1903 and is headquartered in Perrysburg  Ohio 

Earnings History

As noted above the company has a solid recent history of beating the number  With five of the last seven reports coming in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate there is a clear signal here that company executives know how to manage Wall Street 

When I expand my view back another seven quarters I see another five beats  but I add on two misses  The 14 quarter history is a solid one  with 10 beats  2 misses and 2 meets 

Estimates

Estimates have been moving higher almost all year  The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate was  2 15 in February  but moved higher by two and three cents in the following two months  A big move higher of a dime in May brought the number to  2 30  and it remained at that level for the month of June 

The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from  2 41 to  2 55 over the same time period albeit with fewer actual increases 

Valuation

The valuation for OI is nothing if not enticing  The forward PE of 7 5x is less than half the industry average of 16x  Just because one metric is super low  don t expect the stock to just double to catch up to the industry average  To support that argument  look at the price to book of 6 6x when the industry average is 7x  The price to sales multiple of 0 4x is only one third of the 1 2x industry average 

To me  the valuation looks very attractive to a company that is looking at double the industry average revenue growth for this year  Analysts are looking for 9 5  revenue growth for OI this year compared to 4 3  revenue growth for the broader industry 

More growth at a discount  That is what I love to see 

 

Korn Ferry    posted back to back beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  That doesn t make a stock the Bear of the Day  so let s figure out why the stock is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and the Bear of the Day 

The Numbers

KFY beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 54 by  0 04 for a 7 4  positive earnings surprise in the most recent quarter 

This wasn t the reason the stock fell some 21  the session following the release  so read on for why it did fall  Description

Korn Ferry offers leadership and talent consulting services  It operates in around 37 countries and is based in Los Angeles 

Earnings History

Usually when a stock is the Bear of the Day  the earnings history is filled with misses  This is not the case for KFY  as there is one miss over the last five quarters that have been reported 

Estimates

Here is the real reason the stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and the Bear of the Day  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen over the last month  The FY16 estimate stood at  2 56 in May but fell to  2 42 in June 

Next year has also saw a big move lower in estimates with the 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from  2 92 in May to  2 75 in June

	Hopes that the prolonged rout in oil prices will lead to a production freeze helped oil prices to gain on Monday  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that his country is in consultation with Saudi Arabia and other oil producing nations to achieve stability in the oil market  His comments came in after Saudi Arabia s Energy Minister Kahlid al Falih showed willingness to talk with major crude oil producers to limit oil production  last week

4 Stocks to Buy on Yellen s Valuation Warning

In her testimony before a Senate panel  Fed Chair Janet Yellen issued a warning about stocks being overvalued  This was in keeping with the views expressed by the central bank in its policy report submitted to Congress before the Fed Chair s testimony 

This is not the first time that Yellen has weighed in on equities being overvalued  The Fed Chair had expressed similar concerns about biotech and social media stocks two years earlier  Given the state of the markets and economy  it may be a good idea to add value stocks to your portfolio at this time 

Fed  Yellen Sound Valuation Alarm

In her testimony before the Senate panel on Tuesday  Yellen said that valuations were a matter of concern because of investor pessimism about corporate earnings  In other words  stock prices are on a slippery slope because of the dismal expectations about corporate earnings 

The Fed Chair s comments echoed similar fears expressed in the central bank s monetary policy report  In the report the Fed said forward price to earnings were at significantly higher levels compared to their medians over the last 30 years  Market watchers believe that the central bank has clearly stated that valuations of financial assets had increased because of the low interest rate environment 

Were Similar Concerns Justified in the Past 

Concerns about stocks being overvalued were nearly identical to those expressed two years earlier  though they centered on specific sectors  The Fed s monetary policy report issued in Jul 2014 had sparked concerns about  substantially stretched valuations  in Internet and biotech stocks 

At that time  Fed Chair Yellen had stressed that the Federal Reserve doesn t have a target for equity values  instead the central bank tries to figure out if valuations are outside historical norms  But what actually happened in the space of these two years 

During the period between Jul 15  2014 and Jun 22  2016  the Global X Social Media Index ETF gained 8 9  while the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF increased 2 5   During the same period  the S P 500 index advanced 5 6   This means that the Fed Chair was correct about biotech stocks  since they underperformed the broader market 

However  a broader market decline did not follow and social media stocks actually gained over time  But this doesn t mean Yellen got it wrong  For instance  20 years ago  the redoubtable Alan Greenspan had wondered if the market was suffering from  irrational exuberance  

After three years  the Nasdaq lost nearly 78  of its value  Given the multiple concerns the economy is combating now  a slide could come much sooner  It is worth remembering that Yellen has expressed concerns about weak business investment and below target inflation levels 

Our Choices

According to Thomson Reuters DataStream  the forward price to earnings ratio is currently at 16 47  In comparison  the median value for the last three decades is 14 86  If one takes the Fed s and Yellen s comments into consideration  picking stocks with lower forward price to earnings would make a lot of sense 

At the same time  it may be a good idea to consider options with good PEG ratios  Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and Zacks Rank 

We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new  

Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space 

Owens Illinois  Inc       with its subsidiaries is presently the largest manufacturer of glass containers in the world 

Owens Illinois holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a Value Style Score of  A   The forward price to earnings ratio  P E  for the current financial year  F1  is 8 38 and a PEG ratio of 0 78 

Discovery Communications  Inc       offers original and purchased programming in the U S  and more than 200 other countries with over 100 television networks 

Discovery Communications holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a Value Style Score of  A   It has a P E  F1  of 12 21 and a PEG ratio of 0 81 

Qorvo  Inc       is a leading provider of core technologies and radio frequency  RF  solutions for mobile  infrastructure and aerospace defense applications 

Qorvo holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a Value Style Score of  B   It has a P E  F1  of 13 76 and a PEG ratio of 0 92 

Express Scripts Holding Company      is the largest pharmacy benefit manager  PBM  in North America 

Express Scripts Holding holds a Zacks Rank  2 and has a Value Style Score of  A   It has a P E  F1  of 11 76  It has a PEG ratio of 1 01  lower than the industry average of 1 14

148290,369806,OI,USD Net Short Position Climbs To 109K,opinion,CFTC Commitments of Traders  COT  Report  11 December 2012  The net spec short position in the USD grew last week from 68K contracts to 109K contracts  While the aggregate net position is USD short  the specs do have a very big position short the yen and long the USD  The position in the yen is short over 104K contracts    Specs remain short the euro versus a long USD but this position has been reduced to only 36K  Four weeks ago the specs were short 114K   Currencies from commodity producing countries remain exceptionally popular  Speculators believe the increased money supply from various monetary stimulus plans will inflate commodity prices  Since commodities are produced in Australia  Canada and New Zealand  those currencies are in demand  The total of long positions held by specs in these three commodities now tallies 133 3K contracts  Some of this is probably inflated as specs may be buying replacement contracts to replace the December contracts that are about to expire US Dollar Index  The open interest  OI  went up about 10  as the large specs added to both long and short positions  The total spec long was reduced by a little less than 700 contracts Euro  EUR USD   The reduction in the euro OI was the result of option expiration with spreading down 12 545 contracts  more than the total OI decline of 8622 contracts  Speculators again reduced their short euro positions and are now down to 36K contracts from 51 6 in the prior week  There was probably more short covering toward the end of last week  after the cut off date for this report  Small specs are close to flipping to the long side of the market British Pound Sterling  GBP USD   Specs continue to trade the long side of the pound  The small spec is a 2 ratio long and the large spec is long  but a smaller ratio  The market  today climbing above the 1 62 handle  has worked in the specs favor Japanese Yen  JPY USD   The OI in the yen continued to surge  up 37 3K contracts  taking the total to 288 8K contracts  The increase was caused by commercials adding to both long and short positions  The yen has been very weak anticipating the political change from this past week ends election  The total spec short position remained about the same  a very large 140 1K Swiss Franc  CHF USD   Specs continue to be long the SF with a total net long of over 10 4K  Small specs carry a bigger net position in the swissie than the large specs  Perhaps that is because the Swiss National Bank continues to peg the SF to the price of the euro  and the large hedge funds do not wish to fade the SNB Canadian Dollar  CAD USD   Both the large and the small specs made modest additions to their long positions  The large spec is now a 6 3 ratio long and the small spec is a 2 2 long  The total spec long position in the CAD is up to 86 1K contracts New Zealand Dollar  NZD USD   The OI continues to spike up but some of this might be buying in anticipation of replacing longs once the December contract expires  Large specs are a 6 ratio long and the small specs are about a 3 to 1 long  Markets have rewarded the longs as commodity currencies remain in vogue Australian Dollar  AUD USD   Specs continue to accumulate a long position in the AUD  Large specs now have over a 104K contract long position  They are a 4 ratio long  Small specs are likewise long but only modestly  The total long AUD position is up to 188 5K contracts  With expiration of the December contract this week  it will be interesting to see how much will be liquidated ,2012-12-18,Cash Back Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usd-net-short-position-climbs-to-109k-148055,148055
148291,369807,OI,Speculators Go For Aggressive USD Buying ,opinion,Last week we reported the total position of speculators flipped to the long side of the USD for the first time since the Novermber 27  2012 report  The USD long from last week  30 552 contracts  grew sharply to 178 781 of various USD long positions  This is the largest long USD position specs have held since the July 24 report in 2012   The big shift was in the commodity currencies  Going back to our COT report of Feb 5  2013 we observed    For the past several months it has been very popular to be long commodity currencies and short the USD  Combined long positions of the Australian Canadian  and New Zealand Dollars exceeded 230K contracts in three separate periods  This position has been reduced to only 158K contracts  though almost all of the reduction has come in the Canadian Dollar  Judging from market action since the close of the report there is more C   and probably A  liquidation   Indeed  there has been liquidation in these currencies  The most recent report shows the speculative long in the commodity currencies is down to only 14 831 contracts    For the first time in months  the sentiment in the heavily traded euro has shifted and they are now short the single currency  It was early January 2013  the last time specs were short the euro   The big short in the Japanese yen remain for the most part  Recently  it looks like some of the currency warriors have been attacking the British pound  There the net short sutures position has increased to 57 6K contracts  US Dollar Index  The open interest  OI  surged upward by almost 20K as specs aggressively bought the DI  The net spec long position increased from 15 2K to 27K  Most of the trade in the DI is done by large specs  but the small specs do have a 4 ratio long Euro  EUR USD   The combined OI for futures and delta adjusted opens increased to 301K  while the OI for futures alone is only 230 6K contracts  This illustrates the immense trade in the euro options  Large specs increased their short position by 20 3K contracts and decreased their longs by 5K contracts  and in the process flipped to the short side of the euro  Small specs remain long the euro  Judging by market action since the report s end  there has probably been more euro selling British Pound Sterling  GBP USD   The open interest in the pound continued to build as specs sold the pound  The total net short spec position was up to 57 5K from last period s 40 8K  Specs of both sizes are better than a 2 ratio short Japanese Yen  JPY USD   The big spec short in the yen remains but the OI was reduced a small amount as was the big short position  There is a large option trade in the yen  The combined futures and delta adjusted option OI is 281  K  Exclude options  and the OI is only 216 3K  Small specs are about a 3 ratio short and the large specs a 2 3 to 1 short  We wonder if the holders of some of these shorts are not tiring because there is little progress in the bear market Swiss Franc  CHF USD   The total net spec position moved to the short side of the SF despite neither the big or little guys flipped positions  The position change happened last week when the large spec became a nominal short  He then aggressively sold the SF in the last period and became a 2 ratio short  The small spec clings to a small SF long Canadian Dollar  CAD USD   The OI increased 48 8K contracts  an exceptionally large change for one week  Both the large and small specs flipped from a long to a short C  position  The total shift in the specs position was 47 9K in one week  With the big selling in the C   it is surprising that the C  only weakened to the 1 03 handle New Zealand Dollar  NZD USD   Unlike most of the other currencies  there was liquidation in the NZ   However  the large spec remains a 7 ratio long  perhaps unaware the commodity bubble has been pierced Australian Dollar  AUD USD   There was big liquidation of short positions in the A   The total long position in the A  dropped from 46 2K to 17 8K with the small spec flipping to a short position in the Aussie  The large specs remained long 17 8 contracts but market action since the cut off date acts like he has been a late seller ,2013-03-05,Cash Back Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/speculators-go-for-aggressive-usd-buying-157787,157787
148292,369808,OI,How To Sell Cash Secured Puts,opinion,There s a low profile  conservative trading technique that we often utilize to  get paid to wait   for stocks that we want to take a position in Have you ever wanted to buy a stock  but its current price seems too high  or the market may have gotten ahead of itself  Instead of just buying this stock  consider selling put options for it As it turns out  the put option premiums that you can receive can often be higher than a stock s next few dividends  even on high dividend stocks Here are some important principles and definitions to remember when selling options 1  One option contract   100 shares of the underlying stock 2  The further out in time that you sell an option  the more money   higher premium   you ll get paid  Why  Because options have time value  i e   time is money  3  Put option sellers don t receive dividends  We list dividends in our Cash Secured Puts Table so you can compare them to the put premiums 4  Strike Price  The price you re agreeing to buy the stock for  up until the expiration date  in return for being paid a Put Premium now 5  Bid  The price that Put or Call buyers are willing to pay 6  Ask  The price that Put or Call sellers are willing to sell at 7  Many brokerage sites also list the Bid and Ask quantities  which is helpful   if there are many more bidders than sellers  you may have a chance of selling your put or call options at a higher price premium than the current bid 8  Volume Open Interest  Volume is the amount of contracts which have changed hands today  Open Interest is the amount of contracts which haven t yet expired for each call or put option  Thinly traded options have lower Open Interest 9  Cash Reserve  This equals the amount of money that your broker will hold in your account  to ensure that you have enough funds to buy the underlying shares  This amount varies from approx  25  up to 100   depending on the type of account  IRAs will need a 100  cash reserve  whereas taxable accounts approved for Option Level 3 may have only 25 35  held as cash reserve per put selling trade TRADING EXAMPLE  To illustrate how to sell cash secured puts  let s look at MDC Holdings  MDC   which has high options yields  and was trading at  38 91 at the time of this writing 1  Go to the option chain for MDC  and select find  Puts    Many brokers  sites let you select puts OR calls  which makes the data less confusing  For each option you ll see the Strike Price  the Last or most recent price  the Bid prices and quantities  the Ask prices and quantities  today s Volume  and the current Open Interest  OI  2  Look up the values for the closest months   there s usually a pulldown menu   to see if there are any good yields on Put strike prices below MDC s current price  Even though there are June and July expirations  we chose the September expiration  further out in time  since it gives you a bigger put premium   payout   which  in turn  lowers your breakeven 3  Compare the Bids for the Strike Prices that are below the stock s price  If you want to be more conservative  choose a lower strike price  for a lower breakeven  If you want to be more aggressive  choose a high strike price  which will pay you more  but give you a higher breakeven 4  Compare the breakevens to the stock s 52 week low and high  to give you an idea of its range  You can find this data on the far right side of our Cash Secured Puts Table 5  We chose the September  38 00 put in our example  It pays  2 70  which gives you a  35 30 breakeven  Since the Bid Quantity  BidQ  is 204  and Ask Quantity  AskQ  is only 21  there s a good chance that you may be able to sell the  28 00 put for more than  2 70 6  Compare the upcoming dividends between now and the expiration date  Is the put bid price higher than these dividends  In some cases  it s much higher  In our example  the Put Bid Premium is nearly 10 times MDC s next dividend payout 7  Look at the Put Options Yield  Our table lists all put yields as annualized because there are many different expiration dates  In this example  the Sept   38 00 put option pays  2 70  which is a 7 1  nominal yield  for a 116 day term  which equals 22 95  annualized 8  Cash Reserve  For each contract that you sell  your broker will reserve hold in your account the   needed to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock  In our example  we sold one  38 00 put  which equals  3 800 00 Cash Reserve  100 x  38 00 MDC share price  9  Placing the Trade  Click the  Trade  link for the put option you want to sell  This should take you to a Trading module  1  Choose  Sell to Open  in the Action pulldown menu  2  Choose  Limit  in the Order Type menu  3  Enter your desired Selling Price in the Limit Price field  4  Select  Day  in the TIF pulldown menuWhen you ve made all of these entries  click the  Verify Order  button  This will bring up a summary of your order which will list the Expiration Date  the Put Strike Price  and your selling price Yikes  What have I gotten myself into   In our example  we sold one September 2013  38 00 put for MDC  which obligates us to buy 100 shares of MDC at  38 00  up until this put option s Sept  21  2013 expiration date  BUT  our real cost is only  35 30  because we got paid  2 70 share    270 00 contract sold   for selling the put option After selling 1 put  you ll receive  270 00 into your account  upon settlement in 3 days or less  for the contract you sold   1 put corresponds to 100 shares of stock  100 x  2 70 put premium    270 00  You d have 1 of 2 outcomes at or near the expiration in September  usually options aren t exercised or assigned until right around their expiration date  1  Assignment  If MDC declines below  38 00  you d be assigned  sold  100 shares of MDC for every put contract you sold 2  Non Assignment  If MDC doesn t decline to approximately  38 00 or less  your cash reserve money gets released  and you ve made  270 00 for every contract you sold  less commissions In scenario 1  you d end up owning MDC at a cost basis of  35 30  which is 10 23  lower than its current  38 91 price  There are two ways to view this outcome  Some traders would say that if you d just waited and done nothing  you would have been able to buy it for  35 30 or even less  anyway  if the market went down However  you wouldn t have had the profit opportunity that selling the put gave you  had you just waited for a market downturn  In addition  you received the put cash immediately  which you can put to use now  AND you ve determined your potential buy price at  35 30 Timing  Since selling puts is a conservative bullish strategy  it s best to sell them after prices have fallen  since put prices move inversely to the market  Look for a  down  day or week when the stock is falling in price   this downward action will inflate the put premiums you can sell for  and lower your breakeven Disclosure  Author was short MDC put options

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week sees equities broadly looking better higher  but signs of rotation are showing up  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue the short term channel higher in the downtrend while Crude Oil may be finding a bottom at last  The US Dollar Index continues to be strong as US Treasuries are biased lower in the uptrend  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue its uptrend  but perhaps with a short term pause while Emerging Markets are consolidating in a bear flag and biased to the downside  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   The SPY looks good on the longer timeframe with the IWM starting to move out or a tight range higher  The QQQ looks a bit tired in the short run and money may be rotating out of it to the IWM now  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
