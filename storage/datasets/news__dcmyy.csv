6489,228004,DCMYY,Japan Softbank annual profit jumps on smartphone sales,news,"TOKYO  May 9  Reuters    Softbank Corp   Japan s
No 3 mobile phone operator  said on Monday its operating profit
jumped 35 1 percent for the year that ended in March  boosted by
higher sales of smartphones  but it did not offer a forecast for
the current financial year 	
 Softbank  which operates the exclusive network in Japan for
Apple Inc s iPad and iPhone  booked an operating profit
of 629 2 billion yen   7 8 billion  in its last business year 	
 That compares with an average estimate of 612 8 billion yen
in a poll of six analysts taken after the March 11 earthquake by
Thomson Reuters I B E S 	
 For the current financial year through March 2012  Softbank 
which competes with Japanese wireless operators NTT DoCoMo Inc
 and KDDI Corp   did not give an operating
profit forecast  The average estimate from analysts is for a
676 7 billion yen profit 	
 Many companies in Japan have decided not to give profit
forecasts in the wake of the March disaster 	
 As of the close of trade on Friday  shares of Softbank had
lost a little more than 1 percent since March 11  outperforming
a nearly 4 percent fall in the benchmark Nikkei average

6490,228005,DCMYY,Nikkei slips to 1 week low  stronger yen hurts exporters,news,"  Nikkei down 1 pct  closes at lowest since April 19
   Volume sinks to second lowest this year
   Exporters hit by yen s rise  Sony down 2 pct

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  April 26  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average closed at
a one week low on Tuesday  losing 1 2 percent as exporters were
hit by a stronger yen in thin trade ahead of corporate earnings
announcements 	
 Falls in exporter shares undermined the overall market after
the dollar hit a four week low against the yen   reducing
the value of their overseas earnings 	
 Electronics giants fell  with Sony Corp losing 2 1
percent to 2 415 yen and Toshiba Corp down 2 8 percent
at 416 yen  	
 Among carmakers  Toyota Motor Corp fell 2 4 percent
and Honda Motor Co lost 1 6 percent 	
  Perhaps the dollar s recent weakness against the yen is the
key factor  making Japanese stocks less attractive  On top of
that the impact of the earthquake is putting additional pressure
on prices   said Nagayasu Yamagishi  a strategist at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities 	
  Volume is extremely thin ahead of Japanese and U S 
monetary policy meetings  The market simply can t move much as
there are many factors    we have to confirm the outcome of the
FOMC and earnings   Yamagishi said 	
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold the first
ever post meeting news conference by a Fed chief on Wednesday 
and market participants will be monitoring his comments for
hints on future policy tightening 	
 The Nikkei finished the day down 113 27 points at
9 558 69  its lowest close since April 19 	
 The broader Topix fell 0 8 percent to 833 64 	
 Market turnover struggled to pick up  with only 1 54 billion
shares changing hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s first
section  the second lowest amount this year following Monday s
1 46 billion shares 	
 Analysts said support for the Nikkei is now pegged at the
psychologically key 9 500 line after it fell below previous
support at its 25 day moving average of 9 608 	
 
 AUTO SHARES DOWN  RETAIL INVESTORS BUY SMALL CAPS	
 Auto shares were also undermined after the Nikkei business
daily said last month s huge production cuts will translate into
roughly 1 trillion yen   12 21 billion  in lost revenues for
Toyota and other Japanese automakers  citing its own estimates 	
  Carmakers are being hit by the double whammy of the article
and a stronger yen  But such drops may be priced into the market
soon as investors will likely focus on their earnings   said
Kenichi Hirano  a strategist at Tachibana Securities 	
 DeNA Co jumped 5 6 percent to 2 988 yen after it
said on Monday it would tie up with NTT DoCoMo Inc to
provide a direct link to its popular social gaming platform
 Mobage  through DoCoMo cellphones and smartphones  DoCoMo 
Japan s largest mobile phone operator  rose 0 7 percent to
144 600 yen 	
  Individual investors have been stepping in to buy small cap
shares  but such flows are only for investments in the short
term  But otherwise  big investors and foreigners are largely on
the sidelines   said a senior trader at a foreign brokerage 	
 The trader said retail investors were detected pouring money
into DeNA and another mobile social gaming company  Gree Inc
   which closed up 3 1 percent at 1 555 	
 After the bell  Canon Inc reported a 5 percent fall
in quarterly operating profit and cut its annual outlook to
below market expectations as it copes with the effects of
Japan s earthquake  which has hit suppliers and hobbled
production 	
 Separately after the close  Daiwa Securities Group  
Japan s No 2 brokerage  posted a surprisingly large quarterly
loss  its fourth in five quarters  hurt by valuation losses on
its investments 	
 Daiwa  which is expanding investment banking services in
Asia in a bid to make up for shrinking profits in its retail
investment business at home  posted a 33 1 billion yen net loss
for January March  compared with a loss of 2 8 billion a year
earlier

6512,228027,DCMYY,FUND VIEW GLG upbeat on Japanese equities  buys telcos,news,"  Favours laggard telecoms and railway companies
   Cautious on outlook for Japanese consumers
   Sees new DPJ government acting within expectations
 
 By Harpreet Bhal
 LONDON  Sept 16  Reuters    UK based financial services
group GLG is bullish on the long term outlook for Japanese
equities due to their attractive valuations  and is buying
telecoms and transport stocks which have been shunned by other
investors 
 Neil Edwards  co manager of the GLG Japan Core Alpha Fund
said Japan has an attractive price to book  PBR  ratio of 1 2
times  making stocks in the country attractive on valuations 
while dividend yields are at levels last seen in the 1970s  
 The long only fund aims to pick up bargain stocks which have
been lagging the market rally such as telecommunications and
railway firms  while selling positions in outperforming sectors
like technology  Edwards told Reuters in an interview 
 The fund added defensive mobile phone firm KDDI Corp to its
mix  and increased holdings in peer NTT DoCoMo  while it bought
underperforming railway firms East Japan Railways  Central Japan
Railways and West Japan Railways 
  What we re trying to do constantly is exploit the
propensity for mean reversion   Edwards said  referring to the
theory that prices eventually move towards historical averages 
  The more a stock has underperformed and the cheaper its
relative price to book ratio is  the more we ll have in it    
because they re laggards and there is value in them  
 The 585 million pound fund has returned 19 7 percent in the
year to date against a 2 percent fall in the benchmark Topix
index in the same period  while it returned 16 8 percent in the
second quarter against a 7 percent rise in the benchmark 
 The fund also invests in retailers Seven   I Holdings  which
it sees as cheap  and AEON  but Edwards remains cautious on the
outlook for consumer spending in Japan 
 The incoming Democratic Party of Japan has pledged to
stimulate consumption by putting money in the hands of
households but private consumption is likely to remain weak 
  The Japanese consumer is according to the surveys  in a
somewhat fragile state  I think Japanese corporations are also
going to be very cautious before they start reinvesting   he
said 
 
 STRAITJACKET 
 Edwards said he was cautious about the implications of the
new government s assent to power in Japan but was not unduly
worried as he said the government would be limited in the extent
to which it could advocate drastic changes  
 The Democratic Party faces a raft of challenges including
growing social welfare costs in a rapidly ageing society and
tattered public finances since coming to power in late August  
  I think they re so constrained by the straitjacket that any
government in Japan wears   he said  
  They have got a borrowing situation which is worse than any
other developed country and I don t think markets would let them
behave irresponsibly   he said 
 On the outlook for the economy  Edwards said he sees strong
demand for Japanese exports  especially from neighbouring China 
which he said would help support the yen 
  China desperately wants to get its hands on as much high
technology as it can and buying Japanese products is one way in
which it can look to gain access to technology   he said

 TOKYO  Oct 5  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average hit a 10 week
low on Monday  dented by shares of exporters on concerns over the
fragility of the U S  economic recovery and lingering worries
about the yen s recent strength 
 But a surge in shares of Fast Retailing  which saw domestic
same store sales at its Uniqlo casual clothing chain jump 32
percent in September  provided support to the benchmark index 
which earlier moved in and out of negative territory 
  With eyes increasingly on corporate earnings reports for the
first half of Japan s business year  investors are betting the
stronger yen will no doubt drag on exporters  outlooks   said

after falling as far as 9 671 39  its lowest since July 22 
 The broader Topix slipped 0 9 percent to 866 41 
 Weaker than expected U S  jobs data weighed on investor
confidence  although analysts said the numbers had not
drastically altered expectations that the U S  economy would
recover gradually 
  While the data was bad and optimism about the U S  economy
may have receded  I do not think market players think that this
means that the outlook for the U S  economy is ruined   said
Hideyuki Ishiguro  supervisor at Okasan Securities  investment
strategy department 
  I think it just means market sentiment has returned to
neutral for the time being   Ishiguro added 
 The Nikkei fell 5 2 percent last week  its worst weekly loss
in about three months  It has fallen below trendline support
drawn from its March trough near 7 021 and through its July low
near 9 050  and on Friday the benchmark index dropped below the
bottom of the cloud on daily Ichimoku charts 
 Some analysts say the next downside target may be 9 500  with
a break below that opening the way for a drop towards its July
low of 9 050 
 EXPORTERS DOWN  BANKS  FAST RETAILING UP
 Banking shares rose after having recently been battered by
worries that lenders may come out with share offerings in the
face of a global regulatory push for banks to carry bigger
capital buffers 
 Top bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group climbed 1 8 percent
to 453 yen and Mizuho Financial Group added 2 3 percent to 178
yen  The banking sector subindex rose 0 5 percent 
 Nomura Holdings shot up 5 6 percent to 564 yen  Shares of
Japan s largest brokerage plunged after it last month unveiled a
 5 6 billion share sale plan aimed partly at meeting tougher
capital requirements 
  Short covering after a sell off is buoying financial
shares   said Mitsuo Shimizu  deputy general manager at Cosmo
Securities 
  Investors are also betting Nomura s share sales price will
be decided soon  possibly today  Usually  selling on worries
about the erosion of demand and supply tends to run its course
once such prices are set  
 Fast Retailing soared 16 4 percent 13 710 yen  The big jump
in sales was helped by the onset of cold weather which boosted
demand for autumn goods and by a five day weekend in September 
 Following the strong monthly sales  Morgan Stanley raised its
rating to  overweight  from  equal weight   and UBS lifted the
firm to  buy  from  neutral  
 Exporters retreated on lingering concern that the yen s
recent strength will curb their overseas profits  The yen stood
around 89 80 yen to the dollar  It hit an eight month high of
88 23 yen to the greenback last week 
 Sony Corp slid 2 2 percent to 2 395 yen and Nikon dropped 6 4
percent to 1 451 yen  while Honda Motor shed 2 3 percent to 2 610
yen and Toyota Motor Corp fell 0 9 percent to 3 350 yen 
 The head of Toyota on Friday called the current dollar yen
rate  very tough   and Honda Chief Executive Takanobu Ito said on
Thursday said that a dollar below 90 yen was  too painful  
 Defensive sectors were higher  with some analysts saying
worries about the impact of the strong yen on exporters  earnings
may be prompting investors to buy shares of companies that are
less sensitive to currency moves or that may benefit from a
stronger domestic currency

 in Algiers next week  Saudi Arabia reportedly offered to lower its oil production if Iran agrees to cap output this year at its current level of 3 6 million barrels per day  Saudi output usually drops in winter and spikes during hot summer months

Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said this morning that he believed interest rates should be raised gradually now and warned that if the unemployment rate falls from here  it could stoke inflation  which could lead to a recession  Rosengren was one of 3 Fed policymakers voting for a rate hike this week 
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  responding to questions from the public on Twitter  said he believed the labor market continues to have slack and that he wanted to see the unemployment rate  now at 4 9 percent  to come down  The bigger worry for him  he said  was that the Fed will raise rates too soon rather than too late  The view that the labor market is not close to overheating is also central to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan s view that the Fed should be patient and cautious in raising rates

Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  CEO John Stumpf has resigned from the Federal Reserve Advisory Council  a banking industry group which meets with the Fed s board of governors four times a year to discuss economic issues  Meanwhile  eight senators have asked the Labor Department to launch a probe into whether Wells may have violated wage laws by failing to pay overtime to employees who stayed late to meet sales quotas 
We have talked extensively about the Wells Fargo scandal  but here is one more insult   salt on the wound  You paid for it  If you have paid federal taxes over the past couple of years  you essentially subsidized the multi million dollar payouts given to Wells Fargo executives who oversaw a massive consumer fraud 
Carrie Tolstedt  an executive who oversaw Wells Fargo s Community Banking group   where much of the fraud occurred   pocketed millions in  performance pay   including stock and equity  between 2012 2015  Under a 1993 law  corporations can deduct no more than  1 million of executive compensation from their taxes  But that law made an exception for pay linked to performance  Consequently  because Wells Fargo structured Tolstedt s payout as a bonus   rather than wages   the bank could deduct the  78 million from its taxes  effectively giving itself a  27 million tax boost 
Banks continue to use these subsidies even as government regulators charged them with breaking rules  Between 2012 2015  Wells Fargo cashed in on  54 million in tax subsidies for CEO John Stumpf s compensation  Over that same period  regulators extracted  10 4 billion in misconduct penalties from the bank

6542,228057,DCMYY,Verizon  VZ  Ties Up With Qualcomm  IoT Prospects Bright,opinion,"U S  telecom behemoth  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is forging ahead with its new growth and innovation plans in the Internet of Things  IoT  space  The company recently entered into a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies  Inc   a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM    the largest manufacturer of wireless chipsets  This partnership will see Verizon s IoT platform  ThingSpace  being integrated into Qualcomm Technologies  MDM9206 Category M LTE modem The IoT collaboration news was released at CTIA Super Mobility 2016 in Las Vegas  Reports state that the ThingSpace IoT platform will be available for original equipment manufacturer  OEM  integration on MDM9206 based solutions around the beginning of 2017 
Verizon ThingSpace and Qualcomm CAT MInternet of Things  IoT  is basically the networking of physical devices  vehicles  buildings and other items that are embedded with electronics  software  sensors and network connectivity  which enables these objects to collect and exchange data  ThingSpace is Verizon s global IoT platform which enables developers to build and manage applications throughout the globe Qualcomm s Category M1 or CAT M is a network generated by the companies to allow devices stay connected with each other  It also offers long battery life and better coverage for long communication range 
Objective of the DealThe joint initiative intends to deploy Qualcomm s CAT M on Verizon s 4G LTE network for serving various IoT services including asset tracking  security and industrial control  The main purpose behind the merger is to simplify IoT applications  to deliver next generation IoT products and services along with less power and lower bandwidth  reduce IoT cost of connecting devices to the LTE wide area network and to help developers and businesses operate easily with their connected devices on 4G LTE network  Earlier  connecting IoT devices to the LTE network was much more expensive than connection to other technologies such as Wi Fi  Bluetooth  Zwave or ZigBee  The tie up is also expected to help companies deal with the two major issues of IoT   firmware management and diagnostics handling  Verizon also claims that it will soon launch more IoT solutions for electric  water and gas companies and cooperatives using Qualcomm chips  Additionally  other applications such as device security and sensor data visualization are expected to emerge as a result of this merger 
Bottom LineThis partnership is expected to benefit both the companies  On one hand  Verizon will provide tough competition to other major U S  wireless carriers such as AT T Inc    NYSE T   and startups such as SigFox that deliver wireless connections for smart devices at subsidized prices in the IoT space  On the other hand  signing a deal with one of the leading telecom players in the U S  is a prudent move for Qualcomm VERIZON COMM Price

6544,228059,DCMYY,FEATURE Cell phone shopping makes wallets redundant in Japan,news,"By Sachi Izumi
 TOKYO  Nov 11  Reuters    Japanese office worker Satoshi
Tada pays for shopping  wins free food and gets store discounts
all by waving his cellphone 
  I use it pretty much every day   the 25 year old said 
 You can charge money on it right there if needed  and you
don t have to run around trying to find an ATM  You can even
get points because it s linked to credit cards  
 The world s top firms such as Visa Inc and Nokia are still
mostly testing phone use for payments  but in Japan  more than
50 million  or about half of all cellphone users  already carry
phones capable of serving as wallets 
 Japan has pioneered not just the technology but also the
business models that will pave the way for wallet phones to
become a standard payment method in the future  Some 700
million people worldwide are expected to own such phones by
2013 
  You can t deny that having such applications on a phone is
convenient  and that will likely be the way that mobile phones
are going worldwide   said JPMorgan Securities analyst Hironobu
Sawake in Tokyo 
  People always carry cellphones on them  and they would
find it useful to have a financial function there  
 Success in Japan and in trials abroad have shown that the
technology is ready for cell phones to replace credit cards 
cash as well as serve as transportation and movie tickets and
electronic keys for homes and offices 
 But there are other hurdles  from breaking the
psychological barrier for consumers sceptical about using
phones as credit cards  to working out new business models as
the lines blur between banks  financial institutions and cell
phone companies 
 Japan is leading the way in this regard 
 KDDI  for example  is a Japanese telecom operator that has
recently set up a bank along with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group  NTT DoCoMo  Japan s biggest wireless carrier  offers
credit cards and lending services as part of a tie up with
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group  Japan s third largest bank 
 Outside Japan  telecom industry and financial players are
still in the midst of working out how the wallet phone payment
business would operate  who would get a cut and when 
  Traditional financial industry met telcos by going mobile 
Now telecom operators want to play a part in that chain  These
talks are well under way   said Gerhard Romen  Director for
Strategic Alliances   Partnering at Nokia 
 The world s biggest payment card company  Mastercard  said
last month it was in talks over commercial launches of phone
wallets with several banks  and during the next two years it
expects to see substantial activity from retail focused banks 
 Now banks say  I have no doubt in the technology  We need
to solve the business model between mobile and payments
industries  It s not a trivial task   said James Anderson  a
Vice President at Mastercard s mobile business 
  There is a very strong consumer pull for this service  
Anderson added 
 COUPONS
 Tada  the Tokyo office worker  rarely pulls out his leather
wallet these days as his cell phone does the job instead 
  For shopping  I use it everywhere I can     and I also use
coupons such as Gourmet Navigator Touch wherever possible  
Tada said  citing services at some restaurants that offer
coupons and free gifts when customers wave their phones at
reader terminals 
 NTT DoCoMo began the so called  wallet phone  service in
2004 and rivals KDDI Corp and Softbank Corp have followed suit 
Overseas  Nokia also has such phones on the market 
 Nevertheless  despite Japan s relative success with payment
phones  still only one third of wallet phone holders use their
cells for purchases 
 Consumers in their 20s and 30s are the main users of wallet
phone services  Research shows that once they start using  they
tend to use frequently and repeatedly  making it a useful tool
for companies to track their customers and shopping habits 
  For young people the phone is more important than the card
when they leave home   said Nokia s Romen 
 McDonald s Japan and 7 Eleven convenience stores have been
testing mobile discount coupons  and FeliCa Networks  a joint
venture of Sony and DoCoMo  have launched a mobile platform for
retailers to offer such services 
  With many cellphones around and most of them being wallet
phones  we cannot ignore them as marketing tools   McDonald s
Japan spokesman Kazuyuki Hagiwara said  McDonald s plans to
widen its mobile discount coupon offering nationwide next year 
 EXTRA CHIP
 The world s top cellphone maker Nokia has started selling
wallet phones  though growth is hampered by costs stemming from
an extra chip needed in phones for data security  As a result 
Nokia s near field communications  NFC  version of devices
costs far more than regular phones 
 Near field communications  NFC  enables contactless data
transmission at high speed and enables many functions at once
such as various electronic money services  keys and coupons 
In contrast to Nokia  Japanese makers install Sony Corp s
FeliCa chips in new mobile phones by default  and prices are
competitive with other cell phones 
 Globally  research firm Juniper Research says there will be
700 million NFC capable phones by 2013  from some 50 million in
Japan now  offering major growth for the phone payment industry
and the companies that provide the hardware and software 
 Credit card network Visa is developing an application to
allow in store contactless payments by cell phone for Google
Inc s Android operating system  and UK mobile operator O2 is
also testing wallet phones 
 Security concerns are high among potential users but DoCoMo
says a remote lock system will protect it from being used by
other people in case of emergencies 
 One of the remaining hurdles to attract more wallet phone
users is to expand the system network 
  It would be so useful if we can use it everywhere  For now
we don t know where we can use it and we have to carry both a
phone and a wallet   UBS Securities analyst Makio Inui said 
 If we can spend a day with just with a phone  that would be
big

6555,228070,DCMYY,UPDATE 1 DoCoMo  aims to boost overseas sales via more deals,news,"  Aims to up overseas ops to 10  of sales in 5 yrs from 2  now
   To seek more acquisitions after Tata Teleservices deal
   To focus on investments in Asia but open to other regions
  Adds comments  details  background 
 By Sachi Izumi and Noriyuki Hirata
 TOKYO  Dec 4  Reuters    NTT DoCoMo Inc aims to boost its
overseas business to account for 10 percent of sales within five
years from 2 percent now  as it continues to seek acquisitions
after an investment in an Indian operator  a senior executive
said on Thursday 
 DoCoMo  Japan s biggest mobile phone operator  last month
said it would pay  2 7 billion for a 26 percent stake in Tata
Teleservices  India s No  6 wireless carrier  making an entry
into the world s fastest growing major mobile market 
 Toshinari Kunieda  senior vice president and managing
director of DoCoMo s global business division  said the company
aims to expand its overseas business through more acquisitions
and increased cooperation with firms in which it has already
invested 
  Considering Japan s future economy with the ageing society
    we just have to go abroad   he told Reuters in an interview 
 DoCoMo spent nearly 1 9 trillion yen   20 4 billion  in the
late 1990s and early 2000s to invest in operators around the
world  to promote use of its i mode mobile Internet technology
and ensure the adoption of 3G network on the same W CDMA standard
it uses 
 But it saw its investments sour  and pulled out of AT T
Wireless Services Inc  Dutch operator KPN Mobile N V  and
Hutchison 3G UK Holdings after incurring heavy losses 
 DoCoMo is now back on an overseas acquisition spree as its
home market is expected to show little growth  Prior to its entry
into India  DoCoMo took a stake in Bangladesh s No  3 cellphone
carrier for  350 million 
 DoCoMo also has stakes in companies like South Korea s KTF
and Philippine Long Distance Telephone  PLDT  
 Kunieda said DoCoMo will prioritise beefing up its
Asia Pacific operations but will not exclude the United States
and Europe as possible destinations for future investments 
  It is easier in the United States and Europe to bring out
strategic synergies   he said 
  Especially in Europe  30 percent of subscribers already use
mobile Internet     and LTE is already coming into view   he
said   It is possible to develop applications  content and mobile
phones with a partner  
 Through capital ties  DoCoMo aims to reap monetary returns
such as profits and dividends as well as what the company calls
 strategic synergies   which include increased roaming revenues
and lower mobile phone costs through joint procurement 
 LTE  or Long Term Evolution  is next generation network
technology that DoCoMo supports

6579,228094,DCMYY,Vodafone And Liberty Global Offer Concession For Dutch JV,opinion,"The European Union Competition Commission  EC  recently confirmed that Vodafone Group  LON VOD  Plc    NASDAQ VOD   and Liberty Global Plc    NASDAQ LBTYA   have jointly offered some concessions to ensure regulatory clearance for their proposed joint venture  JV  in the Netherlands  Although the type of concessions offered is yet to be disclosed  the telecom operators generally divest infrastructure assets to their competitors to win regulatory approval  The EC is scheduled to take a decision on the deal by Aug  3  subject to feedback from competitors and other interested parties 
In Feb 2016  British telecom giant Vodafone and Liberty Global    the largest cable MSO  multi service operator  in Europe   decided to merge their Dutch operations to form a 50 50 JV  As per the agreement  Vodafone will pay  1 billion  approximately  1 12 billion  in cash to Liberty Global to bring the valuation of each of their local units on par  The two companies are expecting to achieve cost and revenue synergies of  3 5 billion  around  3 9 billion  after factoring in integration costs 
Notably  last year  the two companies had been negotiating a series of transactions including global asset swaps  However  the merger negotiations were abandoned after they failed to reach an agreement on valuations  At the moment  Vodafone and Liberty Global are combining their Dutch businesses  Both the companies have declined to comment whether there is a possibility of the deal being extended to other markets in the future 
Vodafone has a nationwide 4G LTE network in the Netherlands serving around 5 13 million mobile and about 73 000 fixed broadband subscribers  Liberty Global  through its Ziggo subsidiary  serves approximately 4 1 million pay TV subscribers in the country  Of the total  nearly 3 1 million customers also use Ziggo s broadband service while 2 5 million customers use its voice service 
It is worth mentioning here that Ziggo already has an MVNO  mobile virtual network operator  agreement with Vodafone Netherlands  At present  Ziggo serves around 181 000 mobile customers in the country using Vodafone s wireless network  In the event of the deal materializing  the combined Vodafone Liberty Global entity will pose a formidable challenge to key players like Royal KPN NV  OTC KKPNY  and T Mobile Netherlands of Deutsch Telekom in the country 
Last week  Reuters reported that the Dutch market regulator  Authority for Consumers and Markets  ACM  had approached the EC for permission to evaluate the Liberty Global   Vodafone JV  However  the EC hasn t taken any decision in this regard

6581,228096,DCMYY,U S   Germany And Japan  Post Brexit ETFs,opinion,"Before the Brexit vote and market turmoil  I was privileged to share interview time on the  The Larry Kudlow Show  with a longtime friend  Jeff Kleintop of Schwab  Larry  Jeff  and I have had many discussions about markets and economics over the years  In addition to discussing the pros and cons of Brexit  during this interview  I compared the valuations of three major markets  the United States  Japan  and Germany  For those who may have missed  The Larry Kudlow Show  on June 18  2016  here is a recap  I am also including some explanatory notes  If you would like to listen to our conversation  you can find it   our segment begins at the 58 minute mark   The United States  SPY  NYSE SPY 
The United States is the largest capital market and economy in the world  Its benchmark references the Standard   Poor s 500 Index  S P 500  and is represented by SPY  the first ETF  launched in 1993  It has been a remarkable success  With its low expense ratio  SPY captures the movement and activity of the S P 500 within a few basis points  bps   The index itself is managed by State Street Global Advisors and represents large capitalization stocks in the US  SPY has a market capitalization of about  180 billion  sees a very large trading volume every day  and usually trades within pennies of its net asset value 
Bloomberg data shows that SPY has had a trailing price to earnings  P E  ratio of 24 over the last year  SPY shows 18 as its forward P E estimate  Thus  the outlook for SPY is growth in earnings and an improving P E ratio  Whether that outlook comes to pass remains to be seen  Improvement from an average P E ratio of 24 to 18 is a positive indicator for the US economy and its profits 
Note that SPY is capitalization weighted  The 10 largest weights are Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   2 88    Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   2 21    Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   2 09    Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   1 76    General Electric  NYSE GE   1 56    Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   1 52    Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   1 48    Facebook  NASDAQ FB   1 45    AT T  NYSE T   1 39   and JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM   1 27    Those holdings drive a considerable portion of the index s performance  If we do not consider the Google stock split  to form GOOG and GOOGL   then Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  is actually the second largest holding  2 26   
U S  Valuation
For reference  we will note that pharmaceuticals constitutes about 7  and banks about 6 5  of the total index  The SPY yield is a little over 2  
Given SPY s 2  yield and outlook for a forward P E ratio of 18  valuing SPY is a difficult task in a climate where the 10 year Treasury yield is about 1 5   The earnings yield with a forward multiple of 18 is approximately 5 5  
Thus  the equity risk premium calculation would take the earnings yield  5 5   and then subtract the 10 year Treasury yield  The difference is an equity risk premium of about 400 bps  In a climate of very low interest rates  low growth  puzzling monetary policy  and questionable robustness within the American economy  a 4  equity risk premium would suggest fair valuation and certainly not a bargain  The Brexit outcome suggests lower interest rates for a longer period with the Fed on hold for a while 
We are going to skip the world s second largest economy  China  Its markets are not liquid  deep  or qualified enough to rank among the mature economies or index eligible global markets 
We are also going to skip the United Kingdom  Brexit issues have induced turmoil  so the calculation of valuation is set aside for the purpose of this writing 
We move forward with the other two major markets 
Japan  iShares MSCI Japan  NYSE EWJ 
Japan is the world s third largest economy and second largest mature equity market  It is represented by the iShares MSCI Japan ETF  EWJ  which captures the basic structure of the Japanese stock market  Within that structure  some sectors  such as pharmaceuticals and banks are quite comparable in size to those same sectors in the US  Pharmaceuticals are almost 7  in the Japanese market  as they are in the US  Banks are slightly over 7  in Japan  also similar to the United States  In other sectors  there are differences  For now  picking these two sectors provides a reference 
The largest holding in EWJ is Toyota Motor  5 09   followed by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  NYSE MTU   2 20    KDDI Corp   T 9433   1 95    SoftBank Group Corp   OTC SFTBY   1 92    Japan Tobacco Inc  T 2914   1 60    Honda Motor Company  NYSE HMC   1 54    Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  NYSE SMFG   1 48    Mizuho Financial Group  NYSE MFG   1 31    NTT DOCOMO  NYSE DCM  1 31    and Sony  NYSE SNE   T 6758   1 31   
Japan Valuation
Japan  EWJ  shows an average trailing P E ratio of 17  That ratio compares favorably with almost 24 for the United States  The Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  Finance estimate of forward P E is 14 for EWJ  Thus  the earnings yield for the Japanese ETF is estimated at 7  
The interest rate comparison for Japan is below zero  Post Brexit it is likely to stay below or at zero for many more years  The equity risk premium for Japan  using the riskless government bond interest rate  is higher than the earnings yield and above 700 bps  Truth be told  post Brexit  there are questions about growth rates in Japan  But worst cases from Brexit are not as devastating as market panic selling has suggested  Japan was cheap before Brexit  The yield is 1 5  and is lower than the 2  in the US 
The list of companies  Sony and Toyota among them  illustrates how cheap Japanese stocks are  compared to US stocks  Their relative value is one reason why Cumberland Advisors  international accounts continue to maintain an overweight position in the Japanese stock market  Japan s is perhaps the cheapest major market in the world  EWJ is for sale at bargain basement prices  It is historically rare for the equity risk premium to be higher than the earnings yield 
There are two possible reasons for this anomaly   1  the market is fully mispricing outcomes in Japan  or  2  the market is offering investors a bargain that does not come along often  In our view  the right take is the latter  and for that reason we are overweight Japan 
EWJ has a market cap of approximately 15 billion and trades within pennies of net asset value  This holding is easy to execute for the US foreign investor

The world s fourth largest economy and third major market is Germany  which is represented by the iShares MSCI Germany ETF   NYSE EWG   The largest weights in EWG are Bayer AG  DE BAYGN   7 97    Siemens AG  DE SIEGn   7 72    SAP SE  DE SAPG   7 29    BASF SE  DE BASFN   6 78    Allianz  DE ALVG   6 52    Daimler AG  DE DAIGn   5 88    Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   5 02    Fresenius SE  DE FREG   2 78    Muenchener Rueckver  OTC MURGY   2 75   and Deutsche Post AG  DE DPWGn   2 68    Here  just as in the other two ETF s  we see a virtual  Who s Who  of major global companies 
German Valuation
The yield in EWG is approximately 2 4  and is higher to that of SPY  The market cap is the smallest of these three at about  4 trillion  By the way  EWG trades in a liquid form and can be executed within a penny or two of net asset value  The trailing P E average of EWG is 21  and the forward P E estimate is 14  just as it is in Japan 
In Europe and in Germany  the 10 year reference for government debt is trading below zero  Brexit ensures it will be there for years  Hence  EWG has the same value characteristics as EWJ  We see this list of companies as cheap  The earnings yield for EWG is above 7   as it is for EWJ in Japan  That equity risk premium is higher than the earnings yield because of the negative interest rate on the riskless government bond that it is compared to  Pharmaceuticals are 9 2  in the German basket  and banks are approximately 2 8  
Our conclusion is that the United States  by metrics of valuation  relative valuation and comparison with riskless government debt  is fairly priced but no bargain  Japan and Germany  by comparison  are cheap  They offer bargains if investors are willing to test the waters  Companies like Toyota and Bayer or Siemens and Sumitomo are major players in the world  They rank as highly as many companies within the S P 500 Index do  They are strong  heavily capitalized  globally active enterprises  In one place  they are available for an earnings yield above 7

6584,228099,DCMYY,What Brexit Panic  5 Stocks Hit 52 Week Highs,opinion,"The general consensus of a prolonged period of market volatility post Brexit seems to have been exaggerated  as the markets have once again sprung into life  The Brexit vote on Jun 24 sent shock waves through the global financial markets  confirming the worst fears of market watchers and industry experts 
Several economists still believe that lower business expenditure as a result of the Brexit referendum could weigh on GDP growth in the near to mid term  Rising uncertainty could result in several companies pushing back or reducing their scale of new projects  However  the Fed is unlikely to raise rates as a result of such worries  A weak interest rate regime should outweigh the impact of a global turmoil 
Moreover  the  third  GDP estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 1 1   higher than the consensus estimate of a 1  increase  Further  first quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0 8  rise  Additionally  the U S  economy usually picks up pace over the second quarter  rebounding during spring and summer   read    
Investors  it seems  have downplayed Brexit related fears as reflected in the recent stock market rally  Several stocks soared to their 52 week highs on Wednesday defying all odds  So it makes sense to add these high flying stocks to your portfolio now  The 52 week effect is expected to do the magic  propelling the stocks higher

6588,228103,DCMYY,Bet On These 5 Low Leverage Stocks For Better Returns,opinion, When you combine ignorance and leverage  you get some pretty interesting results    Warren BuffettIn everyday business   leverage  is a familiar term that indicates the use of various financial instruments by corporations to multiply their profits  But from the perspective of an investor  this term holds the key to prudent investment  In fact  financial leverage specifically indicates the amount of capital a firm has borrowed to boost its operations  thereby indicating the level of risk it bears Of course  this does not mean that debt financing  which is an inherent instrument for corporations to grow their earnings  should be a taboo in corporate financing  However  too much debt can be unhealthy for a company because while it brings with it the chance of drawing higher profits in the future  it also bears the risk of paying higher interest and thereby dragging the company into a debt trap No doubt in the uncertain world of investment  markets can trip anytime affecting companies bearing a higher degree of financial leverage  This makes low leverage companies more attractive for investment purposes Naturally  to be on the safe side  investors will be eager to know how much leverage a company currently bears  Several leverage ratios have been constructed so far for this purpose  the most common one being debt to equity ratio Understanding Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityIn simple terms  debt to equity is a solvency ratio that measures the extent of financial leverage a company is bearing  A lower debt to equity ratio implies a more financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity In general  investors target companies exhibiting solid earnings growth projections  But if these stocks bear a high debt to equity ratio  in times of economic downturns their so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare Winning PicksConsidering the aforementioned discussion  it is imperative for an investor to choose stocks that bear a low debt to equity ratio  However  choosing stocks based solely on one financial metric might not be a wise investment strategy To ensure maximum possible return from this strategy  we have expanded our screening procedure to include some other criteria Here is

6605,228120,DCMYY,Positive Trade In Asia Driven By Oil Bounce And USD Weakness,opinion,"Where to invest in Asia if you had a time machine
A positive day of trade in Asia today driven by a bounce in oil prices and weakness in the US dollar  Volumes were very light in the Christmas period  particularly in the ASX and Hang Seng  while Japanese markets were closed 
The DXY dollar index looked to be finding some stability during the Asian session with currencies moves relatively muted  except for gains by the Taiwanese dollar and declines by the Malaysian ringgit 
New Zealand s November trade balance came in slightly better than expected at NZD  779 million  although its twelve month total blew out to its largest number since April 2009  Although the release had little effect on the kiwi dollar  which was holding steady just below the US 0 6820 level during the Asian session 
China left the CNY midpoint marginally stronger for the third day in a row giving further credence to the argument that we may have seen an end to CNY depreciation at least until the possibility of the next Fed rate hike approaches in April 
Japan
It has been a strong year for Japanese equities  returning 8 3  year to date  YTD   But when one dives into the index  it was clear that one really only wanted to have their money allocated to the Japanese healthcare sector  Despite the selloff in August  healthcare stocks in the Nikkei have still returned 40  year to date   a stellar performance by anyone s measure   and significantly outperforming its closest competitors the utilities and consumer discretionary sectors  The worst performer by far was the telecommunications sector  which lost 28  year to date   even underperforming the energy sector in a year that saw oil prices drop to 11 year lows  Japanese government pressure to break up the oligopoly of NTT Docomo  N DCM   KDDI  OTC KDDIF  and Softbank  OTC SFTBF   and lower phone and data fees have clearly weighed heavily on these stocks this year 

China
The Shanghai Composite caught the focus of the world this year as it gained 60  by its high in June  And even despite the dramatic selloff seen since June and through to August and September  the index has still managed to return 13  year to date  But it has very much been a story of allocation for success in the Mainland stock markets  Even after the dramatic June selloff  the transition in China s economy from the  old  industrial China to  new  services  and consumption focussed China is very evident in the returns  Elements of the  new  China economy saw the best returns this year by far  with consumer discretionary stocks gaining 92  YTD  IT stocks returning 80 3   and industrial stocks returning 68 4   While growing non performing loans from the  old  China saw financials ex real estate see the worst performance on the index  declining 5 5  YTD 

Hong Kong
The Hang Seng will be keen to see the back of 2015 as it lost 6  YTD  seeing its worst annual performance since 2011  The only place one would have wanted to put their money was the IT sector  and that was entirely attributable to Tencent s Hong Kong listing which returned 35  YTD  So basically  Tencent  OTC TCTZF  was almost the only stock one would have wanted hold on the Hang Seng this year  On the bottom end  the energy sector unsurprisingly had a dismal year losing 37  YTD  But consumer discretionary stocks also lost 40  YTD  a sector dominated by gambling stocks and subject to the vicissitudes of the ongoing corruption crackdown and new capital outflow restrictions  Macau being a great place to wash RMB through as one spirits it away to invest in a different currency  


ASX
The ASX is down 4 9  this year  on track for its worst annual performance since 2011  But those who were invested exclusively in the healthcare  industrials and consumer discretionary sectors managed to weather out the storm  Healthcare has returned 11  YTD  industrials 10  and consumer discretionary 9    a very respectable performances given the state of the rest of the index  In a year dominated by the commodities selloff  the ASX has been hit particularly hard  Unsurprisingly  the energy and materials sector were the worst performers  losing 36  and 24  YTD respectively  Corresponding to the selloff in materials and energy  there has been a dramatic reweighting of the index with the ASX more weighted to financials than ever before at 49  of market capitalisation  This means the fortunes of the index will be tied to the tribulations of the Big Four as they battle through a slowing housing market  growing bad and doubtful debts and new capital requirements  For those looking for a hedge to the performance of the banks in 2016  owning some stocks in the healthcare  industrials and consumer discretionary sectors may not be a bad idea

6606,228121,DCMYY,Guggenheim Defensive Equity Fund  Defensive ETF That Failed To Deliver,opinion,"The Guggenheim Invest Defensive Equity ETF  N DEF   at first glance  looks like the perfect ETF  positioned within the right sectors and with an investment strategy that seems logical to hedge against economic downturns 
However  the ETF did very poorly during the current market turmoil  plunging 6 4  in the past month 
What went wrong with this ETF which seems to tick all the right boxes  In order to understand what went wrong we have to dig a little deeper 
As equity markets are crashing all over the planet  more conservative players look to play defense by considering defensive investments and related exchange traded funds to hedge against the current correction  
Defensive Stocks and Sectors
During market downturns  high volatility and economic uncertainties  many investors use a risk aversion strategy by rotating to defensive sectors through buying defensive stocks and ETFs to shelter from the storm  Defensive Stocks and Sectors are those deemed non cyclical and not very dependent on the overall economic cycle  The traditional sectors considered defensive are utilities  consumer staples and healthcare  After all  consumers cannot easily manage without gas and electricity  soap and toothpaste and of course their medicine  Other sectors deemed defensive are the telecom sector and the US real estate REIT sectors 
Part of what makes defensive stocks and sectors appealing is their relatively higher and  safer  dividend which caters to investors wanting equity exposure but less risk 
DEF Fund Description

The Guggenheim Defensive Equity ETF  NYSEARCA DEF  seeks investment results that correspond to the performance  before the Fund s fees and expenses  of the Sabrient Defensive Equity Index  the  Defensive Equity Index    The Fund invests at least 90  of its total assets in US common stocks  American depositary receipts   ADRs   and master limited partnerships   MLPs    Guggenheim Funds Investment Advisors  LLC  the  Investment Adviser   seeks to replicate the performance of the Defensive Equity Index which is comprised of approximately 100 securities selected from a broad universe of global stocks  generally including securities with market capitalizations in excess of  1 billion  For more information about this ETF  

ETF methodology and Sector Allocation Index selection methodology is designed to identify companies with potentially superior risk return profiles to outperform during periods of weakness in the markets and or in the American economy overall  The Index is designed to actively select securities with low relative valuations  conservative accounting  dividend payments and a history of outperformance during bearish market periods  The Index constituents are well diversified and supposed to represent a  defensive  portfolio  The sector allocation of this ETF is as follows 
DEF Dividend and Fees DEF pays a respectable dividend of 3 31  and charges an acceptable management fee of 0 65  
The Perfect Defensive ETF  At first glance  DEF looks like a pretty diversified ETF  positioned within the right sectors to hedge against economic downturns in its focus on traditional defensive stocks  including utilities  real estate and consumer defensive  With its highly regarded investment advisor Guggenheim and an investment strategy that seems logical  DEF might even look like the perfect defensive ETF  as its name suggest  but is it really 
Performance of DEF in the past 30 days The following chart depicts the performance of DEF against the S P 500 index tracked by the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSEARCA N SPY  during the past 30 days ending Friday January 15  2016 
Source ycharts com
As noted on the chart above  DEF utterly failed as a defensive ETF as it tumbled 6 4  when the S P 500 Index fell 8 4   Let us compare the performance of DEF against the average performance of the five defensive sectors  The failure of DEF is even more evident based on the above table as DEF tumbled by 6 4  against an average decline of 4  for the five main sectors considered to be defensive  So what went wrong with this ETF which seems to tick all the right boxes  In order to understand what went wrong we have to dig a little deeper  Three reasons DEF failed to do its job as a defensive ETF 1  Geographical allocation issues  
A high 9 3  geographical exposure to the Asian market  of which about one third relating to emerging markets  The allocations include countries such as Singapore  Taiwan  Japan and Asian emerging markets  all of which are very sensitive to China and took a large hit from the Chinese stock market crash  Stocks in this category include Telekomunik Indonesia  N TLK   Japan s Nippon Telegraph   Telephone  NYSE N NTT   and Korea s SK Telecom  NYSE N SKM  
Direct exposure to China  China Mobile  N CHL   China Petroleum   Chemicals  NYSE N SNP   and Chunghwa Telecom  NYSE N CHT   
About 2  is allocated to South American markets which are highly dependent on commodities and tend to be more sensitive to economic and market volatility and uncertainty  Stocks in this category include Banco De Chile ADR  N BCH  and Mexican Grupo Aeroportuario PAC ADR  N PAC  

2  Sector Allocation issues 
The Fund has a high 8 2  exposure to the energy sector including oil and gas Master Limited Partnerships  These sectors got hammered the past month  DEF holds indeed high risk stocks for the current environment  such as National Oilwell Varco  NYSE N NOV  and Targa Resources Partners  N NGLS  
A 3 2  exposure to the basic material sector which has been diving for the past two years  as commodity prices reached multi year lows on concerns of a China slowdown  Stocks in the ETF include AGL Resources  N GAS  and Syngenta AG  VX SYNN  
A very high exposure of 14 5  to the telecom sector proved to be too much for a defensive ETF  as the sector plunged 7 6  to become one of the ugliest defensive plays for the past month  Stocks in the ETF include Verizon  N VZ   Frontier Communications  NASDAQ O FTR   NTT DOCOMO  N DCM  and Vodafone  NASDAQ L VOD  
3  Passive Investing Strategy  The most notable problem with DEF Fund lays in the fact that it uses a  passive  or  indexing  investment approach which makes it vulnerable as economic conditions change  DEF does not have a dynamic system in place to exclude currently risky sectors which once used to be considered safe  such as the oil sector and commodities sector  or to limit exposure to disfavored regions and countries

6613,228128,DCMYY,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks For A Safe Portfolio ,opinion, Every time you borrow money  you re robbing your future self     Nathan W  MorrisOf course  since capital is one of the basic requirements of production  companies   especially those with a dearth of resources   often resort to debt financing to boost up their future earnings  This is because equity financing is relatively costlier  Another perk to debt financing is that the interest expense is tax deductible However  for a safe investment strategy  understanding the amount of financial leverage that a company bears is crucial  This is because financial leverage multiplies the underlying business risk  So  while financial leverage brings with it the expectation of increased return in the future  it also carries the risk of losing money substantially  In fact  in any unfavorable turn of events  exorbitant debt financing bears the risk of dragging a company into bankruptcy For the purpose of safe investment in stocks  varied parameters based on leverage ratio have been constructed historically  These parameters serve the purpose of estimating the credit worthiness of a company  One such prominent tool is debt to equity ratio What is Debt to Equity Ratio Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityIn simple terms  debt to equity is a solvency ratio that measures a company s debt position and its ability to pay interest  A lower debt to equity ratio greatly contributes to an investor s confidence in a company s financial stability This is because a high debt to equity ratio indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the large debt amount  which had once exploded its earnings  This in reality  makes the company s so called solid earnings extremely volatile Choose the Right StrategyInstead of blindly targeting high earnings yielding stocks  it is wise for investors to pour money in low leverage stocks However  choosing stocks based solely on one financial metric might not fetch the desired outcome  To ensure maximum possible return from this strategy  we have expanded our screening procedure to include some other criteria Here is the final screen Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Those stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Although 35 stocks passed the screen  we have eliminated those with a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio   Here are five stocks from the final 19 Omega Protein Corporation   NYSE OME    This nutrition products supplier  with a special focus in fish meal products  currently holds a Zacks Rank  1 and witnessed a 3 8  improvement in its current year consensus estimate in the last 60 days NTT DOCOMO  Inc    NYSE DCM    This mobile communications

This isn t the first time that the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s feeds have appeared on Google Search  A similar deal was signed between the companies in Oct 2009  which expired in Jul 2011  While it is still not clear why such a yielding collaboration came to an end  Twitter continued to maintain its relationship with other search engines such as Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO   NTT DOCOMO Inc  NYSE DCM   Yahoo  Japan and other smaller developers  Apparently  the main reason for the fallout was Google s emerging social networking project   Google Plus  Back then  Google was ambitious about Google Plus after a failed attempt with Orkut and considered Twitter a competitor 
However  with changing market environment and fierce competition from the social networking giant Facebook  NASDAQ FB   both the companies have come to reconsider their decision  Facebook is trying to creep into Google s domain with its own search engine  read more   It was not until the beginning of this year that Twitter and Google realized that combining their forces will help capture a large share of ad revenues  According to eMarketer  Google lost mobile ad market share last year  which dropped to 38 2  from 46  in 2013  The tech giant is losing out to Facebook  in particular  given its absence on social platforms  Hence  with the new deal  Google can boost business over mobile platforms  attracting more advertisers and raking in higher ad revenues 
Twitter will now be able to generate ad revenues from clicks on Google search  which would display live Twitter stream and lower its dependence on Twitter users  Twitter expects to diversify its revenue stream and increase sales from  665 million in 2013 to  14 billion by 2024  However  it currently has only 60 000 advertisers as against Facebook s 1 5 million  according to reports  As a result  it plans to increase the share of ads that appear on users  timelines to 5  ",2015-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/twitter's-tweets-to-be-displayed-on-google-search-page-252530,252530

6638,228153,DCMYY,5 Stocks To Buy As Japan s Economic Outlook Brightens,opinion,"In a clear signal that Japan s economic situation is improving  the country s central bank raised its growth outlook for the year in a report released on Thursday  Of course  skeptics continue to point toward the country s inflation rate  which still remains well below the Bank of Japan s  BoJ  stated target  But it has become increasingly apparent that the economy has turned the corner and is on the verge of expansion Given Thursday s events  the BoJ is likely to maintain is monetary stimulus as long as it needs to in order to boost growth and inflation  The continuing success of its stimulus measures  as well as that of the Japanese government  makes it a good idea to invest in Japan stocks at this time 
Bank of Japan Upgrades View on Economy 
In its Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices  the BoJ sounded the most optimistic about the economy in nine years  Raising its yearly assessment for the economy  the central bank increased its 2017 18 forecast for real GDP above the rate of 1 5  projected in January  At 1 6   the new estimate for yearly growth is a definite improvement 
In its quarterly assessment of the economy  the BoJ also said that Japan s economy was now steadily moving ahead on the path toward  moderate expansion   This is at variance with the view that the central bank had expressed in March  when it stated that the economic situation had improved  and was continuing to do so   moderately as a trend  
Additionally  both the International Monetary Fund  IMF  and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  have recently raised their real growth forecasts for Japan  According to the IMF  the country s economy will expand by 1 2  in 2017  which represents a 0 4 point improvement from its January estimate of a growth rate of 0 8  
Monetary Stimulus Maintained to Tackle Inflation
However  Japan s central bank also reduced it forecast for growth in core CPI for the fiscal year from 1 5  to 1 4   Last week  BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda stated that the monetary stimulus which is in place is likely to continue  Kuroda said that this had become necessary because inflation remained significantly  sluggish  
Such a comment also illustrates the variance between the positions of Japan s central bank  and its compatriots in the U S  and Europe  on monetary stimulus  However  on Thursday  Kuroda said he was confident that an expanding economy will ultimately lead to an increase in wages and consequently inflation 
Kuroda s confidence reflects the economy s new found strength  which has been more than evident since the beginning of the year  In March  exports increased by its largest extent in more than two years  At the same time  the confidence of manufacturers touched its highest level since the Great Recession of 2008 Our ChoicesThe fact that Japan s central bank has raised its economic outlook for the year is reflective of its new found confidence in the world s third largest economy  Other economic indicators released recently also bear out such a view  Additionally  key financial institutions have also revised their assessments of the country s economy upward Adding Japan s stocks to your portfolios looks like a prudent option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score Hitachi  Ltd    OTC HTHIY   is one of the world s leading global electronics companies Hitachi has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 20 2  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 5 3  over the last 30 days Advantest Corp   is one of the world s leading automatic test equipment suppliers to the semiconductor industry  and is also a producer of electronic and optoelectronic instruments and systems Advantest has a VGM Score of B  The company has expected earnings growth of 38 6  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 9  over the last 30 days  The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see NTT DOCOMO  Inc    NYSE DCM   is a provider of mobile telecom services in Japan NTT DOCOMO has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 8 8  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 0 6  over the last 60 days Canon Inc    NYSE CAJ   is an industry leader in professional and consumer imaging equipment and information systems Canon has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of B  The company has expected earnings growth of 30 7  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 9 9  over the last 60 days Nomura Holdings  Inc    NYSE NMR   is a leading financial services group in Japan and has worldwide operations  providing a wide range of value added financial services and competitive products Nomura Holdings has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of B  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 14 6  over the last 30 days  The forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the current financial year  F1  is 11 38  lower than the industry average of 16 56 Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside
