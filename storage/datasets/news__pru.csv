133742,355257,PRU,Expect more money market jitters at year end  fund managers,news,"By Megan Davies and Dan Burns
NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors should expect another bout of money market volatility as the banking system s year end funding crunch approaches and the Federal Reserve has not arrived at a permanent fix for the problem  top bond market players said on Monday 
The Fed was also to slow to respond in the first place to market ructions in September that drove up key interest rates  they said  Cash available to banks for their short term funding needs all but dried up  and interest rates in U S  money markets shot up to as high as 10  for some overnight loans  more than four times the Fed s rate 
 I think the pressures will be similar at the end of the year  but the Fed has committed to a pretty big repo facility that they ll deploy faster this time   Anne Mathias  global rates and FX strategist at Vanguard  told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit   Part of the problem the first time is that it took them a while to get the facility going  
 The Fed made a major mistake here  They weren t listening to the market and were too busy doing the blame game   said Gregory Peters  managing director and multi sector and strategy head at PGIM  the asset management arm of insurer Prudential Financial Inc  N PRU  
Since September  the Fed has been pumping tens of billions of dollars of cash injections a day to stabilize a key funding market known as the repurchase agreement  or repo  market  Last month  it increased the daily offering to at least  120 billion and a senior Fed official on Monday said the Fed would adjust its operations as warranted to ensure smooth conditions 
The Fed has also begun buying  60 billion a month of Treasury bills to help replenish the stock of bank reserves  which had fallen too low this fall and proved insufficient at a time when financial institutions  cash requirements were high 
 You have a confluence of balance sheet reduction  financial regulation  tax bills   Mathias said 
Peters said the Fed s actions are providing only limited relief to an entrenched problem 
 The truth is that the structural and regulatory environment isn t helping  Banks are penalized for holding Treasuries   Peters said 
 They will throw money at it  but it doesn t solve the underlying issue  Doing this backdoor  quantitative easing  thing helps on the margin  but the fact they were asleep at the switch is more concerning on a looking forward basis  
Peters is also concerned that the position of head of market operations at the New York Fed has gone unfilled since becoming vacant following the departure of its long standing director  Simon Potter 
 The NY Fed is by far the most important institution in the market  and some people who were really well respected have left the building   Peters said

of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures  and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those into forward looking statements  Do you see the slide titled forward looking statements and non GAAP measures in the appendix to today s presentation  which can be found on our website at investor credential com With that  I ll hand it over to Charlie Charles F  Lowrey    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Darin  Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us today  Yesterday  we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of  2 33  We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12 1  for the full year  Looking back on 2019  and we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long term  As a result  we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives  against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance  I ll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019  First  we launched a process  talent and technology transformation initiative  which is on track to realize  500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022  As part of this program  we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U S  workforce during the fourth quarter  which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce Second  we returned approximately  4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases  The 10  increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield unbooked value in excess of 4   Third  we completed our acquisition of assurance IQ in October adding leading direct to consumer financial wellness solutions platform  We re encouraged by the growth and customer demand the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well known technology companies  Finally  we may progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern  And we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance In 2019  our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment  the annual assumption update in our Individual Life business and higher than typical expenses in our International Businesses  In 2020  we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead  We re focused on executing three key initiatives  First  we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long term sustainable growth while generating  140 million in cost savings this year  Second  in our International Businesses  we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets  Supporting this objective  this quarter  we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat  expanding our presence in Latin America We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets  including Korea  We ll share further details at the appropriate time  And third  we re continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment  such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products  Turning to slide three  I ll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results  which Rob will cover in more detail  Our U S  Businesses benefited from record account values in Retirement and Individual Annuities  Earnings increased from the prior year quarter  reflecting higher net investment spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business  PGIM  our global asset manager  reported record assets under management of  1 3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees and Other Related Revenues Our International Businesses increased earnings  driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth  partly offset by higher than typical expenses  Turning to slide four  I d like to touch briefly on four ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way  First  we are a purpose driven company  We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders  Second  in December  our Board introduced a multi stakeholder framework that extends the Board s accountability to investors  employees  customers and society at large  reinforcing the Board s commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns  Third  this multi stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental  social and governance practices  Finally  we provide transparency so investors can measure our progress We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability board s task force on climate related financial disclosures  This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions  recycling and water usage  In addition  we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold  Just last month  Fortune included us on its list of World s Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year  We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year  In closing  we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place  including the three initiatives I have outlined for 2020 With that  I ll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook Robert M  Falzon    Vice Chairman And DirectorThank you  Charlie  I ll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U S   PGIM and International Businesses and in our near term earnings growth outlook  Turning to slide five  Our U S  Businesses consist of the workplace solutions  individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees  investment spread and underwriting income  Our U S  Businesses have three key priorities for growth  First  we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins  Second  we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities  including  by way of example  the non jumbo corporate segment of the full service retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our Group Insurance business And third  we remain committed to expanding our addressable market  including through workplace financial wellness  and assurance IQ  As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities  over time  we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns  In the near term  We expect underlying earnings in the US businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth and retirement  group insurance and insurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our individual annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline  We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business  Now turning to slide six PGIM  our asset management business  continues to leverage its diversified multi manager model  global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value added strategies that serve investors globally  With a record  1 3 trillion of assets under management as of year end  PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager  It is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms  We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets  And as the investment engine of Prudential  PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U S  and International Businesses  Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success More than 80  of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last three   five  and 10 year periods  This performance helped us to generate  1 9 billion of net third party flows during the fourth quarter  including  1 2 billion of institutional and  700 million of retail net flows  In addition  PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018  PGIM s adjusted operating margin of 32  in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and has grown over the last three years as we balanced business reinvestment with margin expansion  For the full year 2019  PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4  higher than 2018 and 6  higher after adjusting for business acquisition related costs Looking ahead  we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid  to high single digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager  and we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year  Turning to slide seven  Our International Businesses continue to benefit from our world class Japanese life insurance operation  where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as from our focus on other operations in high growth markets  Life Planner sales increased by 17  compared to the year ago quarter  This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil  Korea and Taiwan  Sales for Gibraltar were 14  lower than the year ago quarter This primarily reflects lower single pay U S  dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as the recent decline in U S  interest rates led us to lower crediting rates  In addition  we continue to focus on quality distribution  The number of life planners as a result has declined  The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales  We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability  Total in force for international increased by 3  from the prior year  including 5  increase in Life Planner and a 1  increase in Gibraltar  In the near term  we expect total in force to grow at a similar level  We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates And with that  I ll hand it over to Ken Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Rob  I ll begin on slide eight  which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results  We begin with pre tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter  which was  1 2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of  2 33 on an after tax basis  then we adjust for the following items  First  in the fourth quarter  we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income  which was a benefit of  135 million  Second  the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs  which will result in a net benefit of  435 million or  0 85 per share and is comprised of two items  The fourth quarter included  160 million of seasonally higher expenses and  365 million of implementation costs  including the impact from the voluntary separation program As indicated in the eight k filing on December 17  We expect implementation costs of 170  5 million in 2020  With about 20 million of these costs in the first quarter  and long term compensation expense for retiree eligible employees is recognized When awards are granted  which is typically in the first quarter of each year  in the first quarter of 2020  we expect this expanse to be about  70 million split between PGM and corporate another  these items net to 85 cents per share  Third  there are other considerations that we we expect will have a  20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our to the fourth quarter  And fourth  we anticipate that investment income will be reduced by  10 million  assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter  Combined  this gets us to a baseline of  2 and 95 cents per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of sherry purchases  business growth and market impacts in 2020 The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately  0 15 per share  While we have provided these items to consider  there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020  I d also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix  On slide 18  we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll forward by business  And on slide 19  we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business  In addition  we have included some other considerations for 2020 on slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs  the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate  Now turning to slide nine  I ll provide an update on capital deployment  liquidity and leverage  We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position We returned  900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases  which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses  On December 19  we announced the Board s authorization to repurchase up to  2 billion of common stock in 2020  In addition  we increased the first quarter dividend to  1 10 per share  which represents a 10  increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4 4  yield on our adjusted book value  We also continue to maintain a rock solid balance sheet Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets  and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target  Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were  4 1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our  3 billion to  5 billion liquidity target range  We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses  assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders  Turning to slide 10  and in summary  we had numerous accomplishments in 2019  We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020  leading to greater earnings in 2021 Now I ll turn it to the operator for your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Nigel Dally    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Thanks  And good morning  I had a question on annuities  It s one of the areas that you do expect a decline in earnings in 2020  So I just wanted to check  you said just because of a modest decline in AUM  because of the anticipated outflows overwhelming market appreciation  Or is there also an underlying element of some deterioration in the return on assets  And if is the latter  what s driving that Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesSo Nigel  thanks for your question  This is Andy  There s really two major impacts that we re seeing in the annuities business  One  as you pointed out  is the outflow  That really is coming from    we are being very disciplined in our pricing of product and in our return on new sales  And if you look backward  we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range  So that s creating that outflow  And the other thing I would point to  though  is as that business is rolling across its surrender period  we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Nigel  this is Ken  I d just add    I know there s been some questions about the ROA  Our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE  and our variable annuity business is very profitable  and that is evident by the higher ROE that s in the high teens  And that high ROE reflects our unique product design  our robust risk management and disciplined pricing  And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings  capital and cash flow even with significant market moves  So as a result  our earnings  capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values  And the ROA may move as market moves  but again  our earnings  capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome  So the decline in rates and the increase in the equity markets  while it had an increase in account values  had a less meaningful impact on our earnings  again  due to our robust risk management Nigel Dally    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Got it  Second question was just on dividends  Good to see the incremental dividends again this quarter  I think that brings your payout ratio to around 35   Is there a limit to how high you d like to go  Or is there incremental upside there Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Sure  So maybe just a little bit of reflection of our capital management and shareholder distribution philosophy that s been very consistent over time  and it starts with our free cash flow  which is about 65  of after tax earnings  This year  a little bit better than that  And this should    we then distribute in both the forms of dividends and share repurchases  Our dividends have increased actually 12 years in a row now  And if you look at the average increase over the last five years  it s been 11   And now that dividend represents  as I mentioned in my opening comments  a 4 4  yield on book value  Our Board has also authorized  2 billion of share repurchases for 2020  So generally  a very consistent approach to our shareholder distributions  which balances both dividends and returns of excess capital through share repurchases Nigel Dally    Morgan Stanley    AnalystVery helpful  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  good morning  So maybe a question on interest rates  On last quarter s call  you increased your guided interest rate sensitivity to  0 30 of EPS impact for a 50 basis point drop in rates  And now we ve seen in 2020    well  maybe not today  but I was estimating 30 basis points so far in 2020  So I just want to make sure there are no changes  Should we expect a  0 15 to  0 20 negative impact on 2020 EPS based on that  Or are there some other factors at work  And with that  maybe you could tell us what your new money yields are doing in the portfolio Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Sure  So the sensitivity that we gave to interest rates of 50 basis points at  0 30  that s still good  So that rough rule of thumb and how you applied it  I think that still is appropriate  Our new money yields in the second half of the year were about 3 65   and you can think of that relative to our    and that s in the U S  relative to our U S  portfolio yield of about 4 2  Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  And then just shifting over to the Individual Life segment and kind of thinking back  second quarter  you had that  200 plus million charge  Third quarter  there was about  30 million of underwriting income below expectations  And in 4Q  it was about  15 million now below expectations  So I m wondering if    as we look forward  are you comfortable with underwriting assumptions into the year  And your sales were really robust at  209 million  You cited it as a record since 2013  So what are you selling that you re excited about Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesYes  So Andrew  it s Andy  Thanks for your question  So we would consider our actual to expected in the fourth quarter as in line with our expectations  The result was 103   and I would encourage you to think of there s a quarter around that  100 million plus or minus a couple of percent so that    we really think that s in line  As far as you referenced the assumption updates  we re seeing that our business performance has been consistent with the updates that we made in the second quarter  Shifting over to the new business sales  we are very  very pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business  as you cited  it s best quarter in five years We re probably even more pleased that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales  The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from Guaranteed Universal Life  which obviously is highly interest rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life  which has much  much less sensitivity to interest rates  So pleased with what we re seeing  The success is really coming from we have a very  very strong brand name  We believe our product portfolio is very strong and our distribution system is top notch Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystAnd term life is at the balance of the sales largely Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesYes  Awesome  Thanks OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI  Please go ahead Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  Just a first question on the assurance IQ deal in terms of how are you thinking about the results so far  It looks to me based on the disclosure that the revenues are coming in below what was projected initially  I think it was  500 million  Was the 2019 guide and looks closer to maybe  300 million on a full year basis  I guess first question is that right  And secondly  does that cause you to rethink revenue and earnings projections  2020  2021 Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesSo maybe    Tom  this is Andy  I ll start  and then I ll hand it off to Ken  So as you d imagine  these are early days  We just closed the acquisition in October  but I ll tell you  there s a lot of things that we re excited about  We re  as we sit here today  even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business  In fourth quarter  we saw very  very strong consumer demand flow across the platform  We saw 6 5 million shoppers  And just to define that for you  we define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute intention to buy a financial service product and that s willing to share their contact information with us  So we saw 6 5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q  That s compared against  3 5 million in the year ago quarter  So we re very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand A very positive for us on that is we have product providers  literally lining up of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform  So from a revenue potential perspective  we re every bit as strong as we were  We are in    kind of where we re focused right now is getting those additional products onto the platform  As far as your numbers around revenue  yes  our revenue for the year came in just north of  300 million  And really  what I would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents  we ll call it  capacity on the platform  We learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 healthcare agents onto the platform  I will tell you that we re already well under way in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020  So it s a completely rectifiable situation and we re well out in front of it Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  The only thing I d add there is  as you had heard from Andy describe  this business is a very high growth phase and we were not expecting meaningful earnings in the near term or in 2020 as a result  And so it s early days and we ll report this information to you each quarter  And just as Andy indicated  just a reminder  that is a seasonal business  primarily fourth quarter loaded Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  And Ken  would you say you re sticking to the  700 million revenue projection for 2020 still  Or is that sort of TBD Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Given the high growth nature of this business  we don t want to get into the practice of updating each and every quarter  So again  we re going to    you re going to see the results as they occur in a separate segment Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  And then just my follow up is  is PRU planning on early adopting variable annuity reform at year end 2019  And if not  is the plan to do full implementation in 2020 or a three year phase in Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe re going to adopt on the effective date  which is January 1  2020  but remind you that we made big structural changes that were very much aligned with the new reform many years ago  So we re well positioned  and we expect to be very well capitalized before the reform and after the reform Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  And Ken  no three year phasing  you d fully adopt in 2020 Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerFully adopt  January 1 Tom Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  thanks Operator Operator Instructions  Next  we ll go to the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research  please go ahead Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystHi  thank you  Um  So you ve clearly taken some big steps to accelerate the timing of realizing the expense savings you ve talked about  Can you just help us think about when we ll start to see these in results and where they ll come through  I guess  whether in terms of the business segments or through in corporate Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Sure  In our 8 K that we filed  we gave some information of our belief of the progression of the saves  They were modest in 2019 and we provided an estimate for 2020  that  140 million would be realized in the P L in the year  Those results  you can expect to build as we go through the year and you can expect to see them emerge with    primarily in the U S  Businesses and in corporate but throughout those businesses but  again  because it s a company    it s a U S  Businesswide program Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystGot it  And when you re giving sort of your walk through in the slides of kind of future earnings trajectory  am I right that there s nothing really explicitly contemplated there from savings in the businesses Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOnly what was accomplished in the    through 2019 or the first and the fourth quarter  And then any future improvement  whether it s from business growth or share repurchases or additional expense saves  incremental expense saves would not be included in that baseline  That s all in the future Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystGot it  And then you mentioned in the remarks  potential actions to continue streamlining your business portfolio and realize that it s premature to say much specific  But how would you think of redeploying any proceeds you potentially generate  Would you look to reinvest these in the businesses  Or potentially  would they be available to return to shareholders Charles F  Lowrey    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe answer is yes  So what we mean is  we ll cross that bridge when we come to it  But let me take a step back for a moment and make a more general comment on how we think about capital  in particular  the optimization of our capital  which I think we ve been doing for years  So we always look across our businesses  both domestically and internationally  to ensure that we re optimizing capital deployment  and when we see attractive opportunities  you ve seen us invest in growth and make acquisitions  And you ve also seen us scale back or look for divestitures over the years when there are better uses of capital and then put that capital to use either in growing the franchise or  if there aren t opportunities  returning it to shareholders  So we ll continue to look for ways to optimize capital deployment and to maximize outcomes for our shareholders  whether that be in investing in new business opportunities  which  again  you ve seen us do or return capital to shareholders Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW  Please go ahead Ryan Krueger    KBW    AnalystHi  good morning  I guess first  have you completed the year end cash flow testing analysis  And if so  can you give us any indication of the impact Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe statutory filings will come out at the end of the month  and so yes  that will include our updated cash flow testing or asset adequacy testing  You ll see those results when we report them  What I d offer you now is  given lower rates  we would expect some strengthening in our AAT reserves or cash flow testing  but we have derivative gains or interest rate hedges that offset that and we expect to have RBC ratios that are above our AA financial strength objectives Ryan Krueger    KBW    AnalystGot it  And then when you did the second quarter assumption review and had some impacts to the Individual Life business  at the time  you talked about reinsurance as being a potential option to improve returns in that business  Is that something that you re still contemplating  And can you give us any update there Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesYes  Ryan  this is Andy  So I would broaden your question and say we re taking a number of actions to strengthen the performance of our life business  First and foremost  we are working diligently on expense efficiencies and you can think about that in the context of the broader work going on at the company and the  500 million in outcomes we expect over the next couple of years  We already talked about the sales  which we think is a meaningful    will be a meaningful contributor to giving earnings lift over time in the business  And then  yes  you are correct  We have been looking at options and we ll continue to look at options from a reinsurance perspective on    with the block  And what we re looking for there  obviously  is the right partner and the right terms that make economic sense for us  There s nothing currently that we want to report  but we ll keep you posted as we go forward Ryan Krueger    KBW    AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi  Please go ahead Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystThanks  Just focusing on slide 20 of your deck in the International Businesses  it looks like  at least over the next 12 months  Life Planner and Gibraltar are expected to be flat  which is lower than that intermediate earnings growth guidance you gave at Investor Day of mid single digits  So just want to get a sense of if we stay in this interest rate environment  what kind of gets us from flat back up to the mid single digits and sort of over what time frame Scott Sleyster    Executive Vice President and Head of International BusinessesHi  Suneet  This is Scott  Let me take that  So as you pointed out  the underlying business fundamentals for our International Businesses actually look quite strong  As Rob pointed out  our in force block is growing at about 4   4  to 5  in LP and about 1  in Gibraltar  Unfortunately  given the low rate environment  for the most part  we re giving back a lot of the earnings growth associated in the block  and we re continuing to make some portfolio investments on technology and the like  So right now  I would say  over the    certainly  looking out to this year  we think we re going to be closer to flat  We hope  over time  as we make adjustments  that ll start to build  But I would say  even right now  looking at the intermediate term  we d say we re looking at low single digit growth Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystOkay  And then a follow up is just on Assurance IQ  I think it was mentioned that there are about 6 5 million shoppers in the fourth quarter  What should we expect to be the conversion rate of the    of that balance  in other words  of the  6 5 million  How many would you expect to actually buy a product Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesSo Suneet  it s Andy  I ll take your question  Conversion rate is a very complex topic  So it very much depends on the product mix that s on the platform  And as we talked about  we are in a phase of rapidly looking out    looking to roll new products onto the platform  So the conversion rates that we re currently experiencing are going to change quite a bit with that product mix shift as well as  as you can imagine  with the shopper demand we had  but the mismatch with our agent capacity  our conversion was lower than we would expect going forward  At this point  we re not going to put out explicit numbers  but hopefully  that gives you a way to think about it Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystAnd have you put any PRU products on that platform yet  I know that was one of your objectives when you announced the deal Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesYes  So it absolutely is one of our primary objectives  We have been working diligently to get our simply term life product onto the platform  We are ahead of schedule on those plans  and we will get that product on the platform in the second quarter of this year  And we re very encouraged with our brand name and the quality of our products that will give both assurance and  obviously  other Prudential some lift Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystOkay  thanks Operator Operator Instructions  Next  we ll go to the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O Neill  please go ahead John Barnidge    Sandler O Neill    AnalystThank you  Have you seen any meaningful acceleration in PGIM s U K  business post election or demand for product from that market in Continental Europe Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesSo John  this is Andy  I ll take that question  So what I would tell you is in the short term  with all the flux that s been going on  we haven t seen any meaningful change or lift  I would kind of frame it as  in many ways  the marketplace is a bit hunkered down  So as an example  on the real estate side  we haven t seen a whole lot of capital fundraising and deployment  We are absolutely ready no matter how that plays out  We have licenses in all the right places and people in all the right places to continue not only serving our current clients but to capitalize on potential opportunities if and when the dust settles John Barnidge    Sandler O Neill    AnalystOkay  And then my follow up  As we look back to SARS over 15 years ago in light of the coronavirus  do you see any increased demand for your products on the benefits side to note Scott Sleyster    Executive Vice President and Head of International BusinessesThis is Scott  again  On the specific question  I would say  history would show that any time there s a widespread illness  it creates a greater sensitivity among the customer base about the kinds of products that we sell  In particular  as you know  on the international side especially  we re very focused on death protection products  And so anytime you have something like this that goes on  you re very concerned about your employees and your customers and you re taking lots of actions there  but I do think there is a follow on effect of greater sensitivity to the products that we offer John Barnidge    Sandler O Neill    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling   Partners  Please go ahead Humphrey Lee    Dowling And Partners    AnalystGood morning  and thank you for taking my questions  A question related to PGIM  So looking at your retail flows  it looks very strong from an inflows perspective  I think it may be even a record number  but then at the same time  it seems like you have record withdrawals as well  I was just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of where you see the inflows and what happened in the outflows and how do you think about it in 2020 Andy Sullivan    Executive Vice President and Head of U S  BusinessesSo yes  This is Andy  Humphrey  So we are very pleased and proud of the retail flows that we saw  As I think Rob mentioned in his opening  we moved up to number seven in the quarter  The retail flows are really coming from an expansion of our product portfolio on that platform as well as the work that we ve done around usage  From an outflow perspective  what I d say is that will tend to be episodic  and I think over the long term  we feel very  very good that due to our investment performance and our range of strategies  that we will see a continued upward trend over time Charles F  Lowrey    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Humphrey  I would just add on the institutional side  that those flows can be a little bit lumpy  And we saw a couple of clients who want to consolidate this year  And sometimes  we re the beneficiary of consolidation  Sometimes we re not and a couple of dominoes tilted against us this year  but that doesn t affect how we think about our institutional capability or the quality of flows that we can have going forward Humphrey Lee    Dowling And Partners    AnalystThat makes sense  And then just a clarification of regarding Assurance IQ  So I think Ken was talking about the    given the growth that you re expecting and then you re not necessarily expecting any earnings from Assurance IQ in 2020  I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly because I think originally  at the announcement  you were expecting maybe a  0 10 EPS accretion for 2020  So I just wanted to kind of bridge the differences Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  No  I didn t mean to say no earnings  I said not meaningful earnings  again  because of the high growth nature of the phase that they re going through Humphrey Lee    Dowling And Partners    AnalystSo the  0 10 still kind of    I understand you re not going to update guidance or anything like that  but is  0 10 a reasonable expectation Ken Tanji    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAgain  we don t want to get in the practice of having to update this every quarter Humphrey Lee    Dowling And Partners    AnalystOkayOperatorAll right  And I d now like to turn the call back to Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments Charles F  Lowrey    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thank you very much  So in closing  I hope you all walk away from this call with a clear picture of our progress and

September contracts on the S P 500 slipped as much as 0 5  after settling Wednesday at a record high  Strategists and investors said they weren t sure if addition of 224 000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls would change Chairman Jerome Powell s thinking on stimulus 
Here s a roundup 

Delores Rubin  a senior equity trader at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  Wealth Management

One  immediate reaction was a July cut is off the table  but the futures reaction is showing this is not what the market wants  The real question is are there any other data points between now and the Fed meeting that show enough signs of weakness that allows the Fed to be comfortable with a rate cut  I suspect the fact that we are coming off of the 4th of July holiday on a Friday that not as many investors are around which will make today s moves more exaggerated  

Lindsay Bernum  head of macro at Smith Capital Investors

 It s one of those tricky things because the market was pricing in Fed cuts so there can be two reactions  one  that this allows the Fed to have the option of remaining on hold and not cutting in July  At times  that could be negative for risk assets  but overall that could be a short term movement as the market does need to reprice Fed cuts  Overall  the strong foundation that the U S  still remains in via employment  the consumer and getting through some of the temporary disruptions we ve had overall should be a positive for risk assets  There might be a temporary hiccup as the market reprices but a strong foundation should be good for risk assets  

Peter Boockvar  chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group

 Let s be honest people  this spike to record highs in stocks has been all about the hopes for easing  easing  easing because the economic data over the past few weeks has been weak  While jobs data is a lagging indicator and should not be taken as an all clear signal at all  it might certainly hold off and push out the easing  easing  easing  

Tony Bedikian  managing director and head of global markets at Citizens Bank

 Today s jobs report shows the U S  economy continues to create jobs at a strong pace even as we enter the longest period of economic expansion on record  The bounce back in the June jobs number may splash cold water on the notion of an imminent Fed rate cut  We will have to see whether the equity markets can shrug that off when balanced against other macroeconomic factors  such as the hope of a China trade truce  

Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc  NYSE PRU  

 This leads to questions as to whether or not the Fed will be as committed to rate cuts at the July meeting  Chairman Powell goes up to Capitol Hill for his testimony  he s obviously going to be asked about monetary policy  The question is  will he begin to walk back his comments that led the market to believe in a 100  chance of a rate cut later this year  The Fed fund futures will pull back a little bit  

Dennis Debusschere  head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI

 This continues the cross current scenario that the Fed has to deal with  A bigger question is  they have to untangle how much of the other economic data releases that were weaker    and we saw a few    had to do with trade  and not the state of the economy  Pretty much the best payroll number you would ask for  within reason  from a risk asset point of view  i e   labor market strong  yet nothing within the number suggest the Fed should change course from the easing bias  ",2019-07-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/not-what-the-market-wantspayroll-data-is-too-hot-for-comfort-1916033,1916033

133775,355290,PRU,U S  small cap stocks under renewed threat from tariffs,news,"By April Joyner and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK  Reuters    Last week s announcement of more U S  tariffs on Chinese goods may have undermined the prospects for small cap stocks to rebound this year  even after a brief respite from the Federal Reserve s recent interest rate cut  Just a day after the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade  President Donald Trump vowed on Aug  1 to impose 10  tariffs on an additional  300 billion of Chinese goods beginning on Sept  1 
The prospect of lower interest rates has helped combat concerns about slowing economic growth  which have hampered the performance of small cap shares over the past year  But such relief has quickly faded as fears have mounted that additional tariffs could impede the U S  economy  A U S  economic slowdown would bode especially poorly for small cap companies  which tend to be more domestically focused than their large cap counterparts   What small caps need above all else is a confirmation that the U S  economy is on solid footing   Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  in Newark  New Jersey  said in an interview on Tuesday 
Strategists have said the risks to the U S  economy increase as the trade war escalates  Morgan Stanley s chief economist wrote in a note on Monday that if the trade war intensifies with the United States raising tariffs to 25  on all imports from China for four to six months  the global economy could enter a recession in three quarters 
Moreover  he wrote   about two thirds of goods tariffed in this round are consumer goods  which could lead to a more pronounced impact on the U S  as compared to earlier tranches  
Since Trump s announcement last Thursday of additional tariffs  the small cap Russell 2000 Index has fallen about 3 1   further than the benchmark S P 500 s 2 1  slide 
SHRINKING PROFIT MARGINS
Given the renewed threat of tariffs  small cap stocks are likely to continue to underperform for at least the next few months  said Keith Lerner  chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services  SunTrust recently upgraded its rating on U S  small cap stocks  citing their low valuations  But Lerner said he expects investors to remain wary of small cap stocks until the possibility of further escalation in the U S  China trade war recedes 
 Small caps looked like they were about to break out   he said   But as soon as  Trump s  tweet came out  they broke down   In particular  recent developments on tariffs have brought small cap companies  shrinking profit margins back into focus  an issue that has dragged down their shares over the past year 
Revenue growth for smaller companies has largely kept pace with that of large cap companies  said Steven DeSanctis  equity strategist at Jefferies in New York  But rising wage and input costs have resulted in lower profits for the group  According to IBES data from Refinitiv  as of Wednesday  earnings for companies in the small cap S P 600 Index were expected to have declined 6 3  year over year for the second quarter of 2019 while second quarter earnings for S P 500 companies were expected to have risen 2 7  
Furthermore  profit margin projections have fallen for small cap companies more sharply than for large cap companies since the end of June  according to research from Lori Calvasina  head of U S  equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets  Added costs from tariffs would further depress small cap earnings 
 There s definitely a margin issue if costs rise and they can t pass them on to consumers   DeSanctis said 
Heightened trade tensions in recent days have raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will further cut interest rates  As of Thursday  traders were fully pricing in a 25 basis point cut at the Fed s next meeting in September  according to CME Group s FedWatch tool 
But even lower rates would do little to bolster small cap shares without at least a detente in U S  China trade relations  said Kristina Hooper  chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York  Conversely  a walk back of the additional tariffs coupled with a reacceleration of U S  economic data following the Fed s recent rate cut could help jump start small cap shares  in her view 




 That s the scenario where small caps could really perform better   she said ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-smallcap-stocks-under-renewed-threat-from-tariffs-1949885,1949885

133780,355295,PRU,Capital spending outlook another worry ahead of earnings,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are preparing for more cautious capital investment outlooks from U S  companies as worries mount heading into earnings season about the possibility of an economic recession 
Capital expenditure increases have been weaker than last year  when corporate tax cuts helped to bolster spending  and some strategists say they may even fall short of Wall Street s expectations given the concerns about the economy and a prolonged trade war between the United States and China 
Less spending on technology  machinery and other equipment would suggest corporate executives are less confident in the economy than they had been  another potential negative for the stock market  which has fallen this week amid a series of weak economic reports 
Capital expenditures are expected to have increased just 3 0  in the third quarter from a year ago  which would be the lowest since the second quarter of 2017  when capex declined slightly  according to data based on analysts  estimates compiled by Refinitiv s research senior manager  David Aurelio 
That estimate drops to 1 1  in the fourth quarter  and year over year declines are projected in some quarters of 2020 
 It s very likely that capex spending is going to be below expectations   said Kristina Hooper  chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York   We are in a state of heightened economic policy uncertainty  That tamps down business investment  
Strategists said spending plans will be of particular interest as S P 500  SPX  companies discuss their results for the third quarter in the weeks ahead 
The reporting period begins with big banks including JPMorgan Chase  N JPM  and others reporting on Oct  15 
Results overall are expected to be relatively weak  with analysts forecasting earnings for S P 500 companies to have declined 2 7  in the third quarter from a year ago  based on Refinitiv s data 
Recent dismal economic indicators have fueled concerns that the United States was flirting with a recession 
Upbeat jobs data offered some relief for investors on Friday  but it came on the heels of a report this week showing manufacturing activity plunged to a more than 10 year trough in September  Other data showed U S  services sector activity slowed to a three year low in September 
 There is a correlation between CEO confidence and capex  And right now we ve seen CEO confidence decrease  so again it s going to be a challenging environment for companies to go ahead and spend   said Keith Lerner  chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta

133853,355368,PRU,In a Market Meltdown  Trump May Complicate the Fed s Response,news," Bloomberg     Investors are confident that the Federal Reserve s monetary policy is independent of political influence  Yet President Donald Trump s criticism of Jerome Powell and his rate increases isn t making things any easier for the Fed chair as stock prices tumble 
Tumult in equities and tightening financial conditions have altered the course of Fed policy before  most recently in 2016  when the central bank signaled four rate hikes for that year and then only carried out one  For now  the Fed hasn t suggested that tumbling shares risk altering its tightening plans  However  Trump s badgering doesn t create the best optics if officials do want to potentially pause should confidence in the markets and the economic outlook deteriorate markedly 
Trump stepped up his attacks on Powell on Tuesday  saying he  maybe  regrets appointing him  The president also said he s intentionally sending a direct message that he wants lower rates  The criticism by Trump    who s previously touted equities gains as evidence of his success    seems to align with slides in the S P 500 Index 
 Trump is very politically savvy   said Marc Chandler  chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex   If the stock market sells off he s got a target    it s the Fed s fault  And if the Fed does begin to pause then Trump will be able to claim it as a victory  This puts Powell in a no win situation  
In September  the Fed lifted rates for the sixth time since Trump took office  although it was the first move since the president began complaining about Powell  Officials are signaling another hike this year and three more in 2019  Trump s hardly the first president to pressure Fed chairs to keep rates low  Both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon did so 
Gauging the Sell off
The S P 500 has dropped almost 8 percent since peaking in September  still short of the 10 percent threshold that classically defines a correction  Still  the current sell off concerns some investors because of the persistence of the losses  Since last month s high  stocks have dropped roughly twice the frequency of the last three corrections 
Back in 2016  stocks got off to an ugly start  From the end of December  the S P 500 fell 12 percent before bottoming in February  Fed officials wound up backing off plans for more aggressive rate hikes amid the financial market turmoil  which was triggered by concern over slowing Chinese growth  Inflation was also running too low at the time 
 The Fed should be of strong enough character that regardless of what the president is saying about them  that if it s the right policy to change course then they should change course   said Jim Bianco  president of Bianco Research LLC 
 Back Channels 
Powell has time before having to make any tough decisions  The S P 500 would have to fall 15 to 20 percent to raise the odds of the Fed altering policy  according to Krishna Guha  head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI 
Absent a Fed shift  it s Trump himself who could act as a catalyst for the market  depending on whether he moves to ease trade tensions  Yet his  market sensitivity does not mean that Trump will make significant policy changes on any topic including trade based upon short term market volatility   Guha wrote 
Money market traders have already trimmed bets on how many rate increases they see over the next year  That  combined with haven buying  have pushed the benchmark 10 year yield down to 3 12 percent  from a seven year high of 3 26 percent touched Oct  9 
The market has to understand  that this is fluid and the president s comments are not unusual from the White House   said Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc  NYSE PRU    But it s usually in essence kept at the White House and sent through back channels to the Fed  ",2018-10-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/in-a-market-meltdown-trump-may-complicate-the-feds-response-1658169,1658169

133937,355452,PRU,Q A  Volatility creates opportunity in emerging markets   PGIM head,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn
 Reuters    The only thing abnormal that the head of Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  Inc s asset management unit sees in the recent burst of stock market volatility is that it had not happened sooner  PGIM Chief Executive Officer David Hunt  whose unit manages  1 2 trillion  spoke with Reuters about the opportunity it triggers and more 
Q  What do you make of the market correction 
A  It s not at all unexpected and a bit overdue 
Obviously  we look at that as long term investors and for us  this means that we can get in at a better entry point 
Q  Is there an opportunity 
A  If you take the 10 year view  a large portion of the growth from worldwide economies will come from emerging markets  Over the last 18 months  it s been hard to get into that at a reasonable price  Now the numbers are looking more positive 
Q  Which emerging markets are appealing 
A  Looking at the world in terms of countries is not the way to do it  Industry trends now are more powerful  Trends around cities and urbanization are more powerful 
We think the internet has the opportunity to grow disproportionately in emerging markets than in developed markets  We ve been big investors in China  India and others in the internet  payment platforms and other technologies that we think will leapfrog a lot of existing technologies in the developed world 
Q  What is PGIM s best performing investment 
A  In 2017   good balanced portfolio did really well across the portfolio  Real estate investments were very strong 
We had a record performance in our private asset classes  Private credit performed extremely well  The most important thing was that more than 90 percent of our assets performed better than their benchmarks 
Q  Are there troublesome pockets of real estate 
A  We were well ahead of the trend of the difficulties in retail    That s now been a bit overdone  so we are now stepping back into malls where we think they have been sold off badly or where we think we can create a really interesting experience 
On the other side  the internet is creating really different uses for real estate    Every major U S  city needs to have four or five big complexes not too far from the city center   to set up and create the last line of delivery to the home   And my favorite one  self storage  There is no more powerful human emotion than the desire to hold on to stuff  And it s not a big returner  but it s a good returner   about a 7 9 percent return   and very low risk 
Q  Where do you see PGIM fitting in as passive managers take over more of the marketplace 
A  My general thesis on the passive piece is that it s both overblown and misunderstood

133942,355457,PRU, 1 2 Trillion Asset Manager Isn t Worried About Trade Fight,news," Bloomberg     Prudential Financial Inc  NYSE PRU   s investment management arm  PGIM  is bullish on global stocks and likes emerging market debt  even as the escalating conflict between the U S  and China over trade rocks markets 
There s a  fairly low  probability that the trade tensions will derail global growth  David Hunt  chief executive officer of PGIM  said in an interview on Wednesday in Tokyo 
 There is an awful lot of discussion  and issues get on the table   he said   As it moves into implementation  in general  there has been a kind of middle ground that has been found  
Hunt s top asset managers  who were with him in Japan  agree  Here is what they had to say 

 Equity valuations on average are not excessive by historical standards   said Jeffrey Becker  chief executive officer of Jennison Associates  one of PGIM s investment firms  citing the S P 500 Index   It would be a mistake to sit on the sidelines of the equity markets over the next several years  

 We consider the volatility in February and then March  April to be selloffs  not a correction or the sign of an early bear market  
 Both countries have a lot to lose by escalating the trade war   he said   I think the substance of trade restrictions and their real impact will be far less than the headlines  
 We do not expect a U S  recession in the next two to three years or longer  


Mike Lillard  chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income  which manages about  709 billion  likes bond and currencies from emerging markets 

 We favor emerging market currencies such as Mexico and Brazil versus the U S  dollar   he said   Stronger growth rates  higher real rates of return and better demographics will cause these countries  currencies to outperform over the long run  
 Some of the best opportunities  are currently in emerging markets  he said  giving the example of hard currency notes with a 10 year tenor from Mexico 


PGIM Fixed Income is overweight select emerging market currencies  as well as some emerging market government  corporate and local currency bonds  It s underweight developed market sovereigns  U S  agencies  U S  MBS and U S  interest rate swaps

133965,355480,PRU,Exclusive  Canada increasingly convinced Trump will pull out of NAFTA,news,"By David Ljunggren LONDON  Ontario  Reuters    Canada is increasingly convinced that President Donald Trump will soon announce the United States intends to pull out of NAFTA  two government sources said on Wednesday  sending the Canadian and Mexican currencies lower and hurting stocks  The comments cast further doubt on prospects for talks to modernize the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   which Trump has repeatedly threatened to abandon unless major changes are made  Officials are due to hold a sixth and penultimate round of negotiations in Montreal from Jan  23 28 as time runs out to bridge major differences  It is not certain the United States would quit NAFTA even if Trump gave the required six months  notice  since he is not obliged to act once the deadline runs out  Notice of withdrawal could also raise opposition in Congress  One of the Canadian government sources also said later it was not certain that Trump would move against the treaty and that Ottawa was prepared for many scenarios  But even the prospect of potential damage to the three nations  integrated economies sparked market concerns  Wall Street s major stock indexes ended lower on Wednesday  partly due to those worries   N   The Canadian dollar weakened to its lowest this year against the greenback on Wednesday as the NAFTA concerns tempered bets that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next week   Mike Archibald  associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments in Toronto  cited  a tremendous amount of uncertainty on the horizon   Canadian government bond prices rose across the yield curve and railway  pipeline and other trade sensitive stocks weighed on the country s main index  Mexico s currency also weakened and stocks extended losses  The S P BM IPC stock index fell about 1 8 percent    There s been chatter in the market going into this week that it was coming up   Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  in Newark  New Jersey  Royal Bank of Canada s Chief Executive Dave McKay said on Tuesday he believed there was now a greater chance that NAFTA could be scrapped   The government is increasingly sure about this     it is now planning for Trump to announce a withdrawal   one of the sources  who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation  said  Separately  a U S  source close to the White House quoted Trump as saying  I want out  as the talks drag on with little sign of progress  A White House spokesman said  there has been no change in the president s position on NAFTA   ALARMED Trump has long called the 1994 treaty a bad deal that hurts American workers  His negotiating team has set proposals that have alarmed their Canadian and Mexican counterparts   Among the most divisive are plans to establish rules of origin for NAFTA goods that would set minimum levels of U S  content for autos  a sunset clause that would terminate the trade deal if it is not renegotiated every five years  and ending the so called Chapter 19 dispute mechanism  The head of the U S  Chamber of Commerce said that economic gains made through tax cuts and the lifting of business regulations would be undone if the U S  canceled trade deals  including NAFTA  General Motors Co  NYSE GM  shares fell 2 4 percent  The Detroit automaker has 14 manufacturing facilities in Mexico  including one that builds large pickup trucks  among the automaker s most profitable vehicles  Trucks built there could be subject to a 25 percent tariff if the U S  exits NAFTA   We have always said that this is a possibility   a Mexican government source with knowledge of the talks told Reuters  referring to the prospect of a U S  withdrawal  Mexico s Economy Ministry declined to comment on the report  a ministry spokesman said  Scott Minerd  Global Chief Investment Officer at Guggenheim Partners  said  if Trump were to announce a NAFTA exit  the stock market would probably pull back by 5 percent or so before advancing to new highs  Most likely the Canadians are reacting to the President s negotiating posture   The Canadian sources said that if Trump did announce the United States was pulling out  Canada would stay at the table  since the talks would continue at a lower level  Mexico has previously said it would walk away if Trump formally announced Washington intended to quit  Canadian officials say if Trump does announce a U S  withdrawal  it could be a negotiating tactic designed to win concessions  The talks are scheduled to wrap up by the end of March  The news broke as the cabinet of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began gathering in the southwestern Ontario town of London ahead of a scheduled two day meeting where NAFTA is one of the items on the agenda  A spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland   in overall charge of U S  Canada relations and the NAFTA file   was not immediately available for comment

133986,355501,PRU,Exclusive  Global regulators to ditch  too big to fail  gauge for insurers   source,news,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price WASHINGTON  Reuters    Global financial regulators have decided to ditch a  too big to fail  gauge for assessing the riskiness of insurers  according to a source briefed on the matter  in a big win for companies such as American International Group  N AIG  and Prudential Financial Inc  N PRU   The Financial Stability Board  FSB   which coordinates financial regulation across the Group of 20 Economies  G20   is expected to announce in coming weeks a switch in focus from insurers  size to their activities when deciding whether to subject them to increased regulatory scrutiny  said the source  who requested anonymity because the matter has not been made public  Companies singled out for such scrutiny are required to hold extra capital to cover potential losses  increasing overall business costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns   The insurance industry has been lobbying for years for regulators to move to the activities based approach  arguing that their huge size should not automatically qualify them as systemically risky and on the hook for onerous bank like capital rules  The shift in the FSB s approach to designating globally systemically important insurers  or GSIIs  follows pressure from the U S  Treasury Department  which has been pushing the FSB to ease up on insurers and asset managers  the source said  A spokesman for the FSB declined to comment   The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged to overhaul regulations introduced following the 2007 2009 global financial crisis and put U S  interests first when engaging in international bodies such as the FSB and the Basel Committee of banking supervisors  In September  a group of U S  regulators   known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council   removed AIG from its domestic list of systemically important insurers  raising questions over whether the FSB would keep AIG on its global list and continue to add new firms  In a policy report published last month  the U S  Treasury rejected the idea of singling out specific asset management and insurance firms as systemically risky and criticized the FSB for mission creep and a lack of transparency  The U S  Treasury is shortly due to release a policy report on the FSOC designation process and powers  which critics including regulatory experts and insurers have said are too opaque and unaccountable  AIG BAILOUT AIG helped spark the global financial crisis  and the labeling of major financial institutions as systemically important stems largely from its  182 billion U S  government led rescue in September 2008  The bailout came just before the company would have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection amid mounting losses on its derivatives book  Worried the insurance giant was  too big to fail   the government stepped in to prevent further chaos to the financial system  The company ultimately repaid taxpayers in full by the end of 2012  with a profit of  22 7 billion  according to AIG  Since then  regulators have primarily focused on the size of a company s overall assets when assessing the risk they pose to the global financial system   Moving to an activities based approach could see firms on the list that largely engage in traditional insurance activities removed  but other non designated insurers that use their cash to invest in risky assets  or which deploy high levels of leverage  added  
The suspension of the 2017 review means the 2016 list of nine GSIIs   which also includes MetLife Inc  N MET   Allianz SE  DE ALVG  and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd  SS 601318    will continue to stand for at least the next 12 months until the FSB has completed an assessment based on the new methodology  the source said ",2017-11-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-global-regulators-to-ditch-too-big-to-fail-gauge-for-insurers--source-842121,842121
133987,355502,PRU,Regulators must focus on risks  not specific firms  U S  Treasury,news,By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Treasury Department said on Friday regulators should closely monitor risk across the whole financial system  rather than singling out large non bank financial firms for tougher scrutiny  The eagerly awaited policy recommendation marks another win for the financial industry  which has been lobbying to change the current process of designating individual firms as  systemically risky   which they say is opaque and arbitrary   Its findings mark a clear shift from the approach of former President Barack Obama s administration  under which regulators focused on targeting individual  large companies for tougher oversight including higher capital requirements   In the 68 page report issued on Friday  the Treasury urged the Financial Stability Oversight Council  FSOC  to reduce its reliance on identifying certain firms as  systemically important financial institutions   SIFI   a label that carries with it more rigorous oversight under the Federal Reserve  Rather  the Treasury called on the panel  which was created after the 2007 2009 financial crisis  to make its first priority monitoring the financial system as a whole rather than singling out companies  The panel should rely on primary regulators as the first line of defense  and only place a SIFI label on a company as a last resort  the Treasury recommended  It appears likely the changes will be adopted by the panel  which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and consists of a majority of President Donald Trump appointees  Mnuchin is expected to make consideration of those changes a high priority  according to a senior administration official  Most of the Treasury s recommendations are aimed at how the FSOC regulates non bank financial companies  whereby regulators exercise significant discretion in singling out companies for tougher rules  The Treasury described the SIFI designation as a  blunt instrument  in its report  arguing instead that it should fall primarily to individual regulators to monitor risks within their jurisdiction  while the FSOC focuses on broad challenges overall  The Trump administration has already taken steps to reduce the FSOC s footprint  In September  the panel voted to remove the SIFI label from American International Group  N AIG   leaving Prudential Financial Inc  N PRU  as the lone non bank SIFI still facing tougher scrutiny  That insurance company is expected to make the case for removing the label when it receives its annual review from the FSOC in the coming months  Insurance company MetLife  N MET  originally received a SIFI label but successfully challenged it in federal court  An appeal by the government had been stayed while the Treasury s FSOC conducted its review  The report does not weigh in on whether the government should drop its appeal  Under current law  all banks with over  50 billion in assets are automatically considered SIFIs  although there is legislation pending in the U S  Congress to raise that threshold to  250 billion   The report also recommends the FSOC boost its transparency across a range of its operations  That includes establishing a clear  off ramp  for firms carrying a SIFI label  where regulators more clearly lay out what steps should be taken to escape that designation  It also called for regulators to more rigorously consider the costs of applying stricter rules  and whether it would outweigh the benefits granted to the system  The Treasury s findings are a result of an executive order signed by Trump in April ,2017-11-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/regulators-must-focus-on-risks-not-specific-firms-us-treasury-879050,879050

134008,355523,PRU,It s Going to Stay a Yellen Fed No Matter Who Gets the Job,news," Bloomberg     It s going to be Janet Yellen s Federal Reserve no matter who is the next chair 
With every headline  financial markets get jolted as investors guess whether President Donald Trump will re nominate Yellen to the helm of the U S  central bank or opt for a more hawkish successor such as Stanford University economist John Taylor  Fed chairs matter  If credible  they influence dozens of policies  from regulation to research 
But on monetary policy  Yellen s strategy of gradual rate hikes  and ultra slow balance sheet runoff  will be difficult for any newcomer to quickly change  The Fed is guided by the goals Congress set for it  what the data say about those goals  and its forecast of how fast it s going to achieve them  And right now  it has missed its inflation goal for most of the past five years  with the data showing scant sign of a breakout to galloping growth 
 I don t think the fundamentals of the economy allow you to change the policy path that much   said Seth Carpenter  chief U S  economist for UBS Securities  and a former Fed economist   The biggest opportunity for change is with respect to balance sheet policy  and even there I find it hard to see how much change  a newcomer can bring 
Trump said this week he s  very  very close  to announcing his pick for the new Fed chair  who will need Senate confirmation  In a Fox News interview broadcast Sunday  the president specifically mentioned Yellen  Taylor and Fed governor Jerome Powell  without precluding other choices 
Yellen and Powell  who has never dissented since his arrival at the Board in May 2012  would be continuity choices 
Taylor brings a different framework  If he gets the job  there is little doubt that his influence will be large over the longer run  In the near term  however  the biggest change under a Taylor Fed might be in the area of transparency  said Andrew Levin  a former student of Taylor s and a Dartmouth College professor 
 He would make monetary policy more clear  more transparent  and more accountable to Congress   Levin added 
Gradual Pace
Under Yellen  the Federal Open Market Committee has raised the benchmark lending rate just four times since December 2015 to a range of 1 percent to 1 25 percent  Officials agreed to take several years to shrink the balance sheet  a process that started this month  They have penciled in one more hike this year  for a total of three  and possibly three more next year 
The policy future is going to look at lot like the recent policy past  said Nathan Sheets  chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income  an asset management arm of Prudential Financial Inc  NYSE PRU  
 The current FOMC has said that it is going to be moving three times next year   said Sheets  a former division director at the Fed board   I would think it would be roughly that    no matter who is chair  
The pattern of gradualism has been dictated by several economic conundrums  the most important being that the link from low unemployment to higher inflation seems to be much weaker than in the past  Growth in productivity    output per hour    has also been unusually low  and that s blamed by many economists for holding down wages and growth 
Much of the debate about how Taylor  or any new chair  would approach these problems revolves around an obscure economic concept known as the neutral policy rate    the theoretical level that keeps supply and demand in balance 
Raise rates too high above neutral  and the economy slows as demand is constrained  Keep rates too far below neutral and demand exceeds supply  pushing up prices and potentially stoking asset bubbles  Problem is  it can t be directly measured  though officials think it s low  Fed projections in September imply a real neutral rate of 0 8 percent  after adjusting for inflation  and some estimates place it below zero 
Most importantly  the neutral rate  known by economists as R star  is an input into Taylor s eponymous rule on monetary policy  Taylor has resisted tampering with his neutral rate estimate of 2 percent  after inflation  although last year he said there is  a lot of disagreement and uncertainty  around estimates  Using his baseline spits out a Taylor Rule rate recommendation of around 3 75 percent 
 The only reason Taylor is a high rate person  in the minds of investors  is that he has a dramatically higher R star estimate than anybody else on the committee   said former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer  who doesn t think Taylor can convince the committee that the neutral rate is around 2 percent 
 Not a prayer in the world   said Meyer  who now runs his own policy analysis firm   FOMC decisions have become more consensus driven under Bernanke and Yellen  No going back  
One area where a new chair could influence the committee is on the eventual size of the balance sheet  which will guide how monetary policy operates day to day 
Taylor says he wants to go back to a system where the federal funds rate is determined by demand for reserves  implying a small balance sheet  But he could face opposition from William Dudley  president of the New York Fed  which manages the central bank s portfolio  Dudley favors an abundant reserve model and other officials lean the same way 
As a matter of policy  officials are keeping an open mind on the topic  saying in the minutes of their June meeting that they expect  to learn more  about the underlying demand for reserves as they gradually shrink the balance sheet ",2017-10-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/its-going-to-stay-a-yellen-fed-no-matter-who-gets-the-job-548987,548987

134029,355544,PRU,AIG returns to pre bailout paydays for CEO  top executives,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn NEW YORK  Reuters    American International Group Inc s  N AIG  new Chief Executive Brian Duperreault has pledged to revive the insurer s glory days of top talent  underwriting discipline and fat profit margins  One thing he has already brought back  big pay packages  As he rejoined AIG in May  the 70 year old insurance industry veteran received bigger awards than any of his predecessors since Maurice  Hank  Greenberg  the man who built the company into a behemoth and left under a cloud in 2005  Duperreault quickly hired as his deputy Peter Zaffino  a former colleague at broker Marsh   McLennan Cos Inc  N MMC   with a lucrative sign on bonus  as well as a senior executive to head technology initiatives   Shareholders are banking that these costly personnel moves will pay off  after watching AIG stock underperform rivals and the broader market for nearly a decade   He  Duperreault  comes with a visible long term track record in terms of inspiring the operations and leading the personnel   said Mac Sykes  an analyst at investment firm Gabelli   Co  which owned about  58 million worth of AIG shares as of June 30   It s what AIG needs at this point   Sykes and others said they have no issue with Duperreault s handsome pay package  as long as he performs   We didn t react in a negative way  especially because they re going to make a lot more money if they execute   said a portfolio manager whose fund owns a large AIG stake  but was not authorized to speak about it publicly  FLAWED INCENTIVES   In addition to a  16 million annual package for 2017  Duperreault received  12 million in cash for shares he forfeited from Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd  an insurance company he co founded and led in his native Bermuda  On top of that he got options to buy up to 1 5 million AIG shares dependent on the share price hitting certain targets over the next seven years  AIG also agreed to pay Hamilton  40 million to get Duperreault out of a noncompete agreement and bought the company s U S  unit for  110 million  Excluding the sign on award  Duperreault s annual package is similar in size and structure to what CEOs of major rivals Prudential Financial Inc  N PRU  and MetLife Inc  N MET  received for 2016  AIG spokeswoman Cindy Leggett Flynn declined to comment on Duperreault s compensation or the other payments required to bring him on board   But there can be risks to big pay packages if they do not properly incentivize executives  pay consultants said  AIG learned that the hard way when it nearly collapsed in 2008 due to massive exposure to derivatives based on plunging property prices  and needed a  182 billion taxpayer funded bailout by the Federal Reserve and U S  Treasury  After that  AIG withheld awards from some executives for inappropriate risk taking  and paid its new CEO a nominal  1 salary in 2008  The company kept a lid on CEO pay throughout the period it was supported by the U S  government  which ended in 2013  For a graphic showing AIG CEO pay since 2004  click on  Corporate governance experts said they were most concerned about the structure of Duperreault s longer term stock option awards  To cash in the maximum number of his stock options  he must raise AIG s stock price by  30  or about 50 percent of its current value  within the next seven years and it must stay at that level for 20 consecutive trading days  The earliest he could exercise all his options  if the share price hits certain levels  would be three years   That could encourage aggressive risk taking for short term profits that ultimately harm the company  some experts said  Duperreault s options could vest more quickly than it may take for long term risks he takes on to become apparent  said Adam Kolasinski  an executive compensation expert who teaches finance at Texas A M University   If I were a board member  I would be very happy to grant a pay package even more generous than this one  provided it created good incentives   said Kolasinski   I am afraid this one does not   SMALL FORTUNE Recruiters  consultants and industry sources said AIG had little choice but to spend a small fortune to get Duperreault to leave a firm where he was comfortable and well paid  to take a difficult job that few wanted  His predecessor  Peter Hancock  left under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn  who was unhappy at dismal results and a static share price  Revamping AIG will require all Duperreault s leadership skills and insurance know how  He spent more than 20 years at AIG at the start of his career before transforming ACE Ltd into a global insurance powerhouse  revamping a troubled Marsh   McLennan and co founding Hamilton before returning to AIG as CEO   How many people can step into that job   asked David Larcker  director of the Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business   It s a pretty small set   Duperreault is the first AIG CEO in a decade to focus on growth and investment rather than divestitures and cost cutting in the wake of the 2007 2009 financial crisis  Investors are hoping this is the right approach  given AIG s sluggish share price growth since the crisis  AIG s stock closed at  60 78 on Friday  down 7 percent this year  compared to a 9 percent rise in the S P 500 index  The stock must hit  90 99 for Duperreault to exercise the maximum number of his stock options over the next seven years  a challenge Wall Street is ready to see him take on  
 I d rather see a package like this on the entry than a golden parachute on the exit   said Jeff Wilson  an equity analyst at Scharf Investments LLC  which owned about  186 million in AIG stock as of June 30 ",2017-08-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/aig-returns-to-prebailout-paydays-for-ceo-top-executives-522773,522773

134062,355577,PRU,U S  regulators weigh MetLife appeal against  too big to fail  label,news,"By Lisa Lambert
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The top U S  financial regulators ventured into uncharted legal territory on Friday  as they weighed the future of their appeal in a long running case over their labeling of MetLife Inc   N MET  as  too big to fail  
Almost everyone expected Republican President Donald Trump to withdraw the appeal  filed by the Obama administration  soon after taking office  said Douglas Holtz Eakin  who served as chief economist for former President George W  Bush 
Withdrawal would let stand a judge s 2016 decision that MetLife  the country s largest life insurer  should not be designated a  systemically important financial institution   a relatively new label that triggers heightened oversight and capital requirements 
Instead  both MetLife and the U S  government have repeatedly asked for delays in the case since Trump s inauguration  MetLife is currently considered  dedesignated  
On Friday the Financial Stability Oversight Council FSOC  that makes the designations  consisting of the Treasury Secretary  Federal Reserve Chair and other regulatory chiefs  met to discuss the case  Because FSOC is a new body  no one is sure of the next legal step 
The council did not make any announcement after the meeting 
Critics of designation  including Holtz Eakin  say that since the Obama administration asked the Justice Department to file the appeal and represent the FSOC  the Justice Department can simply withdraw the appeal 
Trump has ordered U S  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to review FSOC and the designation process  after expressing skepticism of both 
 We believe the Trump administration should support an abeyance in the case until the review of the FSOC designation process is complete  which could lead to the dismissal of the appeal   said MetLife in a statement to Reuters 
Withdrawing the appeal could ease the way for the  systemically important  non banks   American International Group  N AIG  and  Prudential   LON PRU  Insurance  N PRU    to also shed the label 
Supporters of the Dodd Frank regulatory reforms that came out of the 2007 2009 financial crisis want the appeal to proceed 
Non profit lobby group  Better Markets  Inc  that pushes for a strict interpretation of the Dodd Frank financial regulations  recently asked the court to appoint independent counsel for FSOC  saying the Justice Department cannot represent both the council and the Trump administration 
It also believes that FSOC  in removing designations  should follow steps similar to those for making a designation  namely an extensive review  said Dennis Kelleher  Better Markets president

134107,355622,PRU,Insurers push to keep industry expert on U S  regulatory council,news,By Sarah N  Lynch and Suzanne Barlyn  Reuters    With no sign of a replacement in the works  the U S  insurance industry is pushing to prevent the departure of a key figure on the federal body that determines how large insurance companies are regulated   Roy Woodall  the sole independent voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council  FSOC  with insurance expertise  will lose his seat in late September  as his six year term set out under the Dodd Frank financial regulation reform law expires  His presence on the council is important to the insurance industry  because FSOC has the power to decide whether large financial companies are  systemically important financial institutions   or SIFIs  a tag that carries higher capital requirements and Federal Reserve oversight  As there is no federal insurance regulator  Woodall is effectively the most important figure in U S  regulation of large insurers   He will be forced to step down in five months  leaving a critical vacancy on the FSOC  which is based out of the U S  Treasury Department  unless Congress changes the Dodd Frank law and permits him to be held over temporarily  or U S  President Donald Trump acts swiftly to nominate a replacement    Treasury doesn t have that much experience in insurance  so it makes the insurance expert particularly important   said Dave Snyder  vice president of international policy and policy development for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America  A U S  Treasury spokesperson declined comment   Woodall  80  told Reuters that he would not want to serve another full six year term but would be willing to stay on until a replacement can be confirmed  Several large insurers fought their SIFI designations  arguing that they do not pose the same kind of risks as big banks    Prudential  Financial Inc  N PRU  and American International Group Inc  N AIG  still carry the designation  but Prudential  LON PRU  is widely expected to seek to have it rescinded  Industry executives say that if Woodall leaves without a replacement lined up  it could hurt their chances of success  FSOC s process to determine whether to apply the designation is  imprecise   said Ann Kappler  Prudential s deputy general counsel and head of external affairs  on Wednesday during an event about insurance regulation organized by the Bipartisan Policy Center  a think tank  Many FSOC staffers responsible for decisions did not fully understand how the company operates  Kappler said   Despite the amount of work done by FSOC staff  it was rife with problems   Kappler said   NOBODY S PUPPET  Two thirds of FSOC s sitting members must support rescinding a designation for it to happen  and regulatory matters affecting insurance companies are likely to come up during FSOC meetings  A former insurance commissioner of Kentucky  Woodall has more than 50 years of experience in insurance regulation  law and policymaking  Former President Barack Obama appointed him to the FSOC in 2011  He voted against designating Prudential and MetLife Inc  N MET  as SIFIs but was outnumbered by his other FSOC colleagues   He favored designating AIG  whose near failure during the 2008 crisis was a major threat to the financial system  as well as GE Capital  which has since shrunk and simplified   Roy Woodall is nobody s puppet   said Bridget Hagan  a partner at the lobbying and consulting firm Cypress Group  who also leads a coalition of insurers that are subject to Federal Reserve supervision   But he has deep experience     It s important that he stay in his role until a new official is confirmed   GE Capital shed its designation after breaking itself up  and MetLife successfully sued the government to shake its designation  An appeal is working its way through the courts  UNIQUE POSITION  Although Woodall s departure is five months away  insurers are worried that the White House will not nominate a replacement in time  or that Congress will not change the law to permit Woodall to be held over on a temporary basis   Trump has been slow to appoint financial regulators  including those that wield more power  such as the Federal Reserve s vice chair of supervision  A White House spokeswoman said the president is aware of the deadline and that it will be addressed in due time  Woodall s situation is unique on the council  whose other members are allowed to continue serving in their roles on expired terms  or be temporarily replaced with an acting member if there is a vacancy  The FSOC is composed of heads of federal financial regulators and led by U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  Industry lobbyists are starting to approach lawmakers to find out whether they might be willing to tuck language into unrelated legislation  such as a spending bill  that would allow Woodall to stay in place  a person familiar with the matter said  A financial regulatory proposal by House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling would merge Woodall s role with a separate job inside the U S  Treasury s Federal Insurance Office and allow for the sitting expert to be held over after a term expires  But the bill is not expected to go far because Senate Democrats oppose it

134221,355736,PRU,Emerging Markets Back In Favor  4 Safe  Solid Ways To Profit,opinion,"This post was written exclusively for U K  Investing com

In late November thoughts naturally turn to the upcoming new year and investment opportunities ahead  A casual glance at a few of the strategy notes already released by the big banks shows that emerging market investment opportunities are a favorite of many   
 

It ss easy to understand the rationale behind this  emerging markets have many supportive  big theme  mega trends including progressive urbanization and a 1 4 billion population increase by 2035  and within this the rise in importance of a consumption centric middle class   Naturally there are also lots of potential issues around corporate governance  corruption and the natural volatility from anything that is labelled  emerging   It is therefore possibly easier to access the theme via UK listed investments whose revenues  profits and cash flows are disproportionately generated from emerging market locations   
 

The first big name on the FTSE 100 mentioned by many looking for global emerging market exposure will be  Unilever   NYSE UN    LON ULVR   With marquee brands such as Surf  Magnum and Lipton Tea  the consumer goods company already generates more than 60 percent of its near 50 billion euro annual sales   56B USD  from emerging markets  What was marked about the Anglo Dutch company s third quarter results in October was the sheer advance of emerging markets with underlying year on year sales growth of 5 1 percent versus a derisory 0 1 percent decrease for developed markets  

Clearly the emerging markets theme is strong here but with bond proxy shares such as Unilever being so fashionable among investors over recent years  it is no surprise to see a firm valuation today too  There is no need to chase this share here   
 




 

By contrast  the mining and financial sectors are both currently out of favor due to reductions in global growth hopes during the year  However  times may be changing as estimates from supranational bodies such as the International Monetary Fund anticipate lower growth rates in the United States but flat or rising levels of growth elsewhere in the world  including across emerging markets in aggregate  This potential market rotation has started feeding into financial markets over the last quarter and  given the level of recent years outperformance by the bond proxy areas and related  could have further to go   
 

Three names that should benefit from such a market shift are Anglo American  Prudential and Standard Chartered 

 Anglo American   OTC NGLOY    LON AAL  titled a recent presentation  Positioned for the Future  and the world s leading platinum and diamonds producer both sourced from key African mining assets will benefit from both clean air legislation and rising wealth impacting demand for these commodity outputs  But Anglo American is much more than just a bunch of legacy strong African mining assets 
More recently it has focused its expansion efforts in South America and in a world where new large copper mines are hard to find  It announced a couple of months ago that its mine at Quellaveco in Peru was a generational asset with enough reserves to supply a century of production  Once the mine reaches full capacity  it will produce an average 330 000 tonnes a year of copper in its first five years  With copper a key commodity needed for emerging market focused urbanization efforts  this augurs well for a group whose management team have focused on debt reduction over recent years and could propel the shares back to the levels last seen nearer the start of the current decade  
 




 

In contrast to Anglo American  insurance giant  Prudential   NYSE PRU    LON PRU  is progressively focused on enhanced simplification  The heart of the business is no longer the eponymous  Man from the Pru  knocking on doors  but a pan Asian insurance business supplemented by a cash generative North American division  Insurance is a clear growth area as individuals in emerging markets want to protect and maintain rising wealth  In August s interim results  the Asian business again grew at a double digit rate  with very strong returns on capital and crucially very high customer loyalty with customer retention rates at 95 percent   

The troubles in Hong Kong have concerned some investors but any volatility in growth here will be more than countered by the opportunities in the huge mainland Chinese market as well as across the broader Asian geography  Earlier this year Prudential commented that the opportunity in protection insurance in China was currently over US 800 billion in size 
Asian division profitability is already matching the U S  division and with significantly higher new business growth  a large business will become a behemoth by the mid 2020s  At the very least the share offers scope to return back to the levels of eighteen months ago  
 




 

Meanwhile  Standard Chartered   LON STAN  present in 70 countries around the world is active in banking across the African  South American and Asian geographies  where Anglo American and Prudential also operate  After a number of years of turnaround  financial sector slowdown has placed the stock at less than 0 7 times book value  which appears attractive given the company s stated target of reaching a 10 percent return on equity in 2021  

Banks are typically positively correlated with economic development but have been held back recently by ultra low interest rates and fears of a malaise in trade and growth  A continuation of recent hopes would give this name   which generates profits almost exclusively from emerging markets   a chance of a renaissance after a tough last few years  In its recent third quarter numbers  Standard Chartered reported an 8 percent rise in average interest earning assets to US 603 billion  a statistic that should continue to rise along with the size and importance of the emerging market it serves  
 




 
Emerging markets remain a positive mega theme for investors to position their portfolios towards  However rather than just blanket buying  a strategy of understanding underlying sector exposures and whether one area or another is already highly appreciated by investors is also important  It is worth bearing in mind that despite the undoubted continued trials and tribulations around Brexit in the early part of the 2020s  at least the UK stock market maintains the breadth of opportunity to be much more than just a local economy play ",2019-11-28,Chris Bailey,https://www.investing.com/analysis/emerging-markets-back-in-favor-4-safe-solid-ways-to-profit-200488607,200488607

134225,355740,PRU,Analysts Estimate Prudential  PRU  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Prudential  LON PRU  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 2  
Revenues are expected to be  14 23 billion  down 20  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 39  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Prudential 
For Prudential  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 80  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Prudential will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Prudential would post earnings of  3 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 22  delivering a surprise of  4 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Prudential doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-prudential-pru-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200502378,200502378

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 15 92   A quarter ago  it was expected that this financial services company would post earnings of  3 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 22  delivering a surprise of 4 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Prudential  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  posted revenues of  17 45 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22 63   This compares to year ago revenues of  17 78 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Prudential shares have lost about 2 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for Prudential 
While Prudential has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

134236,355751,PRU,Asian Stocks Climb On US Job Growth,news,"By   

Asian stocks headed higher Monday after the U S  reported stronger than expected job growth last week and the head of the European Central Bank said he will increase stimulus if needed to boost the region s economy  These developments already pushed U S  stocks more than 2 percent higher on Friday 
On Monday morning  Japan s Nikkei 225 climbed 1 3 percent  South Korea s KOSPI index 0 4 percent and Australia s ASX 200 1 2 percent 
The U S  reported 211 000 new nonfarm jobs in November  compared with the 200 000 expected by economists  October s new jobs total was also revised upward to 298 000  While this sign of the health of the U S  economy cemented expectations that that Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the first time in nine years next week  investors have been factoring that in for weeks amid other positive data and statements by Fed officials 
 The post payrolls rally in U S  equities was notable   Bloomberg reported Kymberly Martin  a markets strategist in Wellington at Bank of New Zealand Ltd   as saying   The market appears to have read the data as reason for confidence in the economic outlook  rather than taking flight at the prospect of imminent reduction in U S  Fed stimulus  
In addition  the Fed has sent signals that further increases will be gradual 
Meanwhile  ECB President Mario Draghi reassured markets in a speech in Washington Friday  saying stimulus measures are  here to stay  with  no particular limit   Some investors were disappointed on Thursday when the ECB extended its bond buying program without increasing the monthly amount  and reduced interest rates less than they expected

134237,355752,PRU,Fed to sit tight on rates at March meet  hint at hikes to come  ,news,"By Ann Saphir SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The Federal Reserve won t raise interest rates this week  but will likely make clear that as long as U S  inflation and jobs continue to strengthen  economic weakness overseas won t stop rates from rising fairly soon  That will be a big change from the last time the Fed met  when uncertainty over the impact of slower growth in China and Europe drove policymakers to signal it would stay on hold until it could make a better call on the outlook  That in turn was a setback from just a month earlier  when the Fed raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade and seemed ready to move four more times this year   This week  fresh forecasts from the Fed s 17 officials released after the meeting will almost certainly signal a retreat from that pace  to perhaps two or three rate hikes this year  economists predict and Fed officials themselves have suggested   But the expected downgrade may largely reflect the drag from the oil and stock market slide in January and the Fed s decision then to put policy on hold  rather than mounting worries over the U S  or global outlook   Indeed  since the last Fed meeting U S  inflation has shown signs of stabilizing  with one measure published by the Dallas Fed rising to 1 9 percent  its closest to the Fed s 2 percent goal in 2 1 2 years  Meanwhile  the U S  unemployment rate held at 4 9 percent in February  near the level many Fed officials believe represents full employment  The European Central Bank s decision last week to ease policy further may help add to confidence that action has been taken to underpin growth in Europe  helping ensure a stalling of global growth drag on the U S  That could mean another U S  rate hike by mid year and  depending on economic data  more to come after that   June seems certainly like a possibility  for the Fed s next rate hike  said former Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota  whose own preference is for the Fed to take out  insurance  against a recession by cutting rates back to near zero  Market based inflation expectations have improved somewhat since the Fed s last meeting  he said   a real positive  development   INFLATION DEBATE Still  Kocherlakota s former colleagues will likely spend plenty of time discussing the inflation outlook  That much was clear last week  when two top Fed officials  speaking simultaneously at separate Washington events  gave diverging assessments of recent evidence of rising prices  More hawkish rate setters worry that if the Fed does not act to preempt inflation  it could end up behind the curve and lose credibility  while the more dovish members believe the economic recovery is still fragile and want to see firm evidence of inflationary pressures    That s probably internally the biggest grounds for debate   said Regions Financial Corporation  NYSE RF  economist Richard Moody   The Fed will also need to tackle how to characterize the  balance of risks  to their baseline outlook  he said  particularly if policymakers want to keep the door open to rate hikes in April or June    If they truly want the markets to believe that all the meetings are on the table  for a potential rate hike  then I would think they have to have something in there   Moody said  predicting they will characterize risks as  nearly balanced   the same phrase they used before December s rate hike   And yet  others say  Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be wary of sending too strong a signal of coming rate hikes  for fear of roiling markets   
 By June they will have a broad clutch of data and that could help them  and even some of the doves the Federal Open Market Committee  to come to a solid conclusion  on the desirability of a rate hike  and a conclusion  by the way  that the market agrees with   said Quincy Krosby  a market strategist for Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  ",2016-03-14,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fed-to-sit-tight-on-rates-at-march-meet,-hint-at-hikes-to-come-389675",389675

134291,355806,PRU,Prudential  PRU  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Prudential  LON PRU  in Focus
Based in Newark  Prudential  PRU  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 21 15   Currently paying a dividend of  1 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 4 05   In comparison  the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield is 2 44   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 99  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  4 is up 11 1  from last year  Prudential has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 13 31   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Prudential s current payout ratio is 34   meaning it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PRU for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  12 77 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 9 24  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PRU is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-06-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/prudential-pru-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200429235,200429235
134292,355807,PRU, MET Or AIG  Which Multi Line Insurer Looks More Attractive ,opinion,"The multi line insurance industry has put up a favorable performance so far this year  led by gain in insurance pricing  industry consolidation  solid capital levels  new product launches  diversified business lines coupled with not so severe catastrophe activity 
Despite low interest rate regime  which drives insurers  net investment income  the multi line insurance industry is poised for growth 
Against this backdrop  lets analyze American International Group  Inc    NYSE AIG   and MetLife  Inc    NYSE MET    both having market capitalization of nearly  46 billion  These stocks carry Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy   respectively  You can see  
Factors Driving the Multi line Insurance Industry
The industry is witnessing an increase in premium pricing after suffering from low prices for several years  It remains well capitalized and financially prepared to pay for large scale losses  if any occurs  in 2019 and beyond  This surplus capital is also expected to fuel increased consolidation in the industry as players seek to increase market share  achieve geographical diversification  change product mix and grow in niche areas 
Also  increased use of technology  like blockchain  AI  advanced analytics  telematics  cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save unnecessary delay and cost  which would increase business efficiency and reinforce good enterprise resource planning 
Let s see how American International and MetLife are placed in the rapidly growing industry 
Price Performance
Both the companies have outperformed the   up 11 1   so far this year  While shares of MetLife have gained 17 7   American International has rallied 34  
Other companies in the same space  Prudential Financial  Inc    NYSE PRU   and W  R  Berkley Corp    NYSE WRB   have gained 22  and 30 5   respectively  over the same time frame 

 
Return on Equity  ROE 
ROE is a measure of a company s efficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds  ROE for the trailing 12 months for MetLife and American International is 10 2  and 2 48   respectively  Further  with industry s average of 7 1   MetLife is more efficient in using shareholders  funds 
Earnings Estimate Revisions   Growth Projections
Analysts seem to be bullish on American International Group s financial performance  Thus  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings of  4 96 has moved 1 4  upward over the past 30 days  Also  the same indicates growth of 324  year over year  The stock has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 11   compared with the industry s growth of 11 5  
Meanwhile  MetLife s consensus estimate for 2019 earnings of  5 61 has marginally gone up by 0 4  over the past 30 days and it implies growth of 4 1   The stock has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 8 5  Therefore  this is in favor of American International 
Leverage
American International s net debt to capital ratio is 34  compared with MetLife s 3 9   The industry s average for the same is 22 5    Net debt is calculated by deducting cash and cash equivalents from a company s debt In case of Metlife  the ratio is lower than the industry average  implying the company s low debt levels in its capital structure  This reduces the company s financial risk and provides strength to its balance sheet 
Valuation
The trailing 12 month price to tangible book value per share  P B  of MetLife is 0 94  and that of American International is 0 75  compared with the industry s P B level of 0 80 
Thus  American International looks more attractively valued here 
Our Take
Our comparative analysis indicates that MetLife is placed better on leverage and profitability front  while American International scores better on valuation  estimate revision and past performance 
Stocks that have been witnessing positive estimate revisions tend to be solid bets  In this context  American International looks better than MetLife

134293,355808,PRU,Can Value Investors Pick Prudential Financial  PRU  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Prudential Financial  Inc    NYSE PRU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Prudential Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 79  However  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Prudential Financial s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 8 94 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 98  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Now  Prudential Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of7 79  which is quite lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Prudential Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Prudential Financial has a P S ratio of just 0 65  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 22x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Prudential Financial currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Prudential Financial a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Prudential Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives PRU a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen seven upward revision versus four downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the full year estimates have seen four upward and seven downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has shot up 1 2  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched down 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Prudential Financial  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePrudential Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a very strong industry rank  among Top 4  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become one of them in a new Special Report   7 Things You Can

The comments from Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on capital and other coming funding sent shares of Morgan Stanley  N MS  down 2 7 percent on Tuesday  while shares of JPMorgan Chase  N JPM  were down 1 4 percent 
Under global rules  the biggest banks face an extra equity capital requirement  or surcharge  on top of the standard measures  Tarullo did not specify how much the surcharges imposed on U S  banks would outstrip the international requirements  but he said it would be  noticeably so for some firms  
 You know  if the firm really thinks     that it has to be this big and this complicated to engage in a certain set of activities or to have a certain sized balance sheet  then it can do so  but it has to have very high levels of capital   Tarullo told the U S  Senate Banking Committee 
 If  on the other hand  those highest levels of capital appear to not be worth it  then it has the option of changing what people have called its systemic footprint   he said 
Those firms also would face additional capital charges if they use risky short term funding methods  Tarullo told the hearing  which was focused on regulators  progress implementing the 2010 Dodd Frank law 
U S  and international regulators have sought to make banks safer in part by forcing them to fund themselves more through shareholder equity and less through debt 
That includes a surcharge for the largest firms  such as JPMorgan Chase  N JPM  and Citigroup  N C   of up to 3 5 percent of their assets  on top of other capital requirements 
Tarullo said U S  regulators would set surcharges in the higher end of the range  International regulators have not imposed the top charge on any bank so far  keeping the capital surcharges between 1 and 2 5 percent 
The comments were some of the most direct yet from Tarullo  a leading Fed voice on regulation  and showed that officials intend to remain tough six years after the financial crisis 
 The evidence on your screen is the market is telling you it s one thing for  Fed Chair  Janet Yellen to mention something in passing  It s another for Governor Tarullo    to say   We are working on this and this is what we are going to do    said David Hilder  an analyst with Drexel Hamilton 
Marianne Lake  chief financial officer at JPMorgan  said at an investor conference on Tuesday that the bank was already prepared to meet tougher requirements 
 We are already in a situation where we are adequately providing capital and liquidity protection   Lake said 
SMALL BANKS
Tarullo warned big banks  but he said regulators think the Dodd Frank law was actually too tough on smaller and regional banks  He has called for exempting some banks from rules such as writing plans for going through bankruptcy in a crisis 
On Tuesday  he said community banks should not have to comply with the Volcker rule  which bans banks from making speculative bets with their own money 
Some lawmakers agreed   I think it is time for a fix it bill around Dodd Frank   said Senator Mark Warner  a Virginia Democrat 
Tarullo also said the Fed is working on capital requirements for insurance companies 
Dodd Frank requires non bank firms that are declared too big to fail to meet bank style capital rules  Insurers American International Group  N AIG  and Prudential Financial  N PRU  say those requirements would not fit their business models 
The Senate passed legislation to let the Fed write rules that fit insurers  but the House of Representatives has not approved it 
 You are caught in this limbo situation   said Senator Mike Johanns  a Nebraska Republican 
Tarullo said even if that legislation does not move forward  the Fed has some ability to tailor the rules by determining the risk level of insurance products that are not offered by banks  But he said a legislative fix would provide more flexibility

134310,355825,PRU,MetLife beats profit estimates as premiums rise,news," Reuters    MetLife Inc  N MET   the largest U S  life insurer  reported a better than expected quarterly profit  helped by higher premiums and gains tied to its derivatives program 
The company s shares were up about 3 percent at  53 49 in extended trading 
Premiums rose 7 percent to  9 69 billion  while total operating revenue rose 6 5 percent to  17 92 billion in the third quarter ended Sept  30 
 We delivered both top and bottom line growth  investment margins remained strong  and expenses were well controlled   Chief Executive Steve Kandarian said in statement 
MetLife said earlier this month that it would fight a plan by the U S  risk council to designate it as a firm whose demise could risk global finance  a tag that brings far greater regulatory scrutiny 
The U S  risk council is considering designating MetLife as a non bank systemically important financial institution  SIFI   the third insurer to be tapped for such a designation 
AIG  N AIG  and Prudential Financial Inc  N PRU  were designated as systemically important last year 
On an operating basis  MetLife earned  1 60 per share in the third quarter  topping the average analyst estimate of  1 38  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
MetLife has tried to scale back on capital intensive businesses such as annuities to focus more on traditional life insurance and pension products 
The company s net profit rose to  2 06 billion  or  1 81 per share  in the quarter  from  942 million  or 84 cents per share  a year earlier 
MetLife s profit in the latest quarter benefited from a  311 million derivative gain 

MetLife  like other insurers  is heavily exposed to persistently low interest rates  But it has long had a substantial derivatives program designed to smooth out that risk

134334,355849,PRU,Should Value Investors Buy Prudential  PRU  Stock ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One company to watch right now is Prudential  LON PRU   PRU is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 8 03  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 9 51  Over the past year  PRU s Forward P E has been as high as 8 75 and as low as 5 93  with a median of 7 60 
Investors should also note that PRU holds a PEG ratio of 0 89  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  PRU s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 05  Over the last 12 months  PRU s PEG has been as high as 1 03 and as low as 0 66  with a median of 0 85 
We should also highlight that PRU has a P B ratio of 0 88  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 75  Over the past 12 months  PRU s P B has been as high as 0 94 and as low as 0 68  with a median of 0 81 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  PRU has a P S ratio of 0 74  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 03 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Prudential s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that PRU is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-prudential-pru-stock-200413752,200413752
134335,355850,PRU,PRU Vs  RDN  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Insurance   Multi line stocks are likely familiar with Prudential  LON PRU  and Radian  RDN   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Prudential has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Radian has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that PRU has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
PRU currently has a forward P E ratio of 8 24  while RDN has a forward P E of 8 53  We also note that PRU has a PEG ratio of 0 92  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  RDN currently has a PEG ratio of 1 71 
Another notable valuation metric for PRU is its P B ratio of 0 89  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  RDN has a P B of 1 43 
These metrics  and several others  help PRU earn a Value grade of A  while RDN has been given a Value grade of C 
PRU has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than RDN  so it seems like value investors will conclude that PRU is the superior option right now ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pru-vs-rdn-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200413718,200413718

134338,355853,PRU,Why Prudential  PRU  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Prudential  LON PRU  in Focus
Based in Newark  Prudential  PRU  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 21 78   Currently paying a dividend of  1 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 4 03   In comparison  the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield is 2 42   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 98  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 is up 11 1  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Prudential has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 13 31   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Prudential s current payout ratio is 34   This means it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  PRU expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  12 82 per share  with earnings expected to increase 9 67  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout

134370,355885,PRU,Are Investors Undervaluing Prudential  PRU  Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One company value investors might notice is Prudential  LON PRU   PRU is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock holds a P E ratio of 7 68  while its industry has an average P E of 9 34  Over the last 12 months  PRU s Forward P E has been as high as 8 75 and as low as 5 93  with a median of 7 60 
We also note that PRU holds a PEG ratio of 0 85  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  PRU s industry has an average PEG of 1 03 right now  PRU s PEG has been as high as 1 03 and as low as 0 66  with a median of 0 85  all within the past year 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PRU s P B ratio of 0 83  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 71  Within the past 52 weeks  PRU s P B has been as high as 0 94 and as low as 0 68  with a median of 0 81 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  PRU has a P S ratio of 0 71  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 06 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Prudential s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that PRU is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-prudential-pru-right-now-200406755,200406755
134371,355886,PRU,PRU Vs  RDN  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Insurance   Multi line sector might want to consider either Prudential  LON PRU  or Radian  RDN   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Prudential has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Radian has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PRU is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
PRU currently has a forward P E ratio of 8  while RDN has a forward P E of 8 37  We also note that PRU has a PEG ratio of 0 89  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  RDN currently has a PEG ratio of 1 67 
Another notable valuation metric for PRU is its P B ratio of 0 85  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  RDN has a P B of 1 41 
Based on these metrics and many more  PRU holds a Value grade of A  while RDN has a Value grade of C 
PRU has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than RDN  so it seems like value investors will conclude that PRU is the superior option right now ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pru-vs-rdn-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200406731,200406731
134372,355887,PRU,Why Prudential  PRU  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Prudential  LON PRU  in Focus
Prudential  PRU  is headquartered in Newark  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 24 27  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  1 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 95   In comparison  the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield is 2 35   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 9  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 is up 11 1  from last year  Prudential has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 13 31   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Prudential s payout ratio is 31   which means it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PRU for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  12 70 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 8 64  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PRU is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-prudential-pru-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200407143,200407143
134373,355888,PRU,Dividend Buys  RQI  ZTS And PRU,opinion,"If your mattress is a bit heavy on cash these days  you re probably grinding your teeth every day as the markets tick higher  Should you be in the market  Shouldn t the market pullback eventually 

Here s a solution that ll get your  buy and hope  friends out of your face  buy some dividend machines that ll pay you while the markets levitate and hold up just fine if we do see the dip we re overdue for 

I m talking specifically about three mighty  pullback proof  dividends  yields up to 7 5   perfect for the  cliff edge  market we re seeing now  More on those in a moment 

Beware the  Dumb  Money

First  when I say  cliff edge   I m not kidding around 

As I just wrote in my Contrarian Income Report service  I ve recently grown wary of the market s short term outlook and my unease goes well beyond the first level panic about the  inverted yield curve  

The real reason to be wary is simpler  the  dumb money  hasn t been this confident of further market gains since January 2018  Dumb was dumber back then because stocks promptly collapsed 



 Source  Sundial Capital

 By the way  many individual investors would be categorized as  dumb money  because they get greedy when markets are hot and tend to buy high  Professionals and savvy contrarian income seekers like us on the other hand  smartly buy the dips  

This does not mean we re going to cash  We need to keep our income and our nest egg growing  so we re going after what I call  pullback proof  dividends 

These high yield  unicorns  have three weapons to deploy against the next market brushfire 

Big and growing dividends  I like to see a stock throwing off a yield of at least 4   double the current average S P 500 payout   backstopped by explosive payout growth 
Bargain valuations  For stocks and real estate investment trusts  REITs   this means low price to free cash flow  FCF  ratios  for high yield closed end funds  CEFs   we re talking huge discounts to NAV  or market prices well below the value of the fund s portfolio  
Rising sales to keep driving those dividends and gains no matter what 


What s the endgame on stocks like these 

Simple  they ll hold their own in a meltdown  and when markets rise  their attractive payouts and cheap prices nicely set them up to outperform 

3  Pullback Proof  Dividend Buys and 5 More Bonus Buys

With that  let s move on to the three  pullback proof  plays I have for you now  Then I ll wrap by telling you about five  bonus  dividend payers hardwired to push back against the next crash  These five boast even bigger payouts I m talking massive cash hits all the way up to 8 5  

Put it all together and you re actually getting a free  8 pack  of dividend payers to protect and grow your nest egg here  Let s get going  starting with our three leadoff hitters 

Prudential   Cheap by any Measure 

The 21  surge from Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  this year might make you think the easy money has been pocketed here  No way  Because this stock still ticks all three of our  pullback proof  boxes 

For one  the insurer is cheap by any measure  Right now you can buy shares for 82  of book value or less than what PRU would sell for if it were broken up and sold off  What s more  PRU trades at a silly two times free cash flow  Downright insulting for a management team that s grown sales 52  in the last five fiscal years 

Then there s the dividend  which yields a nice 4 1  now and is growing like a weed 

PRU s Supercharged Payout



If you ve been following my articles on Contrarian Outlook  you know I ve written before about a dividend s power to yank share prices higher as it grows 

PRU is a textbook example  As you can see above  the share price has jumped up to meet its payout over and over until early 2018  that is  when the pair parted ways  That s even more proof we ve got a nice buy window now  before the stock gaps back up 

Zoetis  A Classic Megatrend Stock 

My  unofficial  fourth requirement for a pullback proof payout is a tie in to a soaring megatrend  One of the biggest  and most overlooked   The growing pile of cash we re doling out on our furry pals 

Consider this  in 2009  total US pet spending clocked in at  45 5 billion  This year  An estimated  75 4 billion a 66  rise in just a decade 

And Zoetis Inc  NYSE ZTS   a maker of medicines for pets and livestock spun off from Pfizer  NYSE PFE  in 2013  is grabbing more than its share of that spending 

A Cash Machine



There are  however  a couple of places where Zoetis does come up a bit short on our  pullback proof  checklist 

Let s deal with those now 

First  the dividend looks lame at 0 7   But that s because investors bid up the price with each hike  keeping the current yield the same  because you calculate yield by dividing the yearly payout into the share price  

But if you d bought in early 2013  the yield on your original investment would already be up 200   to 2 1   Going hand in hand with that increase are management s stock buybacks  which have propelled the shares to a very speedy triple 

Share Count Down  Share Price Up



Second  Zoetis seems pricey at 34 times free cash flow  But as you can see below  that s on the low end historically another sign that now s the time to move 

When Expensive Is Cheap



Finally  let s  

RQI  A Cheap and Safe 7 5  Dividend

REITs are one of my favorite pullback plays because these landlords are obligated by law to pay 90  of their income as dividends  fueling some truly gargantuan payouts 

There s just one problem 

REITs on a Roll



With the big run in REITs since the Fed suddenly became  patient  on interest rates  it s been tough to find bargains here 

That s where CEFs come in  By tapping their famous discounts to NAV  we can  rewind the clock  and tap into some of the hottest properties in the US at 2018 prices  Consider the Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  RQI  

This stout CEF trades at a 7 1  discount to NAV  But as you can see below  that gap has almost completely closed in just the last year  So we ve got plenty of  snap back  upside built in here 

RQI s Buy Alarm Goes Off



Source  CEF Connect

Here s something else you need to know about this  all in one  real estate play  it rolls out an enormous dividend  7 5  yield   every single month 

A Steady Monthly Cash Infusion

Finally  this portfolio focuses on the best REITs industrial  residential  self storage  data center and health care while dodging retail  the perennial whipping boy of Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  

RQI Skips the Mall



Source  Cohen   Steers

With its 7 5  dividend and  nearly  matching discount  RQI is a solid  pullback proof  candidate now 
My Top 5 Pullback Proof Dividends  up to 8 5   Don t Miss Out

Now let s move on to those other five high yield plays I mentioned above 

I ve dropped them into a brand new Special Report and I m going to GIVE you your own copy now 

These five stocks have a lot in common with RQI  ZTS and PRU  But there are two key differences and they both work in your favor 

Higher yields  I m talking 7 5  payouts  on average and one of these cash machines throws off a mind boggling 8 5  dividend 
Bigger upside  This cash spinning quintet is even cheaper than the three stocks above  That means you can dive in safely  knowing you ve got even stronger downside protection and even faster gains as the market grinds higher  I m expecting 20   price upside in the next 12 months from each of these five dividend superstars 

The kicker  Because some of these plays pay dividends monthly  you can start tapping their income streams fast 

But a word of warning  all five of these stocks have edged higher in the market s latest upswing  I know I don t have to tell you that the higher they go  the more of that critical downside insurance we lose and the smaller their dividend yields get

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1  
Revenues are expected to be  13 74 billion  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 15  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Prudential 
For Prudential  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Prudential will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Prudential would post earnings of  2 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 44  delivering a surprise of  15 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Prudential appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/prudential-pru-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200410235,200410235

134376,355891,PRU,MGIC  MTG  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of MGIC Investment  MTG   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  14 43 in the previous session  MGIC Investment has gained 36 6  since the start of the year compared to the 13 3  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 9 6  return for the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 23  2019  MGIC reported EPS of  0 42 versus consensus estimate of  0 38 
Valuation Metrics
MGIC may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
MGIC has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 8 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 7 1X versus its peer group s average of 9 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 75  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  MGIC currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if MGIC meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though MGIC shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does MGIC Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of MGIC have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Swiss Re  SSREY   Prudential  LON PRU  Public Limited  PUK   and Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 41  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MGIC  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-04-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mgic-mtg-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200411788,200411788

134401,355916,PRU,Is Prudential Financial Services A  PFSAX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"Having trouble finding a Sector   Finance fund  Well  Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  Services A  PFSAX  would not be a good potential starting point right now  PFSAX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4  Sell   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance 
Objective
PFSAX is one of many Sector   Finance funds to choose from  Sector   Finance mutual funds provide investors with a diversified and stabilized investment approach focused on the financial space  which is a notoriously large  complex  and heavily regulated industry  These funds include everything from insurance companies and exchanges to banks and investment giants  interest rates can impact the players of this space as well 
History of Fund Manager
Prudential  LON PRU  is based in Providence  RI  and is the manager of PFSAX  Since Prudential Financial Services A made its debut in June of 1999  PFSAX has garnered more than  77 02 million in assets  A team of investment professionals is the fund s current manager 
Performance
Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance  This fund in particular has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of  1 78   and is in the top third among its category peers  If you re interested in shorter time frames  do not dismiss looking at the fund s 3 year annualized total return of 2 99   which places it in the top third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  Compared to the category average of 10 65   the standard deviation of PFSAX over the past three years is 16 13   Looking at the past 5 years  the fund s standard deviation is 15 78  compared to the category average of 10 29   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
Investors cannot discount the risks to this segment though  as it is always important to remember the downside for any potential investment  In PFSAX s case  the fund lost 47 09  in the most recent bear market and outperformed its peer group by 14 41   This makes the fund a possibly better choice than its peers during a sliding market environment 
Investors should not forget about beta  an important way to measure a mutual fund s risk compared to the market as a whole  PFSAX has a 5 year beta of 1 15  which means it is likely to be more volatile than the market average  Because alpha represents a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark  which is the S P 500 in this case  one should pay attention to this metric as well  With a negative alpha of  10 05  managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Examining the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States 
The mutual fund currently has 80 72  of its holdings in stocks  and these companies have an average market capitalization of  96 89 billion  Turnover is 26   which means this fund makes fewer trades than its comparable peers 
Expenses
Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  and particularly as competition heats up in this market  And all things being equal  a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors  In terms of fees  PFSAX is a load fund  It has an expense ratio of 1 33  compared to the category average of 1 42   Looking at the fund from a cost perspective  PFSAX is actually cheaper than its peers 
This fund requires a minimum initial investment of  2 500  and each subsequent investment should be at least  100 
Bottom Line
Overall  Prudential Financial Services A   PFSAX   has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank  and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance  worse downside risk  and lower fees  this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now

134425,355940,PRU,Prudential  PRU  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Prudential  LON PRU  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 1  
Revenues are expected to be  14 03 billion  down 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 7  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP

For Prudential  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Prudential will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Prudential would post earnings of  3 14 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 15  delivering a surprise of  0 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

134441,355956,PRU,Prudential Financial Inc  Solid As A Rock,opinion,"In another article we discussed the importance to identify trends in the Silver Economy and today I wanted to share with you an interesting investment idea using this rationale by analysing the Prudential Financial Inc   NYSE PRU  shares 
PRU  is an American large cap company with offices worldwide which provides life insurance  annuities  pensions and retirement services  The company has a history which goes back over 140 years 
The firm is so proud of its strength  that it uses the rock of Gibraltar as its corporate logo to showcase its financial stability and strength 
During the financial crises the company managed to avoid taking bailout  something that few of its competitors could manage  Not only did it avoid the bailout  but Prudential Financial was also able to quickly restore its dividend to pre financial crisis levels  After the dividend was cut in 2008  it quickly recovered by 2010 and it has increased regularly ever since  Today it pays a dividend of around 3 6  
Interestingly  the dividend payout ratio is just 19  of earnings and thus suggesting a high probability that the dividend will be maintaining growth over time At the moment the company is continuing to achieve healthy profits and revenues each year  The company is also trading at good prices   the stock has a P B of 0 92x and a P E of 10  The firm also has a debt to equity ratio around 0 37 and a healthy free cash flow 
During the last earnings announcement  the company also reported the below key messages   Double digit growth in adjusted earnings per share and adjusted book value per share  Distributed   760 million to shareholders  on the rise in comparison to previous quarters   Adjusted operating return on equity of 13 5   Financial leverage ratio less than 25   Financial leverage ratio represents capital debt divided by sum of capital debt and equity From a technical perspective  the price has just recently crossed over the 200 MA  which is considered as a very strong buy signal 
When considering the dividend  the attractive valuation  strong technical views and the continuing increase of ageing population  I think that this represents a good opportunity

134442,355957,PRU,Prudential  PRU  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Prudential  LON PRU  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 3  
Revenues are expected to be  13 51 billion  up 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 21  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Prudential 
For Prudential  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Prudential will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number

What s Next for Prudential 
While Prudential has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

134448,355963,PRU,Is Prudential  PRU  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Prudential  LON PRU   PRU is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 7 79  which compares to its industry s average of 9 84  PRU s Forward P E has been as high as 11 15 and as low as 6 99  with a median of 8 24  all within the past year 
We also note that PRU holds a PEG ratio of 0 87  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  PRU s industry has an average PEG of 1 right now  Within the past year  PRU s PEG has been as high as 1 39 and as low as 0 78  with a median of 0 96 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PRU s P B ratio of 0 86  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks solid versus its industry s average P B of 1 44  Over the past year  PRU s P B has been as high as 0 99 and as low as 0 75  with a median of 0 85 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  PRU has a P S ratio of 0 73  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 
Finally  investors should note that PRU has a P CF ratio of 5 58  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  PRU s P CF compares to its industry s average P CF of 9 42  Over the past year  PRU s P CF has been as high as 11 15 and as low as 4 95  with a median of 5 57

	Specifically  the Dow was up 0 57  to 24 792 2  The NASDAQ soared 0 84  to 6994 8  while the S P increased 0 54  to 2690 2  Each of these indices could potentially end 2017 at milestones if the Dow crosses 25 000  the NASDAQ finishes above 7000 and the S P eclipses 2700   Stocks pushed higher today as a snag free weekend provided investors calm that the tax bill will get done  I would put it at a 99  probability that a bill is singed by the end of the year  Markets were comforted by that notion and continued their bullish trek higher   said Jeremy Mullin in Counterstrike

	Insider Trader   Every time I see the data and it doesn t show people pouring into the stock market  I get giddy  Because that means we still have a way to go before this stock market turns bubblicious   Remember  bull markets don t just fizzle out  They end in a blaze of glory  They end with speculation and greed 
	 We re just in a normal bull market right now  It s not any different than that of the 1980s and early to mid 1990s      Tracey Ryniec Momentum Trader   Perhaps the most boring rally I ve seen in quite some time hit the stock market today  I figured it would be a slow news day as my train was pretty much empty on the way in  It s that time of year where people try to ditch the office to go Christmas shopping  Traders on the street pretty much dialed it in early in the morning then put things on autopilot  We gapped up at the open and remained pinned near the start for most of the session 
	 Expect to see volume start to subside over the next few days  We may get one huge  big volume day celebrating anything that happens on Capitol Hill but I wouldn t expect much more than that  If the sideways movement today was any indication of what the week will bring then it will be a bit of a snoozer      Dave Bartosiak

134549,356064,PRU,Is Prudential Financial  PRU  A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Prudential Financial  Inc    NYSE PRU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Prudential Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Prudential Financial s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Prudential Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 1  which is in line with the current level  Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company s current share price P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Prudential Financial has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years PRU is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Prudential Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Prudential Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Prudential Financial is 1 4  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 5  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 2  which is better than the industry average of 11 5  Clearly  PRU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Prudential Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F  This gives PRU a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter as well as the full year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Prudential Financial  Inc  Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePrudential Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 38  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks

134571,356086,PRU,5 Value Picks With Amazingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is by far the most widely used metric in the value investing world due to its simplicity  Many prefer to take the P E route in their quest for stocks that are trading at attractive prices  But even this ubiquitously used equity valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations Is EV EBITDA a Better Substitute to P E While P E is the most commonly used tool for evaluating a firm s value  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA works even better  The ratio is often viewed as a better alternative to P E as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA determines the total value of a company while P E solely considers its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Simply put  it is the total value of a firm The other component of the ratio  EBITDA is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the better it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another limitation of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and also can be used to value entities that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements Thus  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio  the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that

for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the better it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another limitation of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and also can be used to value entities that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements Thus  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and

134609,356124,PRU,Prudential Financial  PRU  Is A Strong Value Stock,opinion,"Today  investors often place their faith in stocks that they think are poised to grow exponentially in both the near and long term  This often leaves growth minded investors fixated on stocks such as Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Facebook   NASDAQ FB    which continue on their meteoric climbs 
Yet  at a time when many investors target superior growth often in favor of many other metrics value investing can still be a solid way to invest 
A company that currently presents great value for investors is Prudential Financial   NYSE PRU   
Let s take a look at Prudential s most recent quarterly results and more of the financial firm s current fundamentals to help investors gauge whether they want to consider Prudential  LON PRU  stock at this time 
Fundamentals 
Prudential posted its third quarter results last week  The firm reported earnings of  3 01 per share  which beat Wall Street expectations and also marked a 13 2  year over year gain  Prudential s revenues jumped over 10  to hit  13 4 billion  also read    
Prudential is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system 
One of the first major value indicators many investors often point to is a company s price to earnings ratio  Prudential is currently trading at 10 92x earnings  which marks big discount compared to the  Insurance   Multi line  industry s average 
On top of its solid PE ratio  Prudential s 0 84 price to sales ratio is also strong and comes in well below its industry s 1 07 average  The firm s P S ratio also marks a discount compared to some of its biggest competitors  such as AIG   NYSE AIG    Prudential s P B ratio of 0 84 is also a major discount compared to the industry and helps boost the firm s overall value based resume 
Along with these valuation metrics  Prudential currently presents a decent dividend yield of 2 68  Prudential Financial  Inc  PS Ratio  TTM    Shares of Prudential have gained almost 30  over the last year  and 5 45  during the last 12 weeks 
And just so investors don t leave thinking that Prudential is only a value investment  the company rocks an  A  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system to help it earn an overall VGM grade of an  A  
The company s Q4 earnings are expected to gain 3 56   based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Prudential s EPS is projected to jump nearly 13  for the full year

134615,356130,PRU,Prudential  PRU  And Units  Ratings Retained By Moody s,opinion,Prudential Financial  Inc    NYSE PRU   and its life insurance units  ratings were reiterated by Moody s Investors Service  The rating agency affirmed the long term debt ratings of Prudential  LON PRU  and the A1 insurance financial strength  IFS  ratings of its lead operating company   Prudential Insurance Company of America   along with other affiliated US life insurance units  together knows as PICA   Also  the outlook for such ratings was changed from stable to positive Ratings Representation of Prudential and its UnitsThe ratings representation of Prudential and its units represent the group s strong foothold and franchise in the U S  life and retirement market  boasting top 10 positions in numerous product markets  Additionally  the ratings also signify solid regulatory capital levels coupled with an internal capital protection framework during pressure situations The positive outlook denotes the company s efforts and progress in lowering high levels of debt and leverage Notably  consistent decline in leverage and the realization of perpetually stronger  less volatile earnings  can lead to an upgrade of the group s ratings  This apart  enhanced credit profile of the Japanese operations and increase in cash flow diversity  which is available to the holding company  could also result in the ratings upgrade On the flip side  stabilization of PICA s ratings  owing to substantial one time charges or other factors  deterioration in the credit portfolio of the Japanese operations and total leverage remaining at 40  are a few of the factors that can change the outlook from positive to stable Factors Resulting in PICA s Ratings UpgradeSome of the factors that can lead to PICA s ratings upgrade are GAAP return on capital for the U S  life insurance operations in the high single digits and a continued lowering of earnings volatility along with total consolidated leverage at Prudential moving toward 30  Factors Likely to Change PICA s OutlookHowever  total consolidated leverage at Prudential remaining at 40  and consolidated GAAP earnings coverage remaining of less than 8x or cash coverage of less than 5x  are a couple of factors that that can change PICA s outlook from positive to stable Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investors  confidence and maintaining a stock s credit worthiness  On the other hand  rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances  We believe that such ratings will help Prudential retain investors  trust and write more businesses going forward Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementPrudential holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU    PRU  moved higher following the election last fall  By early December though it had stalled and started to move sideways  That continued in a tight range for 2 and a half months until a push higher  It topped again at the end of February and pulled back to the same support area  This would be the range for the next 5 months until a break below 2 weeks ago  It was a minor break down  and has come back to retest the break level Friday  From here we look for a push back into the range and towards the top or a reversal to head lower towards 84 
Momentum looks to be turning back up with the RSI rising off of the oversold level and the MACD turning toward a cross up  These would support a move higher  There is resistance at 103 and 105 50 followed by 109 65 and the top of the channel at 115 20  Support lower sits at 101 and 99 25 followed by 96 and 89 40 before 85 50 and 82 75  Short interest is low at 1 2  and the company is expected to report earnings next November 1st 
The September options chain shows open interest on the put side from 95 to 110  But the sum total of that is less than half of the open interest at the 115 strike on the call side  October options are still building and have little open interest  The December chain  the first after the next earnings report  show small open interest on the put side centered on the 105 strike  and spread from 110 to 120 on the call side

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with Jackson Hole behind and looking ahead to the Labor Day weekend at the end of next week saw the equity markets improved  but still lacking strength 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate at 1300 in its uptrend while Crude Oil drifts higher slowly  The US Dollar Index remains weak and better to the downside while US Treasuries are biased to continue higher  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue higher after a big break out and Emerging Markets are better to the upside working through long term resistance 
Volatility looks to remain low putting the bias back higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts are all looking good on the longer timeframe but mixed in the shorter timeframe  The QQQ is the strongest and is consolidating  while the SPY continues to be at some risk for further pullback  and the IWM is reversing but the weakest  under its 200 day SMA  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

the proceeds to refinance an 8 9  junior subordinated note issue worth  600 million that is scheduled to mature before 2018  The funds will also be utilized to repay  partly  medium term notes as well as for general corporate purposes The approach by Prudential to capitalize on the still low interest rate environment to procure funds appears prudent  Also  this might lower the interest burden on borrowings  facilitating margin expansion The company exited the last reported quarter with its debt balance rising 1 2  from the 2016 end level  Long term debt to equity ratio was 0 36  up 30 basis points  With the new issuance  the long term debt to equity ratio would  improve by 2 basis points The company s long term credit rating reflects robust operating performance in its key business segments along with diversified earnings and strong liquidity position  According to A M  Best  the company has always resorted to utilizing a significant amount of debts  The recent issuance would increase the existing amount of debts Moody s also stated that Baa1 senior as well as A1 insurance financial strength rating of its U S  life insurance operating companies are driven by the group s solid market position and leading presence in the pension risk transfer market  However  these positives are weighed on by the company s size despite various initiatives to simply the structure and

134681,356196,PRU,Will Prudential Financial  PRU  Be A Suitable Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Prudential Financial  Inc    NYSE PRU   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Prudential Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 40  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 52  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Prudential Financial s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 9 00 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months   Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance  Multi Line industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Prudential Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 37  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Prudential Financial has a P S ratio of about 0 84  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 18 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Prudential Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Prudential Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Prudential Financial is 1 22  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 38  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 14  better than the industry average of 7 06  Clearly  PRU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Prudential Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives PRU a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Further  the company s recent earnings estimates have quite encouraging  The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision  while the next year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has risen by 0 3  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has climbed 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Prudential Financial  Inc  Price and Consensus   However  this positive trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nonetheless  the definite bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock s growth story is intact Bottom LinePrudential Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 28   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Further  over the past six months  the Zacks classified Insurance   Multi Line industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy    Last year  it was generating  8 billion in global

Stock Market Rattled Wednesday   New Research Reports 

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Pfizer  NYSE           Home Depot  NYSE         and ConocoPhillips  NYSE           These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see     

	A brief comment about today s market action is in order before we discuss the featured analyst reports  Stocks appeared immune to the Washington drama for a while  but have started taking note of the issue in today s issue  This isn t helping stocks or the dollar  though safe haven trades into treasuries and gold are doing better  The key question that market participants are grappling with is the future of the Trump Agenda in the current backdrop of a never ending cycle of crises  If the administration is unable to lead Congress into enacting tax reforms and other pro growth measures  then we probably need to get ready for the market to retrace its steps to the pre election level 

	As a reference  the S P 500 index is up  12  in the post election period while the Russell 2000 index is up  15 7  

Today s Featured Stock Research Reports 

Pfizer shares have underperformed the peer group as well as the broader market over the past year  the stock is down  1 7  over the last one year vs  a  4 6  increase for the Zacks Large Cap Pharma industry   15 8  gain for the S P 500 index  on continued drug pricing uncertainty that have refused to go away even after the election  These headwinds notwithstanding  the Zacks analyst is pointing out that Pfizer is strengthening its product portfolio as well as pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals  Also  cost savings and share buybacks should help Pfizer achieve its earnings guidance  While the Hospira acquisition has significantly expanded Pfizer s sterile injectable and biosimilar capabilities  the Medivation deal has strengthened its cancer franchise by adding Xtandi to its portfolio   You can         

Home Depot sharesare up  16 3  in the year to date period  outperforming the Zacks Retail sector  up  13 2   and the broader market  S P 500 up  7 5   in that same time period   Improving customer experience  solid execution and consistent housing market recovery helped the company post an earnings surprise in first quarter fiscal 2017  retaining the four year long trend of beating earnings estimates  The company s relentless focus on offering innovative products  boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off  Moreover  the company raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 while retaining its sales view  On the flip side  market participants can justifiably raise valuation concerns  particularly following the stock s stellar recent performance   You can         

ConocoPhillips  shares are down  5 9  in the year to date period  roughly in line with the Zacks Energy sector s performance in the same time period  on weakness in oil prices  During the first quarter of this year  the company s loss per share narrowed considerably while its top line beat estimates  This was owing to improved commodity price realizations and increased production  But the quarterly loss compared unfavorably with estimates for the January March quarter  Higher expenses  along with normal field declines and dispositions  led to the underperformance  However  the company s plan to reposition its asset base by divesting low margin assets and using the sale proceeds to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders is proceeding nicely  The company decided to divest its interest in the San Juan Basin   rich in natural gas   for a consideration of almost  3 billion  The accord reflects ConocoPhillips  intention to lower its exposure to the U S  natural gas business  which has been less profitable in recent years   You can

Tap 5 Bargain Stocks with Amazingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios 

	The price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by value investors as a useful yardstick for working out the fair market value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit of a portfolio of stocks with bargain prices  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings Is EV EBITDA a Better Substitute 
	While the widespread use of P E stems from its simplicity  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better approach as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA determines the total value of a firm while P E just considers its equity portion 
	Also referred to as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In essence  it is the total value of a firm 
	The other component  EBITDA  gives a better understanding of a company s profitability as it strips out the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings 
	Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more alluring it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued 
	EV EBITDA also takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E does not  This is why EV EBITDA is typically used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks sporting low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another major drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front 
	EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt 
	However  EV EBITDA is not devoid of limitations  The ratio alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements 
	As such  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks Screening Criteria

134762,356277,PRU,Wells Fargo Shares Inches Higher,opinion,"American Banking Giant To Stop Broker Bonuses And Mortgages Programs In The Middle Of  185 Million Fine Recovery As Bank Faces More Charges
In an effort to lessen the damage of the   the bank has now announced that they would not be offering broker bonuses and other programs and products 
One of the products which would not be offered any longer by the bank is their mortgage program  The bank recently suffered a huge setback after the bank s actions regarding their target sales quotas imposed on their employees resulted in a  185 million suit 
Although it has announced that it would be taking full responsibility of the said fine  Wells Fargo is now facing another set of claims and accusations this time in connection to clients being signed into Prudential Financial Inc  NYSE PRU  
The Securities and Exchange Commision have also placed the banking giant recently under questioning to whether how Wells Fargo s portfolio has been placed under valuing and accounting before the bank supplied more the agency more information leading it to end its interrogation  Back in October  the bank has defended itself stating that the portfolio was affected by their own loan modification actions  Aside from those efforts  certain economic events or changes also impacted Wells Fargo s loan change efforts 
Wells Fargo Shares For The Past Month
For the past couple of weeks  shares of American bank Wells Fargo   Co have dropped on news that the bank is to be fined by almost  185 million by the Los Angeles City and Country along with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau s Civil Penalty Fund  and the Office of the Comptroller in connection to a scandal the bank faced  The scandal which led to lawsuits being filed against the management of the bank was claims of the bank employees opening unauthorized accounts through the use of existing client information without their knowledge 
By November  Wells Fargo shares have recovered by as much as 15  from a total of 16 5  decline following the scandal signaling a recovery  The results of the U S  presidential elections also contributed to the recovery of the ailing bank  Wells Fargo also turned into an oversold stock a couple of days after the U S  elections as markets absorbed what a Trump presidency could affect financial stocks including Wells Fargo 

The unauthorized accounts were also charged to the client s existing savings or credit card accounts without their knowledge  Wells Fargo s market capitalization then dropped leading them to place only second as the biggest bank in the U S  next to JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  
On the bank s announcement that they would be paying the  41 million part of the fine  shares of Well Fargo rallied by as much as 2 8  before it slumped down to as much as 2 3  again last Wednesday on the news of the situation in connection with Prudential Financial Inc  NYSE PRU  life  Although it has recovered up from a low trading price around  43 55  it has returned and gained momentum again to as much as  55 19 
Wells Fargo shares are now trading at around  55 19 a long way up from its recent decline a month ago around the  43 level  The massive oversell in Wells Fargo shares gave the banking giant more chances to redeem themselves from the massive scandal that dethroned them as the top bank with the largest market cap in the U S  The market s attention to the upcoming administration is also set to divert the attention placed on the scandal away from the bank ",2016-12-16,FSM News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wells-fargo-shares-inches-higher-200169970,200169970

134852,356367,PRU,Why Shares Of MetLife Inc   MET  Are Down Today,opinion,"Shares of MetLife Inc    NYSE MET    the largest U S  life insurer  were down around 9  Thursday after the release of its second quarter 2016 earnings report  which carried some pretty poor results and negative statements from the company 
MetLife posted second quarter EPS of  0 83  far below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 39  a miss of 39   Earnings dropped a staggering 47  for the quarter when compared to the same period last year  MetLife also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Revenue of  17 07 billion  as it posted revenues of  16 95 billion  This represented a decline of 2 4  year over year 
The insurance company also announced that it plans to cut expenses by 11   as low interest rates continue to squeeze investment income  During its second quarter  MetLife s total operating expenses increased 4 5  year over year to  15 7 billion 
The company s plan is to reduce annual costs by about  1 billion by the end of 2019  which will include job cuts  according to Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian  though he did not specify how many workers will be dismissed  According to its most recent annual report for 2015 the company had 69 000 total employees 
Central bank policies to keep interest rates low have reduced the income MetLife makes on a bond dominated portfolio that s valued at more than  500 billion   In light of the significant headwinds our industry is facing  MetLife must do even more to avoid simply running in place   Kandarian said   We know this will require us to reduce headcount  which is never an easy step for an organization to take  Our overall goal is to be more efficient  so that we can better serve our customers and provide a fair return to shareholders  
Bottom Line
Low interest rates around the world continue to pressure companies in the financial industry  which includes insurance providers like MetLife  AllState   NYSE ALL    and Prudential   NYSE PRU    as well as banks and lending corporations  This is MetLife s second large drop in share price in the past few months  as it also took a major tumble after the Brexit decision earlier this summer  The company can still get by in a low rate environment such as the one we re currently seeing  but it will not be easy  as such conditions aren t conducive to the company s business 
MetLife is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   and shares of the company are down more than 18  since the start of the year ",2016-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-shares-of-metlife-inc.-(met)-are-down-today-200146165,200146165
134869,356384,PRU,Equities Higher Ahead Of Yellen Speech,opinion,"A firmer dollar pretty much across the board  with the exception of the Aussie and the kiwi during the Asian session  with risk sentiment fairly limited  With global terrorism activities still commanding the headlines  this is not that surprising 
USD JPY extended gains to 113 73 for the first time since March 16th as Prime Minister Abe is expected to announce a delay in sales tax increases in order to avoid a new wave of panic among the Japanese consumers  which could further harm inflation and inflation expectations  As Japanese yields dig deeper into negative territory  the Nikkei warned that  negative rates are beginning to bite the BoJ   The Nikkei share average fell 0 2   but given the weakness in the yen this may be a sign of some bottoming 
We continue to see oscillation in FOMC speculation  and given that overnight US macro data revealed that consumer spending practically stagnated while inflation stepped back  any notion that the Fed will tighten further in the near term is for now muted  This leaves the US economy growing at a pace of less than 1  
Last week s CFTC report showed that net dollar longs declined  which may help account for some of the short lived bounces in commodities of late too  Oil prices are down 1  in early trade  giving credence to the idea that much of the rise was as a result of short covering  Given that we have seen a lot of positive correlation between equities and oil prices of late  it remains to be seen if the present upside in European indices can be sustained 
Yet another day where global terrorism is dominating the headlines  but financial markets have maintained composure and are effectively climbing that wall of worry  The FTSE is up 0 66  while the CAC and the DAX have added 1 1  and 0 76  respectively 
Financials are the outperformers this morning  According to Bloomberg  lenders are charging higher interest rates for London luxury homes   all this does is tell you that the market is oversupplied and quite likely on the road to weaker prices  but investors are cheering the potential profit margins nevertheless

Copper  per last Thursday s note  has failed to push through the 200 day moving average at  2 27 lb  Any break below  2 20 oz would negate the recent rally and put the trend on the back foot

134894,356409,PRU,Sector Detector  Earnings Take Center Stage As The Fed Returns,opinion,Earnings season is now officially underway  but the Fed is still holding the limelight  as traders anxiously awaited on Wednesday the FOMC minutes from the June 18 19 meeting  Although several members are pushing to begin tapering off this fall on asset purchases  bonds and mortgage backed securities   which spooked the markets  in fact it now appears that the controlling opinion is that the U S  economy is a long way from demonstrating sufficient evidence of accelerating and sustainable growth  Thus  asset purchases likely will continue through 2014 If you noticed the afterhours trading action on Wednesday  both stocks and bonds spiked up big time  The SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY  and the iShares Barclay s 20  Year Treasury Bond Fund  TLT  closed afterhours up 0 91  and 1 56   respectively  That s because Chairman Bernanke told the National Bureau of Economic Research after his speech late in the day that because unemployment remains high and inflation is below the Fed s target  quant easing is still necessary  He also opined that the recovery is being hindered by higher taxes and the sequester  mandatory Federal budget cuts   So  he essentially has tried to remove the Fed from the daily discussion Mortgage REITs have been dumped by the truckload since the Fed announced their willingness to consider tapering  Just take a look at the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped  REM  which has fallen nearly 20  since May 1 from its recent 52 week highs  However  REM also was up 1 50  afterhours on Wednesday The Fed is between a rock and hard place on mortgage rates  which already have jumped 45  in the past six weeks  They don t want rates to rise so much that they kill the golden goose of a recovering housing market that has helped drive consumer spending  i e   the wealth effect created by low mortgage rates and rising housing prices  This is another reason the Fed is likely to continue asset purchases through much of 2014 So  with the Fed apparently back in the equities fold  did it ever really leave    global investors now can turn their focus on all the other reasons to be bullish on U S  stocks  For one  there is optimism about corporate earnings  Although over 120 S P 500 companies have issued earnings pre announcements  the bar has been set low and is primed for earnings beats  and the S P 500 likely will surpass  25 per share for the second straight quarter  and their coffers are loaded with cash for buybacks and M A  Valuations aren t quite so low after the big run up  but they re not yet too high either  and in fact rising multiples reflect improving confidence in the economy  which makes sense given the challenges faced by the rest of the world  However  top line growth will be essential going forward  given the reliance so far on cost cutting and productivity gains Second  bonds look riskier than stocks as the economy strengthens  We have already seen bond prices plummet on the slightest whiff of Fed tapering  Dividend paying equities are the likely beneficiaries of this rotation Third  the bullish uptrend remains firmly in place  unless a major shock to the system occurs  which is unlikely  I discuss chart patterns in more detail below Fourth  the U S  is gradually heading toward energy independence  which was once considered unthinkable  We are on course to produce more oil than Saudi Arabia by the end of the decade  and we are already the  Saudi Arabia  of natural gas reserves In addition  although we hear a lot about the heavily populated coastal states dealing with massive budget deficits  insurmountable pension obligations  crippling tax rates  high unemployment  and flight of the wealthy  the American heartland is enjoying an exemplary resurgence and impressive economic growth Best bet is to invest in companies that can thrive amid rising interest rates and a strong dollar Looking at the chart of the SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY   it closed Wednesday at 165 19  It has made an impressive recovery above 160 following the disastrous breakdown caused by the Fed s noises about tapering  SPY was consolidating its gains last week in what I described as a symmetrical triangle that could break either way this week  The verdict is now in  and the break was to the upside  back above the long standing uptrend line from last November  and now SPY finds itself up against resistance from the June highs  Oscillators like RSI and Slow Stochastic are looking a tad oversold  but MACD could run further before a technical breather sets in  In any case  I see no indication of an imminent selloff from this point Another chart to behold is the small cap Russell 2000 Index  It set yet another all time high on Wednesday to close above 1020  after finally busting through psychological round number resistance at 1000 last Friday  Leaders have been  new age  service companies like Yelp  YELP  and Overstock com  OSTK   It is a bullish sign when small caps are breaking out Furthermore  the consumer discretionary stocks have taken a leadership role  In particular  if you look at the past three months  the iShares US Consumer Services ETF  IYC  has a virtually identical chart to the Russell 2000  It is a bullish sign when consumer cyclicals are breaking out The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 14 21  which is back in the zone of complacency below 15 that we saw for most of the earlier part of the year Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  business sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations 1  Technology  IYW  remains in the top spot with a robust Outlook score of 92  Stocks within IYW display a low forward P E  a solid long term projected growth rate  and the best return ratios  Although Wall Street analysts aren t highly optimistic about their earnings projections  they aren t doing much downgrading  either  Financial  IYF  to take the second spot with a score of 74  as stocks within IYF enjoy the best Wall Street support  a forward P E  and strong insider sentiment  Healthcare  IYH  is third with a 65  Notably  Consumer Services  IYC  has joined the top five on the strength of improving analyst sentiment and the highest long term projected growth rate 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 5  Although stocks within IYZ enjoy relatively stable analyst support  they are generally weak in all other factors  including a high forward P E  low long term projected growth  and poor return ratios  Also in the bottom two this week is Basic Materials  IYM  at 17  Materials stocks continue to be hammered with downward earnings revisions from Wall Street 3  This week s fundamentals based rankings remain slightly on the bullish side of the fence  particularly given the improving scores in Financial  IYF  and Consumer Services  IYC   and the robust Outlook score of 92 for Technology  IYW   But it would be better to see higher scores in Industrial  IYJ  and Materials  IYM   A major concern is the general lack of positive Wall Street sentiment for any of the sectors  with the exception of IYF  which saw a slight uptick in earnings projections 4  Looking at the Bull scores  IYF has been the leader on particularly strong market days  scoring 58  followed closely by IYJ  while IYZ scores the lowest at 47  The top bottom spread is still a narrow 11 points  indicating relatively high sector correlations  and only two sectors are scoring below 50  This high sector correlation indicates more of a  risk on risk off  approach in which all boats are lifted together  rather than a thoughtful stock picking approach  so I d rather see a wider top bottom spread 5  Looking at the Bear scores  IYW remains the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 53  which is not a particularly impressive score  In the past we have seen defensive sector Utilities  IDU  with a Bear score close to 70  IYM scores the lowest during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 43  The top bottom spread is still only 10 points  which indicates relatively high sector correlations on weak market days  Again  I d rather see a wider top bottom spread 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 195  Telecom  IYM  is the by far the worst at 97  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Industrial  IYJ  displays the highest score of 106  which indicates good relative performance in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Telecom  IYZ  scores the lowest at 92  which indicates investor avoidance during extreme conditions These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Financial sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Some top ranked stocks within IYW and IYF include CommVault Systems  CVLT   Western Digital  WDC   Prudential Financial  PRU   and Everest Re Group  RE  As a reminder  Sabrient s annual  portfolio of top stocks for 2013 continues to perform well  It is up over  22  from the portfolio s inception on January 11 through July 3 led by Genworth Financial  GNW   up  53   Seagate Technology  STX   up  38   EPL Oil   Gas  EPL   up  34   and Jazz Pharmaceuticals  JAZZ   up  32   In fact  all 13 stocks are positive  and 12 are up by double digits  while the S P 500 is up only  12  over the same timeframe  Note that a there is a web site called  that publishes a performance comparison of several prominent firms  top stocks for the year  and Sabrient s once again leads them all  in spite of our late start on January 11  to coincide with the launch of a unit investment trust for this portfolio   Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2013-07-10,Scott

134922,356437,PRU,Goldman Sachs May Rise To  133 In January 2013 ,opinion,We have been trying to build a preliminary pricing model for Goldman Sachs  GS  since 2008  This company was included in our study of   All in all  the model was not stable over time and the prediction for 2009 was not fully correct  Originally  the stock price was defined by the index of housing operations  HO  and that of food away from home  SEFV     we presented an updated model as based on the CPIs available till November 2010 and the December monthly closing  adjusted for splits and dividends  price of GS  In the updated model  the defining CPIs are the index of other food at home  OFH  and the housing index  H   Thus  the difference between the preliminary and the updated model was not too large because the pairs of defining indices are very close  Here we present a revised model  which includes new data obtained since December 2010  The revised model shows that GS share may grow to  133 from its current level of  118  This might be a good long idea together with that for Prudential Financial  PRU   The concept of share pricing based on the link between  has been under development since 2008  In the very beginning  we found a statistically reliable relationship between   CPI  in the United States  Then we extended the pool of defining CPIs to 92 and estimated quantitative models for all companies from the S P 500  The extended model described the evolution of a share price as a weighted sum of two individual consumer price indices selected from this large set of CPIs  We allow only two defining CPIs  which may lead the modeled share price or lag behind it  The intuition behind the lags is that some companies are price setters and some are price takers  The former should influence the relevant CPIs  which include goods and services these companies produce  The latter lag behind the prices of goods and services they are associated with  In order to calibrate the model relative to the starting levels of the involved indices and to compensate sustainable time trends  some indices are subject to secular rise or fall  we introduced a linear time trend and constant term  In its general form  the pricing model is as follows  sp tj     bi CPIi tj ti    c  tj 2000     d   ej   1  where sp tj  is the share price at discrete  calendar  times tj  j 1   J  CPIi tj ti  is the i th component of the CPI with the time lag ti  i 1    I  I 2 in all our models   bi  c and d are empirical coefficients of the linear and constant term  ej is the residual error  whose statistical properties have to be scrutinized  By definition  the bets fit model minimizes the RMS residual error  It is a fundamental feature of the model that the lags may be both negative and positive  In this study  we limit the largest lag to eleven months  System  1  contains J equations for I 2 coefficients  We start our model in July 2003 and the share price time series has more than 100 points  To resolve the system  standard methods of matrix inversion are used  A model is considered as a reliable one when the defining CPIs are the same during the previous eight months  This number and the diversity of CPI subcategories are both crucial parameter  For example  Table 1 lists defining parameters for GS between March and October 2012  For each month  the best model is based on the same defining CPIs   the consumer price index of food and beverages  F  and the index of owners  rent of primary residence  ORPR  In all cases  the lags are the same  three and two months  respectively  Other coefficients and the standard error suffer just slight oscillations or drifts  e g  c and d   It is important to stress again that all models for months except October also include those with future CPIs relative to the given month  Table 1 confirms that no future CPIs drive the share price in March 2012  The best fir model is always based on the past values of F and ORPR  at least since March 2012  Figure 1 depicts the overall evolution of both involved consumer price indices  F and ORPR  It also presents the evolution of two defining indices from the previous model  the index of other food at home  OHF  which is a part of F  and the index of housing  H  with ORPR representing a part of H  The OHF and H indices provided the best fit model between March 2010 and December 2010  The best fit models for GS t  are as follows  GS t     11 06OFH t   11 06H t 12    1 82 t 2000    99 4  December 2010 GS t     13 79F t 3   11 03ORPR t 2    29 93 t 2000    33 75  October 2012  The predicted curve in Figure 2 leads the observed price by two months  The residual error is of  14 52 for the period between July 2003 and October 2012  The price of a GS share is relatively well defined by the behaviour of the two defining CPI components  Figure 2 also depicts the high and low monthly prices for the same period  which illustrate the intermonth variation of the share price
