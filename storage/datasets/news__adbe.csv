7211,228726,ADBE,Stocks   Nasdaq Tops 8 900 as Rally Rolls On,news,"Investing com   Stocks hit record intraday and closing highs Friday  and the Nasdaq Composite Index topped 8 900 for the first time as the December market rally continued 
The Nasdaq closed up 0 42  at about 8 925 on a day when stocks shot higher at the open and basically stayed there  The gain puts the 9 000 level within reach  
The S P 500 Index closed up 0 49  at 3 221  with strength in consumer staples  energy  health care and technology stocks 
The Dow Jones industrials jumped nearly 232 points at the open  but the index gave up about two thirds of its gain  primarily on weakness in Boeing  NYSE BA  and   Nike    NYSE NKE   The blue chips ended up 0 28   or 78 points  at 28 455
Boeing  NYSE BA  was down 1 65  after United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL  said it is taking off flights using the 737 Max jetliner until at least June 4  Spirit Aerosystems Holdings  NYSE SPR  was told by Boeing to halt production of new 737 Max fuselages until the plane is recertified  Spirit shares fell about 1   Investors also appeared dismayed when a Boeing built unmanned capsule failed to reach its proper orbit on its first standalone launch  The capsule is a key to returning Americans to space using U S  made equipment 
Boeing s loss to  328 cut the Dow s gain by more than 37 points 
 Nike   NYSE NKE  fell back 1 2  because the stocks had had a big recent run that made a modest miss in third quarter gross profit margin a reason to sell 
The overall market was cheered by continued hopes that the U S  China trade deal would come together  In addition  the Commerce Department reported better than expected gains in personal income and spending in November 
Some 308 stocks hit 52 week highs on the day  Among these were 10 Dow stocks  including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   In addition  a number of big tech stocks hit new highs  including Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE   Autodesk  NASDAQ ADSK  and Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  
The next two weeks will see lower volumes as traders and investors take time off for the holidays 
The S P finished the week with a 1 65  gain  The Dow added 1 14   while the Nasdaq moved up 2 18  
For the year  the S P 500 is up nearly 29   with the Nasdaq up more than 34  and the Dow up 22  
So far in December  the S P is up 2 55   which would be its best December since 2004  The Nasdaq is up 2 99   also its best showing since December 2004  The Dow s December gain is 1 44  
But what a difference from December 2018 when the S P fell 6 2   the Nasdaq dropped 9 5  and the Dow fell 8 66   
All that said  the relative strength indexes for the S P 500 and Nasdaq  which can help gauge a market trend s strength  ended the day above 75  That s a clear signal that a selloff is coming at some point 
Oil prices moved lower  but interest rates were pulled higher by the rally in stocks 
West Texas intermediate crude fell 74 cents to  60 44 a barrel  Brent crude  the global benchmark  dropped 40 cents to  66 14

7212,228727,ADBE,Forget store traffic and bag count  Gauging retail performance in an online world,news,"By Melissa Fares NEW YORK  Reuters    Marshal Cohen has religiously visited the same stores every holiday season since 1999   But rather than snapping up bargains and favorite gifts for friends and family  the chief retail industry adviser is there to scrutinize the purchasing habits of others as online shopping upends the retail business  Major shifts in consumer behavior and preferences have forced Cohen  who works for market research firm NPD Group  and other retail analysts to approach their jobs very differently than two decades ago   If you were to try and replicate research methodology  or even store observation  in today s world  you ve got a problem   Cohen told Reuters   It s no longer good enough to just look at store traffic or parking lot counts   Cohen and his peers need to get it right because their insights  reported to investors and retail clients  influence marketing  move share prices and guide investment decisions  A record number of U S  consumers spending more online  coupled with a condensed holiday shopping season and year round discount wars among retailers  has forced analysts to get creative  with many shifting away from old school tactics to measure a company s overall performance  Instead of simply asking shoppers why they left a store empty handed  analysts are probing the effect of online giant Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   asking whether customers started Christmas shopping in July on Prime Day  now a major event in the annual retail calendar to rival Thanksgiving weekend s Black Friday  Calculation of sales per square foot is giving way to a tally of how many Instagram native  exclusive and private fashion brands are offered on a retailer s sales floor and website  and analysts    rather than simply seeing how many bags a shopper leaves with    are now counting how many younger millennial and Gen Z shoppers frequent a store and whether they make a purchase   Craig Johnson of Consumer Growth Partners says that traditional metrics such as foot traffic  average selling price  and average basket size can often still be highly indicative of what s happening in stores  But other retail analysts said online shopping and a slew of services like  buy online  pick up in store  can hinder the ability to estimate a retailer s conversion rate   a traditional measure of the proportion of visitors who make purchases  Brian Field  senior director of global retail consulting for ShopperTrak  part of retail data firm Sensormatic Solutions  said it was particularly difficult to figure out if traffic reported by retailers came from people buying items in store or shoppers picking up online orders   It is kind of synonymous with the fact that retailers are reporting blended sales  which include sales online and sales in store together   Field said    I think what it really boils down to is the customer journey has changed   it can start anywhere  in store  online and end anywhere   SUSPICIONS  When Marie Driscoll  Coresight Research s managing director of luxury and fashion  received an email from Saks Fifth Avenue less than a week before Black Friday alerting her that several small leather designer goods such as wallets were on sale  she took note  The department store  she thought  might have been struggling to sell such items  which are often given as gifts  Saks  owned by Hudson s Bay Company  disagreed   It would be flawed to gauge category performance based on customer emails  as the majority include personalized recommendations derived from a client s shopping preferences   a company spokesperson said  Consumer Growth Partners  Johnson keeps close tabs on how many fashion brands born on Instagram are on the sales floor when he visits  Nordstrom Inc   NYSE JWN  these days  That tells him whether the retailer is catering to young shoppers who search for labels on their smartphones  A source with knowledge of the matter said Nordstrom looks for opportunities to launch new brands and expand existing partnerships with limited distribution and emerging brands to differentiate their product line  FLYING BLIND  U S holiday retail sales during November and December are expected to increase by around 4  from 2018 to as much as  730 7 billion  according to the National Retail Federation  NRF    a percentage rise dwarfed by the 13 6  annual jump Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  Analytics has already seen in online sales between Nov  1 and Dec  19  to  125 6 billion  Smartphones accounted for 35 3  of that revenue  But analysts say retail companies are providing too little information too late  forcing them to draw conclusions from very limited data    You don t get the full holiday picture until months later   Until  the retailers  actually report  you re flying blind   said Charlie O Shea  who has worked as a retail analyst for Moody s for 17 years covering Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc   Target  Corp  NYSE TGT   and  Best Buy  Co Inc  NYSE BBY  among others   All the retailers talk about is sales   we need to know how much money you made   he added  O Shea says he sometimes uses third party sales data and Adobe Insights data for online numbers

139389,360904,ADBE,Why Adobe Stock Soared 45 8  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  climbed 45 8  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  That result trounced the S P 500 s 29  gain as the creative software specialist s cloud and subscription services continued to gain steam 
So what
Adobe mustered a more than 30  gain in the first half of last year on the heels of better than expected quarterly updates in March and June  In the press release that accompanied the second quarter report  CEO Shantanu Narayen pointed to an  explosion in creativity across the globe   as well as the company s efforts to build innovative software solutions with more  engaging customer experiences  

Between then and October  however  Adobe stock gave back about half its year to date gain as investors digested the implications of yet another solid quarterly report in September that was accompanied by seemingly tepid Q4 guidance relative to Wall Street s expectations  
But it turned out that the company s forecast had been conservative  Adobe ended the fiscal year with an exceptional fourth quarter report in mid December that handily beat both management s guidance and analysts  consensus targets  
All told  Adobe s revenues soared 24  in fiscal 2019 to  11 17 billion  spurred by a 22  increase in digital media segment revenue to  7 71 billion  and 31  growth from its digital experience products to  3 21 billion  Perhaps most impressive  Adobe exited the fiscal year with  8 4 billion in digital media annual recurring revenue  ARR   up from  6 71 billion in fiscal 2018 
Now what
Management signaled that it anticipated the momentum will largely continue in the 2020 fiscal year  issuing guidance for revenue to increase 17 7  to  13 15 billion    including net new digital media ARR of  1 55 billion    with adjusted net income of  9 75 per share  
Given management s propensity for low balling such targets  however  it should come as no surprise that Wall Street s consensus models already call for the company to slightly outpace its revenue and earnings forecasts  Barring a preliminary release in the next few weeks  we should receive our next update about where Adobe stands when it reports fiscal first quarter 2020 results around the middle of March 
For now  though  suffice it to say Adobe s shareholders should be more than pleased with the state of its business ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phfc9,2058134

139425,360940,ADBE,Your Money  Looking For Holiday Buys  Try E commerce ETFs ,news,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK  Reuters    First the bad news for your wallet  Americans are slated to spend more than they ever have this holiday season   around  730 billion in November and December  according to the National Retail Federation 
Online shopping alone is expected to amount to  143 7 billion over the last two months of the year  a 14 1  increase over last year  according to projections by Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  Analytics 
Now the good news  There is money to be made on the other side of that trade  
E commerce exchange traded funds are set up to capitalize on all those online transactions by gathering a bucket of stocks of companies like Amazon  O AMZN   eBay  O EBAY  and PayPal  O PYPL  and selling shares of them as a specialized ETF 
Top players include First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index  P FDN   Global X E commerce  O EBIZ   Amplify Online Retail  O IBUY  and International Online Retail  P XBUY   ProShares Online Retail  P ONLN   ProShares Long Online Short Stores  P CLIX  and SPDR S P Internet  P XWEB  
There is even a new index created by MSCI  https    a provider of analytics and solutions for financial firms  which identified the digital economy as one of its societal  Megatrends   That likely means that more such ETFs will be in the pipeline  since investment firms can now roll out their own e commerce ETFs based on that underlying index 
A few tips for investors who might be stuffing e commerce ETFs into their holiday stockings 
  Look under the hood 
Not all e commerce ETFs are built alike  Some are highly concentrated  and some are more diversified  so proceed according to your own risk tolerance 
ProShares Online Retail  for example  has almost a quarter of its entire assets in Amazon  and another 13  in Chinese Internet giant  Alibaba   N BABA   If you want to bet on the big winners   and Amazon has certainly been a big winner   that would be the way to go  said Todd Rosenbluth  head of ETF and mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA 
But Amplify s IBUY has Amazon making up only a more modest 3 4  of its portfolio  If you want to spread your bets more evenly throughout the space  that would be a more appropriate pick 
 Dig into the numbers 
Fees are any portfolio s silent killer  Concentrated ETFs may offer lower expense ratios than traditional mutual funds  but higher than broader exchange traded offerings   like  say  Vanguard s Total Stock Market ETF  P VTI   and its microscopic  03  fees 
In comparison  the relatively new Global X E Commerce comes with a  68  expense ratio  and ProShares Long Online Short Stores carries a similar  65  charge 
As for performance  e commerce ETFs have generally experienced a bumpy fall  thanks to trade wars and recession worries  IBUY  for instance  has outperformed the S P 500 on a two year timeframe  but underperformed year to date  While that offers a potential buying opportunity  ask yourself whether you are comfortable with an occasionally wild ride 
 Typically investors will find more volatility in narrower slices of the market like this   said Deborah Fuhr  founder and managing partner of independent London based ETF consultancy ETFGI 
 Expand your horizons 
The United States may be the 800 pound gorilla of e commerce  but there is money to be made outside its borders as well  To wit  the Emerging Markets Internet   Ecommerce  P EMQQ   suggested Fuhr  Its basket includes familiar Chinese names like Baidu  O BIDU  and Tencent  HK 0700   and boasts robust year to date returns of over 32  
  Consider size and scope 
In the ETF world there is a fair amount of churn  If small thematic funds do not manage to attract enough assets  they occasionally close up shop  So check the total assets and know that a fund s long term future is not guaranteed 
  Thematic ETFs are a complement  not a core 
Thematic ETFs are a nice complement to a more broadly diversified portfolio  But notes Rosenbluth   Investors shouldn t get carried away with them

139479,360994,ADBE,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com    It s Fed day  in more than just the usual way  The central bank is also due to carry out some fine tuning of a money market that has gone haywire in the last couple of days due to a complex interplay of short  and long term factors  And oil prices are settling back at lower levels after Saudi Arabia promised the world that it would be back to normal by the end of the month   Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  18th September 
1  Fed to join the global easing party 
The Federal Reserve is still   just about   expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its regular policy meeting which concludes later  As always  the policy statement will come at 2 PM ET  with Chairman Jerome Powell s press conference following at 2 30 PM 
Expectations of a cut have faded in recent days after some strong U S  data but the majority of market participants still expect action  According to Investing com s Fed rate monitor tool  the implied chance of a cut has fallen to barely 55  from nearly 100  as recently as the start of last week 
The Fed isn t the only central bank meeting  Brazil s central bank will also make its monetary policy announcement later in the day  Central banks from Frankfurt to India  Russia  China and Turkey have all dramatically loosened monetary policy in recent weeks to counter a global slowdown   
2  Feathers fly in the money market
The Fed s rate decision is likely to be overshadowed by some extraordinary turbulence in the short term money market over the last couple of days  which has seen overnight rates spike far higher than the targeted range of 2  to 2 25    
Analysts blame a combination of short term and structural factors for the volatility  demand for cash as spiked as companies prepare to meet their quarterly tax bills  the deadline for which was Sept  15   while a freshly settled auction of Treasuries has left the market short of cash at the same time  
However  some point to the fact that regulation introduced after the financial crisis has made it harder for banks to manage such liquidity risks  and made it harder for the Fed to judge the level of overall liquidity needed by the financial system 
The Fed is carrying out a second day of overnight  repos  today  to help bring short term rates back to the target range 
3  Stocks set to open lower
U S  stock indexes will be in holding mode until the Fed s decision but look set to open a touch lower in the meantime 
By 6 AM ET  Dow futures were down 27 points or 0 1   while S P 500 futures were also down 0 1  and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0 2  
The two traditional indices are still within touching distance of new all time highs  although the appetite for making new records may have weakened overnight after FedEx   NYSE FDX  reported a drop in profit in its fiscal first quarter and said full year earnings would fall much more steeply than initially forecast  It blamed its rift with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and the global economic slowdown  Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  shares also fell in after hours trading after the software company issued weak guidance for the year 
4  Oil retreats as Saudi says there ll be nothing to see here by month end
Oil prices have stabilized at lower levels overnight after Saudi Arabia said it will restore lost production by the end of September  Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman also said it has managed to restore supplies to customers to the levels they were at before the weekend attacks on its facilities by drawing from its inventories 
By 6 AM ET  WTI futures  the U S  crude benchmark  were at  58 59 a barrel  down 0 9  from late Tuesday and down over  4 from the peak that they hit in the immediate aftermath of the attacks   The international benchmark Brent was down 0 9  at  63 98 a barrel 
While the supply situation in the Gulf will hog the limelight for the near future   U S  government data on crude stocks are also due today  at 10 30 AM ET  The American Petroleum Institute s figures released on Tuesday suggested a surprise 592 000 barrel increase in inventories  The market is expecting a net drawdown of 2 5 million barrels 
5  Housing market update 
Away from the Fed  there will also be updates on the housing market in the form of building permit and housing starts data at 8 30 AM ET 
They come hot on the heels of another rise in the NAHB housing market index to its highest since October last year  a development helped by the recent drop in bond yields that has dragged down refinancing rates ",2019-09-18,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-1980540,1980540

139508,361023,ADBE,3 Things Under the Radar This Week,news,"1  Shale Production Momentum to Continue
U S  crude oil production remained at a very strong 12 4 million barrels per day last week  the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report 
That s up about 1 5 million bpd from the same period a year ago  with shale oil adding to strong U S  output 
And shale supply will continue to rise  hitting 14 5 million bpd by 2030  according to research firm Rystad Energy 
 In the past decade  crude oil coming from shale patches such as the Permian in the U S  has grown from a negligible contributor to an upstream behemoth  reshaping the industry and the oil market   Rystad said in a note this week 
The 14 5 million bpd level is based on Rystad s base case price scenario of an average price for WTI of  55 per barrel in 2019   54 in 2020 and 2021  and  57 in 2022 
At a flat  45 per barrel scenario  the firm sees a 2030 peak of 11 5 million bpd 
 Based on our analysis  the oil price would need to be as low as  42 per barrel WTI going forward for the 2030 U S   light tight oil  supply to be as low as EIA presents in their reference case   Rystad product manager Sonia Mlad  Passos said 
2  Value Stocks Reigned Supreme  but Sustained Rally Uncertain
Rotation  Rotation  Rotation 
Investors  go to plan to stay ahead of the boom and bust in markets saw value stocks make the list of fashionable investments this week  while high swinging growth stocks got the boot 
The iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF  NYSE VLUE  jumped 4  for the week  while the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor  NYSE MTUM  dropped 2  this week 
In the hunt for value  investors scooped up the cheapest stocks boasting the lowest price to earnings ratios like JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  or Deere  NYSE DE   while casting aside more expensive names like PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  and Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  
With stocks ending the week within touching distance of all time highs  the change in fortunes for value against momentum stocks suggests that investors may be growing nervous about frothy valuations  particularly in high flying tech names  which have largely driven the broader market higher 
But calls for value stocks to put together a sustained run higher and steal momentum s crown may be somewhat farfetched  as some doubted whether beaten down value names in sectors such as energy and financials would need to show meaningful growth to keep prying investment dollars away from momentum stocks in sectors such as tech 
 This  value  trade can work for a while  but it is hard to see it lasting for a while unless those groups   ike financials  energy and retail  really perform fundamentally   Kari Firestone  Aureus Asset Management CEO  told CNBC 
3  What percent 
President Donald Trump continued to rail against his own Federal Reserve this week  calling them  boneheads  for not cutting rates to zero  or below  
But over in Africa  Zimbabwe s central bank went the other way   big time 
The Zimbabwe central bank hiked its overnight borrowing rate to 70  from 50  as its currency plummeted on the heels of runaway inflation 
As the country faces a dearth of foreign investment following its introduction of the new Zimbabwe dollar in the middle of the year  its annual inflation rate has jumped into triple digits 
The inflation rate was officially 176  in June  lower than only Venezuela  according to Reuters  But analysts said the actual rate could be much higher now  particularly factoring in black market transactions 
The hope is the huge rate hike will stem the tide   
 Since the abolishment of the multicurrency system and re introduction of the Zimbabwe dollar in June 2019 as well as the upward reviewing of the Bank policy rate  the inflation pressures are expected to dissipate   Central Bank Governor John Mangudya said in a monetary policy statement this month   Both the annual and monthly inflation are expected to moderate over time  ",2019-09-14,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-1977778,1977778

139525,361040,ADBE,Adobe  ADBE  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Adobe Systems  ADBE  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Adobe basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Adobe  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Adobe
This software maker is expected to earn  9 80 per share for the fiscal year ending November  2020  which represents a year over year change of 24 5  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Adobe  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Adobe to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adobe-adbe-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200498721,200498721
139526,361041,ADBE,Adobe Systems  ADBE  Is Up 2 41  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Adobe Systems  ADBE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Adobe Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ADBE that show why this software maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ADBE  shares are up 2 41  over the past week while the Zacks Computer   Software industry is up 1 74  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 74  compares favorably with the industry s 4 97  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Adobe Systems have increased 29 53  over the past quarter  and have gained 47 35  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 11 27  and 28 99   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ADBE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ADBE is currently averaging 1 794 385 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ADBE 
Over the past two months  6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ADBE s consensus estimate  increasing from  9 76 to  9 80 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ADBE is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Adobe Systems on your short list ",2020-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adobe-systems-adbe-is-up-241-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200498725,200498725
139527,361042,ADBE,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Adobe  ADBE ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Adobe Systems  ADBE  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this software maker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 52 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 24 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 5  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Adobe is 9 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 7 4

interest rate cuts in July  September and October  helped boost consumers  purchasing power  Impressive holiday sales last season also added to the retail sector s growth Retail s Momentum to Continue

these industries witnessed lower job additions in November Picking the Right Retail FundConsidering the sector s growth last year and impressive new job additions in its final month  one could consider investing in retail  However  choosing the right mutual funds for one s portfolio can become cumbersome Let us  therefore  take a look at two mutual funds that invest in the retail sector and find out which of these is best suited to your portfolio Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary Portfolio The fund invests the majority of its assets in securities of companies that are engaged in manufacturing and distributing consumer discretionary products and services  The fund aims for capital appreciation and invests in securities of both U S  and non U S  issuers  FSCPX is a non

how this fund performed compared in its category  and other  1 and  2 Ranked Mutual Funds   The Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary Portfolio  as of the last filing  allocates its assets in top two major groups   High Yield Bond and Large Growth  Further  as of the last filing  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Home Depot  NYSE HD  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD  were the top holdings for FSCPX FSCPX carries a

FSRPXcarries a Zacks Mutual Rank  2  Buy  and was incepted on Dec 16  1985  It carries an expense ratio of 0 76   The fund requires no minimal initial investment ConclusionTaking a closer look at FSCPX and FSRPX  we find that despite being a riskier investment  the latter proves to be a better option  FSRPX may carry a Zacks Mutual Rank  2 but the fund has higher returns over the 3  and 5 year periods as compared to FSCPX  FSRPX carries a lower expense ratio as well While FSRPX has higher risk associated with it  three year beta of 1 16 against FSCPX s 1 15  it offers greater returns  Therefore  investors with a higher appetite for risk must go for FSRPX  This is because the prevalent market conditions are broadly encouraging and one would do well to bet on the fund Want key mutual

139570,361085,ADBE,4 Mutual Funds To Gain On High Holiday Season Sales,opinion,American consumers are on quite a shopping spree this holiday season  thanks to notable shopping trends and easy access to online shopping sites through various retail applications  A range of bargains and offers by brick and mortal stores have are also luring shoppers  After all  the strong economic backdrop  notable new jobs and steadily rising income are crucial factors driving sales Increased Online and Brick and Mortar SalesThis holiday season has been an impressive one for retail  with online sales growing since early November  according to a  by Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  Analytics  A shorter holiday season coupled with early shopping deals encouraged consumers to start splurging early In fact  American shoppers spent  50 1 billion online between Nov 1 and Nov 26  which is 15 8  higher than the levels witnessed in 2018  Of course  an increase in mobile shopping and new marketing trends such as  buy now  pick up in store  have been major contributors this year According to the   consumers plan to spend a total of  1 048  on average  this holiday season on miscellaneous products such as gift items  decorations and candies About 56  of consumers plan to shop online  while 53  intend to shop at department stores and 51  at discount stores  Other popular destinations for holiday shopping include clothing and electronic stores  thrift stores  local businesses  craft and specialty stores Consumer Spending Data Stable To induce optimism in the vibrant holiday shopping season  Americans raised their spending at the fastest pace in four months in November Consumer spending rose 0 4  last month  which is the largest rise since July This data indicates strong spending capacity of American households  thanks to steadily rising incomes  After all  incomes rose an impressive 0 5  in November  rebounding from October s flat reading  Last month  households increased their spending on cars and trucks  Consumers also spent more on healthcare in the month This is why consumer spending on retail products and services could rise this holiday season  because the holiday season has been shorter this year  because of a late Thanksgiving holiday  which shifted Black Friday to December   Given the shorter holiday season  retailers started offering bargains much before holiday season began  which resulted in more sales  The trend is expected to continue In that case  one could benefit from investing in funds focused on retail and financial services companies  After all  increased shopping will lead to more financial transactions  which is bound to boost participants in the financial services sector Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  selected four mutual funds that carry a Zacks

The company has found its software as a service model to be popular with businesses especially as more enterprises move over to cloud computing  Let s take a closer look at what has pushed ADBE stock to where it is today and how the company might report its third quarter performance 
Adobe Acquisitions 
In recent years  the company has been expanding into new areas and creating an enterprise marketing software suite  mostly through acquisitions  Since the start of 2017  Adobe has spent nearly  7 billion on just three cornerstone acquisitions in this enterprise software push 
In 2017  Adobe acquired the video advertising platform  TubeMogul  for  560 million  TubeMogul allows brands and marketers to buy advertisements across desktop  mobile  streaming  and linear TV  The TubeMogul acquisition strengthened Adobe s marketing cloud and brought in new customers who were using TubeMogul but weren t as familiar with Adobe s other capabilities 
In 2018  Adobe purchased Magento  which is an e commerce hosting platform  for  1 64 billion  Magento helps businesses sell goods and services to consumers and other businesses through order management  payment solutions  and analytics 
Adobe went on to purchase Marketo  which provides business to business marketing software  Marketo s services enable marketers to capture  store  and leverage client data for email marketing  digital advertising  personalized advertising  and customer analytics 
These three acquisitions effectively extend Adobe s reach into more markets and also further diversified its services portfolio  The purchases also gave Adobe the option to cross sell its new products to existing customers and bundle its services to enhance the value of its marketing software 
Outlook 
Adobe has identified a large opportunity in the marketing space that can be addressed with a bundle of products sold as a single subscription  Adobe CEO  Shantanu Narayen recently spoke on the firm s confidence in this opportunity on an earnings call where he said  we do think there will be unique capabilities that we ll provide all the way from the moment you see your first ad through where you re transacting and purchasing a product  
Adobe is trying to become a one stop shop for marketing software  which can help the company establish itself in the market  Enterprise customers will likely favor doing business with Adobe rather than dealing with many outsourced vendors  Adobe s ability to bundle these services helps the company offer the services at lower prices 
Adobe s string of acquisitions pits it against Salesforce   NYSE CRM    Many companies around the world already store their customer data in Salesforce s software  which makes Salesforce a prominent competitor in marketing software 
Despite Salesforce s lead in CRM  Adobe produced  2 4 billion in marketing revenue in fiscal 2018 revenue  which outpaced Salesforce s  1 9 billion of marketing revenue 
Adobe stock has also outperformed Salesforce over the past five years 

Our Q4 consensus estimates forecast earnings to climb 23 5  to  2 26 per share and for revenue to increase 20 5  to  2 97 billion  Marketing cloud revenue is estimated to grow 23 8  to  854 1 million and digital imaging and video revenue is projected to rally 20 1  to  2 05 billion 
Fiscal 2019 sales are predicted to climb 23 5  to  11 15 billion and earnings are anticipated to come in at  7 84 per share  for a 16  increase 
Takeaway
Adobe looks poised to continue on its solid growth trajectory thanks in part to its ability to establish itself in the growing marketing software industry  The company will need to keep its focus on its marketing software efforts  especially as companies like Salesforce make their own moves to cash in on the lucrative space 
Investors should note that the company s success has driven its valuation to a pricey forward multiple  ADBE stock currently trades at about 31X its forward earnings  but its forward multiple is right on par with the software market s average  Adobe sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

139587,361102,ADBE,Zumiez  Yext  Adobe And Salesforce Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 11  2019    Zumiez   NASDAQ ZUMZ   as the Bull of the Day  Yext   NYSE YEXT   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE   and Salesforce   NYSE CRM   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  With the market just under all time highs  it may feel like any stock you pick is a good idea  While that may be the case in the short run  over the long run  stocks with strong earnings will outperform  Stock prices tend to move with earnings so this makes perfect sense  But how can you uncover stocks with strong earnings trends  One of the easiest ways is to use the Zacks Rank  Stocks with strong earnings trends tend to have very good Zacks Ranks  Today s Bull of the Day is one of these highly rated stocks Today s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Zumiez  Zumiez Inc   together with its subsidiaries  operates as a specialty retailer of apparel  footwear  accessories  and hardgoods for young men and women  Its hardgoods include skateboards  snowboards  bindings  components  and other equipment  As of August 31  2019  the company operated 711 stores  including 607 stores in the United States  51 stores in Canada  43 stores in Europe  and 10 stores in Australia under the names of Zumiez  Blue Tomato  and Fast Times  It also operates     and  e commerce Websites  Zumiez is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in the Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry which ranks in the Top 15  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the favorable rank lies in the series of earnings revisions coming in to the upside recently  Over the last seven days  six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year while five have upped their estimates for next year  The bullish sentiment has pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  2 15 to  2 44 while next year s number has gone up from  2 24 to  2 49 The positive revisions have been helping the stock rally  After bottoming out under  19 in early June  the stock has rallied dramatically  Shares popped up over  35 following its most recent earnings report  For the last two days  the stock has been giving up ground  coming down to look for support  Sometimes  all it takes is one earnings report to take a stock from being a potential high flyer to a tough situation  That s the case here with today s Bear of the Day which was just in one of our portfolios at Zacks  After the report  analysts have been slashing earnings estimates  Stocks which have seen negative earnings estimate revisions tend to have worse Zacks Ranks than others  An easy way to uncover stronger earnings trends is by looking for stocks that are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  Those with weaker ranks like today s Bear of the Day have much weaker earnings trends Today s Bear of the Day is Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Yext  Yext  Inc  provides a knowledge engine platform that lets businesses manage their digital knowledge in the cloud and synchronize it to its knowledge network in North America and internationally  The company offers Yext Knowledge Engine  a cloud based global platform that enables businesses to control and manage their digital knowledge and make it available through its knowledge Network of approximately 150 third party maps  apps  search engines  intelligent GPS systems  digital assistants  vertical directories  and social networks  Over the last week  earnings estimates for the current year and next year have come down  The negative revisions have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from a 43 cent loss to a 46 cent loss  Next year s number has come down from a 38 cent loss to a 40 cent loss  That s not the sort of EPS movement that investors reward Will Q4 Earnings Send Adobe  ADBE  to New Highs Adobe will report its fourth

139614,361129,ADBE,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  Costco  Adobe  FedEx And General Mills,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 5  2019   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   Total earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 6  in Q4 from the same period last year on  2 9  higher revenues  with the Energy sector as a big drag on growth  Looking Ahead to Q4 Earnings SeasonNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s Earnings Trends report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  please click here   Here are the key points We did not see much earnings growth in the first three quarters of the year  primarily reflecting tough comparisons to last year  and this trend is expected to continue in the last quarter of the year as well Total earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 6  in Q4 from the same period last year on  2 9  higher revenues  with the Energy sector as a big drag on growth Energy sector earnings are expected to be down  41 1  from the same period last year on  6 9  lower revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total earnings for the index would be up  1 9  Sectors with weak growth in Q4  besides Energy  include Autos   56 2    Basic Materials   20 2    Aerospace   17 4    Industrial Products   7 7    Retails   6 5    Tech   3 7    and Transportation   2 9    Q4 earnings are expected to be below the year earlier level for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q4 include Utilities   19 1    Business Services   8 8    Finance   7 8    and Medical   2 8   Estimates for Q4 have come down since the quarter got underway  with the current  3 6  decline from  1 1  at the start of October For the Q3 earnings season  we now have results awaited from only 9 S P 500 members  Total earnings for the 491 index members that have reported already were down  1 5  from the year earlier level on  4 3  higher revenues  with 72 7  beating EPS estimates and 58 2  beating revenue estimates While Q4 earnings growth was below what we had seen for this group of companies in other recent periods  revenue growth was only modestly below what this same group achieved in the preceding period  The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates was within the historical range  though revenue beats were on the lower side For the Retail sector  we now have Q3 results from 96 6  of the sector s market cap in the index  Total earnings for these sector companies are up  1 9  from the same period last year on  9 2  growth in revenues  with 64 7  beating EPS estimates and 55 9  beating revenue estimates The Retail sector s Q3 earnings performance has been weaker than what we saw from the same companies in the June quarter  with the proportion of sector companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking below what other recent periods For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q3 results from 568 companies or 94 5  of the index s total membership  Total earnings or aggregate net income for these companies are down  18 5  from the same period last year on  2 4  higher revenues  with 58 8  beating EPS estimates and 58 3  beating revenue estimates Total 2019 earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  1 6  on  2 6  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 2  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  8 1  on  4 2  higher revenues The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 19 4X and index close  as of December 3rd  is  159 58  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  172 58 for 2020  P E of 17 9X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with the 2019 growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings The Start of the Q4 Earnings Season The market will start paying attention to the Q4 earnings season after we enter the New Year  But the Costco   NASDAQ COST   and Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE   reports next week will kick start the Q4 reporting cycle for us  Both of these companies and many others like FedEx   NYSE FDX   and General Mills   NYSE GIS   that will report in the following days will be reporting quarterly results for their respective fiscal periods in November  which we count as part of our December quarter tally The earnings growth trend established in the first three quarters of the year is not expected to change in the last quarter of the year  with tough comparisons to the year earlier period weighing on growth For Q4  total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  3 6  on  2 9  higher revenues  with 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have lower earnings relative to the year earlier period As has been the trend in other recent periods  Q4 estimates came down as the quarter got underway The magnitude of negative revisions to Q4 estimates is in line with historical trends  In fact  a big reason for the market s favorable reaction to Q3 results was the absence of across the board negative guidance that many in the market appeared to fear ahead of the start of that earnings season Driving this fear was the negative impact of the trade issue on business confidence and growing signs of economic weakness in key regions of the world  including the domestic factory space Earnings growth was essentially flat in the first two quarters of the year  but is on track to be down  1 8  in Q3  we haven t closed the books on the Q3 earnings season yet as 9 results are still awaited  The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the

139615,361130,ADBE,Adobe Systems  ADBE  To Report Q4 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Adobe Systems  ADBE  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 97 billion  up 20 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 35  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Adobe 
For Adobe  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 12  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Adobe will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Adobe would post earnings of  1 97 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 05  delivering a surprise of  4 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Adobe appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adobe-systems-adbe-to-report-q4-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200490448,200490448

139639,361154,ADBE,4 Solid ETF Ideas To Follow This December,opinion,After capping the strongest monthly performance since June  Wall Street is facing dual headwinds of an escalation in trade tensions and bouts of weak data  which signal slowing economy in the crucial holiday shopping season  read    This is especially true as President Trump is planning to restore tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina and proposed tariffs of up to 100  on  2 4 billion worth of French products  Also  trade talks between Washington and Beijing have stalled as Trump said that he will wait until the November 2020 election to strike a deal  The President previously touted that he will impose tariffs on Chinese goods from Dec 15  as announced  if the deal is not reached  This has dented hopes of ending the lingering trade war  resulting in risk off sentiments Meanwhile  latest data shows that U S  manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth straight month in November with a steep drop in new factory orders  U S  construction spending also unexpectedly fell in October as investment in private projects tumbled to its lowest level in three years However  the strong start to the holiday season paints an upbeat economic picture  The burst of heavy discounts and promotional deal has been paying off retailers both in stores and online  About 190 million consumers shopped between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday  according to the National Retail Federation   NRF    This is up 14  from last year s figure  Out of these  more than 124 million consumers shopped in stores during the holiday weekend Per Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE   online sales jumped 14 5  year over year to a record  4 2 billion on Thanksgiving   Black Friday and Small Business Saturday also witnessed record figures of  7 4 billion  up 20   and  3 6 billion  up 18   respectively  Notably  Thanksgiving sales surpassed  4 billion for the first time ever  Cyber Monday also broke another record by raking in  9 4 billion in online sales  read    Further  the stock market has entered a typically strong period  December has historically been the strongest month of the year despite the S P 500 dropping more than 9  last year after months of selling  According to Sam Stovall  chief investment strategist at CFRA  the S P 500 gained 1 6  on average with positive movements in 76  of the time Amid the tug of war between bulls and bears  it is difficult to plan investments that could fetch sure shot returns  In this case  we have highlighted some investing ideas that could prove to be extremely beneficial for investors this holiday season Focus on Low Risk ProductsInvestors should prepare themselves for volatility amid the return of trade jitters  While there are many ways to survive the market turmoil  investing in lower volatility ETFs could reduce losses in declining markets  while generate decent returns when the markets rise  ETFs like iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF   Invesco S P 500 Low Volatility ETF  SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility  NYSE LGLV  Focus ETF  ONEV  and SPDR SSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF  LGLV  could be compelling choices  Most of these have a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy   read    Add Value to Your PortfolioValue ETFs have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets  This is because value stocks have strong fundamentals   earnings  dividends  book value and cash flow   that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued  As such  value ETFs have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts  Among these  Vanguard Value ETF   HN VTV    iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF   Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF  MGV  and Schwab U S  Large Cap Value ETF  SCHV  have a Zacks ETF Rank  2  read    Bet on Retail ETFsRetailers have a tradition of tapping the holiday fervor as about 25 40  of sales are generated during this season  If we go by history  retailers have been the clear outperformers in the stock market in the week leading to Black Friday and in the days thereafter According to NRF  holiday sales are expected to grow 3 8 4 2  for November and December to  727 9  730 7 billion  This is higher than last year s growth of 2 1  and the five year average of 3 7   Of these  online and other non store sales are likely to increase

optimism  investors can bet on retail ETFs  Amplify Online Retail ETF   SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  ETF   VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   TSXV RTH   and ProShares Online Retail ETF   Most of these products have a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold   read    Emphasis on DividendsThough dividend focused stocks do not offer much price appreciation in a rising stock market  they offer a steady stream of income along with the potential of capital gains  These are the major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk  The companies that pay out dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis As such  dividend focused ETFs offer safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices  While there are several dividend ETFs  here are some of the top

139640,361155,ADBE,Looking Ahead To The Q4 Earnings Season,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points We did not see much earnings growth in the first three quarters of the year  primarily reflecting tough comparisons to last year  and this trend is expected to continue in the last quarter of the year as well  Total earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 6  in Q4 from the same period last year on  2 9  higher revenues  with the Energy sector as a big drag on growth  Energy sector earnings are expected to be down  41 1  from the same period last year on  6 9  lower revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total earnings for the index would be up  1 9   Sectors with weak growth in Q4  besides Energy  include Autos   56 2    Basic Materials   20 2    Aerospace   17 4    Industrial Products   7 7    Retails   6 5    Tech   3 7    and Transportation   2 9    Q4 earnings are expected to be below the year earlier level for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors   Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q4 include Utilities   19 1    Business Services   8 8    Finance   7 8    and Medical   2 8    Estimates for Q4 have come down since the quarter got underway  with the current  3 6  decline from  1 1  at the start of October  For the Q3 earnings season  we now have results awaited from only 9 S P 500 members  Total earnings for the 491 index members that have reported already were down  1 5  from the year earlier level on  4 3  higher revenues  with 72 7  beating EPS estimates and 58 2  beating revenue estimates  While Q4 earnings growth was below what we had seen for this group of companies in other recent periods  revenue growth was only modestly below what this same group achieved in the preceding period  The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates was within the historical range  though revenue beats were on the lower side  For the Retail sector  we now have Q3 results from 96 6  of the sector s market cap in the index  Total earnings for these sector companies are up  1 9  from the same period last year on  9 2  growth in revenues  with 64 7  beating EPS estimates and 55 9  beating revenue estimates  The Retail sector s Q3 earnings performance has been weaker than what we saw from the same companies in the June quarter  with the proportion of sector companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking below what other recent periods  For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q3 results from 568 companies or 94 5  of the index s total membership  Total earnings or aggregate net income for these companies are down  18 5  from the same period last year on  2 4  higher revenues  with 58 8  beating EPS estimates and 58 3  beating revenue estimates  Total 2019 earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  1 6  on  2 6  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 2  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  8 1  on  4 2  higher revenues  The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 19 4X and index close  as of December 3rd  is  159 58  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  172 58 for 2020  P E of 17 9X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year  Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with the 2019 growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings  
The Start of the Q4 Earnings Season 
The market will start paying attention to the Q4 earnings season after we enter the New Year  But the Costco  COST  and Adobe  ADBE  reports next week will kick start the Q4 reporting cycle for us  Both of these companies and many others like FedEx  FDX  and General Mills  NYSE GIS   GIS  that will report in the following days will be reporting quarterly results for their respective fiscal periods in November  which we count as part of our December quarter tally 
The earnings growth trend established in the first three quarters of the year is not expected to change in the last quarter of the year  with tough comparisons to the year earlier period weighing on growth 
For Q4  total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  3 6  on  2 9  higher revenues  with 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have lower earnings relative to the year earlier period 
As has been the trend in other recent periods  Q4 estimates came down as the quarter got underway  as the chart below show 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The magnitude of negative revisions to Q4 estimates is in line with historical trends  In fact  a big reason for the market s favorable reaction to Q3 results was the absence of across the board negative guidance that many in the market appeared to fear ahead of the start of that earnings season 
Driving this fear was the negative impact of the trade issue on business confidence and growing signs of economic weakness in key regions of the world  including the domestic factory space 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for Q4 and the following quarter and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the first two quarters of the year  but is on track to be down  1 8  in Q3  we haven t closed the books on the Q3 earnings season yet as 9 results are still awaited   
The chart below puts earnings and revenue growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook

No wonder  U S  consumers have already shelled out    marking an increase of 15 8  year over year  per Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  Analytics  A six day shorter holiday shopping season this year led retailers to come up with deals earlier than usual  which drove the sales numbers in November

139705,361220,ADBE,3 Reasons Why Adobe  ADBE  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Adobe Systems  ADBE  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this software maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 56 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 16  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Adobe is 46 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 32 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Adobe have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Adobe a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Adobe well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-adobe-adbe-is-a-great-growth-stock-200484916,200484916

139707,361222,ADBE,Structural Cracks In The Equities Market Now,opinion,"As the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ keep roaring to new highs  the disconnect not only among the market sectors but also among the world s populace  keeps expanding 
Yet  in an almost surreal way  tech and fortune 500 stocks keep running up 
Meanwhile  the civil unrest we see happening on the streets of the world versus the insulation of those in their ivory towers is like the original adobe houses we see in Santa Fe 
They are highly valuable despite the cracks in the walls 
Recently  unrest has sprouted all around the world 
Hong Kong  Lebanon  Chile  Catalonia  Iraq  Venezuela  Ecuador  Peru  to name a few  headline the list 
Issues cited for riots include a stagnating middle class  stifled democracy  and an idealistic belief that things can be different 
The younger generations are out protesting about the ramifications of climate change 
Currently  the world s richest 26 people own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world s population 
But in the 21st century  there is no Bastille to storm 
The riots may be increasing  but unlike the 1960 s  no real leaders of the disenfranchised have emerged 
In the stock market  I have created characters that represent the cyclicals and non cyclicals of the U S  Economy 
This economic Modern Family mirrors the disconnect we see around the world 





Let s check in on their progress or lack thereof this week 
As advances in technology and productivity continue  a lot of those gains are going to the top or the wealthiest  bypassing the lower and middle classes 
All one has to do is look at the chart of semiconductors versus small caps  transportation and brick and mortar retail 
The mirror image of the world s discourse is remarkable 
Beginning at top left  the Russell 2000 IWM  closed DOWN week to week  DOWN  Let that absorb in your bullish brains 
Plus  the April highs stand above as a reminder of the weakness in the manufacturing sector 
Middle left is SPDR S P Regional Banking  NYSE KRE  
Look at the inside week 
The far right is Transportation  NYSE IYT   This too had an inside week  
Bottom left is SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT   It did not have an inside week  yet it did not clear the prior week s high either  
Bottom middle is Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB   This closed higher  Cyclical or non cyclical  A little of both 
Health care costs have exploded  The opioid crisis is receiving fewer headlines  IBB is economically cyclical in that companies will provide healthcare in good times  It is economically non cyclical in that no matter what the economy is doing  people need their medication 
Bottom line  even with the upward move  still far from the April highs  
Finally  there is our very rich  insulated technology sister Semiconductors SMH  Notch another new all time high on her Wonder Woman belt 
VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF  NYSE SMH  rose to 135 26  ultimately closing near the intraday lows  Warning  Meh for now 
Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  houses  once affordable  have become the purview of the wealthy 
But with enough cracks  they too can crumble 
S P 500  NYSE SPY  308 60 support  All time high 311 84 
Russell 2000  IWM  155 156 Key support 157 75  160 46 resistance 
Dow  DIA  A small gap up to a new all time high at 279 95  276 90 now nearest support

SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Neo4j Inc  a graph database firm whose technology was used in investigating the  Panama Papers   said on Thursday it closed an  80 million Series E funding round led by One Peak Partners and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  Expansion Capital 
Graph databases can be used to answer queries with diagrams and charts that illustrate relationships  such as showing how people in a group are related to one another 
Journalists investigating the Panama Papers  documents showing offshore tax havens used by wealthy individuals  used a graph database to help sort through 2 6 terabytes of data  including emails  PDFs and images 
The database found relationships between names  which gave journalists leads to follow  according to a blog by an editor of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists  which led the Panama Papers investigation 
The latest fund raising brings Neo4j s total fund raising to  160 million  The company  based in San Mateo  California  did not disclose its valuation 
Emil Eifrem  Neo4j s chief executive and co founder  said his graph database has been used by bank clients to detect fraud and money laundering and also by retail clients to make recommendations for customers  Artificial intelligence platforms also are drawing on graph databases  he said 
 We re getting an early signal of graph being used for the back end of AI and we are going to invest heavily into that   Eifrem told Reuters by phone

139731,361246,ADBE,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Adobe  ADBE ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Adobe Systems  ADBE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this software maker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 56 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 16  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Adobe is 46 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 32 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Adobe  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Adobe has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Adobe well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-adobe-adbe-200478913,200478913
139732,361247,ADBE,Adobe Systems  ADBE  Stock Moves  0 17   What You Should Know,opinion,"In the latest trading session  Adobe Systems  ADBE  closed at  277 93  marking a  0 17  move from the previous day  This change was narrower than the S P 500 s daily loss of 0 3   At the same time  the Dow lost 0 52   and the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 14  
Heading into today  shares of the software maker had gained 4 41  over the past month  outpacing the Computer and Technology sector s gain of 3 75  and the S P 500 s gain of 2 46  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from ADBE as it approaches its next earnings report date  On that day  ADBE is projected to report earnings of  2 26 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 23 5   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  2 97 billion  up 20 49  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  7 84 per share and revenue of  11 15 billion  These totals would mark changes of  15 98  and  23 49   respectively  from last year 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for ADBE should also be noted by investors  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 05  higher  ADBE is holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now 
In terms of valuation  ADBE is currently trading at a Forward P E ratio of 35 52  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 29 48  which means ADBE is trading at a premium to the group 
Also  we should mention that ADBE has a PEG ratio of 2 19  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  ADBE s industry had an average PEG ratio of 2 22 as of yesterday s close 
The Computer   Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 80  putting it in the top 32  of all 250  industries

139733,361248,ADBE,U S  online spending set to rise 14 8 percent in 2018 holiday season,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  online spending during the holiday shopping season is likely to grow 14 8 percent this year to  124 1 billion  far outpacing the 2 7 percent growth predicted for brick and mortar locations and highlighting the ongoing switch from stores to web shopping 
The forecast was released on Thursday by Adobe Analytics  the web analytics arm of Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  Inc  The company measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U S  retailers and trillions of customer visits to U S  retail sites 
Online sales this year will benefit from an extra day between Cyber Monday to Christmas  which is likely to provide a  284 million sales boost  the report said 
Adobe also forecast the best days for shopping online based on prices across product categories during previous years  For example  Thanksgiving is likely to be a good day to buy sporting goods as prices could be 13 percent lower than their average in the first 10 months of the year  Black Friday will still be a good option for television purchases as prices could be about 22 percent lower 
Apparel discounts could make items cheaper by 22 percent than average on Nov  25  and toys are likely to be 19 percent cheaper on Cyber Monday  the report said 
The November and December holiday shopping season are critical for retailers  when they book an outsized portion of their annual sales and profits

For the current fiscal year  Synnex is expected to post earnings of  12 61 per share on  23 18 billion in revenues  This represents a 15 79  change in EPS on a 15 57  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  13 19 per share on  23 49 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 4 66  and 1 34   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Synnex may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Synnex has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 9 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 8 8X versus its peer group s average of 23 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 0 9  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Synnex currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Synnex fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Synnex shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Synnex Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Synnex have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Dell Technologies  DELL   AppFolio  APPF   and Adobe Systems  ADBE   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 44  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Synnex  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-10-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/synnex-snx-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200475207,200475207

139779,361294,ADBE,Here s What To Expect As Q3 Earnings Season Revs Up ,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points The Q3 earnings season is about to take the spotlight  with the big banks dominating the initial line up of reports  But the reporting cycle has started already  with results from 21 S P 500 members out already  The muted earnings growth pace of the first half of the year is expected to continue in Q3 as well  though current expectations put the year over year earnings growth rate for the quarter at a  5 1  decline on  4 2  higher revenues  Q3 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Energy   26 7    Basic Materials   22 6    Technology   11 1    and Aerospace   10 6  sectors  Excluding the Technology sector  total Q3 earnings would be down  3 3    Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q3 include Business Services   6 9    Transportation   5 5    Utilities   3 5    Finance   0 2   and Construction   1 1    Q3 earnings for the index would be down  6 5  on an ex Finance basis  Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter got underway  with the current  5 1  decline down from  1 3  in late June  The magnitude of negative revisions to Q3 estimates is in line with the comparable periods in other recent quarters  For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q3 earnings are expected to be down   18 3  from the same period last year on  3 0  higher revenues  This would follow declines of  12 7  and  18 3  in 2019 Q2 and Q1  respectively  Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with this year s growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings  Total 2019 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  0 6  on  2 5  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 1  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  9 7  on  5 5  higher revenues    The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 18 0X and index close  as of October 8th  is  161 17  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  176 74 for 2020  P E of 16 4X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year  
 
The Q3 earnings season is about to take the spotlight  as the big banks kick off the reporting cycle for the Finance sector  From our perspective  however  these big bank results will not be the first Q3 results as we see the 21 S P 500 index members that have reported their fiscal August quarter results in recent days as part of the September quarter tally  As such  these August quarter reporters that include bellwethers like Nike  NYSE NKE   NKE   FedEx  FDX   Adobe  ADBE  and others have kicked off the Q3 earnings season already 
The expectation is that the overall earnings growth picture emerging from the Q3 earnings season will not be much different from what we saw in the first two quarters of the year 
Total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  5 1  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  Driving this weak growth picture is tough comparisons to last year when earnings were boosted by the tax reform 
Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter got underway  as the chart below shows 
 
 

 
While the revisions trend is undoubtedly negative  the magnitude of decline in Q3 earnings estimates is about in line with historical trends 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 2 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 
 
 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the first two quarters of the year  but is expected to be down  5 1  in the current period and in modestly positive territory in the last quarter of the year 
My sense is that actual Q3 growth will most likely be in the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year and Q4 earnings growth will most likely turn negative by the time we are closing the books on the Q3 reporting cycle  
The chart below puts earnings and revenue growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook

139781,361296,ADBE,Adobe  ADBE  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Adobe Systems  ADBE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this software maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 56 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Adobe is 46 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 32 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Adobe have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Adobe a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Adobe well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-10-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adobe-adbe-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200472207,200472207

Here are the key points The early Q3 earnings results have started coming in  but the reporting cycle will really get going in mid October with the bank results  The muted earnings growth pace of the first half of the year is expected to continue in Q3  Total Q3 earnings are expected to be down  4 8  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  This would follow  0 5  growth in Q2 and a flat showing in Q1  Q3 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Energy   24 6    Basic Materials   21 5   and Technology   11   sectors  Excluding the Technology sector  total Q3 earnings would be down  2 8    Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q3 include Business Services   7 2    Transportation   5 7    Utilities   3 5   and Finance   1 6    Q3 earnings for the index would be down  6 4  on an ex Finance basis  Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter got underway  with the current  4 8  decline down from  1 3  in late June  The magnitude of negative revisions to Q3 estimates is in line with the comparable periods in other recent quarters  For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q3 earnings are expected to be down   14 7  from the same period last year on  3 1  higher revenues  This would follow declines of  12 0  and  18 9  in 2019 Q2 and Q1  respectively  Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with this year s growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings  Total 2019 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  0 5  on  2 6  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 1  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  9 8  on  5 4  higher revenues    The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 18 4X and index close  as of September 24th  is  161 48  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  177 34 for 2020  P E of 16 7X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year  
We still have a few weeks to go before the Q3 earnings season really gets going  but the reporting cycle has officially gotten underway already  with results from 10 S P 500 members  These 10 index members  which includes Oracle  ORCL   Adobe Systems  ADBE   FedEx  FDX   Nike  NYSE NKE   NKE  and others  have reported results for their fiscal quarters ending August  All of these fiscal August quarter reporters get counted as part of the September quarter tally  In fact  we will have seen results from almost two dozen such companies by the time JPMorgan  JPM  reports results on October 15th 
The expectation is that the overall earnings growth picture emerging from the Q3 earnings season will not be much different from what we saw in the first two quarters of the year 
Total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  4 8  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  Driving this weak growth picture is tough comparisons to last year when earnings were boosted by the tax reform 
Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter got underway  as the chart below shows 
 
 
 
 
While the revisions trend is undoubtedly negative  the magnitude of decline in Q3 earnings estimates is about in line with historical trends 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 2 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 
 
 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was flat in the March and June quarters  expected to be down  4 8  in the current period and in modestly positive territory in the last quarter of the year  My sense is that actual Q3 growth will most likely be in the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year and Q4 earnings growth will most likely turn negative by the time we are closing the books on the Q3 reporting cycle  
The chart below puts earnings and revenue growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook

Adobe shares have added about 25 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 6  
What s Next for Adobe 
While Adobe has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Adobe was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

139828,361343,ADBE,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Adobe  ADBE  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Adobe Systems  ADBE  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this software maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 56 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 8  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Adobe is 46 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 32 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Adobe have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Adobe has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

139840,361355,ADBE,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week   FedEx  Adobe  General Mills,opinion,"With U S  economic data continuing to show strength and trade talks with China back on course  investors have been anticipating another strong rally in equity markets 
That optimism was certainly on display as the trading week came to a close on Friday  three major U S  indices finished higher for a third consecutive week  Still  many analysts haven t yet ruled out another week of volatility  especially since the Federal Reserve is announcing its latest rate decision this coming week and there is enough uncertainty in the air about the central bank s future course of action 
Though the Fed decision is probably the most important event investors will focus on next week  there are also some big earnings announcements that shouldn t be ignored  These three large caps might surprise markets when they report quarterly numbers 
1  FedEx
The world s largest parcel delivery service  FedEx  NYSE FDX  will report its fiscal 2020  first quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday  Sept  17  On average  analysts are expecting an 8  decline in earnings to  3 17 a share on sales that will likely remain flat at  17 09 billion 
FedEx s earnings  which come almost a month earlier than the third quarter 2019 numbers for the majority of U S  companies  are generally closely watched since the delivery business is considered a proxy for the global economy  As such it can provide early warnings on trade and business investment issues 

This past June  FedEx warned that the company expects it might see its first annual decline in adjusted earnings per share in more than five years during fiscal 2020  Adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year will drop by  a mid single digit percentage  from  15 52 a share in the previous year  negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production 
Due to this bearish forecast  FedEx shares have fallen about 33  from their 52 week high  closing at  174 10 on Friday  The company s report and guidance might offer some clues to wary investors on how badly the U S  China trade dispute and the weakness on the industrial side of the economy are affecting its business 
2  Adobe Systems
Another stock that could surprise investors this coming week is Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE   The maker of Photoshop also releases its fiscal 2019  third quarter earnings on Tuesday  Sept  17  after the close 
Analysts on average expect  1 97 a share profit on sales of  2 82 billion  In June  Adobe released an impressive earnings report for its Q2 period  helped by the company s expanding product line after two acquisitions in the past year 





Sales were up 25  from a year earlier as Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen s push to diversify the company  known for creative software  paid off  Adobe last year bought Magento Commerce  an e commerce platform developer  and marketing automation software creator Marketo 
Adobe  which competes with Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  in the marketing and e commerce technology segment  is trying to boost growth by expanding its business offerings while strengthening its core  creative software business 
The software manufacturer expects a 25  increase in bookings in its digital experience business  the corporate segment that includes its marketing and analytics products  Adobe shares have had a powerful rally this year  surging about 25   The stock closed at  278 35 on Friday 
3  General Mills
The maker of Cheerios cereal  Yoplait yogurt and Nature Valley granola bars among other consumer staple brands   General Mills   NYSE GIS  will release its fiscal 2020 Q1 earnings report on Wednesday  Sept  18  before the market opens 
Investors expect  0 77 a share profit on sales of  4 08 billion amid signs that the Minneapolis based company s growth is coming under pressure  The challenge for General Mills is daunting  the consumer foods company has to accelerate growth in an era when consumers are rapidly changing their eating habits  looking for fresher  greener and less sugary fare 





The company s last earnings report showed the path ahead is likely to be uneven  despite General Mills  latest effort to diversify its revenue base after it reported that sales excluding the effects from currency fluctuations and acquisitions fell in its fiscal fourth quarter and were flat for the year   Despite these concerns  the company s stock has produced a 40  rally this year  closing on Friday at  53 97 
The company s attractive 3 6  dividend yield  and its acquisition of Blue Buffalo  a natural pet food producer  could explain the reasons behind this strength  In the coming week  however  it will be important to see what other growth drivers General Mills might have on tap to spur expansion and impress investors ",2019-09-15,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week--fedex-adobe-general-mills-200464692,200464692

139845,361360,ADBE,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  September 13 
1  China Welcomes U S  Invitation for Trade Talks
China welcomed an invitation by the United States to hold a new round of trade talks  raising hopes for a deal easing the bitter tariff dispute between the world s two biggest economies 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said earlier that Beijing had received the invitation and welcomed it  adding that the two countries were in discussion about the details 
The Trump administration had invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks  the White House s top economic adviser said on Wednesday 
Larry Kudlow  who heads the White House Economic Council  told Fox Business Network that U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had sent an invitation to senior Chinese officials  but he declined to provide further details 
This comes after President Donald Trump warned last week that there could more trade tariffs against Beijing totaling  267 billion  on top the already  200 billion in tariffs previously announced 
2  U S  Stocks Futures Point Higher 
U S  stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wall Street  as investors reacted to a small step forward in trade war negotiations between the U S  and China 
At 5 15AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures were up 30 points  or about 0 1   the S P 500 futures tacked on 3 points  or around 0 1   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 14 points  or roughly 0 2  
The earnings calendar on Thursday will bring investors the only two S P 500 members reporting results this week  with Kroger  NYSE KR  and Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  releasing quarterly updates 
Elsewhere  in Europe  the region s major bourses were mostly higher  with most of the sectors in positive ground  The pan regional STOXX 600 benchmark was up 0 2  in mid morning trade 
Earlier  Asian markets ended higher  led by strong gains in China  Hong Kong and Japan 
3  U S  Inflation Data
Investors will get key inflation data in the morning with the August report on consumer prices set for release at 8 30AM ET 
Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0 3  last month and 2 8  over the prior year  according to estimates 
Core inflation  which excludes the more volatile costs of food and gas  is projected to climb 2 4  on a year over year basis 
The CPI data comes after soft U S  wholesale price data undermined the case for a faster pace of policy tightening by the Federal Reserve 
The U S  central bank is widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates at its September meeting  but odds for another move in December have decreased in recent days 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was a tad higher at 94 92 
In the bond market  U S  Treasury prices ticked down  pushing yields higher across the curve  with the benchmark 10 year yield rising to 2 975   while the Fed sensitive 2 year note rose to 2 755  
4  European Central Bank Policy Meeting
The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep interest rates at their current record low levels  making only nuanced changes to its guidance to stay on course to end bond purchases this year and raise interest rates next autumn 
The ECB will announce its policy decision at 1145GMT  7 45AM ET   followed by President Mario Draghi s news conference at 1230GMT  8 30AM ET   during which quarterly economic projections will also be unveiled 
With Thursday s decision  the ECB s deposit rate  currently its primary interest rate tool  will remain at  0 40  while the main refinancing rate  which determines the cost of credit in the economy  will remain at 0 0  
The euro dipped 0 1  against the dollar to 1 1610  weighed by broader economic uncertainty linked to developments in Italy 
Perhaps attracting more attention is a policy meeting by the Turkish central bank  which is expected to raise interest rates to shore up its battered lira 
5  Bank of England Rate Announcement
The Bank of England is also expected to hold fire after raising interest rates last month  If all goes as scripted  the British central bank will keep rates at 0 75  
A decision is due at 1100GMT  7 00AM ET  
Investors will look closely at the breakdown of votes on the nine member Monetary Policy Committee for further indications on the timing of the next rate increase 
Comments regarding the ongoing Brexit negotiations will also be in focus 
Expectations of another BoE rate hike are only seen in the second half of next year  given Britain s plans to leave the European Union in March 
The pound was little changed ahead of the BoE s monetary policy decision  with GBP USD at 1 3045 
Market players will also keep an eye on the U K  government  with a cabinet meeting scheduled to take place today  Prime Minister Theresa May is set to discuss the issue of a no deal with the European Union over Brexit ",2018-09-13,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-1608570,1608570

139863,361378,ADBE,What To Consider In September  Tariff Moves  Bond Yields  Fed Talk,opinion,"Investors hoping for some relief from August s whipsaw trading may not find it in September 
Next month  several major issues seem to be looming on the horizon  riddled with uncertainties  For one  we re seeing the unresolved U S  China tariff tensions escalate to new levels  For another  the Fed has been sending mixed signals about whether another rate cut is appropriate  And in another issue apparently keeping investors on edge  the bond market has been ringing economic alarm bells with its brief yield curve inversions 
September s markets have the potential to smooth out from recent turbulence if any of the main foreground issues land on a resolution  or at least get more clarity  But just as easily  stocks could continue to tread on shaky ground next month  A resolution to the China trade issue seems as far away as ever and that continues to be one of the main sticking points for markets  if not for the entire world economy 
U S  and China Digging in on Tariff Stances
The tariff standoff between the U S  and China took a backseat there for a while  but toward the end of August  the issue leapt back onto investors  radars and has remained front and center heading into September with the two parties apparently headed back to the negotiating table 
The latest developments started when President Trump said the U S  would impose 10  tariffs on about  300 billion in Chinese goods  a move that was delayed until December to try to ease the impact on the holiday shopping season  China retaliated by announcing tariffs of its own  ranging from 5  to 10  on some  75 billion in U S  goods that take effect over the next three months as well as 25  tariffs on U S  auto imports   In response to the measures by the U S   China was forced to take countermeasures   the Chinese State Council said in a statement on August 23   The Chinese side hopes that the U S  will return to the correct track of consultation and resolve differences  and work hard with China to end the goal of ending economic and trade frictions   In turn  Trump threatened to jack up tariffs even higher 
Stocks took a turn for the worse following each escalation  sliding further after President Trump called on U S  companies to find an alternative to operating in China  Next  the U S  and China officials plan to meet in early September  so investors can watch whether the tone remains combative  which would could weigh on the markets  or returns to one of cooperation  which could add to overall optimism and perhaps give stocks a boost 
While September does offer a number of different possible headwinds and tailwinds for the markets  this tariff issue has shown no signs of abating and has remained the one to watch  Without some sort of resolution  trade is likely to continue to be front and center and worries about tariffs could be a firm brake on any moves to the upside  Volatility  as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   popped back up above 20 in late August  indicating chances of more turbulence ahead  Investors might want to take extra care moving into and out of the market at times like this 
Fed Chief s Latest Sentiments Seem to Soothe Overall Edginess
Then there s topic of what might happen with interest rates  At its last meeting  the Fed gave investors the interest rate cut they expected  breaking its streak of steady increases  But in the aftermath  we ve gotten a sense that the Fed is still sorting out just how to go about making future rate cuts  if any 
The conundrum it s facing is that parts of the economy  like the jobs scene and the retail sector  seem to be firing on all cylinders  which some Fed officials have said makes cutting interest rates inappropriate  On the other hand  as Fed Chief Jerome Powell said  the broader global market has been showing signs of deteriorating  and that could have a domino effect that could hit the U S 
Bond yields in Germany fell deep underwater in August  putting pressure on U S  Treasury yields  The trade tensions are another issue that might force the Fed s hand  as Powell and others in the Fed have said they re intent on keeping the expansion going 
Powell s comments at last week s Jackson Hole symposium seemed to signal another rate cut up ahead  perhaps as soon as next month  and the futures market puts odds of a 25 basis point cut at 95   His comments appeared to momentarily calm the market  but China trade news right afterward sent stocks spinning lower and bonds higher 
Powell did add  however  that the Fed is near its goals on both price stability and with the labor market 
Bond Market Remains Under Close Scrutiny
The bond market  with its yield curve inversions between the 2 year and 10 year U S  Treasuries  has been rattling investors in recent weeks  and that trend could easily continue  When short term and long term yields invert to where shorter term bonds are providing more return than longer term bonds  the market takes that as an alarming sign because that kind of inversion has often  but not always  preceded recessions 
The yield curve inversions helped trigger a flight to so called  safe haven  assets like gold and bonds  as well as sectors like Utilities and Real Estate  Both those sectors are outpacing many others  but some analysts warn that they re trading at elevated levels on a price to earnings basis  That could make them more prone to a big drop if resolutions come to some of the market s pressing fundamental issues 
The 10 year yield was at 1 52   just a basis point above the two year yield  as of Aug  26  Any move toward inversion or back below 1 5  in the 10 year could push stocks into the red  The 10 year yield starts the month not far above three year lows  and the 30 year yield remains just above 2   A drop below that level might raise eyebrows about the economy 
One thing to keep in mind is that despite all the recession talk  data continues to look solid  A lot of people seem to think a recession is coming  but the numbers don t back that up  Also  though many economists talk about inverted yield curves signaling past recessions  something to consider is that fundamentals were very different back when those recessions happened  Interest rates tended to be a lot higher than they are now  both here and overseas  It s unclear if inversion is still a recession indicator 
Other Economic Factors to Consider Watching in September
While September looks poised to bring many pockets of uncertainty  several parts of the market and economy seem to be steadfast in a show of strength that could continue 
The jobs picture  the retail sector and the housing market are all among the areas generating generally positive momentum lately  so those monthly reports could be ones to consider monitoring for any changes as we head into the fall 
As for jobs  employment rates are currently the strongest they ve been in about 50 years  which has had a rippling positive effect on consumer spending  July s jobs report showed the U S  added 164 000 new jobs  just below expectations but about on par with average monthly gains this year  And wages climbed 3 2  year over year  just above expectations  It all shows that while the global economy may be sputtering  the domestic economy has a true pillar of strength with jobs  And of course with more jobs and higher wages  spending tends to follow 
Retail earnings last month were more than solid  showing consumers are still healthy  As long as joblessness remains low and consumers are out there spending  it s hard to imagine the economy taking a huge hit 
On the housing front  the picture is a bit more complicated  Still  it s generally looking a bit stronger  likely driven in part by the healthier jobs scene  On the one hand  mortgage rates remain low  which can attract more buyers  On the other hand  supplies are on the tight side  which can drive up prices and deter buyers  What we saw this month was that existing home sales rose more than expected in July  New home sales were down about 12  from June  but still up year over year in most regions of the U S  Building permits  which measure future demand for new homes  also rose sharply 
In other things to consider watching  September also brings a few more earnings including from retailers like Lululemon  LULU   Lands  End  LE   Signet Jewelers  SIG  and  Nike   NYSE NKE   Technology companies Oracle  NYSE ORCL   Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  and DocuSign  DOCU  are also on next month s slate 
If you follow the technical aspects of the market  it s worth noting that despite all the recent turbulence  the S P 500 Index  SPX  hasn t strayed from its long term range of around 2800 3000  The lower part of that range might represent a support level  technical analysts say 
However  August ended with two of the more important  canaries in the coal mine  for the market the Russell 2000  RUT  index of small cap stocks and the Dow Jones Transportation Average   DJT  both on the defense  falling more steeply than the broader market  Sometimes weakness in these two can indicate that trouble is on the way

Online sales rose 14 1 percent from the year ago quarter  boosted by sales for Presidents Day and Martin Luther King  Jr Day  according to a report by the web analytics arm of Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  Inc 
 This continued fast paced growth in online spending suggests that consumer confidence remains high  and we suspect the strong stock market is also helping buoy online sales   Sid Kulkarni  manager for Adobe Digital Insights  another Adobe Systems research arm  said in a blog post

 We re seeing a slowdown in spending in the days just before a key shopping holiday  and then a boost when the sales begin   Kulkarni said   The pattern suggests that increasingly savvy online consumers are waiting to compare retailers  deals  and then spending big when the prices dip

to unleash that old  dartboard approach  to investing  The problem with that is  eventually  the cream in the market will rise to the top while the rest of the market will settle lower  One way to find that cream at the top is by leaning on the time tested strength of the Zacks Rank  I used the Zacks Rank to come up with today s Bull of the Day  I m talking about Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  BHP Group  BHP Group discovers  acquires  develops  and markets natural resources worldwide  The company engages in the exploration  development  and production of oil and gas properties  and mining of copper  silver  lead  zinc  molybdenum  uranium  gold  and iron ores  as well as metallurgical and energy coal  It also engages in the mining  smelting  and refining of nickel  provision of freight  finance  and administrative services  as well as trading  marketing  and support services  and potash development activities The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank lies in the series of earnings estimate revisions to the upside recently  Over the last thirty days  two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year  while three analysts have increased their estimates over the last sixty days for next year  The bullish sentiment pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  3 86 to  4 56  Next year s number has popped from  3 52 to  4 23 Stock prices have a tendency to move along with earnings  Stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks have the strongest earnings trends  One way to visualize this is by looking at our Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise charts  Estimates for each year are plotted  along with the stock price  Here  the Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise chart for BHP Group shows earnings estimates bottoming out along with the stock price in early 2016  From there  consistent earnings moves to the upside have helped underpin a long term rally    Today s Bear of the Day is a stock that had been a high flier until last quarter  A bearish earnings report sealed the deal for the bears  causing a tough selloff for long term investors  The writing was  however  on the wall before this report  Earnings estimates had already begun to rollover  well ahead of the report  One way to uncover this potential looming danger in stocks is to lean on the Price  Consensus and Earnings chart on Zacks  I ll show you how to avoid these potential pitfalls in the future by using this chart The stock I m talking about is Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Foot Locker  Foot Locker  Inc   through its subsidiaries  operates as an athletic shoes and apparel retailer  The company operates in two segments  North America and International  The company retails athletic footwear  apparel  accessories  and equipment under various formats  including Foot Locker  Kids Foot Locker  Lady Foot Locker  Champs Sports  Footaction  Runners Point  Sidestep  and SIX 02  It also sells team licensed merchandise for high school and other athletes The reason for the unfavorable rank lies in the series of earnings estimate revision to the downside coming from analysts  Following its last earnings report  eleven analysts cut their earnings estimates for both the current year and next year  The bearish sentiment has dropped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year down from  5 20 to  5 02  Next year s number has also been brought lower  from  5 68 to  5 44 Additional content Adobe  ADBE   Buy or Die Subscription based revenue is the new gold standard for software companies  This business model creates long standing sustainable revenue that has the ability to continue to grow as the business does  This model has been successfully integrated into software behemoth  Adobe  Adobe has driven north of 20  revenue growth for every quarter year over year since 2015  ADBE has surge more than 313  in 5 years  and potential investors keep missing the boat  The stock is on track for their 8th consecutive year of double digit returns Adobe Stock AnalysisADBE is riding its all time high  trading around  300  I as an investor am always apprehensive about buying such a volatile stock on new highs because historical price trends show that the stock is likely to dip before it hits new highs  This being said  I do not have a crystal ball and this price could very well be the 52 week low in 52 weeks This firm s performance has been extraordinary since its pivot to cloud based software  which began in mid 2013  They were an early mover on this type of subscription driven software and have been able to reap the benefits  Effectively all of Adobe s revenue is now being delivered to customers through the cloud and their stable subscription based sales are pushing year over year as well as quarter over quarter growth nowhere but up Adobe is a must have software for professionals in both creative fields and marketing  They are the clear leader in digital content creation which is a category that is only going to grow as our society becomes increasingly digitalized  Being an essential provider of software for professionals in a growing industry gives this firm a solid backing for a buy recommendation at the right valuation Looking at valuation  this firm is consistent with a firm that is expected to have strong double digit top and bottom line growth for the next 3 years  ADBE is trading at a TTM P E of 51x and a forward P E of 40x  both around their 5 year median RisksAdobe has an enormous amount of growth priced into it  and if they are unable to grow their customer base or software prices in line with analyst expectations  the stock s current valuation could be discounted  The current valuations are far above any comparable firm and economic as well as geopolitical headwinds could have a significant downside to Adobe s stock price Competing cloud based software firms include Oracle and Salesforce Take Away  There is no question that Adobe has an extraordinary business model with an enormous amount of potential as the undeniable leader in the digital content creation space  The question is whether the current price is the right price to buy  As a long term investor  more than 2 years  not worried about short to medium term volatility  I would say this stock is trading at reasonable enough valuations to buy and hold through the volatility  8 consecutive years of strong double digit stock return is a convincing argument for a proved business model If you are a medium to short term investor   6 months or less  I would wait for a valuation dip to jump into ABDE  Seeing the 12 month forward P E come closer to the 35x level would make me as an investor feel much more comfortable about buying this software powerhouse The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 81   A quarter ago  it was expected that this software maker would post earnings of  1 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 71  delivering a surprise of 6 21  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Adobe  which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Software industry  posted revenues of  2 74 billion for the quarter ended May 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 64   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 20 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Adobe shares have added about 21 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 3  
What s Next for Adobe 
While Adobe has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Adobe was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

139940,361455,ADBE,Adobe Systems  ADBE  To Report Q2 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Adobe Systems  ADBE  reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 70 billion  up 23  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Adobe 
For Adobe  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Adobe will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Adobe would post earnings of  1 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 71  delivering a surprise of  6 21  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Adobe doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adobe-systems-adbe-to-report-q2-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200429180,200429180
139941,361456,ADBE,Top Stock Reports For Johnson   Johnson  Chevron   Adobe,opinion,"Thursday  June 6  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Chevron  CVX  and Adobe  ADBE   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Johnson   Johnson s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry so far this year   4 1  vs   0 1    The Zacks analyst thinks J J is likely to witness significant generic biosimilar headwinds in the Pharma unit in 2019  However  J J s sales and earnings growth is expected to accelerate in 2020  supported by contribution from new drugs like Tremfya and successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and immunology drug  Stelara  
J J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions  It has already gained FDA approval for two new drugs in 2019  Balversa and Spravato  Meanwhile  share buybacks and restructuring initiatives should provide bottom line support  
Headwinds like biosimilar generic competition and pricing pressure remain  Allegations that its talc products contain asbestos  which causes users to develop ovarian cancer  continue to be an overhang on the stock 
 You can   
Shares of Chevron have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry in the past six months   1 8  vs   1 9    The Zacks analyst thinks Chevron s financial results have greatly improved over the past few quarters  primarily aided by surging production and free cash flow turnaround  In fact  Chevron s free cash flow and upstream production for 2018 hit a record  
The company s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting a CAGR of 3 4  through 2023 thanks to the planned expansion in the Permian Basin  Moreover  growing free cash flow should enable Chevron to deliver stable and rising dividends in the foreseeable future  However  there are worries of a drop in its downstream earnings  
Meanwhile  Chevron s decision to walk away from the Anadarko transaction meant that the company lost the chance to significantly augment its substantial Permian holdings  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point 
 You can   
Adobe s shares have gained  10 3  over the past year  underperforming the Zacks Software industry which has increased  20 5  over the same period  However  the Zacks analyst thinks Adobe is riding high on benefits gained from the Magento and Marketo acquisitions  Further  increasing demand for its creative products is driving top line growth  
The company has been making great efforts toward establishing its presence in cloud related areas such as documents and marketing  Adobe s market position  compelling product lines  continued innovation  solid adoption of Creative Cloud and Adobe marketing cloud provides cause for optimism  Estimates have been stable ahead of the company s Q2 earnings release  
The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters  However  lower end market demand and exposure to Europe remain overhangs  Further  high acquisition expenses do not bode well for margin expansion

139954,361469,ADBE,What Makes Adobe  ADBE  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Adobe Systems  ADBE   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Adobe is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Adobe  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Adobe
For the fiscal year ending November  2019  this software maker is expected to earn  7 81 per share  which is a change of 15 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Adobe  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Adobe to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-05-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-adobe-adbe-a-new-buy-stock-200421281,200421281

139968,361483,ADBE, U S  stocks struggle ahead of quadruple witching expiration,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded mixed on Friday  with the Dow struggling to hold the psychological level of 19 900 points  though volatility was expected around the closing bell 
At 11 17AM ET  16 17GMT   the Dow Jones gained 41 points  or 0 20   the S P 500 lost 1 point or 0 03   while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite also slipped 1 point  or 0 03

139992,361507,ADBE,Earnings Recession Fears Are Exaggerated,opinion,"With earnings growth expectations for the first quarter of 2019 already in negative territory and estimates for 2019 Q2 moving in that direction as well  there is growing talk of an impending earnings recession 
This is coming at a time when many in the market are worried about the duration of the current economic cycle that is on track to become the longest in the nation s history later this summer  It is this backdrop that has made market participants overly sensitive to the shape of the Treasury yield curve and its cyclical implications  No doubt  the  R  word has become potent 
So how reasonable are these  earnings recession  fears 
The definition of  recession  is two or more quarters of negative growth  typically GDP growth  The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following three quarters and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters 
 
 
To be totally pedantic about it  the recession talk reflects ground reality  as you can see in the chart above  After all  earnings growth in the first two quarters of the year is on track to be negative  even though the 2019 Q2 growth pace is barely in negative territory 
We shouldn t take this recession talk too seriously  however  The reason is that the negative growth in the first half of the year is solely because of very tough comparisons  In other words  the base period for 2019 Q1 growth is 2018 Q1  when earnings received a huge boost from the tax cut legislation  You can see this in the expanded version of the above chart that shows all four quarters of 2017 as well 
 
The lower corporate tax rates that showed up in earnings for the first time in 2018 Q1  the base year for 2019 Q1  boosted profitability through margin expansion  As such  we are up against some tough comparisons in 2019 
The tax cut legislation didn t have a direct bearing on revenues last year and we are not seeing that much drop off in estimates for this year either  as the chart below shows  orange bars  
 
So  if the earnings recession is only  technical   is there nothing to worry about on the earnings front 
That s not correct as there are legitimate reasons to be wary of the earnings picture  The earnings growth trajectory would be challenged and difficult even without the issue of the aforementioned tough comparisons as the global economic growth backdrop has become less favorable and cyclical rises in transportation  logistics  payroll and other expenses are squeezing margins  As a result  analysts steadily lowered their estimates for 2019 Q1 as well as full year 2019  as you can see in the chart below 
 
The weak guidance from Nike  NYSE NKE   NKE   FedEx  FDX   Adobe  ADBE   Oracle  ORCL  and others in this reporting cycle suggests that we will likely see a replay of what we experienced the last earnings season that pushed estimates lower  We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond 
Expectations for 2019 Q1   the Initial Earnings Report 
Total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  3 8  from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  If actual 2019 Q1 earnings growth turns out to be negative  it will be the first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016 
Driving the expected Q1 earnings decline is broad based margin pressures across all major sectors  with net margins for the index of 11  down from 12  in the year earlier and 11 8  in the preceding quarter  The Utilities sector is the only one that is expected to have unchanged net margins in 2019 Q1 relative to the year earlier period  with margins expected to be lower for all of the remaining 15 sectors 
Q1 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit earnings declines for 5 sectors  including Energy and Technology  For the Technology sector  Q1 earnings are expected to be down  10  from the same period last year on  3  higher revenues and 270 basis points compression in net margins 
For the Finance sector whose members will be in the first round of Q1 releases  total earnings are expected to be up only  0 8  on  6 5  higher revenues 
The table below shows the summary picture for 2019 Q1  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period 
 
 
Q1 Scorecard  as of March 29th  2019 
The market will start paying attention to the start of the earnings season following the quarterly reports from JPMorgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC  on April 12th  But these bank earnings reports will not be the first of the Q1 earnings season  as the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway already  with results from 20 S P 500 members out  All of these early reports  which includes a few bellwethers like FedEx  FDX   Nike and others  have fiscal quarters ending in February  which we count as part of our March quarter tally 
For the 20 S P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already  total earnings are down  11  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  with 75  beating EPS estimates and 50  beating revenue estimates 
 The Q1 growth for these 20 index is tracking notably below what we had seen in the recent past and positive revenue surprises appear also to be on the weak side  as the comparison charts below show 
 
 
It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this admittedly small sample of Q1 results  but it is nevertheless a weak start to the reporting season

With earnings growth in the first two quarters of 2019 expected to be in negative territory  the  earnings recession  term is liberally being thrown around  This is coming at a time when late cycle worries have already made market participants overly sensitive to the shape of the Treasury yield curve and its cyclical implications 
The definition of  recession  is two or more quarters of negative growth  typically GDP growth  The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings and revenue growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following three quarters and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters 
 
 
To be totally pedantic about it  the recession talk reflects ground reality  as you can see in the chart above  After all  earnings growth in the first two quarters of the year is on track to be negative  even though the 2019 Q2 growth pace is barely in negative territory at present 
We shouldn t take this recession talk too seriously  however  The reason is that the negative growth in the first half of the year is solely because of very tough comparisons  In other words  the base period for 2019 Q1 growth is 2018 Q1  when earnings received a huge boost from the tax cut legislation  You can see this in the expanded version of the above chart that shows all four quarters of 2017 as well 
 
 
The lower corporate tax rates that showed up in earnings for the first time in 2018 Q1  the base year for 2019 Q1  boosted profitability through margin expansion  As such  we are up against some tough comparisons in 2019 
The tax cut legislation didn t have a direct bearing on revenues last year and we are not seeing that much drop off in estimates for this year either  as the earlier chart above shows  orange bars   Importantly  growth is expected to resume in the second half of the year and accelerate into next year 
The chart below puts earnings growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected next year 
 
 
So  if the earnings recession is only  technical   is there nothing to worry about on the earnings front 
That s not correct as there are legitimate reasons to be wary of the earnings picture  The earnings growth trajectory would be challenged and difficult even without the issue of the aforementioned tough comparisons as the global economic growth backdrop has become less favorable and cyclical rises in transportation  logistics  payroll and other expenses are squeezing margins  As a result  analysts steadily lowered their estimates for 2019 Q1 as well as full year 2019  as you can see in the chart below 
 
 
The weak guidance from Nike  NYSE NKE   NKE   FedEx  FDX   Adobe  ADBE   Oracle  ORCL  and others in this reporting cycle suggests that we will likely see a replay of what we experienced the last earnings season that pushed estimates lower  We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond 
Recent revisions trend shows that these low growth expectations for the coming quarters still remain vulnerable to further downward revisions  In other words  it is reasonable for market participants to nurse some doubts about the current earnings backdrop

140038,361553,ADBE,Wall St  drops as oil s multi year low adds to investor fears,news,"U S  stocks closed sharply lower on Friday  with the S P 500 ending its worst week since August  as plunging crude oil prices compounded investor nervousness on expectations for the first U S  interest rate hike in nearly a decade 
Oil dragged down market as a whole  as investors worried whether a weakness in commodities signaled a broader slowdown 
Furthermore  investors were worried about declines in China s yuan and in high yield debt markets 
 Positioning has been clearly along the lines of taking risk exposure off   said Michael James  managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles 
The sell off gained ground ahead of the close as investors took profits on stocks such as Amazon com  O AMZN   which had performed well this year  said Dennis Dick  head of markets structure at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas 
 If you had a large oil position you need to raise cash  probably from some of your winners   he said 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 309 54 points  or 1 76 percent  to 17 265 21 with every component in the index ending down  The S P 500 lost 39 86 points  or 1 94 percent  to 2 012 37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 111 71 points  or 2 21 percent  to 4 933 47

Small caps sold off as well  The Russell 2000 index fell 5 1 percent for the week  its biggest weekly percentage decline since May 2012 
The continued plunge in oil prices added to investor uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve s expected rate hike after the U S  central bank s Dec  15 16 meeting 
Brent futures fell to an almost seven year low  while U S  crude futures fell to just above  35 a barrel after the International Energy Agency said it expected the supply glut to worsen in 2016 as demand slows and OPEC shows no signs of slowing production in its fight for market share 
Adding to the somber mood  China s yuan currency fell to its lowest in 4 1 2 years on concerns about the country s slowing economy and expectations of a U S  rate hike 
James of Wedbush said investors are worried about high yield markets  especially as it relates to high yield debt and energy needs after New York based Third Avenue Management said Thursday it was trying to liquidate a roughly  1 billion junk bond fund in the biggest failure in the U S  mutual fund industry since the 2008 financial crisis 
Tracking oil prices  the S P energy index fell 3 4 percent  leading the decliners among major S P sectors  The index has lost 11 percent since the beginning of the month in its worst month since September 2011

140127,361642,ADBE,OECD unveils proposals to curb corporate tax avoidance,news,"By Tom Bergin  LONDON  Reuters    New international tax rules proposed on Tuesday could eliminate structures that have allowed companies such as Google Inc  O GOOGL  and Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  to shave billions of dollars off their tax bills   The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  announced a series of measures that  if implemented by members  could stop companies from employing many commonly used practices to shift profits into tax havens   Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot political topic following media coverage and parliamentary investigations into the arrangements many big companies use to cut tax bills   Amazon and Google say they pay all the taxes they should  Analysts say competitive pressures force companies to seek to minimize all costs  including tax   Last year  the Group of 20 leading economies asked the OECD to develop an action plan to tackle the problem   Big U S  technology companies could be those most affected by the OECD s plans but others could also be hit  including pharmaceuticals and branded consumer goods firms  as well as many European companies   Chris Morgan  Head of Tax Policy at accountants KPMG in London  said the proposals were  balanced  and while some firms would pay more tax  big business accepted the need for change   Anti poverty charity ActionAid criticized the plans saying some of the measures envisaged would be too expensive for developing countries to implement   The draft proposals announced have been agreed by all G20 members and OECD members  which include most major industrialized countries  the OECD said in a statement   But the measures form part of a larger   tax  base erosion and profit shifting  program that will conclude next year  Only then will countries look at enshrining the results of the program in law   TREATY MISUSE  For more than 50 years  the OECD s work on international taxation has been focused on ensuring companies are not taxed twice on the same profits  The fear was that this would hamper trade and limit global growth   Over the years  the OECD has formulated a standardized model tax treaty which allows countries to split taxation rights and avoid double taxation  partly by providing reliefs from measures intended to stop tax avoidance  such as withholding taxes   But companies have been using such treaties to ensure profits are not taxed anywhere   For example  search giant Google takes advantage of tax treaties to channel more than  8 billion in untaxed profits out of Europe and Asia each year and into a subsidiary that is tax resident in Bermuda  which has no income tax   Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt has said changes to rules that increase its tax bill would hit innovation   The OECD s proposals would make amendments to its model treaty so that cross border transactions would not benefit from the reliefs in tax treaties  if a principal reason for engaging in the transactions was to avoid tax    We are putting an end to double non taxation   OECD head of tax Pascal Saint Amans said in a call with reporters   The think tank  which also advises members on economic policy  also wants curbs on how much profit companies can report in centralized intra company lending and purchasing arms  which are often based in tax havens   Where such subsidiaries generate large profits on the back of intra company trade  the OECD said the profits should be shared across the group   This could hit UK telecoms provider Vodafone Group Plc  L VOD   which has a Luxembourg subsidiary that buys telephone equipment for the group   Vodafone Procurement Company s 200 staff generated profits of more than 400 million euros   518 5 million  last year  making it one of the group s smallest but most profitable divisions  An unusual Luxembourg tax rule allowed the subsidiary to pay no tax on that profit   Vodafone said businesses across Europe already benefited from savings achieved by the Luxembourg operation and that it did not expect a significant impact on its business from the OECD measures   TAX RESIDENCE  The OECD has also proposed changes in the rules on tax residence that allow U S  tech giants to generate billions of dollars in sales in many countries but not have those revenues assessed for tax by those countries  tax authorities   A long standing rule that allows a company to operate a warehouse in a country without creating a tax residence there should be reconsidered  the OECD said   This would potentially hit Internet retailer Amazon as the warehouse exclusion allowed Amazon to channel 15 billion euros last year in European sales to a subsidiary in Luxembourg  where it can build up profits tax free   A raft of companies which sell online including Apple Inc s iTunes service  software provider Adobe Systems Inc   O ADBE  and e commerce group eBay Inc   O EBAY  could also be forced to report revenues in the countries where they are generated  if the OECD s proposal that having a  significant digital presence  in a country would also create a tax residence   A Reuters investigation last year found that three quarters of the 50 biggest U S  technology companies channeled revenues from European sales into low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Switzerland  rather than reporting them nationally   The companies all say they comply with tax rules in all the countries where they operate   Anton Hume  Global Head of Transfer Pricing at accountants BDO  said the measures could prompt companies to change their structures and move jobs out of tax havens   It may mean that a lot of activities are onshored again    However  Ireland s jobs and enterprise minister  Richard Bruton  said his country would not lose out   
 As countries move away from other tax haven situations  a good country with a very clear  certain  regime like Ireland can stand to gain   he said     Editing by Jane Merriman and David Clarke ",2014-09-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-global-plans-unveiled-to-crack-down-on-corporate-tax-avoidance-309611,309611

Adobe shares fell nearly 5 percent in extended trading 
The company said it expected adjusted profit of 26 32 cents per share on revenue of  1 03 billion  1 08 billion for the quarter ending November    
Analysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of 31 share on revenue of  1 09 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
 I think the market has come to expect perfection from this company and today was not perfect   Edward Jones technology analyst Josh Olson told Reuters 
Revenue from Adobe s digital media business  which includes the Creative Cloud and document services  fell about 2 4 percent to  621 4 million in the third quarter ended Aug  29 
Adobe has been switching to web based subscription for its Creative Suite 6 from traditional box licenses to attract more predictable recurring revenue 
Online subscriptions let customers access the latest versions of a host of software for a monthly payment 
The number of paid subscribers for Creative Cloud   including Photoshop  Illustrator and InDesign software   rose by 502 000 to 2 81 million 
 We have been accustomed to 35 percent positive surprises in terms of the subscription gains and this was really in line with expectations   Olson said 
He added that Adobe had achieved a lot of the  low hanging fruit  in shifting its existing customer base to the cloud  but the challenge now was to convince the more  resistant  customers  such as small businesses and individuals 
Revenue from Adobe s digital marketing business  which offers marketing campaign management and analytics tools  increased 8 percent to  336 6 million 
Total revenue rose 1 percent to  1 01 billion  while analysts had expected  1 02 billion 
Net income fell to  44 7 million  or 9 cents per share  from  83 million  or 16 cents per share  a year earlier 
Excluding items  Adobe earned 28 cents per share

140159,361674,ADBE,Adobe Sinks  As Market Cycles Point Lower into New Year,opinion,"Summary 

Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  traded 6  lower on Friday morning  after posting mixed earnings compared to Wall Street expectations 
Based on its market cycles  we believe this period of risk will last into the new year 


The software company reported earnings per share of  1 83 and total revenue of  2 46 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  1 89 and  2 43 billion  While guidance from management exceeded on revenue  it fell short on earnings with  1 60 versus an expected  1 88 
CEO Shantanu Narayen highlighted their recent acquisitions  pointing out that they have   resulted in record revenue and impressive growth across all our businesses   The problem of course is that they haven t helped meet expectations for the bottom line 
The market cycles for ADBE show that it is in the declining phase for the current cycle  As well  it broke below the support point  the level at which it started the cycle  This is another indication of lower prices into next year  Our target is  205 by January ",2018-12-14,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adobe-sinks-as-market-cycles-point-lower-into-new-year-200368268,200368268
140160,361675,ADBE,Adobe Systems  ADBE  Stock Moves  0 68   What You Should Know,opinion,"Adobe Systems  ADBE  closed the most recent trading day at  224 65  moving  0 68  from the previous trading session  This change was narrower than the S P 500 s daily loss of 1 54   Meanwhile  the Dow lost 1 49   and the Nasdaq  a tech heavy index  lost 2 17  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the software maker had gained 2 94  over the past month  This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector s loss of 4 64  and the S P 500 s loss of 6 77  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from ADBE as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be March 21  2019  In that report  analysts expect ADBE to post earnings of  1 63 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 5 16   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  2 54 billion  up 22 3  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  7 76 per share and revenue of  11 15 billion  These totals would mark changes of  14 79  and  23 43   respectively  from last year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for ADBE  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection has moved 5 9  lower  ADBE currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Investors should also note ADBE s current valuation metrics  including its Forward P E ratio of 29 14  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 28 16  so we one might conclude that ADBE is trading at a premium comparatively 
We can also see that ADBE currently has a PEG ratio of 1 78  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  The Computer   Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2 05 as of yesterday s close 
The Computer   Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 57  which puts it in the top 22  of all 250  industries

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Walmart   NYSE WMT    Pfizer   NYSE PFE    Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE    Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and IBM   NYSE IBM   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Top Research Reports for Walmart  Pfizer and AdobeThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Walmart  Pfizer and Adobe  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Buy rankedWalmart s shares have performed nearly in line with the Zacks Supermarkets industry over the past six months   8 6  vs   8 7    due to its focus on strengthening e commerce and store operations  The Zacks analyst thinks these factors helped the company retain its sturdy comps trend in third quarter fiscal 2019  wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter marked its third consecutive beat Notably  U S  comps rose for the 17th straight time  E commerce sales surged  courtesy of strong Walmart com and online grocery performances  These factors encouraged management to raise view  Walmart is also making efforts to improve its International unit by shifting focus to profitable countries However  the company s investment in Flipkart is expected to dent the bottom line  Further  transportation costs and a compelling pricing strategy have been hurting Walmart s gross margin for a while  Nonetheless  the Flipkart deal bodes well for the long term and should help the company stand firm against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   You can   Shares of Pfizer have outperformed its peer group year to date  the stock is up  19  over this period vs  a  3  increase for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry   The Zacks analyst likes the fact that Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio through acquisitions and licensing deals However  it is facing top line headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs  supply challenges in the legacy Hospira portfolio  pricing pressure and rising competition  Nevertheless  new products like Ibrance  cost cutting efforts  a lower tax rate and share buybacks can support bottom line growth Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and looks well positioned to deliver several potential new breakthrough innovative medicines in the next five years  which can drive long term growth  Bavencio  though approved for two small indications currently  is being considered a key long term growth driver for Pfizer if it can gain label expansion approvals  Pfizer also recently gained FDA approval for four new cancer medicines  which can boost oncology sales  You can   Adobe s shares have gained  26 4  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Software industry which has increased  13 5  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Adobe s fiscal fourth quarter revenues were benefited by contributions from Marketo acquisition and strong demand for its creative products However  higher expenses incurred on acquisitions impacted the bottom line  Nevertheless  Adobe is benefiting from growing subscriptions for its cloud application  It has been making great efforts toward establishing its presence in cloud related software areas such as documents and marketing Adobe s market position  compelling product lines  continued innovation  solid adoption of Creative Cloud and Adobe marketing cloud are major positives  But lower end market demand and exposure to Europe remain overhangs  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include

140181,361696,ADBE,Restoration Hardware  Penn National Gaming  American Eagle Outfitters  Costco Wholesale And Adobe Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release 
Chicago  IL   December 10  2018    Restoration Hardware   NYSE RH   as the Bull of the Day  Penn National Gaming   NASDAQ PENN   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO   Inc    Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST     Adobe Inc    NASDAQ ADBE   
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 
 
Stocks were battered last week  but if there s any hope for a  Santa rally   it will likely come on the back of trade war progress paired with renewed optimism about the consumer economy  If that happens  look for companies that have recently posted beat and raise quarters on the back of strong business trends 
One such example is Restoration Hardware  The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  home furnishings retailer last week posted earnings of  1 73 per share  topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 27 and growing 66  from the year ago period  This performance also surpassed RH s own guidance range of  1 15 to  1 33 per share 
Adjusted revenue in the quarter totaled  638 5 million  which marked year over year growth of 8  and beat estimates of  633 million  RH s comparable brand sales  comps  were up 4  from the prior year  which is especially impressive given that the comparable quarter saw comps growth of 6  
So what contributed to the strong performance  and can investors expect the trend to continue  Well  let s take it from management themselves 
 While the luxury housing market has sequentially slowed throughout 2018  our revenues have sequentially accelerated  despite cycling inventory reduction efforts and managing the business with a bias for earnings versus revenue growth  clearly demonstrating our ability to gain market share   the company said in its release 
And in terms of outlook  management raised its Q4 revenue guidance to range of  680 million to  690 million  up from previous guidance of  665 million to  685 million  Earnings guidance for the period was raised to  2 75 to  2 90 per share  a major increase from prior expectations of  2 33 to  2 54 per share 
RH also maintained its fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance of  2 72 billion to  2 82 billion  This would represent growth of 8  to 12   Moreover  management said it will not see a material impact from Chinese tariffs 
Shares of RH added about 11  in the day after its report  but the stock pulled back during Friday s selloff  Investors simply did not want to hold on to stocks with fresh momentum over the weekend  as another volatile week of trading likely inspired whatever profit taking was possible 
That said  RH is now trading at an incredibly attractive valuation  By late afternoon hours  the stock was at about 16 2x the midpoint of its full year EPS guidance range  This pairs well with its PEG ratio of 0 8  which is a discount to the industry s average of 1 0 and implies investors are getting a great price for the company s earnings growth outlook 
That s a brief look at the near term value and growth outlook  but one should also note that analysts have given RH a long term projected EPS growth rate of 21 9  
This is a very simple thesis  really  The overall price action in stocks right now looks relatively bearish  But with the Fed turning slightly dovish  we ve shortened our list of major headwinds down slightly  and investors will be ready to rip higher if progress is made on the trade war 
RH protects you from the worst of the trade war blues by not being materially affected by it  plus it has the perfect combination of value  growth  and earnings fundamentals that investors will pile into as the outlook for the broader market improves 
 
In this volatile  range bound market  you want to at least be sure that your holdings are supported by strong underlying business trends  This should lead us away from many casino stocks right now  including regional operators like Penn National Gaming 
Penn National is an operator of casinos and racetracks throughout the United States  It is primarily a regional operator and may be best known as the manager of the Hollywood Casino chain  although it does own and operate the Tropicana in Las Vegas as well  In total  it manages about 40 properties right now 
At first glance  one might like PENN for its unique growth prospects in the casino business  Regional gaming companies should be able to benefit from legalized sports gambling  for instance  Penn National has also proven that it can grow revenue at a rate that might others in the industry jealous  For the current quarter  the company guided for revenue growth in excess of 49  
But Penn National s growth plan is fueled by acquisitions  That top line expansion it is seeing this quarter is likely due to the closing of its deal to buy Pinnacle Entertainment  which added 12 properties to its portfolio 
Growing by acquiring is a legitimate tactic  no doubt  For savvy investors  though  this knowledge means we must look a bit deeper at the underlying business trends 
In the most recent quarter  Penn National missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both earnings and revenue  Its results were also below the company s own guidance  Management also said it expects Q4 earnings to be  0 90 per share  down from previous guidance of  1 75 per share  This type of swing and miss quarter is not what we like to see in this market climate 
Much has been said about slowdown in Vegas and Macau this year  but Penn National does not have an Asian presence  and Vegas is not a huge part of its business  Instead  it was  competitive pressures in Illinois and Mississippi   as management noted in the earnings report  which may have contributed to the soft results 
Penn National s weak earnings results and poor guidance obviously led to a plethora of negative estimate revisions from analysts  In fact  seven analysts have revised their estimates for 2018 and 2019 earnings to the downside  Our Zacks Consensus for 2018 is now relatively in line with Penn National s guidance  while the 2019 mark has plummeted 40 cents to just  1 61 per share 
Earnings  earnings estimates  and more specifically earnings estimate revisions are the crux of the Zacks Rank  This downtrend explains why PENN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   I would also point out that the stock is currently sporting just a  C  in the Value category of our Style Scores system  despite having lost about 30  in the past six months 
This suggest the recent selling has not quite brought shares down to a reasonable valuation  Indeed  PENN is trading at about 25 6x earnings  which is a premium to its industry s average of 21 8  Moreover  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 5  while the industry has an average of 1 5  This suggests the EPS growth that s supposed to come in the next fiscal year is not coming at the best price 
So why cycle money into an overpriced casino stock with an earnings outlook that just fell off a cliff  I don t think recent market price action is saying now is the time to make such a move  Overall  I m not sure many casino options look great right now

Upcoming Earnings to Watch  AEO  COST  ADBE
Stocks were sliding again on Friday morning  with investors seemingly shrugging their shoulders at the latest jobs numbers and continuing to crank up trade war based selling  This headwind is overshadowing basically all other conversations  including strong reads on earnings and revenue in many sectors 
Wall Street got what it wanted from last weekend s G20 summit  as trade representatives from the U S  and China agreed to halt new tariffs for 90 days in order to work on a longer term agreement  But that optimism was quickly erased thanks to discouraging trade related news  including a series of tweets from President Trump and the arrest of U S  backed arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou 
The trade war is now  without a doubt  the number one headwind affecting stocks  especially considering last week s surprise dovish turn from the Fed  Sure  folks are worried about a recession on the horizon  but investors are really worried about the trade war sparking a recession much sooner than expected  and that has kept stocks in a bearish range recently 
This makes it difficult for companies reporting earnings during this stretch  Investors need to see powerful beat and raised quarters during this non busy period for reports  and that is no easy task 
With that said  investors should remember to use the  to plan out their schedules for earnings  dividend announcements  and other important financial releases  This handy tool is your perfect one stop shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio 
We have made this task even easier today by selecting a few of next week s top reports to preview right now  Let s take a closer look at a few of the earnings announcements due during the week of December 10 
1  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc 
Specialty retailer American Eagle is slated to announce its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes on December 11  AEO had a great run to start the year  but the stock has now lost more than 30  since reaching five year highs in August  American Eagle will hope to reignite its earlier momentum with an impressive report 
Analysts expect the retailer to report earnings of  0 47 per share  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate  This would represent year over year growth of 27   American Eagle has seen positive and negative revisions to estimates within the last 30 days  but the overall consensus has not budged  Revenue is projected to be up nearly 8  to  1 04 billion 
2  Costco Wholesale Corp  
Big box retail giant Costco is expected to release its most recent quarterly report after the closing bell on December 13  Costco shares have added about 23  so far this year  The company posts monthly sales results and just announced that Q1 same store sales growth reached 8 8   crushing expectations  That should serve as an indicator that next week s full report will be largely positive 
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are pegged at  1 62 per share for earnings and  34 5 billion for revenue  These results would represent year over year growth rates of 19  and 9   respectively  COST is trading at roughly 30x earnings ahead of the report 
3  Adobe Inc 
Software innovator Adobe will release its earnings report after U S  markets close on December 13  A darling momentum stock for the past few years  Adobe has pulled back from its highs as investors have ditched high flying tech picks in recent months  That said  ADBE is still up over 40  in 2018 and could extend those gains with another great report 
Adobe s earnings per share are expected to improve 49  to reach  1 88 for the quarter  based on our Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenue is estimated to grow nearly 21  to total  2 42 billion  These results would bring full year earnings and revenue growth to roughly 58  and 23   respectively 
Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies 
It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation

140202,361717,ADBE,5 ETF Suggestions For Festive December,opinion,"The rituals of Santa Clause appear to be real for the broader market this year  with November glooms passing away and good news flowing in from key asset classes as soon as we stepped in December  There were expected oil output cuts from Saudi  Russia and Canada and a temporary U S  Sino trade truce 
Historically  December is the best month for stocks as the S P 500 has offered 1 53  on average with 51 years of positive returns since 1950  as   read    
Every year  traditional investors pin their hopes on the Santa Clause rally  This time  the Christmas month is likely to be merrier for the market on short term trade truce between the United States and China agreed upon in the G 20 meet and strong hopes of output cut in the oil patch 
Though there could be one glitch in the end of season rally  in the form of the fourth Fed rate hike  the move is largely priced in at the current level  Also  the Fed chair Powell has lately come up with some apparent dovish comments on the interest rate policy  which left investors relaxed  If there is no political gridlock caused by the divided congress in the United States or any downbeat news does not come up from the corporate or global front  2018 should probably see a solid Santa rally 
Investors should note that  the S P 500 s multiple has been squeezed 15  from the year ago level to   hovering around the cheapest level since early 2016  This makes it a beaten down zone at the current level and ready for a quick rebound 
Against this backdrop  investors must be interested in finding out all possible ETFs to win over the unseen or cash in on some inevitable euphoria  For them  below we have highlighted a few ETFs 
ProShares Long Online Short Stores ETF 
The retail landscape is changing  with online sales gradually taking control  Online retailing is likely to hit a home run this holiday season as evident from upbeat Thanksgiving and Black Friday data  Sales on web jumped 28  to a record  3 7 billion and 23 6  to  6 22 billion on these two events  respectively 
Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  expects online Cyber Monday sales to set another record of  7 8 billion  up nearly 18  from last year  The  is a little higher than past years  per RetailNext  read    
VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH  
Apart from the e tailing  investors should also pay attention to the overall retail spectrum in the all important holidays season  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Walmart  NYSE WMT  are top three holdings of the fund 
Invesco DWA Technology Momentum ETF   V PTF   
Tech stocks have been beaten badly of late  However  latest U S  China trade treaty may boost the space in December on cheaper valuation  This is because semiconductor and technology hard ware companies have considerable weight and are exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions  Also  holiday season buying for electronic and tech gadgets may boost the space  read    
WisdomTree Emerging Markets Quality Dividend Growth ETF 
This is yet another beneficiary of cheap valuation and U S  Sino trade ceasefire  Emerging market  EM  shares hit a two month high on Monday on trade news  Already  dovish Fed comments led EM stocks to witness their  in November  If these were not enough  the U S  Treasury yield curve inverted on Dec 3   This may keep a check on the rise in the greenback and boost EM assets   Notably  DGRE is heavy on China  South Korea  Taiwan and India 
Russell Midcap Pure Growth Invesco ETF 
While large companies are normally known for stability and the smaller ones for growth  mid caps offer the best of both  allowing growth and stability in portfolios simultaneously  These middle of road securities are arguably safer options 
A subdued greenback is good for larger stocks that are quite exposed to international affairs and economies  Thus  with this option  investors can have the benefits of both   upbeat economic activity in the United States and a rebound in some corners of the global markets

140205,361720,ADBE,Adobe Systems  ADBE  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Adobe Systems  ADBE  reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 13  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  49 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 42 billion  up 20 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Adobe 
For Adobe  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Adobe will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Adobe would post earnings of  1 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 73  delivering a surprise of  2 37  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Adobe doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/adobe-systems-adbe-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200365741,200365741
140206,361721,ADBE,Upcoming Earnings To Watch  AEO  COST  ADBE,opinion,"Stocks were sliding again on Friday morning  with investors seemingly shrugging their shoulders at the latest jobs numbers and continuing to crank up trade war based selling  This headwind is overshadowing basically all other conversations  including strong reads on earnings and revenue in many sectors 
Wall Street got what it wanted from last weekend s G20 summit  as trade representatives from the U S  and China agreed to halt new tariffs for 90 days in order to work on a longer term agreement  But that optimism was quickly erased thanks to discouraging trade related news  including a series of tweets from President Trump and the arrest of U S  backed arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou 
The trade war is now  without a doubt  the number one headwind affecting stocks  especially considering last week s surprise dovish turn from the Fed  Sure  folks are worried about a recession on the horizon  but investors are really worried about the trade war sparking a recession much sooner than expected  and that has kept stocks in a bearish range recently 
This makes it difficult for companies reporting earnings during this stretch  Investors need to see powerful beat and raised quarters during this non busy period for reports  and that is no easy task 
With that said  investors should remember to use the  to plan out their schedules for earnings  dividend announcements  and other important financial releases  This handy tool is your perfect one stop shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio 
We have made this task even easier today by selecting a few of next week s top reports to preview right now  Let s take a closer look at a few of the earnings announcements due during the week of December 10

Specialty retailer American Eagle is slated to announce its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes on December 11  AEO had a great run to start the year  but the stock has now lost more than 30  since reaching five year highs in August  American Eagle will hope to reignite its earlier momentum with an impressive report 
Analysts expect the retailer to report earnings of  0 47 per share  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate  This would represent year over year growth of 27   American Eagle has seen positive and negative revisions to estimates within the last 30 days  but the overall consensus has not budged  Revenue is projected to be up nearly 8  to  1 04 billion 
 
2  Costco Wholesale Corporation    NASDAQ COST   
Big box retail giant Costco is expected to release its most recent quarterly report after the closing bell on December 13  Costco shares have added about 23  so far this year  The company posts monthly sales results and just announced that Q1 same store sales growth reached 8 8   crushing expectations  That should serve as an indicator that next week s full report will be largely positive 
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are pegged at  1 62 per share for earnings and  34 5 billion for revenue  These results would represent year over year growth rates of 19  and 9   respectively  COST is trading at roughly 30x earnings ahead of the report 
 
3  Adobe Inc     NASDAQ ADBE   
Software innovator Adobe will release its earnings report after U S  markets close on December 13  A darling momentum stock for the past few years  Adobe has pulled back from its highs as investors have ditched high flying tech picks in recent months  That said  ADBE is still up over 40  in 2018 and could extend those gains with another great report

140254,361769,ADBE,Europe Slips On A Plunge In Oil And Italian Budget Drama  Dow Future Slumped,opinion,"The European market  Stoxx 600  is currently trading around 351 58 in the pre US session Friday slips by almost  0 28  on a plunge in oil and the never ending Italian budget drama  There are some reports that Italy may ban short sell in banks and certain other financial instruments  The market slips from earlier green 
The European market  Stoxx 600  was around 353 40 mid Friday EU session  edged up by almost  0 25  on higher USD and renewed Italian budget optimism  Techs and banks were helping  while energies dragged as oil plunged almost 6  on supply worries despite the report of some oil field shut down in the North Sea  Miners were also under stress on European as well as global growth worries 
EURUSD plunged by almost  0 45  to 1 1353 amid ongoing Italian budget jitters and terrible manufacturing PMI data from Germany and overall composite PMI data from the Eurozone  Although a subdued PMI data is negative for the overall economic prospect  a lower EUR  local currency  is also positive for the export heavy European market 
GBPUSD also slumped by over  0 40  on renewed worries about a hard Brexit as the revised exit draft is nothing but  old wine in the new bottle  and thus it would be very tough for Theresa May to sell it back home  Also  Gibraltar may be going to be another  Irish  issue for the Brexit and Spain could veto block the Brexit deal in its Parliament on  unauthorized  change in the Brexit text  draft  regarding Gibraltar without its permission  As a result of stress in EUR and GBP  the US dollar index  DXY  is up by almost  0 10  and helping the export savvy European market to some extent 
Earlier  the European market is also buoyed by a rally in Italian banks on renewed budget optimism amid ongoing drama and hopes   hypes of a budget compromise  In the latest rhetoric  Italy s Di Maio urged  dialogue  with the EU and not  war  and reiterated no cuts to key reforms  while wants to stop daily back and forth with the EU 
As a part of the daily ritual  jawboning  to keep the Italian German spread under control  relatively lower   Di Maio assured the market that the Italian government does not want to leave the euro  Di Maio also clarified that  Italy will not change the pillars of 2019 budget  while financial markets will be reassured in the coming days  Italy will show the highest of willingness to negotiate with the EU  but cannot betray Italians  
Meanwhile  Italy s Lega economic adviser Siri also clarified that the budget framework cannot be touched  although some budget measures can be improved  Elsewhere  another report suggests that Italy s EU affairs minister Savona may resign in a sign of dissent with the government s strategy to challenge EU budget rules  Although Savona denied the report of his resignation  there  can t be smoke without fire   Savona s resignation is positive for the Italian budget truce  despite he is a known hardline Eurosceptic
On Wednesday  some reports suggest that Savona is strongly in favor of amending the budget law  while Italy s agriculture minister denies reports about Savona backing budget changes  said Savona never voiced concerns during cabinet meetings  Thus Savona s reported resignation dissent may be indicating that all is not well within the Italian  bizarre  coalition government  which is under severe pressure from rising spreads and also from all sides to revise their 2019 budget plan as per permissible EU rules  Moody s said Italy s escalating tensions with the EU will likely to keep Italy s funding costs high and increase risks to the economy 
Earlier  European stocks also inched up as Italian political risks eased after the yield on Italy s 10 year government bond dropped to a 2 week low of 3 352  when Italian Deputy PM Di Maio said there are  margins  for a dialog with the EU  
Also  Italian Prime Minister Conte said his government would ask the EU to delay any infringement procedure as it works to resolve its budget standoff with the EU   However  gains in European stocks were limited on signs of a slowdown in the Eurozone economy after the Eurozone Nov Markit manufacturing PMI dropped to a 2 1 2 year low of 51 5  not very far from the boom bust line of 50 0  Italy s FTSE MIB 100 is currently trading around 18620  surged by almost  0 10   but well off the earlier high of 18785 50 
 
Germany 30
Germany s export heavy Dax 30 slumped by  0 25  to around 11113 on subdued economic data  GDP PMI  amid Auto Car emission issues and Trump trade war  US China   Dax made a high of 11205 89 earlier in the day on lower EUR

Dow future is now down by over  150 points  while SPX 500 slumped by almost  0 75  to 2629 on lower oil  energies   higher USD and renewed concern about US China trade truce in a holiday thinned market amid a report of US attempt to block using equipment from China s Huawei Technologies in other countries  allies  
On Thursday  Trump said   China wants to make a deal on trade very badly because of tariffs and if we can make a deal  we will   Trump is clearly pressurizing China for a deal ahead of his meeting with Xi  but this hard negotiation tactic could backfire  resulting in no trade deal and more protracted  war of attrition  
Retailers are also under stress on the concern of earnings and operating margin amid a record of discounted black Friday sales and shopping seasons  But the overall market could also get support on signs of a strong start to the holiday shopping season  consumer spending  after Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  Analytics said the US consumers spent about  2 billion online till now Thursday  up almost 30  from a year ago   Also  researcher Consumer Growth estimated Black Friday sales my produce  24 billion in sales

WTI Oil
Meanwhile  oil  WTI  seems to be also under black Friday discount sales as it plummeted by over 6  to a low of 51 28 amid oversupply worries despite the report of some oil field shut down in the North Sea  On Thursday  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid said Saudi Arabia is producing in excess of 10 7 mbpd  which would be a new record 
Khalid said   The production in November is above October level as there is no slowdown in production  But demand for foreign oil in January will be lower and that Saudi Arabia will respond   Saudi Arabia may be now more inclined to keep Trump happy in the Thanksgiving Day holiday driving season  by lower gasoline prices  as Trump is playing with the  Khashoggi murder Trump card  in this game of oil   geopolitics 
On Thursday  Trump tweeted  praising Saudi Arabia   It s a mean   nasty world out there  the Middle East in particular  This is a long and historic commitment    one that is absolutely vital to America s national security    SecPompeo  I agree 100   In addition  many Billions of Dollars of purchases made in U S   big Jobs   Oil  
Trump is supporting Saudi Arabia Crown Prince for this  oil and jobs  despite the thriller story of  Khashoggi  killing and the Saudi Crown Prince is also  rewarding  Trump by pumping more oil  Trump contradicts CIA on the killing of Khashoggi  says agency  had feelings  but did not firmly place blame on Saudi crown prince Salman 
On the Thanksgiving Day holiday  speaking to reporters at his Florida resort  Trump said the CIA had not come to the conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Khashoggi  Trump basically brushed aside the intelligence community s assessment that the crown prince had ordered the killing and reiterated that Saudi Arabia was too valuable an ally to lose over the incident   I hate the crime   I hate the cover up  I will tell you this   The crown prince hates it more than I do  
As a reminder  Trump tweeted on Wednesday  before going for the Thanksgiving Day holiday   Oil prices getting lower  Great  Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World  Enjoy   54  was just  82  Thank you to Saudi Arabia  but let s go lower

140255,361770,ADBE,Is The Pop In USD JPY Durable ,opinion,"Daily FX Market Roundup 11 26 18
By Kathy Lien  Managing Director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management 
The best performing currency pair today was USD JPY  which broke out of a 5 day long consolidation to trade above 113 50  A number of factors contributed to today s moves but the primary driver was strong Black Friday sales  According to Adobe  Analytics  which tracks transactions from 80 of the top 100 internet retailers  online sales hit a record  6 22 billion this Friday  up 23 6  from last year while Mastercard  NYSE MA  projects that overall sales will top  23 billion  Adobe expects consumers to spend another  7 8 billion on Cyber Monday  which would represent a whopping 18  increase from last year s levels  As the one day event turns into a week long sales drive  retailers have done solid job of drawing out consumers  At these rates we could be looking at a retail recovery that is good for not only equities but also currencies  The S P 500 s 1 5  rally along with the increase in Treasury yields also helped to drive USD JPY higher  With the currency pair now trading back above the 20 day SMA  the momentum has shifted back to upside with USD JPY eyeing a move to 114  No major U S  economic reports were released today but tomorrow  house prices and consumer confidence numbers are scheduled for release   unfortunately we don t think either one of these reports will help the dollar because stocks tumbled sharply this month 
Also  President Trump isn t approaching the G20 meeting with optimism   Today he told the Wall Street Journal that its highly unlikely they will postpone additional China tariffs  Not only does he expect to move ahead with 25  tariffs on  200B of Chinese goods but he even suggested that iPhones and laptops imported from China could be subjected to a 10  tariff  We haven t been hopeful going into the Trump Xi meeting and these latest comments from the U S  President reinforce our view that no meaningful progress will be made at the upcoming talks and if we are right  further trade tensions would make it difficult for USD JPY to sustain its gains  With these comments in tow  it should be no surprise that the Australian and New Zealand dollars were the day s worst performing currencies  Although AUD fell more than NZD  New Zealand retail sales were very disappointing   economists had hoped for a 1  increase in Q3 retail sales but instead spending stagnated  As for the Canadian dollar  the rise in the greenback prevented the loonie from reacting to the recovery in oil prices 
Meanwhile EUR USD fell to its lowest level in 6 trading days on the back of U S  dollar strength and cautious ECB comments  According to ECB President Draghi  recent economic data has been weaker than expected and while some of the slowdown may be temporary  prevailing uncertainties call for patience  These worries were reinforced by the lower German IFO business confidence report  Draghi feels that world growth momentum has slowed considerably and while inflation has been going up  it is expected to decline in the coming months  The central bank is still expected to end bond purchases in December but the usage of the words  at current time  to describe their plans to halt bond buying raised some concerns that they could reconsider if the global economy weakens materially over the next few weeks  Since we don t expect a shock in the financial markets before the December 13th monetary policy meeting  the ECB should go ahead but all signs point to dovish guidance and lower economic projections  The ECB s worries overshadowed reports that Italy could be willing to bring its fiscal deficit targets back in line with the EU s requirements  With EUR USD ending the day at its lows  a test of 1 13 seems likely 
EU leaders have approved the Brexit Withdrawal agreement but instead of rising  sterling ended the day unchanged because investors know that the big challenge now is Parliament   Prime Minister may needs 320 votes to pass the Brexit deal and there are 650 seats in Parliament  She should have at least 316 conservative votes but there s almost no chance that she ll get any of the 10 DUP votes so her job will be to convince members of the opposition Labour party to support her deal  It will be an uphill battle because Labour thinks most of their members will reject her agreement but there are Labour rebels and Brexit supporters who could be swayed  Parliament will vote on the deal on December 11th so between now and then  GBP will most likely trade in range as the skeptics hold out for a final outcome ",2018-11-26,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-pop-in-usdjpy-durable-200362485,200362485

140297,361812,ADBE,Here s What Will Shape Medtronic s  MDT  Fate In Q2 Earnings,opinion,"Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT   is scheduled to report second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Nov 20  before the opening bell 
In the last reported quarter  the company delivered earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 4   In fact  Medtronic s bottom line outpaced estimates in all the trailing four reported quarters  the average being 4 3  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Key Catalysts
We look forward to another quarter of solid growth on the company s successful execution of three growth strategies such as therapy innovation  globalization and an increase in Medtronic s economic value  Combined with the demographics of an aging population  these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic  which should further get reflected in the fiscal second quarter 
The space for therapy innovation is filled with multiple developments  Under the Cardiac and Vascular Group  CVG   new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets for left ventricular assist device  LVAD   transcatheter aortic valve replacement  TAVR   drug coated balloons  atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise

   In the to be reported quarter  Medtronic is expected to have maintained a decent market share in the core pacing banking on the back of a continued rollout of the company s Micra Transcatheter Pacing System and the Azure next generation family of pacemakers 
The company is expected to register strong growth in its ICD  implantable cardioverter defibrillator  and CRT  cardiac resynchronization therapy  product lines within the scope of CRHF  cardiac rhythm and heart failure   banking on product launch and creation of meaningful markets 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVG revenues in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at  2 84 billion  2 5  higher than the year ago number of  2 77 billion 
In the last reported quarter  Medtronic registered mid single digit revenue growth in Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  MITG  and Restorative Therapies Group  RTG  plus mid twenty s growth in diabetes 
In the quarter to be reported  Medtronic is anticipated to have retained its market share in the MITG  riding on the strength of Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy  The company is also expected to benefit from a continued strong momentum in robotic assisted surgery platform 
Medtronic is currently confident about its ability to grow MITG in the band of 4 4 5  during 2018  Particularly  for the fiscal second quarter  MITG revenues are expected to register 5 5 5  growth 
Within RTG  despite ongoing challenges in the Spine market  the company is once again projected to register a robust progress  particularly in Brain   Pain divisions 
Considering its flourish within the brain division  Medtronic is fast capturing the endovascular therapy market for the treatment of ischemic strokes leading to high teens growth in neurovascular  This apart  the company s strength of imaging  navigation  robotic and ablation systems are driving growth in neurosurgery  We expect this momentum to continue into the yet to be reported quarter as well 
Within Pain  the company is receiving a positive customer uptake from an array of new offerings in Spinal Cord Stim including Intellis stimulator  Evolve workflow algorithm and Snapshot reporting 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTG revenues in the soon to be reported quarter stands at  1 93 billion reflecting 3 5  growth over the year ago figure 
Within Diabetes  Medtronic is likely to have sustained U S  patient demand for its MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system  Outside the United States  the company is witnessing strong demand for 640G system  Also  in the fiscal first quarter  the company launched 670G in the international markets  This should further boost its international diabetes revenues in the yet to be reported quarter 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes revenues in the fiscal second quarter stands at  552 million  19 5  higher than the prior year number 
Here s What the Quantitative Model Predicts 
Our proven Zacks model clearly indicates that the company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has high chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  
Medtronic has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  Therefore  such combination makes earnings beat unlikely for the stock this season  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to surpass on earnings in the upcoming releases

140305,361820,ADBE,Qualtrics IPO And The Growth Of Subscription Tech Businesses,opinion,"Investors have only a few days until Utah tech company Qualtrics launches one of the more tantalizing IPOs of the year  Business Insider reports that Qualtrics  plans to raise as much as  495 million by offering 23 6 million shares in total  at the price range of  18 to  21   The company would achieve a market value of  4 8 billion  nearly double its valuation compared to last year 
Investors have many reasons to be interested in this company  which reports excellent financial numbers and solid growth  Furthermore  Qualtrics s success indicates how tech business can thrive and become profitable using a subscription model  Plenty of other  similar businesses such as SurveyMonkey  NASDAQ SVMK  and Zscaler  NASDAQ ZS  have gone public in 2018  but Qualtrics shows how much farther this business model can climb 
Customer Acquisition And Growth
Qualtrics plans to list on the NASDAQ under the banner  XM   and it has picked such an unusual name to honor its unique  Experience Management  software  The company argues on its website that its software can help businesses  engage customers on their terms  and provide great experiences  which turn customers loyal  What Qualtrics provides is beyond standard CRM or customer service data  and it operates in a wide variety of industries 
Qualtrics states in its SEC report that  our XM  Platform is used by over 9 000 customers globally  including over 75  of the Fortune 100   Despite having coming so far  the company does correctly point out that businesses across the globe are more interested in offering a great experience and estimates its total addressable market to be  44 billion in 2018 
As a result  the company has both avenues to expand and acquire new customers with a digital customer experience and also has done a fantastic job getting more from its existing customers  Qualtrics has a net retention of 122   and has stayed above 120  for each of the last seven quarters  This means that it has an established record of being able to get more out of its customers and also reduces the chances that its customers will leave to a new competitor 
Other companies like Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  have expressed interest in copying Qualtrics s customer experience data approach  but it would likely be difficult for Qualtrics s existing customers to leave for a competitor  Qualtrics is also not overly dependent on any one customer  with no single company making up more than 2  of its revenue 
All of these factors mean that Qualtrics has a loyal and diverse customer base  can easily stand up to future competition  and has potential to grow  These factors in and of themselves show its potential as an investment 
Qualtrics s Finances
Qualtrics s are excellent for an IPO  as it reports high revenue growth and small net profitability  Revenue has risen from  190 million in the entire 2016 FY to  289 million in just the first three quarters of 2018 
Qualtrics is primarily a subscription based tech company as noted above  and so its successful financial profile shows that tech based subscriptions can be reliably profitably and continue to grow  However  a peculiar note is that the Qualtrics s subscription based revenue has consistently stayed at around 75  of total revenue going back to 2016 
This is different from other tech IPOs  where you generally see higher margin subscription revenue make up a growing percentage of total revenue compared to other  lower margin services  This is not a major concern given that Qualtrics s has kept a high gross profit and seen it rise from 68  to 73  over the past two years  But those who choose to invest in Qualtrics should hope to see subscription revenue increase at the expense of  Research on Demand  or professional services 
Despite this slight concern over subscription revenue  Qualtrics is a business with great financial numbers overall  including positive cash flow and acceptable levels of debt 
Valued Properly
A market cap of nearly  5 billion may seem large if you point out that Qualtrics earned less than  300 million in 2017  But revenue grew by over 52  from 2016 to 2017  If we assume that revenue growth declines to 40   which incidentally is the rate of growth comparing the first three quarters of 2018 compared to 2017 y y  Qualtrics will close out 2018 with a revenue of  405 million 
The end result is a forward ratio of 11 8  which is perfectly reasonable compared to other tech subscription companies and Qualtrics s competitors  Adobe has a current PS ratio of 14 6  while Zscaler sits at 16 3  Even if Qualtrics has a major first day bump  this could still be a value investment   
A Stock For The Future
Everything listed above should make it clear that Qualtrics  especially at its current price  portends to be a fantastic stock to hold onto and watch grow  There are certainly some questions about whether it will remain a good value after the first few days of trading  and investors may want to wait to see if the price drops before buying  But overall  Qualtrics is absolutely a stock to put in your portfolio ",2018-11-09,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualtrics-ipo-and-the-growth-of-subscription-tech-businesses-200357664,200357664
140311,361826,ADBE,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Adobe  ADBE ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Adobe Systems  ADBE   This company  which is in the Zacks Computer   Software industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This software maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 08  
For the most recent quarter  Adobe was expected to post earnings of  1 69 per share  but it reported  1 73 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 37   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 54 per share  while it actually produced  1 66 per share  a surprise of 7 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Adobe  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Adobe currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 19   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on December 13  2018 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-adobe-adbe-200358797,200358797

Coming into today  shares of the software maker had lost 0 56  in the past month  In that same time  the Computer and Technology sector lost 5 26   while the S P 500 lost 1 27  
Investors will be hoping for strength from ADBE as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be December 13  2018  In that report  analysts expect ADBE to post earnings of  1 88 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 49 21   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  2 42 billion  up 20 8  from the prior year quarter 
ADBE s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  6 80 per share and revenue of  8 99 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  57 77  and  23 11   respectively 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for ADBE  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook

140384,361899,ADBE,Stocks Were Flat Last Week  Even Though Nature Of Market Has Changed,opinion,"Summary 
  The stock market was flat last week  with the S P 500  SPX  up 1 point to 2768   Stocks rallied 2  on earnings optimism but then gave it up after the Trump administration took a step back from Saudi Arabia    Our projection is for the SPX to rally and then move to the downside over the coming two weeks  with a target of 2710  
While stocks were flat last week  the nature of the markets has changed  as I pointed out in the latest Market Week show  This is reflected in the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  which bumped around near 20  after having fell to below 12 earlier this month 
With stocks having declined 4  last week  traders breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday  pushing the major indexes up over 2   This was the result of stocks being oversold short term  and also on positive news from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   and Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  
Stocks then wobbled on Wednesday  after the minutes of the Federal Reserve indicated that   Participants generally anticipated that further gradual increases for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained economic expansion  
Another theme last week was the recent gradual decline of the Chinese yuan to just under 7 per dollar  As Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin explained   This poses major challenges to achieving fairer and more balanced trade  We will continue to monitor and review China s currency practices 
On Thursday  the market took a spill  even with the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index coming in above estimates  The downtick occurred after Mnuchin announced that he would not attend the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia  This was taken as a sign of the deterioration in the US Saudi relationship as a result of the recent incident with Jamal Khashoggi 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Saudi leaders had assured him that they would conduct an investigation that would be   transparent for everyone to see  to ask questions about and to acquire   Mnuchin said he would still travel to Saudi Arabia to attend a meeting on combating terrorism financing 
These are some of the factors that are continuing to contribute to our observation that the nature of the stock market has changed  To build upon this  we see rallies continuing to fail  resulting in stronger impulses to the downside versus the upside 
Our approach to technical analysis uses market cycles to project price action  For the coming two weeks  our analysis of the S P 500 is for stocks to attempt a minor rally  chop around  and then move more strongly to the downside  Our target is the intraday low from the previous impulse lower of 2710  Overall for this week  we expect the SPX to move lower ",2018-10-20,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-were-flat-last-week-even-though-the-nature-of-this-market-has-changed-200349497,200349497

Forecast for growth in online retail sales is significantly higher than the 2 7  increase predicted for brick and mortar retail stores  indicative of growing consumer preference for online shopping over physical retail outlets 
The growth was predicted by Adobe Analytics  the web analytics wing of Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE    on Nov 1  The company analyzes more than 55 million products sold by retailers in the United States 
Given the promising forecast for online spending  retail businesses that majorly operate by means of their online stores could be promising bets 
Retailers With Significant Online Presence to Win
According to the Adobe forecast  the five day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday will generate  23 4 billion worth of online sales 
Cyber Monday could contribute  7 8 billion to the total online sales  followed by Black Friday and Thanksgiving s  5 9 billion and  3 3 billion  respectively 
The report cited that businesses that have strong online presence along with their brick and mortar outlets will witness significant spike in sales  given that consumers prefer to check out their online selection at a store before ordering it online 
 For most retailers now  the online and offline experiences are blending together much more   director of Adobe Digital Insights  Taylor Schreiner  told Observer 
Schreiner s insight was based on the fact that the trend of merging online and offline experiences can be witnessed in Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and launching Amazon Go 
 Now competition among retailers is for who can best fulfill customer expectations in both the real and virtual worlds  The focus on both online and offline certainly changes the competitive landscape   Schreiner added 
The overall November December period sales are likely to increase between 4 3  and 4 8  this year  the National Retail Foundation cited in October

140421,361936,ADBE,Salesforce Strengthens Its AI Capabilities With An  800 Million Purchase,opinion,"The relationship management software company has announced its fourth acquisition this year 
Enterprise software company Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM  recently announced yet another buyout deal in 2018  this time of artificial intelligence  AI  provider Datorama  It s been a busy year for Salesforce    it made its largest purchase ever just a few months ago with the addition of MuleSoft  and it has seen top line growth reaccelerate as it makes more inroads into the software industry 
This latest move won t cause the same stir as MuleSoft did  but it is nevertheless an important one for investors to consider 
A list of the spoils
After a year long hiatus  Salesforce is back on the prowl    2016 was an active year with a total of 12 buyouts  and 2018 is on track to be nearly as busy  Included in the purchases this year was MuleSoft  which topped its  2 8 billion acquisition of Demandware back in 2016 by a hefty sum 

Why Datorama 
To date  the primary goal of Salesforce s shopping spree was to add a fifth segment to its cloud based offerings  integration cloud  which it accomplished with MuleSoft  CloudCraze was a small company that will be used to supplement its fast growing marketing and commerce cloud by helping business to business commerce migrate to a digital format  Datorama is a much larger addition that will further bolster this up and coming segment 
Datorama is AI for the retail industry  The company s technology helps marketers make sense of their advertising campaign data from across all channels  improving decision making on a campaign to help increase consumer engagement  Datorama boasts that over 3 000 brands from around the globe use its service  including names like PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   Unilever  LON ULVR   Live Nation Entertainment Inc  NYSE LYV  subsidiary Ticketmaster  and travel site Trivago NV  NASDAQ TRVG  
Datorama will be used to supplement the AI capabilities Salesforce already offers through its built in  Einstein  software  Existing retail customers will be able to leverage the new service in its marketing campaigns  As for Datorama customers  CEO Ran Sarig says they will receive even faster and better support now that the company is part of the Salesforce family 
The marketing and commerce cloud segment is getting some attention  and for good reason  E commerce is quickly reshaping the retail industry  and it shows up in Salesforce s numbers  Marketing and commerce is the smallest segment at Salesforce  making up only 15  of revenue in the last reported quarter  However  it s by far the fastest growing segment  increasing 41  from the same period a year ago 
Helping the industry with its marketing and selling capabilities is a natural fit for Salesforce  its biggest money maker remains its customer relationship management software  so marketing and e commerce is hardly a stretch  The company has competition in that space  though  including Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE   which bought e commerce company Magento a few months ago  and e commerce software leader Shopify Inc  NYSE SHOP  
Salesforce has momentum on its side in that expanding division  but it could be doing better  Shopify s subscription based revenues grew 61  in the first quarter of 2018  Thus  while the marketing and commerce cloud s growth of 41  is nothing to scoff at  bigger gains are out there for the taking  With Salesforce making a push to hit  20 billion in revenue in the next few years    a 50  increase from this year s expected top line    Datorama s AI software could be a key piece of the puzzle to help the company reach its ambitions ",2018-07-30,Nicholas Rossolillo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/salesforce-strengthens-its-ai-capabilities-with-an-800-million-purchase-200334463,200334463

Gold raced towards a new two week high  which was attributed by some commentators to the weaker Dollar due expectations that the US and China still could reach a trade deal  Other precious metals  such as silver and platinum also gained  with platinum on track for the fourth consecutive day of higher prices

140449,361964,ADBE,Computer Software Stock Outlook  Growth Prospects Solid,opinion,"The Computer Software industry is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation demand environment Software has become the focal point of technological innovation  The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing  predictive analysis  artificial intelligence  AI   self driving vehicles  digital personal assistants and Internet of Things  IoT   consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry Moreover  continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software as a Service  SaaS  presents significant growth opportunity for industry players Notably  the cloud offers a flexible and cost effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems Additionally  the increasing need to secure cloud platforms  amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking  continues to drive demand for cyber security software Further  as enterprises continue to move their on premise workload to cloud environments  emergence of hybrid cloud   application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance  This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud based environments Industry Returns PositiveRobust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth  These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry s growth prospects The   within the broader   has outperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year 
One Year Price Performance
While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34 1   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13 7  and 19 2   respectively We believe the near term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement Stretched Valuation a ConcernHowever  the Computer Software industry s valuation looks stretched at the moment  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its price to earnings ratio  P E   which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings Notably  a lower P E ratio is always better The industry currently has a forward 12 month P E ratio of 26 65  which is close to the highest level over the past year The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large  as the forward 12 month P E ratio for the S P 500 is 17 14 and the median level is 18 28 
Price to Earnings Ratio  F12M 

Moreover  a comparison of the group s P E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium  The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector s forward 12 month P E ratio of 19 71 and the median level of 20 50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry s respective ratios 
Price to Earnings Ratio  F12M 

Improving Earnings Outlook to Drive OutperformanceNevertheless  strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead  One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies  Empirical research shows that a company s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock One could get a good sense of a company s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year s reported number  but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of  3 13 per share reflects solid year over year improvement  Moreover  the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late 
Price and Consensus  Zacks Computer Software Industry
Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group s earnings potential The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2 6  upward since Mar 31  2018 
Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued outperformance in the near term The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  63  which places it at the top 25  of more than 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks 

Long Term Growth Prospects StrongThe long term  3 5 years  EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising  The group s mean estimate of long term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11 89   This compares to 9 8  for the Zacks S P 500 composite 
Mean Estimate of Long Term EPS Growth Rate

Computer Software s long term growth prospects are alluring  Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models  rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools  the proliferation of wearables   self driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry Moreover  the growing usage of Internet of Things  IoT  at home  in office  for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver  These factors are expected to drive top line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016 
 

Moreover  another indication of solid long term prospects is the improvement in the group s gross margin 
 
Bottom LineThe role of software is evolving  Apart from running devices and applications  its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure  Moreover  the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition SaaS companies are expected to register strong top line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues  subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate  Moreover  strong spending by enterprises is a positive Moreover  software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump s repatriation policy  This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions Despite stretched valuations  investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook Here  we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see   ANSYS  Inc   ANSS   The stock of this Pittsburgh  PA based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45 1  over the past year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year EPS has increased 1 9  over the last 60 days

140472,361987,ADBE,The 3 Rules Of A Bull Market ,opinion,"When I talk to investors about the stock market  I still hear all the reasons that it s time to be cautious and the end is near 
But all my experience tells me differently  And while I have often thought this year that the market must be in its 6th or 7th inning  I have few fundamental reasons to believe that it couldn t keep making new highs for another two to three years 
So as I look back at the portfolios and the body of content I ve created over the years to help investors profit  I wondered if I could simplify the message even further 
I often prefer not to over simplify  leaning instead toward parsing out the complexities and nuances of economic matters 
But my work does have the same persistent themes  And so I realized  I could very easily crystallize them into 3 rules  and just ten words total 
In the video that accompanies this article  I go back over some of those messages from the past nine years of this bull market 
Then I summarize them all with my  3 Rules  
My hope is that this video becomes teaching tool for investors age 8 to 88 because its lessons will certainly stand the test of time in the next bull market  and the one after that too 
In the video  I also promise some useful links   
For a review of my latest fundamental update on BABA in case you missed it  here was my May ZU Strategy Session presentation  It s the last clip at minute 44 20

The Moral of the Bull s Story

Finally  here was the message I offered on  back in January   
Cooker s Melt Up Recipe
Three ingredients for a  melt up recipe  that investors can profit from 
1  Multiple Expansion Is Under Control  We may be in the 6th inning of this bull market  but multiple expansion isn t yet as high as it was at the peak of other bull rallies like 1999 2000  There could still be more upside to go 
2  Competition  There s less stock and more investors  Additionally  Wall Street  unlike most retail investors  has to buy  but doesn t have to sell 
3  No global macro worries  Whatever happened to the Eurozone crisis or China having a hard landing  For the first time in a decade  the global economy is in sync and growing at the same time with virtually no economic crises looming

Three ingredients for a  melt up recipe  that investors can profit from 
1  Multiple Expansion Is Under Control  We may be in the 6th inning of this bull market  but multiple expansion isn t yet as high as it was at the peak of other bull rallies like 1999 2000  There could still be plenty more upside to go

Granted  the market headed into a 10  correction right after that on new global macro worries about a trade war  But I also warned Zacks Ultimate members about the temporary  exuberance  in stocks 2 weeks prior

The Chemistry and Culture of Emotion
Since I began the Mind Over Money podcast in November of 2016  I have frequently read from books by two different groups of scientists that form the foundation of my knowledge about human psychology in markets and beyond 
The first group is  of course  the behavioral theorists like Daniel Kahneman  Richard Thaler  and Dan Ariely who have helped create the field of behavioral economics  and its smaller niches in finance and trading 
The second group is composed of the neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio  John Ratey  and Candace Pert  discoverer of the opiate receptor  who have taught me much about the latest discoveries in the structure and function of our incredibly complex brains 
I just started reading the new book by Lisa Feldman Barrett  PhD  this week and I offer some initial reactions on the podcast  Dr  Barrett is a University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University  with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital 
In addition to the book How Emotions are Made  The Secret Life of the Brain  Dr  Barrett has published over 200 peer reviewed  scientific papers appearing in Science  Nature Neuroscience  and other top journals in psychology and cognitive neuroscience  as well as six academic volumes published by Guilford Press  She has also given a popular TED talk 
Dr  Barrett received a National Institutes of Health Director s Pioneer Award for her revolutionary research on emotion in the brain  These highly competitive  multimillion dollar awards are given to scientists of exceptional creativity who are expected to transform biomedical and behavioral research 
Despite my natural attraction and openness to any book about the brain  I actually had some initial reactions of resistance and confusion when I first started reading the introduction  Dr  Barrett s  point of attack  seemed to be on the cultural and even scientific misconceptions about how emotions are created 
After reading nearly two dozen books by other neuroscientists  I guess I assumed that much of the confusion had already been cleared up  But at 320 pages  with a 45 page bibliography and 40  pages of notes  the book appears to offer several months of instruction and insight 
And so I am more than willing to give the expert the benefit of the doubt as I dive in this summer 
Be sure to check out the full podcast to hear me read a few paragraphs from the book and offer my amateur observations  whatever those are worth 
And don t forget to watch my video  and to share it with friends and fellow investors you know  be they anywhere from 8 to 88

140493,362008,ADBE,Is Adobe Systems  ADBE  Stock Outpacing Its Computer And Technology Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Computer and Technology space have likely heard of Adobe Systems  ADBE   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Computer and Technology peers  we might be able to answer that question 
Adobe Systems is one of 632 companies in the Computer and Technology group  The Computer and Technology group currently sits at  8 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group

140494,362009,ADBE,Should PowerShares Dynamic Large Cap Growth Portfolio  PWB  Be On Your Investing Radar ,opinion,"If you re interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market  look no further than the PowerShares Dynamic Large Cap Growth Portfolio  PWB   a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 03 03 2005 
The fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares  It has amassed assets over  587 01 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market 
Why Large Cap Growth
Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above  10 billion  Overall  they are usually a stable option  with less risk and more sure fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies 
Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates  While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market  they also have higher valuations  Additionally  growth stocks have a greater level of risk associated with them  Compared to value stocks  growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market  but don t perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments 
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts  other things remaining the same 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 57   putting it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 0 60  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund s holdings before investing  Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector  about 42 10  of the portfolio  Industrials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Chevron Corp  CVX  accounts for about 3 77  of total assets  followed by Adobe Systems Inc  ADBE  and Mastercard Inc  MA  
The top 10 holdings account for about 34 81  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
PWB seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Large Cap Growth Intellidex Index before fees and expenses  The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation while maintaining consistent stylistically accurate exposure 
The ETF has gained about 8 11  so far this year and was up about 29 39  in the last one year  as of 05 18 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  35 23 and  45 21 
The ETF has a beta of 0 90 and standard deviation of 13 99  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 50 holdings  it has more concentrated exposure than peers 
Alternatives
PowerShares Dynamic Large Cap Growth Portfolio carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3  Hold   which is based on expected asset class return  expense ratio  and momentum  among other factors  Thus  PWB is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market  Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space 
The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF  IWF  and the PowerShares QQQ  QQQ  track a similar index  While iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF has  41 55 B in assets  PowerShares QQQ has  62 48 B  IWF has an expense ratio of 0 20  and QQQ charges 0 20  
Bottom Line
Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost  transparency  flexibility and tax efficiency  They are excellent vehicles for long term investors

In the last year alone  Adobe Systems  revenue has grown by 24 72   That s a solid sign for Adobe Systems stock owners 
We like to invest in companies that grow their sales  A growing top line is a sign of a healthy business 
For now  Adobe Systems will continue to pull in revenue  So let s take a closer look at the company s total financial health  And the best way to do that is by looking at its balance sheet  Adobe Systems  cash comes in at  6 billion and the company s debt is  2 billion 

Adobe Systems  cash pile is larger than its total debt  This and a steady cash flow has allowed the company to buy back shares 
What Is Adobe s Stock Worth 
Let s look at a few key ratios to determine the value of Adobe Systems stock 
Price to Earnings   P E   This ratio comes in at 60 82 for Adobe Systems  That s high  A high P E ratio shows that investors are already expecting high earnings growth 
Price to Book  P B   This ratio is a cornerstone for value investors  A lower number here indicates a better value play  And at 13 08  Adobe Systems looks expensive  but P B varies greatly based on the industry 
These two metrics are a great place to start when valuing a company  but your analysis should go much deeper ",2018-03-27,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-close-look-at-adobe-systems-200301058,200301058

140541,362056,ADBE,Why Did Adobe  ADBE  Stock Hit A New High On Wednesday ,opinion,"Shares of Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE   climbed over 2 2  to hit a new all time high on Wednesday  roughly one week before the company is set to report its first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results 
With no big news to speak of  it seems that investors are simply showing their confidence ahead of the company s upcoming Q1 report and with good reason  Before today s jump  shares of Adobe had skyrocketed nearly 77  over the last year and almost 23  in the last 12 weeks

140582,362097,ADBE,4 Trade Ideas For A Move Higher In Adobe  Bonus Idea ,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  ran higher under trend resistance until it gapped up over it in October  It continued higher and then pulled back  As is often the case  prior resistance became support after a minor break down and then stock price bounced in December  It ran to atop in late January and then pulled back again with a long lower shadow also stopping at trend support  The reversal from there is back at the prior top going into the week 
A break of resistance to a new all time high would give a target short term on a Measured Move to 214 50  At present there is no resistance above 204  Support lower comes at 196 and 185 50 then 180  Short interest is low in the stock at less than 1   The stock pays no dividend and the company is expected to report earnings next on March 15th 
The weekly options chain shows the largest open interest above on the call side at the 205 strike  but with some size from 180 to 190 on the put side below  The March options chain covers the earnings report and shows traders expecting a move of about  14 or nearly 7  by then  It also shows the largest open interest at 195 on the put side and 210 on the call side 
Adobe Systems  Ticker   ADBE
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 204 with a stop at 199 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 204 and add a March 200 190 Put Spread   4 00  as protection through earnings  Sell the April 220 Calls   3 00  to cover most of the cost of protection 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the March 9 Expiry April 210 Call Calendar   4 65   Sell the March 190 Puts   2 65  to lower the cost 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the April 190 210 Bullish Risk Reversal   1 50  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed on Friday  which  with February Options Expiration behind  sees the equity markets recovering substantially from their first correction in 2 years 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue higher in its new uptrend while Crude Oil also resumes the path higher  The US Dollar Index looks better to the downside and US Treasuries are biased lower  Both are entering major trend change territory  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets have reversed their moves lower with the Chinese market still a bit weak 
Volatility continues to drift lower  easing the pressure on the equity markets  The equity index ETFs SPY  IWM and QQQ all had strong moves higher on the week  retracing at least 61 8  of the moves lower  All three ended the week with possible reversal candles on the shorter timeframe though  but with strong charts on the longer timeframe  Perhaps some short term weakness remains  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Stocks move higher as tax reform and data bolster fresh record highs

140659,362174,ADBE,Overcapacity Or Opportunity  2 Retail REITs To Bet On,opinion,The end of Cyber Monday  a day which witnesses the single largest volume of online purchases  is possibly a good time to take stock of e commerce s fortunes  Fresh estimates from Adobe Systems Inc   NASDAQ ADBE  indicate that expenditure via the e commerce route registered a near 17  increase to hit  6 6 billion this Cyber Monday In fact  the holiday season as a whole will see online expenditure touch nearly  107 billion  more than 11  of total retail holiday sales  While this is great news for the likes of Amazon com  Inc   NASDAQ AMZN   brick and mortar retailers are an embattled lot  But the fallout of the e commerce assault isn t limited to this segment alone  Retail REITs are also increasingly feeling the heat General Growth Property s DilemmaThe problems faced by U S  retail REITs are best illustrated by the case of GGP  Inc    NYSE GGP    On Nov 11  GGP received a  15 billion offer from Brookfield Property Partners  aimed at buying the shares it still doesn t in this major mall owner Reportedly  GGP had already been in talks with Brookfield about going private  But Brookfield offered to pay only  23 per share  only marginally higher than Nov 10 s closing price of  22 20 in a cash and equity deal   This case serves to illustrate how acute the situation seems for retail REITs  This Chicago based REIT is believed to be well above its peers in terms of the quality of its real estate portfolio  Most of its malls are considered to be  Class A  level  those which generate the highest level of sales per square foot Has E commerce Caused Retail Overcapacity But GGP is already facing a large number of problems  store closures and retail bankruptcies to name a few  all of which are a fallout of the switch to online purchases  Share prices of several major retail REITs are down year to date  This includes the likes of Simon Property Group   NYSE SPG    Federal Realty Investment Trust   NYSE FRT   and Kimco Realty Corporation   NYSE KIM   which have lost 12   8  and 27 7  over the last one year And yet  most of these REITs enjoy occupancy levels of 95   according to most industry estimates  This means that demand from multiple sources remains high  In fact  year to date leasing volumes for Kimco Realty are at a record high  a fact which serves to illustrate the sector s inherent strength  Rental prices and leasing volumes continue to remain high and earnings have been mostly promising Is Diversification the Way Forward Coming back to the GGP story  a deal with Brookfield would provide the mall owner with an opportunity to diversify across various segments of the REIT industry  For instance  it could follow a mixed usage strategy  putting office space and apartments into several of its properties  This is because Brookfield itself holds a more diversified real estate portfolio  including retail stores  offices and multifamily housing This is likely a situation which retail REITs across the board are facing  As brick and mortar retailers increasingly come under fire  retail REITs are having to make rapid changes  sometimes only in order to combat falling share prices  Though stock fundamentals continue to look solid  activist investors are demanding rapid changes in the face of the e commerce boom Price Declines Likely OverdoneThere is no denying that the retail REIT segment is facing a number of challenges  Among them is increased competition  both at malls and at shopping centers anchored by groceries  This could lead to a significant decline in margins for retailers who would in term pay lower levels of rent REITs are suffering because it is difficult to predict the outcome of the so called retail apocalypse  But strong earnings and leasing volumes indicate that the extent to which prices of retail REIT stocks have declined is difficult to justify 2 Retail REIT ChoicesDespite the troubles plaguing the industry currently  retail REITs remain solid prospects  Strong fundamentals imply that price declines are overdone  This is why investing in select retail REITs remains a good option A favorable EV EBITDA ratio is desirable for any REIT given the large levels of debt which they utilize to funds their operations  Both of our picks have EV EBITDA levels which are lower than the industry average of 23 3  Additionally  each of them has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc    NYSE UBA   is a retail REIT whose operations are centered around high quality malls surrounding New York City Urstadt Biddle Properties has a dividend yield of 4 6  Its EV EBITDA ratio of 15 3 is lower than the industry average of 23 6  Cedar Realty Trust  Inc    NYSE CDR   is a fully integrated real estate investment trust which focuses primarily on ownership  operation  and development of supermarket anchored shopping centers in coastal mid Atlantic and New England states Cedar Realty Trust has a dividend yield of 3 3  Its EV EBITDA ratio of 16 5 is lower than the industry average of 23 6    Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a

featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE    AppFolio   NASDAQ APPF    Red Hat   NYSE RHT   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  3 Cloud Stocks to Buy Right NowIn a matter of just a few years   the Cloud  has evolved from the new feature that your grandmother just can t quite seem to understand to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector  Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software related companies  and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech focused investors New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape  and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud  The markets have been paying attention  and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud based companies  or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations With this in mind  we ve highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud related activity  but also strong fundamental metrics  Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now 1        Adobe SystemsAdobe Systems is a provider of graphic design  publishing  and imaging software for Web and print production  The company s main offering is its  Creative Cloud   which is a software as a service  SaaS  product that allows users to access all of Adobe s tools at one monthly price  The stock is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Adobe has had a great year  but shares recently exploded when company management released optimistic guidance for its next fiscal year  In response  we ve seen 12 positive estimate revisions for the period  and our consensus earnings estimate is now 31 cents higher Based on these latest figures  we now expect to see Adobe post EPS growth of 30  next year  and that s on top of the 39  growth that s expected this year  Current projections are also calling for sales to improve by around 20   both this year and next year  Furthermore  the company is growing its cash flow by 48   and management is generating a whopping  3 21 in cash per share  outpacing its industry average of just  0 68 per share 2        AppFolioAppFolio offers cloud based software solutions for the property management and legal industries  The company s AppFolio Property Manager is a leading solution for property management  while its MyCase application is ideal for practitioners and small law firms  The young company has posted its first profits in the last three quarters  surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates in each A company s first profitable quarters often mean huge profits for investors  and with shares up over 75  this year  that has certainly been the case with AppFolio  Earnings and revenue have also soared this year  but that expansion is expected to continue next year  with current estimates calling for EPS growth of 30  and sales growth of 26  in the upcoming fiscal period  And on top of this  strong earnings estimate revision activity and positive earnings surprises have earned the stock a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  3        Red HatRed Hat is a leading provider of open source software and enterprise IT solutions  including cloud computing  The company has a strategic partnership with Amazon s Web Services unit and is rapidly growing its cloud offerings  After another impressive bullish run  the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Red Hat has met or surpassed earnings estimates in every quarter that we have tracked the company  dating all the way back to early 2014  This year  the firm is looking to grow sales and earnings by around 20   Furthermore  management is generating an impressive  2 29 in cash per share  Red Hat is also growing its cash flow by nearly 19  right now  And with shares continuously testing new 10 year highs  RHT

higher than the year ago earnings of 2 cents per share  Earnings increased 14  sequentially The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 40 cents per share The company reported non GAAP revenues of  1 39 billion  which surged 46  year over year and 4  from the previous quarter  Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 37 billion  The figure was in line with the upper end of the guided range of  1 34  1 39 billion The year over year growth was driven by strong demand and adoption of the company s diversified product portfolio for automotive  industrial and communications end markets  Management is particularly positive about the strong operating model followed by ON Semi Shares of ON Semi have gained 67 8  year to date  significantly outperforming the  28 6  rally  Revenue DetailsON Semi has three business units namely   Power Solutions Group or PSG  revenues of  706 million   Analog Solutions  revenues of  492 million  and Image Sensor Group  revenues of  193 million  Automotive  30  of revenues  end market revenues were approximately  411 million  up 30  year over year and were almost flat quarter over quarter  In the quarter  the company s CMOS image sensors  power management products  mixed signal ASICs and sensor interface products witnessed strong demand Industrial  25   end market revenues increased 51  year over year and 1  sequentially to  349 million  The company noted that its Python line of products for machine vision applications continues to grow at an impressive rate Demand in industrial end markets was driven by power modules and power management semiconductor solutions for industrial applications  The addition of Fairchild s offerings to its product portfolio has made it further lucrative  Management expects the growth trend in this market segment primarily driven by the requirement of higher energy efficient products and automation related products to boost its market share Communications  20   end market revenues grew 50  year over year and 9  quarter over quarter to  282 million  The company exited the mobile image sensor market during the second quarter  However  new platforms and increased adoption of the company s content on major platforms offset the negative impact of the exit  Management is optimistic about the acceptance of USB Type C solutions in the smartphone market Computing  11   grew 58  year over year and 16  quarter over quarter to  157 million  pertaining to the impressive performance of client and server solutions segments  Consumer  14   end market revenues grew 59  on a year over year basis and approximately 2  sequentially to  192 million  Strong performance of white goods consisting of heavy consumer durables contributed to segment revenues ON Semiconductor Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   MarginsNon GAAP gross margin was 37 9   up 100 basis points  bps  sequentially and 205 bps year over year  backed by revenue growth and improved operational efficiency  A favorable product mix also boosted margins Non GAAP operating margin was 16 6   reflecting a sequential increase of 190 bps and a ear over year increase of 370 bps Balance SheetCash   cash equivalents were  901 2 million  up from  871 6 in the previous quarter  In the third quarter  operating cash flow was  328 million compared with  333 2 million in the previous quarter  Free cash flow was  238 million  down from  264 2 million in the previous quarter GuidanceON Semi reiterated its annual synergies run rate from the Fairchild acquisition to be  180 million  The company targets annual synergy rate of  240 million from the acquisition by the end of 2019 Management expects to see strong growth in revenue contribution from Fairchild in the near to mid term  In the fourth quarter  automotive revenues are expected to increase sequentially backed by the ramp up of IGBTs for electric vehicle traction motors in China  Revenues from industrial  computing  consumer and communications end markets are however expected to go down sequentially due to seasonality ON Semi now forecasts revenues to be in the range of  1 33  1 38 billion in fourth quarter 2017  Non GAAP gross margin is projected to be in the range of approximately 36 8  38 3   while non GAAP operating expenses are expected in the range of  294  308 million For 2017  On Semi now expects free cash flow of around  700 million  up from the prior guidance of  600  650 million ConclusionON Semi is benefiting from a diversified customer base as none of the end markets generate more than 5  of the revenues  thus lowering the risk of customer concentration Divestiture of non core and underperforming business segments are also proving to be beneficial for the company s margins  The company anticipates consistent growth backed by high margin products meant for the automotive and industrial end markets  Additionally  per management  past investments in the automotive  industrial and communications end markets are also reaping benefits Moreover  integration and optimization of Fairchild s manufacturing operations is anticipated to further boost the company s profitability  Most recently  the company integrated Fairchild s IT systems  The company is already enjoying cross selling opportunities to a combined customer base that is aiding its top line and we believe this will help in improving its performance going forward Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderON Semiconductor carries Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see Better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include

article include  Applied Materials Inc  NASDAQ AMAT    Tilly s Inc   Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  Inc  and Take Two Interactive Software Inc Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research  4 Top Liquid Stocks to Buy for Stellar ReturnsThe liquidity position is indicative of whether a company s business is heading in the right direction  Favorable liquidity may help a company see strong business growth  which in turn may drive its price performance  Liquidity is a measure of a company s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash So  a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company s financial health Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see   Growth Style Score less than or equal to B Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only nine Here are four of the nine

results before the opening bell on Nov 1 Last quarter  the company reported earnings of 33 cents  exhibiting a miss of 8 3   Overall  Pitney Bowes has a dismal earnings surprise history  having missed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 4 9  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayPitney Bowes  concerted efforts to transform its business have started to show results as evident from growth across most business lines  For instance  the new channels that the company has been developing over the last four years namely  the tele and digital channels  proved conducive to growth of in its Mail business The transformation initiatives and constant introduction of new products have provided a boost to its performance  This apart  the company s prolonged effort to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform is also likely to prove conducive to operating profit and bottom line growth for the quarter under review Moreover  the company s Global e commerce business is proving to be one of the strongest profit churners  and is anticipated to boost top line growth in the third quarter  In less than five years  Global e commerce has grown from  20 million business to a worth of over  400 million  The company also expects segment s growth rate to accelerate going forward  in light of growth in overall retail volumes and customer wins Further  the company remains optimistic about Commerce Cloud platform  which is expected to enhance digital capabilities and web based solutions  along with acting as a decisive growth enabler going forward However  the fact remains that the company s major earnings driver   the Small and Medium Business Solutions   SMB   business   has witnessed a decline in revenues  The tepid performance was primarily due to prolonged softness in the North American Mailing business as well as International Mailing Business  This is expected to put pressure on the overall top line performance of the company in the upcoming quarter as well Moreover  continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes  growth momentum for the quarter under review  Lower recurring supplies revenues are expected to adversely affect the mailing business in the upcoming quarter  Additionally  currency fluctuations has remained one of the headwinds over the past few quarters  and is expected to impact earnings and revenues in the upcoming release as well This apart  the company has been experiencing a surge in operating expenses due to ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising and marketing strategies  Moreover  it expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program  related to digital capabilities enhancement  which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Pitney Bowes

140779,362294,ADBE,Can TE Connectivity Maintain Its Beat Streak In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Connectivity and sensor solutions manufacturer  TE Connectivity Ltd    NYSE TEL   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 1 TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history  with an average positive surprise of 9 5  in the trailing four quarters  The company scored its seventh consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter  beating estimates by 6   However  the company anticipates weak revenues in Transportation Solutions in the upcoming quarter  which constitutes the major portion of its total revenues Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayPrimarily depended on end market dynamics  TE Connectivity s business remains susceptible to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer  Though the company witnessed some extent of stability in direct business with OEMs  poor sales through distribution channels took longer than expected recovery time  consequently hurting the segmental performance  These factors could be a drag on segment margin and affect its profitability in the upcoming quarter The company s commercial transportation market is yet to witness signs of stabilization due to weak global construction and agriculture markets  along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets  This apart  the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review  These factors can severely undermine TE Connectivity s growth prospects Moreover  sluggishness in oil and gas markets along with its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as major headwinds for TE Connectivity  Further  helicopter demand has also been impacted negatively  which can prove to be a drag on the company s aerospace business Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to be reported quarter currently remains low at  1 670 million compared with fiscal third quarter revenues of  1 765 million  Revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are also anticipated to be low sequentially  with an estimate of  880 million compared with reported revenues of  905 million in the prior quarter However  being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business  TE Connectivity is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength  About 80  of the company s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications  In the past five years  the company s harsh business applications have had experienced mid single digit growth  driving top line growth  Going forward  we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion in the upcoming quarter Moreover  the company s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market  especially in China  Growth in electronic content as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company s transportation business  going forward Furthermore  during the previous quarter  the company enhanced its harsh environment portfolio with bolt on acquisitions in the Automotive and Medical business by entering into an agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication and purchasing MicroGroup  These acquisitions will unlock expansion opportunities  and advance content growth in key applications for the automotive and medical markets  This bodes well for the to be reported quarter s top line   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for TE Connectivity this time around  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate

Options Expiration Ahead
Traders should note that October options expire this Friday and many stocks will either get hit or benefit by the inevitable upgrades and downgrades that will occur this week  Unfortunately  ADBE was first in line for the bad news and has suffered for it  Traders and investors should now watch for daily chart support around the  146 85 level

140803,362318,ADBE,Here s Why Adobe  ADBE  Stock Is Climbing Today,opinion,"Shares of Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE   were up more than 10  in morning trading Thursday after the company felt a bullish reaction to several key announcements at its annual Adobe MAX user conference 
Most importantly  Adobe revealed preliminary financial targets for fiscal 2018 at a briefing with investors and financial analysts  The company is currently aiming for results that would exceed our consensus estimates and mark impressive year over year growth 
According to Adobe s briefing  management expects total revenue of  8 7 billion next year  This comes in on the high end of our consensus estimate of  8 63 billion and would represent growth of about 20  from its estimated full year 2017 total 
On the bottom line  Adobe expects non GAAP earnings to come in at  5 50 per share  That would crush the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 15 and mark year over year growth of nearly 31  from our fiscal 2017 projection 
 Adobe s vision has never been more clear or more relevant   to empower people and businesses to design and deliver amazing digital experiences   Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in an accompanying press release 
It s worth noting that Adobe s fiscal year 2018 growth will be coming on the back of an already impressive year of growth in 2017  In fact  our current consensus estimates are calling for the company to finish the year with earnings growth of 39  and sales growth of 24  
On top of this  Adobe s announcement included impressive growth projections throughout its key segments  For instance  management expects its Digital Media unit to witness revenue growth of 23   while its Experience Cloud segment s total revenue is expected to swell by 15   Breaking it down further  Adobe projects that it will see 20  growth in subscription revenue from its Experience Cloud segment 
In addition to its strong financial outlook  Adobe detailed even more of its future at this week s MAX conference  Perhaps most interestingly  management clarified its overall intentions for its artificial intelligence platform 
 We are not building a general purpose AI platform like some others in the industry are   and it s great that they are building it   Adobe CTO Abhay Parasnis noted in a press conference 
 We have a very deep understanding of how creative professionals work in imagining  in photography  in video  in design and illustration  When one of the very best artists in Photoshop spends hours in creation  what are the other things they do and maybe more importantly  what are the things they don t do  We are trying to harness that and marry that with the latest advances in deep learning so that the algorithms can actually become partners for that creative professional  
Adobe announced its Sensei AI platform about a year ago  The company is focusing on attempting to integrate Sensei into its industry leading digital media creation products  and it seems to have a particularly defined vision for what Sensei should do 
Currently  Adobe is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The stock has been one of the hottest in an on fire tech sector  and shares are now up about 50  year to date

UnderwayOracle NYSE       gave us a shaky start to the Q3 earnings season  with the tech company offering a tepid outlook for the current period even as it matched bottom line expectations and beat revenue estimates for its fiscal quarter ending on August 31st  The stock had weakened in the days ahead of the earnings release  with the anemic outlook adding to its woes as market participants try to size up the sustainable growth potential of its cloud business   The predominant majority of companies use calendar quarters as their fiscal reporting periods  but not all of them as the aforementioned Oracle report shows  In addition to companies on calendar quarters  fiscal periods ending on September 30th   companies fiscal periods ending in August and October will also form part of our Q3 earnings tally  The fact is that we will have seen such Q3 results from almost two dozen S P 500 members by the time the banks start reporting results on October 12th We have 5 S P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in August on deck to report results this week  This week s notable reports include FedEx  NYSE        FedEx reports results after the market s close on Tuesday

market s close on Tuesday  September 19th  with the software company expected to earn  1 00 per share on  1 81 billion in revenues  representing year over year growth rates of  34  and  23 9   respectively  The stock has been an impressive performer this year  up  50 2  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Tech sector s  18 5  gain and the S P 500 index s  11 6  gain  The stock was up following each of the last two quarters as it beat top  and bottom line estimates General Mills  NYSE        General Mills reports quarterly results before the market s open on Wednesday  September 20th  with the cereal maker expected to earn  0 77 per share on  3 79 billion in revenues  representing year over year declines of  1 7  and  3   respectively  General Mills shares have lagged the peer group as well as the broader market this year  with the stock down  10 1  in the year to date period Expectations for Q3Total Q3 earnings are expected to be up  3 3  from the same period last year on  5  higher revenues  This would follow  11 1  earnings growth in 2017 Q2 with revenues improving by  5 5   the second quarter in a row of double digit earnings growth Estimates for Q3 have come down as the quarter unfolded  with the current  3 3  growth down from  6 3  at the end of June Please note that while Q3 estimates have followed the well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years  the magnitude of negative revisions nevertheless compares favorably to other periods  In other words  Q3 estimates have come down  but they haven t come down by as much In terms of sector focus  the strongest growth in Q3 is coming from the Energy sector which benefits from easy comparisons  Excluding the Energy sector  the aggregate growth pace drops to  1 5  from  3 3   The Construction and Conglomerates sectors are the only other sectors with double digit growth rates  Earnings growth is also strong for the Technology sector  with total earnings for the sector expected to be up  8 8  on  6 5  higher revenues On the negative side  Q3 earnings are expected to be below the year earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for

ADBE Technical Analysis



ADBE opened trading yesterday at  141 21 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  140 35  ADBE closed trading yesterday at  140 91 and spiked up after market to  146 00  equivalent to a 4  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that with gap up we are now in un chartered territory as ADBE is now trading at all time highs 

Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up ADBE had already been in an overall upward trend dating back to December 30th  2016 when it traded at  102 95  ADBE has a  of 493 07 million shares and traded 1 83 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 

For  purposes  I would like to see ADBE open trading on Wednesday above  144 30 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 50 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

	We are in a quiet period in the quarterly earnings reporting cycle  with the March quarter results effectively behind us now and a few weeks still to go before we really get into the heart of the Q2 earnings season  But quiet period or not  earnings reports never really stop  with this week bringing in 21 quarterly reports  including 2 from S P 500 members  In fact  these 2 S P 500 members reporting results this week  H R Block  NYSE        and Kroger  NYSE          are officially the last earnings reports of the Q1 earnings season 

	We will start the tally for the Q2 earnings season the following week  as companies like Adobe  NASDAQ         Oracle  NYSE        and others start coming out with results for their May ending fiscal quarters that form part of our Q2 tally Expectations for Q2
	Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  5 7  from the same period last year on  6 5  higher revenues  This would follow  7 4  earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on  3 7  revenue growth  the highest growth pace in all most two years 
	Estimates for Q2 came down as the quarter unfolded  with the current  5 7  growth down from  7 9  at the end of March  Please note that while Q2 estimates have followed well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years  the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods  In other words  Q2 estimates have come down  but they haven t come down by as much 

	Q2 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 6 quarters  This growth pace is expected to continue through the rest of the year 

Recap of the Q1 Earnings Season
	Total earnings for the 498 S P 500 members that have reported quarterly results already are up  13 4  from the same period last year on  7 1  higher revenues  with 72 5  beating EPS estimates and 65 5  beating revenue estimates  The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 52  

Comparing Q1 Results
	The Q1 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 498 index members in other recent periods  Importantly  the growth performance is broad based and not narrowly concentrated  We got the leadership from the Finance space earlier in the reporting cycle  but the baton has since shifted to Tech and host of other areas  including Industrials  Basic Materials  and Energy

    Western Digital revenues for the quarter increased 64 7  year over year to  4 65 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 54 billion  Western Digital witnessed strong demand for both hard drive and NAND based products from all categories of customers  largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications  as well as better than expected PC demand in the reported quarter Segment Revenue DetailsClient devices  49 9  of total revenue  soared 69 2  year over year to  2 32 billion  Management noted that increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long term tailwinds for this business Client solutions  21 6  of total revenue  increased a whopping 189 9  to  1 billion  The company noted that its flash and HDD product portfolio performed strongly during the quarter which more than offsets the typical seasonal revenue decline Data center devices and solutions  28 5  of total revenue  increased 20 1  to  1 33 billion on the back of strong demand for high capacity storage devices  Solid adoption of 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive was also noted in the quarter During the quarter  Western Digital shipped 39 1 million HDDs at an average selling price  ASP  of  63  up from  60 reported in the year ago quarter  However  reported shipments of 39 1 million were down from 43 1 million shipped in the year ago quarter Operating DetailsAdjusted gross margin increased to 39  from 28 1  in the year ago quarter  The expansion was driven by lower product cost and pricing improvement Adjusted operating expenses  as percentage of revenues  climbed 230 bps to 19 3   owing to increased research and development  R D  and selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses Adjusted operating margin expanded 870 bps to 19 7  in the reported quarter as the benefit from improved gross margin were partially offset by increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenues Interest expense was  221 million a massive increase from  8 million reported in the year ago quarter Acquisition Synergies Western Digital stated that it is on track to achieve the  800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar year 2017  The company achieved  300 million of cost of revenue synergies and  325 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis at the end of the reported quarter In terms of SanDisk integration  at the end of the fiscal third quarter  the company realized synergies of approximately  150 million on an annual run rate basis  This is in line with the company s 18 month target of achieving  500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis Balance Sheet Cash FlowAs of Mar 31  2017  cash and cash equivalents were  5 65 billion  up from  4 94 billion as of Dec 30  2016  Long term debt during the quarter was  12 91 billion  down from  12 94 billion at the end of previous quarter  During the quarter  Western Digital generated  998 million in cash from operations GuidanceFor fourth quarter fiscal 2017  revenues are expected to be approximately  4 8 billion  which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 61 billion Adjusted gross margin is projected to be 40   backed by continued favorable pricing and product mix across the company s businesses  Total operating expenses are anticipated to be flat with the fiscal third quarter Interest expense is anticipated to be almost  200 million Management expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of  2 55  2 65 per share for the fiscal third quarter Our TakeWe believe that the shift toward non PC applications  secular growth of digital data  and increasing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long term positives for Western Digital  The company s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is significantly positive  in our view We remain encouraged by the company s launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment  Continued investments in product innovation could result in flat margins in the near term Further  Western Digital s entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large scale adoption  These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts  going forward Moreover  the SanDisk acquisition not only expands Western Digital s offerings in the SSD segment  but also provides a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate Technology   NASDAQ STX   We note that Western Digital shares outperformed the Zacks  industry in the past one year  While shares gained 109 7   the industry advanced 74 1  in the same period  We expect the momentum to continue given the impressive result and positive guidance in the rest of fiscal 2017 Zacks Rank   Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Couple of other similarly ranked stock in the broader technology sector are Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE   and Magic Software   NASDAQ MGIC    both carrying a Zacks Rank  2 Adobe and Magic Software have expected long term EPS

In fact  Pitney Bowes has become one of the first companies to support the new SaaS Subscription functionality on AWS Marketplace  This deal will make it easy for AWS customers to access and deploy the solution and pay through their existing AWS bill 
The Pitney Bowes Geospatial API delivers extremely accurate geocoding and reverse geocoding for data analytics  In this era when location enhanced solutions drive commerce  this technology has a wide range of uses and applications  For instance  it can create address lists from latitude and longitudinal coordinates and also recognize latitude and longitudinal coordinates from an address 
This geospatial capability is critical for data analytics that drive business outcomes for companies  For example  insurance companies can leverage on geospatial data to identify flood zones  whereas telecommunications firms can plan placement of their cell tower network 
Pitney Bowes currently offers eight other spatial and data offerings on AWS Marketplace  These offerings give developers access to its technology for Location Intelligence and Customer Information Management 
AWS services enable Pitney Bowes to escalate product development  testing  deployment and delivery of production applications  which support the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud on AWS 
PITNEY BOWES IN Price and Consensus
   Pitney Bowes is enjoying strong momentum in its global e commerce business  However  in the recently reported quarter  the revenues in its Digital Commerce Solutions business edged down 1  year over year  This was due to lower Customer Information Management and Location Intelligence license revenues  which dragged down sales for the Software Solutions segment 
Also  deteriorating market conditions in the technology industry have been affecting its software business materially  Currency headwinds also remain a major threat for this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s financial performance in the coming quarters 
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the broader computer   technology sector include Adobe Systems Inc    NASDAQ ADBE    Aspen Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AZPN   and Guidance Software  Inc    NASDAQ GUID    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

141011,362526,ADBE,Pitney Bowes  PBI  Misses Q4 Earnings  Reiterates Guidance,opinion,"Pitney Bowes Inc    NYSE PBI   reported third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 44 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents by 6 4  However  on a year over year basis  adjusted earnings improved 2 3  
The bottom line improvement is attributable to lower tax rate during the quarter  However  a rise in total cost   expenses  as well as poor top line performance restricted earnings performance to a great extent 
Inside the Headlines
Total revenue in the quarter was  839 0 million  down 3 5  year over year on a reported basis  Also  revenues fell 2   when adjusted for both the impact of currency and market exits 
Poor top line performance during the quarter under review was largely attributable to foreign currency headwinds  Also  an exit from direct operations in Mexico  South Africa and five markets in Asia aggravated the decline in revenues  Furthermore  weak sales across all three segments of the company added to Pitney Bowes  woes 
As for the segments  on a reported basis  Small and Medium Business   SMB   Solutions revenues slipped 7  year over year to  426 million  Softness in North American Mailing business  down 7   and International Mailing Business  down 9   were attributable to soft equipment sales  Also  recurring revenue streams decline in both the segments worsened the fall 
Enterprise Business Solutions   EBS   revenues inched up1  over year at  220 million  This segment s production mail business grew5 on account of higher sorter  inserter and print equipment sales  However  few lower margin deals hampered Presort Services revenues  down 2    thus offsetting the growth to some extent 
The Digital Commerce Solutions reported 1  year over year fall in sales to  193 million  A fall in sales from Software solutions  down 9   more than offset a rise in sales from global e commerce business  up 8    thereby driving an overall decline  Lower Customer Information Management and Location Intelligence license revenues acted as a growth dampener for the Software Solutions segment 
However  the global e commerce business continued on its usual growth trajectory  mainly driven by the Borderfree acquisition  In addition  robust outbound U S  package shipments proved to be a major growth driver for the segment 
Liquidity and Cash Flow
Exiting the quarter on Sep 30  2016  free cash flow was  119 4 million compared with  130 9 million as of Sep 30  2015 
As of Sep 30  2016  the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  992 1 million compared with  650 6 million at the end of Dec 31  2016  Long term debt as of Sep 30  2016  was  2 831 7 million  up from  2 489 6 million as of Dec 31  2016 
Guidance
Concurrent with the earnings release  Pitney Bowes has reiterated its guidance  The company forecasts adjusted earnings in the range of  1 75  1 82  Revenues are now projected to decline in the range of 1 3  
Pitney Bowes is bullish about the prospects in the fourth quarter on account of the initiatives that were taken earlier  The company anticipates that implementation of the enterprise business platform  new product introductions and consist enhancement of the channel strategy will act as key growth catalysts for the upcoming quarter PITNEY BOWES IN Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Our Take
Pitney Bowes reported dismal third quarter results  Despite taking multiple measures pertaining to software business transformation  the company has been unable to generate a tangible positive impact on its software business  Also  foreign currency fluctuations and sluggish global economic conditions pose as significant headwinds  Moreover  a rise in the company s operating and marketing expenses are likely to put pressure on margins of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company in the near term 
Despite these negatives  Pitney Bowes  steady transformation process over the past three years to create long term flexibility for investment reinstates hope  Also  the company s strategic collaborations and acquisitions  diligent business pruning and focus on improving operational efficiency bode well for long term growth

beat in its third quarter 2016 results  The company reported adjusted earnings  including share based compensation expense  of 9 cents per share for the quarter  miles ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of breakeven earnings Shares climbed nearly 9  in the aftermath of the results  as investors cheered the company s year over year earnings growth The company posted a GAAP loss of 19 cents per share  much narrower than the loss of 29 cents reported in the year ago quarter  Decent revenue growth  driven by robust growth in software and healthcare solutions  boosted the company s earnings  Lower administrative expenses further bolstered the bottom line Inside the HeadlinesThe 3D printer maker reported revenues of  156 4 million for the quarter  reflecting year over year growth of 3 2   The top line benefited from robust demand for the company s software and health care solutions  as well as higher 3D printers and materials orders from industrial clients  However  a consistent challenging operating environment and lower demand for 3D printers and on demand manufacturing restricted top line growth to some extent Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  162 million by a small margin Adjusted gross margin for the quarter expanded 40 basis points on a year over year basis to 51   helped by the company s shift from consumer products to materials  software and healthcare solutions  which carry higher margins Also  the company s operating expenses plunged drastically  down 13 9   to  91 million  as SG A  down 22   expenses fell significantly on lower amortization and legal expenses  R D expense  up 16 4   increased year over year only due to a non recurring asset write off charge Despite challenging growth conditions  3D Systems continues to focus on expanding its market share and exploring diverse market opportunities  Its recent partnerships with two major healthcare companies to expand its Simbionix training product line for women will fortify its competitive position in the healthcare market and drive results In fact  the quarter saw 3D Systems forge an important partnership with PTC  This alliance will see the two leaders joining forces to integrate 3D Systems  3D Sprint SDK into PTC s flagship Creo CAD platform  This will  in turn  deliver seamless CAD to print functionality to Creo users  in addition to an entire set of print management tools  Further  the leading 3D printing player launched its 3DXpert software for direct metal 3D printing During the quarter  3D Systems released the Geomagic Control X software for 3D inspection and metrology   an easy to use solution that meets the measurement analysis requirements of manufacturers globally  The leading 3D printing player also launched its 3DXpert software for direct metal 3D printing  In addition  the company undertook operational restructuring initiatives like improving the sales network as well as undertaking lean manufacturing initiatives in supply chain operations Particularly  precision healthcare offerings like printers and materials  surgical simulation and planning and printing of devices and tools contributed to growth  This apart  the company s other four growth channels  namely expansion of quickparts services  accelerating 3D printer penetration through channel expansion  launch of integrated 3D authoring solutions platform and strengthening of partnerships proved conducive to the company s operations 3D Systems is committed to channelizing its resources toward more profitable markets  3D Systems recently announced its decision to cease the production of Cube  the entry level consumer 3D printer  Although it might hurt revenues in the short term  we believe that it will direct the company s resources toward higher margin products  and accelerate next generation capabilities and thus enhance profitability over the long run Cash Flow and Balance Sheet3D Systems ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  179 4 million  up from  157 5 million a year back  For the first nine months of 2016  cash generated from operating activities came in at  38 2 million  as against cash used in operating activities of  10 6 million in the comparable period last year 3D SYSTEMS CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    To ConcludeOver the past few quarters  3D Systems has been experiencing unfavorable broader market conditions that have badly hit its financial performance  The company has been grappling with strong volatility in macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown  inflation  currency fluctuations  commodity prices and credit availability  These conditions continue to affect the company s performance However  the company is taking initiatives to channelize its resources into more lucrative areas in professional and industrial markets  3D Systems also conducted numerous successful product launches and strategic deals  which could aid the company to combat these persistent challenges in the near future Also  3D Systems  healthcare business continues to gain traction  driven by rising demand from customers who print medical and dental devices  The company is also focusing on enhancing its existing 3D printers  line  reinforcing partnerships and boosting productivity 3D Systems presently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the sector include

To Conclude
Ubiquiti delivered yet another quarter of exceptional results in rough times  We believe that the company s scalable business model is its biggest asset which helps it to adapt to any ever evolving markets  Moreover  its effective management of its strong global network of over 100 distributors and master resellers has improved its visibility for future demand as well as inventory management techniques 
Going forward  we perceive that the company s steady introduction of fresh products will continue to supplement the top line  This apart  its strong position in the wireless broadband market and increasing foothold in the enterprise WLAN access point markets  signals brighter days ahead  We believe that the U S  government s strong focus on  E Rate funding  program  that aids schools and libraries in obtaining affordable broadband  will act as a meaningful catalyst for the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company

Dave will investigate FedEx s past earnings  look at what is currently going on with the company  and give us his thoughts on their upcoming earnings announcement 
Furthermore  Dave will uncover some potential options trades for investors looking to make a play on FedEx ahead of earnings 
Finally  Dave will be going at 1 30pm CST since he ll be giving us his thoughts on   NASDAQ ADBE  at 1pm CST on Monday 
FedEx in Focus
FedEx Corporation is a global transportation and logistics enterprise that offers customers a one stop source for global shipping  logistics and supply chain solutions  Services offered by FedEx companies include worldwide express delivery  ground small parcel delivery  less than truckload freight delivery and global logistics  supply chain management and electronic commerce solutions 
FedEx is expected to report  per share according to the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Last quarter  they reported an earnings beat of  0 04 cents  coming in just above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 26 per share  FedEx has seen an average surprise of 2 73  over the last four quarters FEDEX CORP Price and EPS Surprise   FedEx is trading around  160 a share near their 52 week high of  169 57 per share 
The Transportation   Air   Freight industry is in the bottom 20  of our Zacks Industry Rank  It is difficult to gauge the growth potential for the sector  For example a lack of global economic growth may hamper FedEx and their competitors such as United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  
That said  FedEx has beaten earnings expectations in the last three straight quarters  Therefore  FedEx has shown to be a strong company against potential headwinds 
Bottom Line
But how should investors play this company ahead of its report

141066,362581,ADBE,Oil Prices Make A Rebound,opinion,"Terror bombings in New York City and New Jersey over the weekend do not appear to be having a negative affect on stock market futures to kick off the week  There is a sought after suspect this morning in connection with the crimes  which caused 29 casualties but no fatalities  For sure it could have been worse 

	Market futures are up partly due to a rebound in oil prices  A signal from oil rich Venezuela that an OPEC deal will be forthcoming to stabilize global oil prices has been received well by early traders  The WTI is up 1 4  at this hour and the Brent is up 1 3   Prices are still lagging down in the mid  40s right now  but the spectre toward  50 per barrel oil looks to have re emerged 

	Of course  the big news this week is the meeting of Fed presidents and a decision on whether to raise interest rates a quarter of 1   No raises have occurred thus far in 2016  and this is the final time the Fed will meet until November  just a few days before the U S  General Election 

	We ve heard from several Fed presidents over the past few weeks  and the tide toward hawkishness does appear to be turning  But raising rates in the current environment   with monetary easing and bond yields elsewhere on the globe lagging in negative territory  to say nothing of domestic inflation pressures which are minor   might appear to be shutting down the party early 

	December looks like the better bet for a raise at this stage  A year ago December was the last time a 25 basis point rate hike occurred  but since then we ve seen the Fed tread with caution as unknown developments beyond our borders   Brexit being a prime example   have clouded the global growth outlook

SheetAdobe ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and investments balance of  4 45 billion compared with  4 32 billion in the previous quarter  Trade receivables were  731 2 million  up from  666 7

granted in Jan 2015 GuidanceFor the fiscal fourth quarter  management expects revenues in the range of  1 55  1 6 billion  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 58 billion  in line with the guided range at the mid point Based on a share count of 503 505 million  GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of 60 66 cents  and non GAAP earnings are projected at 83 89 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 63 cents  well below the guided range  Also  non operating expense is expected within  8  10 million and the tax rate is likely to be 24  on a GAAP basis and 21  on a non GAAP basis For fiscal 2016  management expects revenues in the range of  5 8  5 85 billion  GAAP earnings within  2 12 and  2 18 and non GAAP earnings within  2 94 and  3 per share Our RecommendationAdobe reported strong fiscal third quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate We remain positive on Adobe s market position  compelling product lines  continued innovation and strong balance sheet We believe that the company is being driven by continued innovation in its Creative Cloud  Document Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses After the successful transition from traditional license to subscription based services  Adobe wants to establish its presence in cloud related software areas like documents and marketing  In this regard  the company has been introducing significant features and a number of updates to its Document Cloud In addition  we believe that the constant adoption of Adobe marketing could serves as a catalyst  Moreover  the solid adoption of Document Cloud  a new subscription package that enables users to sign documents on the cloud  should boost revenues ADOBE SYSTEMS Price  Consensus and

141095,362610,ADBE,Today s Trading  Waiting To Unleash The Fury,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
Following a weaker than expected employment report  S P 500  SPX  managed to put together a small rally that lifted price back above the 5  10 and 20 day moving averages  All three of which are just four points apart in total 
Following the highs being established early in the trading sessions  the market proceeded to give back most of those gains until the afternoon dip buyers rampers rallied the market into the close  Overall  the rally was meager at best 
After the rally on Friday  this leaves the SPX in back in the undesirable area of consolidation that it spent all of August and most of July  stuck in 
Of all the indices  the Russell 2000  RUT   is by far  the most bullish  as it sits at the cusp of establishing new rally highs 
SPDRs S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   volume fell off some from the day prior but was just a shade below recent averages 
SPX on the 30 minute chart still shows a significant double top pattern that is in place and yet to be threatened to any large degree 
On the daily chart  there is the possibility of a head and shoulders pattern being formed  and Friday s action being the start of the right shoulder 
Massive meltdown on Friday on CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  where the index saw a 11 1  drop down to 11 98  It was an unusual sell off considering the bandwidth of the VIX of late 
SPX is consolidating in a very tight pattern  while stocks under the surface continue to erode in value  This same behavior was seen back in August of 2015  but in a wider range  and ultimately led to a sudden and very sharp sell off 
As a trader  this is not the kind of market environment that you want where price simply reverts to the mean  You want trendlines and chart patterns  A flat  non moving market is not ideal for trading opportunities 
Crude Oil Futures   CL  shows a massive head and shoulders pattern forming  going all the way back to March of this year  Break the August lows and it confirms 
The market is showing a decoupling from oil as the rise and fall of the commodity in June  July and now August has not impacted the equities market substantially 
Three support levels to watch going forward on SPX is 2168  2155  and 2147  The breaks are only valid if the price can close below those support levels 
Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  has a double top that confirms on a move below 18247

Looking Ahead to Q3 Earnings Season

Q3 has not ended yet  but the September quarter earnings season gets underway this week with the Oracle     reporting after the close on Thursday  Oracle will be reporting results for its fiscal quarter ending in August  which gets counted as part of the Q3 reporting tally  There are more than two dozen companies with similar fiscal periods that will be reporting results in the following and beyond  including operators such as FedEx     Nike     Adobe Systems     and others 

Estimates for Q3 came down as the quarter got underway  in line with the trend that we have become used to seeing over the last few years 

As negative as this revisions trend looks  it is nevertheless an improvement over what we have become used to seeing by this stage in other recent reporting cycles  The improved commodity price backdrop and the reduced dollar drag are some of the more plausible explanations for this development 
	The  3  decline in Q3 earnings from the same period last year on  1 6  higher revenues  which would compare to earnings declines of  2 7  on  0 2  lower revenues in the preceding quarter  Please note  however  that Q2 earnings were expected to be down  5 9  on  0 7  lower revenues at the comparable stage in that reporting cycle 
	Regular readers know that our overall commentary on the Q2 earning season was less negative compared to the last few reporting cycles  This reflected an ever so modest improvement in the growth picture  both for Q2 as well as expectations for Q3  Growth has been in negative territory for a while now   Q2 was the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S P 500 index  The Energy sector has been  and continues to be  a big drag on the overall growth picture  But we can t blame Energy alone for all the growth challenge  there is simply not much momentum from the other major sectors either 
	That said  there is a sense that the worst is likely behind us with respect to earnings growth  with the growth picture currently expected to turn positive in the last quarter of the year and ramping up in the following quarters  A key element to watch during this coming reporting cycle will be how Q4 estimates evolve over the coming days 

Expectations Beyond Q3
	Q3 is now in negative territory as well  with the last quarter of the year as the only one that is currently expected to be in positive territory 

The Energy sector drag is expected to end in 2016 Q4 and beyond  We will see if those estimates will hold up as we reach the last quarter of the year  But given what we have seen over the last few quarters  the odds don t look that favorable

ADBE Technical Analysis

ADBE opened trading yesterday at  98 64 which was up from the previous days trading of  97 99  ADBE closed trading yesterday at  99 71 and slipped down after market to  95 37  equivalent to a 4  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time ADBE traded below these levels was on May 9th when it traded at  94 61   Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that ADBE has been on a upward trend dating back to February 8th when it traded at its 52 week low price of  71 27  ADBE has a float of 498 21 million shares and traded 2 22 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday  For trading purposes  I would like to see ADBE open trading on Wednesday below  96 80 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 50 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

141166,362681,ADBE,Analysts Unshaken After Adobe Systems Incorporated Weak Guide,opinion,"Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  released its latest earnings report after closing bell Tuesday night  coming out ahead of consensus estimates on earnings for its fiscal second quarter and in line on revenue but weak on guidance  The company posted  1 4 billion in revenue  representing a 20 4  year over year increase  Adjusted earnings were 71 cents per share  beating the Street by 3 cents per share 
Management guided for third quarter revenue of  1 42 billion to  1 47 billion  which was light of the Street s estimate of  1 47 billion  Their outlook for earnings is 69 cents to 75 cents per share  which compares to the consensus of 71 cents per share 
Adobe s earnings were  fine
Credit Suisse analyst Michael Nemeroff and team called Adobe Systems  earnings results  fine  as Digital Media ARR revenue beat   coming in at  3 413 billion  although it missed the consensus of  3 42 billion  However  they noted that the small miss was the result of underperformance in Adobe s Document Cloud ARR  Creative ARR came out ahead of consensus at  2 998 billion  Adobe also reported solid growth in Creative Cloud  and strong renewals of ETLA  plus rising average revenue per user trends 
The Credit Suisse team said although the company s results and third quarter outlook  could have been cleaner   the second quarter was mostly in line with their view  after normalizing for the puts takes in timing   However  they still think the company s story is intact  and that it still has several growth initiatives spanning multiple years going forward  They maintained their  105 per share price target and Neutral rating on Adobe Systems following last night s earnings report 
More needed from Adobe Systems
Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss and team said Adobe s results were about as they expected but could be less than what s needed They have an Equal weight rating and  100 per share price target on the company s stock  They also believe Adobe s core  transition story is on track  but they believe that investors need to see strong beat and raise quarters before they will push Adobe Systems shares higher than the current multiple of 24 times 2017 calendar year earnings per share 
The Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  team said  elevated  expectations were the main force working against the company as the results were  otherwise healthy   They also don t see the third quarter guidance miss as an actual miss because they attribute it to a  case of consensus mis modeling QoQ movements  
Shares of Adobe Systems slumped by as much as 4 93  to  94 80 during regular trading hours on Wednesday ",2016-06-23,ValueWalk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-unshaken-after-adobe-systems-incorporated-weak-guide-200137675,200137675
141167,362682,ADBE,Late Morning Brexit Poll Kills Earlier Rally  Earnings Poor Again,opinion,"It is normal for markets to drift higher ahead of an important news event  Hope trumps fear most of the time in this crazy game  I think it s about most folks thinking the worst case scenario won t happen  That intervention will take over right at the end and keep things status quo 
It seems impossible in the minds of the masses that something terrible can actually occur since the world banks  etc are always doing something to make sure nothing all that bad takes place  This said  the market was moving higher all morning until the news came out that a new poll showed a slight lead for those wanting the exit strategy 
The market tanked the moment that came out  Getting too close to the vote to still have the exit strategy in the lead  Fear is starting to creep in  and that s why the market tanked out off of the highs  It took but a few minutes 
The market never recovered  Understandable I guess since a Brexit would likely have a bad effect on all of the world markets  The market traders are not used to having such an important event get this close without a real understanding of what the final vote will ultimately be  The bulls are blinking  Unusual 
The folks of Britain seem very committed to change  The fact that the numbers are this close shows you we could actually see an historic event take place Thursday night when the final votes are tabulated  We are at crossroads for the bull market 
I m not sure how well the market would react to good news meaning Britain will stay in the euro zone  but it appears the market will be very unhappy should they leave  We re almost there  folks  Things are about to get very interesting  If we see more polls tonight that will affect the overnight futures  Be prepared for anything 
The market showed again today why it seems as if something is up behind the scenes  More horrendous earnings reports from major sector leaders  Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE  and FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  both were crushed on their reports 
How the markets remain positive is beyond my understanding  I honestly don t get it any more  Bad earnings  High S P 500 P E  Historically high in fact  Poor economic reports globally  Massive negative divergences on the index monthly charts  Add it all up and you have a market that should be screaming lower  It doesn t fall 
Clearly being held up in ways we don t understand  With that in mind the risk to me is still quite elevated and increasingly so with every move higher we get  Maybe we break out Friday  It ll do what it ll do 
Sit back and relax and enjoy the show since the market  in truth  is no longer in our hands any longer  It s now the fed market  RIP stock market  The new game is in town  Enjoy while you can if you re a bull  Disneyland is still with us  but won t be forever  Get ready for Friday morning fireworks ",2016-06-23,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/late-morning-brexit-poll-kills-earlier-rally.......-earnings-poor-again.-200137677,200137677

141187,362702,ADBE,Trading Chances  Dow Jones  FDAX  EUR GBP  Adobe Systems,opinion,"FDAX 
The German stock index has taken further harsh blows since last week  which are surely due to the big expiry day  However  this decline led to the trend continuing and forming a new low at 9429 
This has resulted in a new  large correction zone between 9736 and 10374 points  meaning that we can assume this trend will still be accompanying us for a fairly long time 
Dow Jones 
In the daily chart  there is a highly interesting situation to be seen in the Dow Jones  In the visible trend  the last high is located at 18083 points  the valid correction zone runs between 17753 and 17297 points 
After the high  the price went back down to the bottom edge of the correction zone  even undercutting the point three as it did so  but without forming a closing price below it  This meant that the trend remained intact and started the next movement from there 
This  however  was broken off just before the high  and the price went back to the end of the correction zone once again and was even able to underbid this once more yesterday  but again without a closing price 
The daily candle is actually a classic reversal candle that was even confirmed in the futures today  With this  the trend is still intact and we can now expect a new movement to develop 
EUR GBP 
All currency pairs that contain the British pound should be handled with caution up until the BREXIT decision 
If the medium trend in the EUR GBP hourly chart is also pointing upwards and is currently in the correction zone  one can speculate on a continuation of the trend  but should  however  place a very tight stop with regards to important decisions

141241,362756,ADBE,Using Out Of The Money Puts And In The Money Calls To Manage Bear Market,opinion,"Strike price selection should be a focus when selling call and put options  With the stock market bearish and volatile at the start of 2016  this article will highlight how such choices will offer significant protection while still allowing for compelling returns  The stock I selected to demonstrate the main points is Adobe Systems  O ADBE   a stock that has appeared on our  over the years although it is currently not on that list  I chose this stock because its option returns are typical of the securities normally found on our list and because it does not report earnings during the February contracts as we enter another  
In my  I always stress that we should favor deeper out of the money puts  lower than current market value  and in the money calls  also lower than current market value  when a defensive posture is indicated as it is now in my view 
Options chain for ADBE

ADBE Options Chain for 2 19 2016
Note that the out of the money  87 50 put generates  2 09 and the in the money  87 50 call generates  4 35  To afford maximum protection  we will first sell the out of the money put so let s feed the information from the options chain into the BCI  single column  Put Calculator 
Put calculations for ADBE

ADBE  Put Calculations
Note that if ADBE does not drop below the  87 50 strike from  89 00 by expiration  we will have generated a 2 45   1 month return which annualizes to 25 52   If the stock price dips below the strike  our cost basis  breakeven  is  85 41 or a 4 03  discount from current market value  If this latter scenario occurs and the shares are put to us  we can always buy back the option if we do not want to take possession of the shares  we can then sell an in the money call option  For purposes of this article  we will extrapolate a bit and assume a similar return next month for the call as we would receive this month 
Call calculations for ADBE

ADBE  Call Calculations
Note that the in the money strike generates a 3 3   40  annualized   1 month initial return with 1 7  downside protection OF THAT PROFIT  This means a breakeven of 5 0   3 3    1 7   
2 month calculations
In this hypothetical scenario based on a real life options chain  our 2 month breakeven protection on the put side is 4 03  and on the call side is 5 0  for a total breakeven protection of 9 03   This means that to lose money ADBE would have to decline in value to below  80 96  If  on the other hand  the markets calm  there is opportunity to generate significant monthly returns 
Discussion
Strike price selection is a powerful tool at our disposal to navigate through bear and volatile markets  Deeper out of the money puts and in the money calls should be given serious consideration in these market conditions  Navigating difficult markets is not for everyone  We must be comfortable and trade within our own personal risk tolerance  That said  staying on the sidelines until the markets calm is another consideration 
This has been the worst 10 day calendar start to an investment year in history  Global markets remained bearish this week reflecting concerns that US growth is slowing and raised questions about whether the US Federal Reserve will be able to pursue its forecast of four rates hikes in 2016  Having fallen 21  since its late December high  the Shanghai Composite Index is officially in bear market territory  defined as a drop of 20  or more from its recent high  Oil extended its decline  dropping below  30 late in the week  Slowing global growth  high supply from the U S  and anticipation of additional supply hitting the markets when sanctions are lifted on Iran are adding to the bearish backdrop for oil and other commodities  Oil ends the week at 12 year lows and bankruptcy fears in the oil sector continue to grow  All this added up to another down week to start 2016  This week s US economic reports 
The Fed s Beige Book  prepared in advance of the January 26 27 Federal Open Market Committee meeting  was less gloomy than many recent headlines
Growth remains modest to moderate across most Fed districts amid few signs of wage or price pressures  according to the report
Comments from several regional Fed presidents during the week were less upbeat  For example  Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren  a voter in 2016  said sluggish global and US growth may force a more gradual pace of tightening than officials currently expect
The European Central Bank released an account of its December meeting that showed that there was a split over the need for further stimulus in the eurozone  The ECB surprised markets by not implementing more aggressive stimulus measures at their December meeting  not a US report  but impacts us 
December US retail sales fell 0 1   For all of 2015  retail sales rose a 2 1   the slowest sales growth since 2009
US industrial production contracted 0 4 in December and January s Empire State manufacturing survey fell to  19 4 from 4 6 in December  setting off a fresh round of concern that US growth is rapidly losing momentum
Corporate earnings for the final quarter of 2015 began to be released this week  Though it is still very early in the process  it is notable that among large banks that have reported thus far  most have exceeded expectations  finally a silver lining
The Fed sent a record  97 7 billion in profits for 2015 to the US Department of the Treasury this week
The central bank sent  19 3 billion in excess capital to the Treasury Department under the terms of the recently enacted federal highway bill  Fed chair Janet Yellen has protested the return of capital  saying it sets a bad precedent and infringes on the Fed s independence
For the week  the S P 500 declined by 2 17  for a year to date return of   8 01

141243,362758,ADBE,Top Trade Ideas For The Week April 18  2016  ADBE,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE   had a four and a half year run higher  from a low in August 2011 under 23 to a high in December 2015 over 96  A move over 300  during that span  If you were in the stock for that entire ride higher then you are probably still holding it despite the almost 25  pullback through early February 
Two months after printing that low the stock has rebounded and back at the all time highs  consolidating  The 2 steps it took to get there suggest one more to come to complete a 3 Drives pattern  That would target a move to about 106 50  Several other pieces of the chart suggest now might be the time to start that move 
The momentum indicators are positive and support more upside  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising  The MACD is sloping slightly downward in the consolidation but positive  The price just touched the 20 day SMA and is riding it back higher  This has acted as support throughout this move  Finally the Bollinger Bands  are squeezing  often a precursor to a move in price  There is resistance at 95 50 and then free air above  Support lower comes at 92 65 and 91 50 followed by 88 50 and 84 20  Short interest is low at just 1 3  
The options chains for Adobe show only monthly Expiry  The May options show open interest spread from 85 to 95 on the Put side  and from 92 5 to 100 on the Call side  The June chain will open this week but the July options  going over the June 21st reporting date show a bit of downward bias as the Put open interest is spread from 70 to 95  biggest at 80 and 85  While the Call side is spread as well  from 80 to 100  but biggest at 90 and 95  both below the current price

141245,362760,ADBE,How Will The Adobe Quarterly Statement Affect Its Stocks ,opinion,"How will the Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  quarterly statement affect its stocks 
The US Adobe published the Digital Price Index  DPI  which reflects the price changes in hi tech goods  Since February 2015 to February 2016 the segment of TVs  PCs  electronic games and other gadgets suffered from deflation which may mean lower consumer demand  Judging by DPI  the prices slumped from 2 5  to 20 3   According to U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  they tumbled 0 5 15   Adobe is actively working on new cloud technologies for data storage and use  Will the probable fall in demand have a negative effect on company s stocks 
Adobe quarterly report for Q1 2016 was released in mid March  The company received the record operating income and its stocks hit a fresh historical high  We assume the investors expectations on further positive dynamics in Adobe financial performance may be unreasonably high  The company s stocks are traded with trailing P E of 40 which is far above the average for the sector     of 16 7 and the average     of 21 for Nasdaq 100 index  The majority of other comparative ratios for Adobe are also above the industry average  For example  the EV Sales is 8 6 compared to the industry average of 4 1  The next quarterly statements of the company will be released on June 21  Another negative for Adobe stocks may be the repetitive vulnerability of its Flash Player product  Some market participants are afraid of such faults in cloud technologies 

On the daily chart ADBE  D1 failed to renew its historical high and left the uptrend to move downwards  The MACD and Parabolicindicators give signals to sell  RSI has formed the negative divergence and fell below 50  The Bollinger bands  have contracted a lot which means lower volatility  The bearish momentum may develop in case the Adobe stocks fall below the three last fractal lows at 92 2  This level may serve the point of entry  The most conservative traders may wait for breaking through support of the downtrend and the lower Bollinger band at 91 4  The initial risk limit may be placed above the historical high  the Bollinger band and Parabolic signal and the last four fractal highs at 97 8  Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal high following the Parabolic and Bollinger signals  Thus  we are changing the probable profit loss ratio to the breakeven point  The most risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop loss level at 97 8 without reaching the order at 92 2 or 91 4  we recommend cancelling the position  the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account 
Position Sell Sell stop below 92 2 or 91 4 Stop loss above 97 8",2016-05-04,IFC Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/technical-analysis-s-adbe-:-2016-05-04-200127907,200127907

Adobe develops digital marketing and media solutions  Looking to expand its foothold in the realm of 3D technology  Adobe recently acquired Mixamo  a 3D animation start up  on June 1  The incorporation of Mixamo into Photoshop should allow designers to operate 3D tools with greater ease 
Two and a half years ago  the software giant began its successful transition to Creative Cloud and a subscription based model  which is now a major valuation driver  A software as a service  Creative Cloud is a subscription based service that allows subscribers to download and install Adobe s software over the internet  The 517 000 subscriptions added last quarter missed the sell side analysts  estimate of 575 000 and investors expect that number to jump this quarter

As Adobe completes its transition to a SaaS company  revenue from the Creative Cloud division will drive its growth  A look into Adobe s price to sales ratio shows that the company is approaching its historical plateau  Typically  Adobe has experienced a peak P S ratio around 8x  Beginning in 2012 with its transition to a SaaS model  Adobe s P S ratio  as well as its price  began to rapidly increase while year over year revenue growth failed to surpass 10  

With both company guidance and the Estimize consensus projecting FQ2 revenues to land at a record high of  1 15 billion and  1 17 respectively  Adobe might be able to achieve the revenue growth that it is seeking  This Tuesday s earnings report will prove to be pivotal for Adobe as the company aims to complete its revenue model transformation ",2015-06-15,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-adobe-poised-to-beat-earnings-expectations-with-record-high-revenue-255135,255135

141279,362794,ADBE,Bullish Setups At All Time Market Highs,opinion,"SPX is challenging new highs  but there is still a lack of quality setups  
I would have thought at this stage  we d see a lot of quality setups beginning to emerge  but still that isn t the case  The number of bearish setups far outnumber the bullish ones  That s nothing to read into  just a point of fact 
With that said  my focus is solely on the long side right now  and once those new highs are established  I ll look to expand my portfolio s holdings to 4 6 total positions and then go from there 
This is by far the best rally the market has seen since February of this year  and is worth riding for as long as the market will allow for it to persist 
Below is my list of long setups  and while some of the names  like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   have already made their big time runs  there are plenty of other names  like Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  and Owens Corning  NYSE OC   that are just starting to make that move

141281,362796,ADBE,Will Cloud Take Adobe Higher ,opinion,"With the rise in popularity of cloud computing and storage  more and more software companies have been flooding into the space and those that have executed well and expanded that segment quickly have seen the biggest benefit to their bottom line  Take Oracle  NYSE ORCL   for example  which last night reported EPS in line with the Estimize consensus  but missed revenue expectations by  52M  Just hours before the report  SunTrust upgraded the stock to a  buy  based on high expectations for the cloud segment  Oracle cited Cloud SaaS and PaaS as a strong point  growing 34  in US dollars and 38  in constant currency  promising that by fiscal Q4  that number would grow to 60  in constant currency  After that announcement  while ORCL fell slightly  others in the cloud space such as Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE  saw a slight increase after being up 1 3  on the day 
Adobe reports earnings results for its fiscal Q1 2016 quarter after today s closing bell  The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 52  higher than the Wall Street consensus of  0 49 and corporate guidance of  0 48  The Estimize estimate denotes YoY growth of 86   with the consensus peaking at  0 56 at the end of July  The Estimize community is also expecting slightly higher revenues of  1 22B as compared to the Street s estimate for  1 21B and guidance of  1 20B 

A reason for the high expectations has been the rapid progression of the company s cloud business which helped total quarterly revenue hit an all time high last quarter  Adobe s largest segment  Digital Media Solutions  makes up close to 65  of total revenues and is driven by the Creative Cloud  Document Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses  The company maintains that Creative Cloud subscriptions will hit 5 9M by the end of 2015  up from 4 6M as of the end of Q2  CEO Shantanu Narayen announced the release of their  best Creative Cloud to date  by the end of the year  which includes Adobe Stock  their stock content service 
Last week  Adobe previewed their new video technology for Creative Cloud at the IBC Electronic Media conference in Amsterdam  which includes integration of UltraHD and touch screens  One segment that hasn t been doing as well is the LiveCycle and Connect business due to a decline in Print and Publishing  Despite all of the promising new updates  Adobe has struggled with the stronger dollar in the past year  although that should subside in Q3 as YoY comparisons get easier  The stock is down 0 04  ahead of the report ",2015-09-17,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-cloud-take-adobe-stock-higher-265412,265412

141300,362815,ADBE,Stocks  The Choppiness Continues ,opinion,"We all know what happened with yesterdays Fed statement s  by now and have had time to sit back and try and make sense of not only what was literally said but how to interpret words and charts going forwards but taking the word  patience  out of the picture for the near future adds more mystery back into the mainstream  Not only do we try and read between the lines and guess if and when the Fed decides to hike rates but with the Dow having triple digit moves 8 out of the past 9 days  capped off with yesterday s almost 400 point Dow reversal from early morning lows  we view yesterdays action as a move that puts us  indices sentiment  back on track for better action with the Russell  IWM  making all time highs  Especially with yesterdays rally being slow and methodical  Europe  on the whole  is up the most since 2000 coupled with crude prices being the lowest since 2009  Also for the VIX believers granted in hindsight  few will argue that there wasn t  fear  out there  just managers and institutions rotating money 
Recently the markets have seen the most volatility from non equity asset classes being the dollar gold crude and with the U S  10 Year yielding below 2  again  stocks  either domestic or more so lately international  seem to be the only game in town

It may take some time to absorb yesterdays move and let the market settle keeping in mind the Dow closed above 18k and the Nasdaq briefly touching the 5000k mark again  Both psychological levels that also need time to be digested after the  run  we have  Until then traders will continue to watch the dollar and crude oil until the market gives us confirmation and confidence in stock prices and indices ",2015-03-19,Tradeview Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks:-the-choppiness-continues-245624,245624

141335,362850,ADBE,Will New Subscribers Boost Adobe s Earnings On Tuesday ,opinion,"Adobe Systems Inc   NASDAQ ADBE  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings after the market closes on Tuesday  June 17th  Adobe is an American multinational software company known for its multimedia and creative software products  Adobe s earnings have stalled over the past year as the company has not posted year over year earnings or sales growth in any of the previous 6 quarters  The slump in Adobe s earnings comes as the company is undergoing a transition from traditional perpetual software licenses to a subscription based business model 
Abode ended last quarter with 1 8 million subscribers and management expects to add another 1 2 million by the end of calendar 2014  Last quarter Adobe added 405 000 subscribers  so management s goal is aggressive  but not outside the realm of possibility  Wall Street is looking for 29c per share in earnings  and revenue of  1 025B  The Street is hoping that for the first time in 7 quarters Adobe will report year over year revenue growth on Tuesday  Here s what investors are expecting after the close 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Adobe to report 29c EPS and  1 025B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 11 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 31c EPS and  1 035B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Adobe to beat the Wall Street consensus on both the top and bottom line by a thin margin 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Adobe s EPS and revenue 5 and 3 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a larger than usual differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 30c to 32c per share and from  1 029B to  1 050B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a narrow range of estimates on Adobe s earnings 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow range of estimates signals more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months Wall Street increased its EPS consensus from 26c to 29c while the Estimize consensus edged higher from 30c to 31c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast rose from  988 03M to  1 025B while the Estimize sales consensus began the period at  1 034B and rose going into the report from a low before reaching  1 035B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 30c EPS and  1 029B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is  overall among over 4 500 contributing analysts  This season turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 50  of the time respectively throughout a massive 1153 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is expecting Adobe to edge past the Wall Street consensus  but come up short of the forecast from Estimize 
Adobe is still going through growing pains associated with its transition to a subscription based business model  but contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are anticipating that Adobe will add subs faster than the Street is predicting  The Estimize community is forecasting that on Tuesday afternoon Adobe will beat the Wall Street earnings consensus by 2c per share and outperform the Street s revenue projection by  10 million

141336,362851,ADBE,The FOMC Meeting And What Low Rates Really Mean,opinion,"The Fed can t keep rates low forever and there is talk that they may raise rates faster than anyone up to now has believed 
Same story across the pond and around the world

Last Friday I had a chance to sit down with a Eurodollar options order filler to get his point of view on rates  I also asked him how it was going in the pits and he said that there was a big pickup in volume last year when there was talk that the Fed might start to move short term rates higher  Almost a year later nothing has changed 
The order filler went on to say that most traders in the Eurodollar futures and options don t think the Fed will raise rates anytime soon but did say he expects to see some type of movement at the end of 2015 
7 Years Later
Interest rates have always been a big part of the futures markets but over the last 7 years both the options and futures volume have fallen off a cliff 
What used to be the one of the biggest volume pits on the floor has been hurt by the Fed s zero rate policy  Long before the CME bought the Board of Trade the bond pit had already gone from 600 in the pit down to 20  The Eurodollar futures and options that used to have over 2 500 people is down to 150 to 200  As the volume disappeared so did the traders 
Free Money
Cheap rates has been the main driver of the stock market  With little or no return on interest rate products the public has had no place to go but stocks  This has worked well for those that stuck with the buy and hold  but those who waited for a correction have been left on the sidelines 
With no 10  correction in almost 3 years and the S P 500 trading above 1900 and the Dow nearing 17000  many are wondering if this is just a runaway train or a real sign of confidence in the economy  The answer is  it s some of both 
There are good reasons for optimism  9 million new jobs created  a return to the pre crisis unemployment rate  7 5 million newly enrolled in health insurance plans  an end to the  10 billion a month war in Iraq  But with inequality worse than that of the Great Depression  the middle class is wondering just who this recovery is really helping 
This lack of trust goes to the heart of what credit means and does for an economy  it s an expression of our faith in ourselves and each other  The Fed is keeping rates low in hopes that banks will start investing in entrepreneurs  in infrastructure  in things that make societies grow 
If the  of cash that companies have raised in this stock boom  combined with cheap credit  can be invested in the things that will make a bright and secure future for everyone  not just a few  the Fed s strategy will have turned the financial crisis into a great opportunity

Our View  Mutual Fund Monday s return has not been kind to Turnaround Tuesday  which used to be the most winning day of the week  Turnaround Tuesday has closed higher 4 out of the last 6 weeks 
While we maintain a bullish bias we also know you have to be on guard for the headline algos  which take the media hype you see in  Breaking News  Crisis in Iraq  graphics and turn it into short sales based on how fast the words  Iraq  and  crisis  start trending on Google and Twitter 
Our view is to sell the early rally and buy weakness  if the ESU14 can get back above 1933 1934 we think it could trade up to 1938 1940
