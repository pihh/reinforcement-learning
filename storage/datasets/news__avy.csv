12459,233974,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Avery Dennison  AVY  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 66 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 60 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 45 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 75   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of office products would post earnings of  1 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 72  delivering a surprise of 2 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Avery Dennison  which belongs to the Zacks Office Supplies industry  posted revenues of  1 76 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 29   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 76 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Avery Dennison shares have added about 31 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for Avery Dennison 
While Avery Dennison has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Avery Dennison was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 69 on  1 79 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 52 on  7 07 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Office Supplies is currently in the bottom 11  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avery-dennison-avy-beats-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200476544,200476544

12464,233979,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Avery Dennison  AVY  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of office products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 78 billion  up 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Avery Dennison 
For Avery Dennison  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Avery Dennison will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Avery Dennison would post earnings of  1 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 66  delivering a surprise of  3 75  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Avery Dennison doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avery-dennison-avy-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200500702,200500702

12510,234025,AVY,Manitowoc  MTW  Down 17  Year To Date  Will It Bounce Back ,opinion,"The Manitowoc Company s   NYSE MTW   focus on product innovation  solid aftermarket business  cost control  improving productivity and pricing actions are commendable  However  shares of the company have lost 16 8  year to date compared with the  s decline of 7 3   This downside can be primarily attributed to muted customer spending on account of the ongoing trade disputes and geopolitical uncertainties 
Let s delve deeper 
What Dragged the Stock Down 
Manitowoc s orders in the first half of 2019 were  813 0 million  a 16  drop year over year as customers became more cautious as a result of uncertain market conditions  Manitowoc s backlog as of second quarter end was  561 million  down 19  year over year  Trade disputes and other macro economic factors continue to create uncertainty in global markets  Additionally  the U S  and European construction markets are slowing and U S  rate counts have declined  All these factors are affecting customer sentiment Further  fluctuating foreign exchange rates are putting pressure on Manitowoc s margins  particularly on European produced cranes that it sells in the United States  The Middle East market also remains challenging owing to geopolitical uncertainties and market competitions Additionally  Manitowoc continues to witness inflation in material costs  which includes the impact of tariffs  This is affecting the company s margins  Further  supply chain challenges continue to be a headwind 
Factors Likely to Drive Growth
Manitowoc continues to execute its strategy to cover cost inflation through pricing actions  The company also remains focused on cost controls  reducing headcount  increasing productivity and eliminating waste  It is also taking proactive steps to support supply chain partners to ensure timely delivery of components  combined with alternative sourcing strategies  Manitowoc has also provided own in house labor to weld the finished components to keep production lines flowing  This will support its financial goals Manitowoc s aftermarket business continues to perform well  Growth is primarily stemming from higher margin parts and services  The company remains focused on improving this crucial part of the business  Further  the company noted that there is scope of improving the Middle East revenues  It continues to strengthen partnerships with its channel partners in the region to capitalize on the recovery in the markets  Manitowoc s focus on innovation by providing differentiated products that add value to customers will strengthen the company s industry leading position Manitowoc s long term outlook remains strong  The company continues to be committed to achieving its target of double digit operating margins improvement year over year  In fact  the company anticipates achieving long term target of double digit operating margins by 2020 through continued streamlining organizational structure 
We believe that these factors will eventually benefit Manitowoc s results and drive a turnaround in its share price

12521,234036,AVY,3 Reasons Why Avery Dennison  AVY  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Avery Dennison  AVY  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of office products is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Avery Dennison is 18 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 8 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 2  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Avery Dennison is 14   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 6 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Avery Dennison have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line

12533,234048,AVY,Is Avery Dennison  AVY  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects

While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of office products is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration

Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Avery Dennison has an S TA ratio of 1 34  which means that the company gets  1 34 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 93  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Avery Dennison looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 0 1  this year versus the industry average of 0  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Avery Dennison  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Avery Dennison has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

12541,234056,AVY,Avery Dennison Pattern Is Repeating,opinion,"Shares in Avery Dennison  NYSE AVY  have been rising steadily throughout 2019 driven by good fundamentals  excellent acquisitions and a strong presence in the emerging markets until the technical picture prevailed  driving the price off the highs of  116  and closing yesterday s session at  106 83  And whilst some of this bearish sentiment can be attributed to the short term weakness in the primary indices  it is the technical picture on the weekly chart that is the primary driver for this downside momentum  with volume price analysis once again revealing the picture 
And the starting point is the classic building block of support and resistance delivered by the accumulation and distribution indicator from Quantum Trading on the NinjaTrader platform  The indicator delivers these levels automatically  but more importantly these are both pinpoint accurate and also define the strength of such regions  Each time a level is tested from above or below and holds  the line thickens to represent this fact automatically  and on the chart  we can see the strength of resistance at  116 30 which capped the most recent rally for the stock in mid April  This level is denoted with the blue dashed line and one which was also responsible for a similar reversal in July last year  The two bar reversal of early April was a classic signal of weakness to come and which has duly appeared with the price action now approaching the volume point of control at  104 80 denoted with the yellow dashed line 
The volume point of control represents the fulcrum of price agreement and as such we can expect to see price consolidation in this region  Below at  102 we have a strong level of potential price support denoted with the blue dashed line which may provide a temporary platform  However  if this is breached  a deeper move lower will follow through the low volume nodes below 
The support and resistance aspect of price is then confirmed with the volume analysis  Note the volume associated with the three up candles as the stock moved from  109 to  116  Three average to low volume bars suggesting a market which is exhausted  Indeed two of these candles were wide spread and up and yet the volume looks lightweight and is therefore anomalous  On the move lower we see volume increasing on the down candles thereby confirming this weakness  This weakness in the uptrends and rallies is also evident through 2018  where each rally runs out of steam with volumes falling away and reversals then taking hold  a pattern now being repeated in the current price action ",2019-05-09,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avery-dennison-pattern-is-repeating-200419249,200419249

12546,234061,AVY,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Avery Dennison  AVY  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Avery Dennison in Focus
Based in Glendale  Avery Dennison  AVY  is in the Industrial Products sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 26 33   The maker of office products is paying out a dividend of  0 58 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 04  compared to the Office Supplies industry s yield of 1 84  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 86  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 32 is up 15 4  from last year  Avery Dennison has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10 87   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Avery Dennison s current payout ratio is 34   meaning it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  AVY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 56 per share  with earnings expected to increase 8 25  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that AVY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-avery-dennison-avy-could-be-a-great-choice-200439736,200439736
12547,234062,AVY,Will Avery Dennison  AVY  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Avery Dennison  AVY   which belongs to the Zacks Office Supplies industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of office products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 35  
For the last reported quarter  Avery Dennison came out with earnings of  1 48 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 46 per share  representing a surprise of 1 37   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 50 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 52 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Avery Dennison  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Avery Dennison has an Earnings ESP of  0 90  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 23  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-avery-dennison-avy-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200440238,200440238
12548,234063,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Avery Dennison  AVY  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of office products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 83 billion  down 1 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Avery Dennison 
For Avery Dennison  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Avery Dennison will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Avery Dennison would post earnings of  1 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of  1 37  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Avery Dennison appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avery-dennison-avy-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200440215,200440215

12564,234079,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Upgraded To Strong Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Avery Dennison  AVY  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Avery Dennison basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Avery Dennison  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Avery Dennison
For the fiscal year ending December 2019  this maker of office products is expected to earn  6 57 per share  which is a change of 8 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Avery Dennison  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Avery Dennison to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-03-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avery-dennison-avy-upgraded-to-strong-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200398155,200398155

compared with 74 cents recorded in the year ago quarter  The mid point of the new guidance reflects year over year growth of 8   Earnings growth in the first quarter and full year 2019 is likely to be

Converted Products segment  The company previously completed the buyout of Highland Packaging Solutions on April 2018 and bought Clear Lam July 2017  The Highland acquisition is anticipated to add

particularly in the emerging markets  will also aid growth  The company has an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 4 7   Headwinds to Conquer Impact of tariffs on steel  aluminum and other

12568,234083,AVY,5 Industrial Stocks Geared Up For Gains In 2019,opinion,The imposition of tariffs on steel imports into the United States last year dealt a massive blow to the manufacturing sector overall  Given that steel is a primary raw material  every manufacturing company bore the brunt of rising steel prices owing to the tariffs  Despite this setback  the manufacturing sector held its ground and witnessed strong production output and strength in new orders last year  It seems well poised to sustain the momentum this year as well  supported by improvement in its end markets like residential and non residential construction  mining driven by ongoing recovery in the commodities  oil and gas industry  and overall economic growth  Further  manufacturers have increased capital spending and hiring driven by massive tax overhaul  deregulatory measures and strong domestic economy Manufacturing Sector Firing on All Cylinders Per the Institute for Supply Management s   ISM   latest report  Purchasing Managers  Index   PMI   for February rose 54 2  after a 56 6  reading in January  In fact  the sector has maintained the growth rate for 30 consecutive months  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  16 reported growth in February  The PMI has averaged 58  over the last 12 months ranging from a low of 54 2  to a high of 60 8   Notably  a reading above 50  indicates

Mining output rose 0 3    its 13th consecutive monthly increase aided by gains in oil and gas extraction  coal mining  and support activities for mining  Sector Performance   Projections All the machinery industries are broadly clubbed under the Zacks  Sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The sector s earnings rose 25 5  in 2018 which was commendable considering the input cost inflation owing to tariffs  Per the latest  report  the sector is expected to log growth of 3 4  and 10 2  in earnings in 2019 and 2020  respectively In 2018  the Industrial Products sector had underperformed the S P 500 market owing to the concerns surrounding the impact of tariffs  In 2018  the sector witnessed a decline of 7 6  while the S P 500 rose 4 7   However  the sector has fared better so far this year  notching a year to date gain of 15 6  compared with the S P 500 s climb of 13 1   We believe this price performance will be sustained this year  driven by the healthy growth prospects and upbeat numbers coming from the manufacturing sector which indicate that the sector is on a firm footing  Continued improvement in residential and non residential construction  and revival in infrastructure demand bode well for the industry  Mining companies are also resuming capital spending on account of improvement in commodity prices  Further  the recently passed tax reform is likely to act as a catalyst by expediting manufacturing investment in factories  new equipment and other capital goods  Moreover  the manufacturing companies continue to combat cost inflation through pricing actions as well as cost controls  increasing productivity and eliminating waste  Further  any positive development on the United States China trade war front will be highly beneficial for this sector

12569,234084,AVY,DMC Global  BOOM  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of DMC Global  BOOM   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 41 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  52 04 in the previous session  DMC Global has gained 42 7  since the start of the year compared to the 14 9  move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 8 5  return for the Zacks Industrial Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 21  2019  DMC Global reported EPS of  0 46 versus consensus estimate of  0 37 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 10 14  
For the current fiscal year  DMC Global is expected to post earnings of  2 55 per share on  356 1 million in revenues  This represents a 23 19  change in EPS on a 9 09  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 34 per share on  394 9 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 30 98  and 10 9   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
DMC Global may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
DMC Global has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 19 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18 4X versus its peer group s average of 11 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 0 98  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  DMC Global currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if DMC Global fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though DMC Global shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does DMC Global Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of DMC Global have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Ashtead Group  LON AHT   ASHTY   Encore Wire  WIRE   and Avery Dennison  AVY   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 37  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for DMC Global  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dmc-global-boom-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200399766,200399766
12586,234101,AVY,Industrial Stocks Earnings Due On Jan 30  AVY  IR  CMPR  RXN,opinion,The Zacks  sector seems to have regained its momentum after struggling with weak productivity and sluggish growth over the last few years  The rebound can be attributed to increased capital spending and hiring as well as rise in manufacturing activity  backed by President Donald Trump s business friendly policies Notably  Industrial Products is one of the eight sectors that are anticipated to record double digit earnings growth for the October December quarter  According to the latest   total earnings of the sector participants are likely to increase 14 4  year over year on 5 5  higher revenues What s Working in Favor of the Sector The U S  economy is benefiting from factors such as low unemployment level and improved business sentiment  which have aided the industrial sector  In addition  Trump s policies  including massive tax overhaul  deregulatory measures and higher government spending are likely to continue aiding manufacturing activities in the economy Industrial production is one of the key economic indicators for industrial stocks  Notably  per the latest Federal Reserve report published on Jan 18  the manufacturing output jumped 1 1  in December 2018  marking its highest gain in 10 months  As a result  U S  industrial production rose 0 3  in December  outpacing the consensus estimate of 0 2   Also  the metric recorded growth 0 4  and 0 2  in November and October  respectively  As a matter of fact  this helped industrial production to grow at an annual rate of 3 8  in the October December quarter Notably  per the latest Institute for Supply Management report  in December 2018  the U S  manufacturing expanded for the 116th consecutive month  Further  the Purchasing Managers  Index for December recorded growth of 54 1   following readings of 59 3  and 57 7  in November and October  respectively  As a matter of fact  any reading above 50 indicates overall growth of the manufacturing sector Moreover  per the Department of Labor s latest report  the manufacturing sector is also witnessing healthy job creations  Notably  in 2018  the manufacturing sector generated around 284 000 jobs  with three fourths of the addition in durable goods industries  These strong numbers  along with strength in the domestic economy and the Trump administration s friendly policies  bode well for the sector Given this healthy backdrop  it will be interesting to see how some of the industrial stocks fare in their upcoming results on Jan 30 Avery Dennison Corporation   NYSE AVY   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results before the opening bell  The company s performance is likely to be aided by growth in emerging markets  focus on high value categories  including

12597,234112,AVY,Top Research Reports For General Dynamics  Enbridge   CSX Corporation,opinion,"Tuesday  May 15  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including General Dynamics  GD   Enbridge  ENB  and CSX Corp   CSX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
General Dynamics  shares have underperformed the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry in the last one year   4  vs   40 6    General Dynamics started off 2018 on a mixed note  with its first quarter earnings surpassing expectations  while its revenues missed the consensus mark  However  results remained impressive on a year over year basis  
Meanwhile  the company remains one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines and its diverse portfolio of products and services  The Zacks analyst thinks General Dynamics  latest acquisition of CSRA will enable the company to secure more government IT contracts  
However  the company operates in a highly competitive market and has to rely on other companies to provide materials  components and subsystems for its products  The company s dependence on international sales for a major portion of its revenues exposes it to the risk of currency fluctuations and other geo political risks 
 You can   
Shares of Enbridge have declined  16 2  over the last one year  underperforming the Zacks Oil Pipeline industry s loss of  10 7  during the same period  Enbridge has the longest and most sophisticated crude and liquids pipeline system in the world that spreads over 17 018 miles  
The Zacks analyst likes the merger with Spectra Energy  F SEP  as it has made Enbridge the largest North American energy infrastructure player  The company s huge backlog of growth projects that stands at roughly C 22 billion along with the C 12 billion worth midstream projects that are online will help it drive dividend by 10  annually through 2020  Enbridge reported strong first quarter 2018 results  thanks to higher liquid delivery volumes  
But the firm s significant exposure to debt is a matter of concern  We are also worried about the company s year over year higher gas distribution costs for first quarter 2018 
 You can   
CSX Corporation  NASDAQ CSX  s shares have gained  25 5  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Rail industry  which has gained  14 3  over the same period  Ushering in further good news  the company reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in the first quarter of 2018  Both metrics also improved year over year  
Apart from lower costs  higher intermodal revenues aided results  Improvement in operating ratio is also a positive  Moreover  the Precision Scheduled Railroading system  implemented by the company s former CEO   E  Hunter Harrison   seems to be paying off  Efforts to reward shareholders are encouraging as well  
However  decline in overall volumes in the quarter is concerning  The automotive unit continued with its dismal performance  thus limiting volume growth  The company s high debt levels represent a further challenge

Earnings AccelerationConsistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Positive earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price  Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price Finding Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  In contrast  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

12613,234128,AVY,5 Top Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Amid Market Turmoil,opinion,"In volatile markets  investors look for both growth and income in their portfolios  This can be achieved by zeroing in on companies that not only pay dividends but also have been consistently increasing their payout   Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a history of enhancing shareholder returns through consistent dividend hikes make an investor s portfolio immune to large swings in stock prices in turbulent times  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty  Simultaneously  these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past year Top Zacks Rank  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  generally outperform their peers in all types of

Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Avery Dennison s Label and Graphic Materials segment is the largest and highest return business  The segment will maintain its momentum of strong top line growth and continued margin expansion  aided by growth in emerging markets  company s strategic focus on high value categories  including specialty labels  as well as the ongoing contribution from productivity initiatives 
The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment continues to perform well on the back of business model transformation  This has enabled it to gain share market share  while driving significant margin expansion  Avery Dennison has increased the segment s competitiveness through strategic pricing initiatives  Margins are likely to improve exhibiting the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volume  Growing adoption of RFID  Radio frequency identification  by retailers due to growth of omni channel retailing as well as the requirement to locate inventories at all times is fueling demand  Consequently  RFID sales  which increased a 20  year over year in 2017  will continue to boost the segment s sales in the to be reported quarter as well 
However  the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment s operating margins are currently bearing the brunt of acquisitions and growth related investments as well as a number of operational challenges  Further  modest sequential raw material inflation will hinder Avery Dennison s first quarter performance  Further  higher debt levels following the Yongle and Finesse acquisitions remain a concern 
Nevertheless  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at  1 34  reflecting year over year growth of 20 7   The estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 76 billion  projecting a year over year climb of 11 7   Focus on productivity  acquisitions  aggressive cost control and share repurchases will drive the results 
Further  Avery Dennison s shares have outperformed the  s performance in the past year  The stock has gained 31 8   compared with the industry s growth of 26 3   Here s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Our proven model does not conclusively show that Avery Dennison will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   That is not the case here as you will see below  Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  4 66   Zacks Rank  Avery Dennison is  3 Ranked  Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Stocks to Consider Here are a few industrial products stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  Axon Enterprise  Inc    NASDAQ AAXN   has an Earnings ESP of  12 50  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   Axon s shares have surged 85  in the past year  The Earnings ESP for Alarm com Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ ALRM   is  5 44   It sports a Zacks Rank  1  Shares of Alarm com Holdings have gone up 32  in a year s time  Rexnord Corporation   NYSE RXN   has an Earnings ESP of  4 36  and a Zacks Rank  2  Its shares have gone up 34  in a year s time  Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ",2018-04-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-in-the-cards-for-avery-dennison-avy-in-q1-earnings-200307285,200307285

payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help

for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks

12653,234168,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Is Oversold  Can It Recover ,opinion,"Avery Dennison Corporation   NYSE AVY   has been on a bit of a cold streak lately  but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock  And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at AVY given that  according to its RSI reading of 28 84  it is now in oversold territory 
What is RSI  
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet  AVY s low RSI value isn t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround  as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late  This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Avery Dennison s earnings consensus 
Over the past two months  investors have seen 4 earnings estimate revisions move higher  compared with none lower  at least when looking at the key current year time frame  And the consensus estimate for AVY has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days  as estimates have risen from  5 46 share two months ago to just  5 88 share right now  
If this wasn t enough  Avery Dennison also has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which puts it into rare company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now  or holding on   as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long

12656,234171,AVY,Pentair Riddled By Cost Inflation  Post Separation Concerns,opinion,On May 4  we issued an updated research report on Pentair plc   NYSE PNR    The company s results in the near term will bear the brunt of material and other cost inflation  Further  concerns pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business remain  Sound Q1 Results Pentair delivered first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share  up 35  from the year ago quarter  Earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents as well as management s guidance of 81 83 cents  Guidance Reflects Electric Business Separation Pentair initiated second quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 67 69 cents  Sales is expected to be around  0 79 billion  up 4 5  on a reported basis and up 3 4  on a core basis compared with second quarter 2017  For fiscal 2018  the company anticipates adjusted earnings per share between  2 25 and  2 30  Sales are projected at  2 96 billion  up 3 4  on a reported and core basis over 2017   Both the guidance ranges reflect the separation of its Electrical business  nVent Electric plc  Electrical Business Separation Completed  Risks Persist Pentair has completed the separation of its Electrical business  which is now held by nVent Electric plc   nVent    a new independent  publicly traded company   nVent shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1  2018  under the symbol  NVT   This will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical   Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc   nVent    respectively   Both the companies are well positioned for long term growth as well as value creation and also possess the scale and strength to flourish as separate entities  Pentair will continue to operate as a leading global water company focused on smart and sustainable solutions  Although the separation of the Electrical business from the Water business will provide financial  operational  managerial and other benefits to the company as well as its shareholders  risks persist in connection with the separation  Pentair will incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin off  such as legal  accounting and other professional fees along with ongoing costs in connection with the spin off  including costs of operating as independent  publicly traded companies  Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits  If the intended gains are not realized or costs exceed estimates  it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition  Further  each management team s inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near term business performance  Following the spin off  trading price of Pentair s shares is likely to decline and may experience greater volatility as it will no longer reflect the value of the Electrical business  Until the market has fully analyzed the company s value without the Electrical business  the price of shares may experience higher volatility  Moreover  the shares may not match some holders  investment strategies or meet criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios  which could cause investors to sell their shares  Excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of Pentair s shares to dip  Factors That Might Restrict Results The company has identified attractive opportunities in specific product and geographic markets  both within and outside the United States  The company is reinforcing its businesses to effectively address these opportunities through research   development as well as additional sales and marketing resources  Unless it is successful in its endeavors  the company s sales growth will likely be limited in the near term or may decline  Sales outside the United States accounted for 40  of net sales in fiscal 2017  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  most notably the strengthening of the U S  dollar against the euro  could have an adverse material effect on the company s revenues  The company continues to witness inflation in material and other costs  The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials   Pentair underperformed its  s performance with respect to share price  over the past year  The stock slumped 33   while the industry recorded growth of 4   Zacks Rank and Key Picks Pentair currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Some better ranked stocks in the same space include Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    H E Equipment Services  Inc    NASDAQ HEES   and Avery Dennison Corporation   NYSE AVY    While Caterpillar sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   H E Equipment Services and Avery Dennison carry a

12658,234173,AVY,4 Top Stocks To Buy For Solid Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Positive earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price  Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price Finding Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  In contrast  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning StrategyLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  In addition to this  we have added the following parameters Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This screens out the low priced stocks Average 20 day volume greater than or equal to 50

12664,234179,AVY,Top Research Reports For Microsoft  Philip Morris And 3M ,opinion,"Tuesday  January 23  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Microsoft  MSFT   Philip Morris  PM  and 3M  MMM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Microsoft s shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology sector over the last year  up  41 6  versus  29 5   The company is dealing with the recent security bug which poses a huge risk for users  In this context  it is rolling out patches to fix Windows kernels in order to address the vulnerability  
Additionally  Microsoft s recent blockchain deals with Hapoalim and Accenture and its Coco framework are tailwinds  The Zacks analyst expects rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 to remain the key catalysts in the near future  Further  collaborations with the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Red Hat  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Cray and PAREXEL are positive for the company s growth prospects  
Microsoft s strategic initiatives to enter the augmented reality and virtual reality market with the acquisition of Altspace VR and launch of mixed reality headsets will also be positives  However  intense competition from Sony s PS4 is a headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Philip Morris have underperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the last six months   8 4  vs   2 9    Though the company has been benefiting from enhanced volumes and revenues in the reduced risk products category  it has been suffering majorly due to consistent declines in cigarette volumes stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products  
Owing to such headwinds  Philip Morris continued with its drab performance in third quarter 2017  wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  These factors also compelled management to lower its 2017 view  
However  the Zacks analyst likes Philip Morris  consistent efforts to improve the performance of its low risk products  In this category  the company s IQOS smokeless cigarette has been steadily expanding owing to consumer demand  Higher cigarette pricing has also been favoring the company 
 You can   
Buy rated 3M s shares have gained  5 8  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has declined  1 9  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes 3M s global footprint  diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets  
The company s ability to convert high R D spends into up cycle market share gains and strong pricing power determines its success  It remains focused on inventing new products  giving it a competitive advantage worldwide  Portfolio management  investment in innovation and business transformation are the three key levers on which the company intends to focus on 
3M also intends to continue investing in capital expenditures and R D to support organic growth as it aims a prudent capital structure strategy and increased capital deployment  However  as exports form a significant part of the company s operations and growth prospects  sustained strength in U S  dollar will continue to negatively impact the company s earnings in the short term

12701,234216,AVY,4 Industrial Stocks To Buy As Harvey   Irma Wipe Out Wealth,opinion,The United States was recently devastated by two back to back hurricanes   Harvey and Irma   one being Category 4 and the other Category 5  These deadly storms wreaked havoc across Texas and Florida causing widespread damages to life and property  once again proving the vulnerability of human life To add to the woes  the hurricanes caused incessant rainfall  resulting in severe floods that crippled transportation facilities and inundated vast tracts of agricultural fields  All these events cumulatively eroded significant wealth from the economy and impacted near term growth momentum of the country Possible Economic ImpactIt is probably too early to quote the full extent of the collateral damages due to these hurricanes  as the economic costs associated with them are still rolling in and are expected to climb further  However  several experts and analysts have put forth certain estimates based on their individual calculation  According to the preliminary estimates by Moody s Analytics  Harvey and Irma together caused between  150 billion and  200 billion in damages to homes and furnishings  vehicles  commercial real estate  and public infrastructure  This is comparable to the loss due to Hurricane Katrina   another deadly hurricane that ravaged the country in 2005 Joel Meyers  the President of AccuWeather  however  believes that the hurricanes collectively cost the public exchequer to the tune of  290 billion  which equates to about 1 5  of the gross domestic product of the country  He further opined that the catastrophic storms were likely to contract the growth momentum of the country in the third quarter as subsequent rebuilding consumes further resources On the other hand  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  pegs the individual losses at  30 billion and  85 billion for Irma and Harvey  respectively  According to Goldman  Hurricane Irma was the 10th most impactful natural disaster in the United States  affecting approximately 6 1  of the populace  With pervasive devastations  the firm currently anticipates third quarter GDP to contract 0 8 percentage points to about 2  How to Profit During This Challenging TimeDespite the initial setbacks  the U S  equity markets scaled near record highs in the aftermath of the hurricanes as investors regained their appetite for riskier bets like equities  courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell off in global bond markets  As the country focuses on its rebuilding efforts  the  sector is likely to immensely benefit from continuous investments in infrastructure related assets In addition  riding on the government s proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  the Industrial Products sector has gained 11 3  year to date  Other factors like the steadily improving housing  automotive and commercial construction markets as well as uptick in new job additions augur well for the industry  Consequently  investors can expect to profit by focusing on some prized stocks from this sector that are driven by solid fundamentals 4 Industrial Stocks to BenefitIn order to select the best stocks from the sector

12703,234218,AVY,Top Research Reports For Citigroup  Qualcomm And Aetna ,opinion,"Thursday  November 2  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Citigroup  C   Qualcomm  QCOM  and Aetna  AET   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Citigroup shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the last one year  gaining  53 6  vs  40   This price performance is backed by impressive earnings surprise history  The company has surpassed expectations for earnings in all the trailing four quarters  Third quarter 2017 results reflected lower expenses and higher revenues  However  weak fixed income market revenues and elevated costs of credit were undermining factors 
The Zacks analyst thinks the company s restructuring and streamlining efforts  strategic investments in core business and expense management will likely support profitability going forward  Moreover  expansion of wealth management business in Australia will act as a tailwind  Yet several issues  including litigation burden  create apprehension  Also  in spite of rising rates  margins are under pressure  due to persistent decline in the company s legacy holdings portfolio 
 You can  
Shares of Qualcomm have gained  4 4  over the last three months vs  the  4  decline for the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry  Qualcomm posted strong fourth quarter 2017 financial results with the shipment of 220 million CDMA based MSM chipsets  The company achieved a 5G data connection with the Snapdragon X50 5G modem chipset on 28GHz mmWave spectrum  Qualcomm is teaming up with Verizon and Novatel Wireless for 5G NR mmWave technology trial  This marks Qualcomm s leadership in 5G  chipset market and mobile connectivity 
Further  it is extending cash tender offer for its pending NXP Semiconductor deal  Qualcomm has launched Mesh Networking Platform and is planning to buy Scyfer B V  to boost its Artificial Intelligence Research  However  the company continues to receive charges for unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments  Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market remains a woe 
 You can  
Aetna s shares outperformed the Zacks Health Maintenance Organization industry year to date  increasing  39 4  vs  a gain of  34 4   Aetna s third quarter earnings surpassed the expectations and grew year over year  driven by strong underwriting margin performance  disciplined pricing  a focus on high quality care management  and a decline in medical cost 
The Zacks analyst expects the company to witness long term growth from its Government business and International expansion  Its cost reduction initiatives will aid margins  The sale of its Group Life and Disability business will help it to focus on core growth areas 
Following strong third quarter results  Aetna raised its earnings guidance  cementing investors  confidence in it  Aetna has  however  been incurring losses in its public exchange business and has been exiting exchanges  Furthermore  its membership growth remains under pressure  Increasing medical benefit ratios are also likely to hurt margins

12724,234239,AVY,5 Of The Best Manufacturing Stocks Right Now,opinion,August witnessed the strongest manufacturing activity in more than six years  according to the latest report by the Institute for Supply Management  ISM   Such an upbeat reading comes at an opportune time when manufacturers have added a record number of jobs  both in the private and public sectors This boost in jobs  particularly in the manufacturing sector  is reflective of one of the Trump administration s key campaign promises  In fact  Trump s plan of comprehensive tax reform should help U S  manufacturers create more jobs  With this in mind  adding stocks from the manufacturing sector could be a lucrative move for your portfolioISM Manufacturing Highest in 6 YearsThe ISM Manufacturing Index by 2 5  to 58 8  in August  up from July s level of 56 3  and representing the highest level recorded since April 2011 Out of the 18 manufacturing industries  14 have registered growth  Investors should note that the five key indicators that are monitored by the ISM Manufacturing Index are new orders  production  employment  inventories and supplier deliveries  Although the index for new orders decreased 0 1  to 60 3   the employment index jumped 4 7  to 59 9    the highest in more than six years  the production index improved 0 4  to 61  as well The ramping up of manufacturing activity shows increased raw material purchase by managers to meet heightened demand Index Shows Growth in U S  Economy provided by the Institute for Supply Management clearly shows that the manufacturing index has been well above 50  over the past 12 months  As per the non profit organization  if the index is more than 43 3  through a length of time  it hints at an expanding economy The U S  economy grew at the fastest pace during the April to June quarter of 2017 in more than two years  During the second quarter  the market witnessed 3  improvement in gross domestic product  GDP    revised upward from the first estimate of 2 6    against only a 1 2  increment in the prior quarter  The improvement in the economy was mainly supported by strong business investments Further  favorable business spending and retail sales data have led most economists to predict that the U S  economy will maintain a growth pace of more than 3  in the third quarter Manufacturing Jobs CreatedAccording to the ADP National Employment Report  private companies created 237 000 jobs in August  marking the best pace since March  The broader manufacturing industry  which created 16 000 jobs  produced record employment in the private sector Additionally  the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that non firm payroll for the month of August increased by 156 000  Manufacturing firms created 36 000 new jobs in the United States  the highest monthly job addition in five years Growth in manufacturing sector employment is in line with Trump s electoral promises and immediate actions on assuming office  During his campaign  the president had promised to improve the manufacturing industry by creating jobs through a combination of higher infrastructure spending  tax cuts  and deregulation  And recently  President Trump asked members of Congress to pass a bill to slash business and personal tax rates in order to do just that Our ChoicesThe latest reading of the ISM manufacturing index reinforces the view that manufacturing activities are growing at a rapid pace and are likely to expand in the days ahead  Significant job creation by manufacturers  along with Trump s promises and actions  are likely to support the trend Picking manufacturing stocks seems to be a smart option at this moment  However  picking winning stocks may be a daunting task This is where our  comes in handy  Here  V stands for Value  G for Growth  and M for Momentum  and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

5 Manufacturing Stocks to Buy for 2nd Half 2017 

	Fresh data from the Institute of Supply Management released on Monday showed that the manufacturing sector is in fine fettle  The institute s manufacturing index hit a record level in June  well above that observed immediately after the presidential election of 2016  Instead of being based merely on positive sentiment  manufacturing data is now being bolstered by recently released data which hints at a pickup in GDP 

	As of date  the ISM Manufacturing index has expanded for 10 successive months with the latest report reflecting broad based improvement across most sectors  The report also reveals that a strong uptick in demand has taken place  which is why it would be prudent to invest in select manufacturing stocks going into the second half of 2017 

Sharpest Growth in Three Years

	In June  the ISM Manufacturing Index increased from 54 9 to 57 8  its highest level since August 2014  It is also significantly higher than the estimated level of 55 1  This increase of 2 9 points represents the largest expansion witnessed since the first half of 2013  More importantly  growth was witnessed across 15 of the 18 industries which form part of the survey  indicating that the expansion was broad based in nature 

	Delving into the details  the New Orders Index increased from 59 5 in May to 63 5 in June  The Production Index increased from 57 1 to 62 4 while the Employment Index gained 3 7 points  rising from 53 5 to 57 2  The New Export Orders Index increased from 57 5 to 59 5 

	An increase in order backlogs was experienced  with the associated index rising from 55 to 57  At the same time the prices index fell from 60 5 to 55  the lowest witnessed since November  indicating that raw materials prices are rising at a slower rate now 

Economic Growth Likely to Pick Up

	Even though manufacturing makes up only 12  of total economic activity  its fortunes are used to gauge those of the broader economy  Given the improvement in the report s Employment Index  jobs growth likely rebounded last month following a decline in May  Data to be released by the Department of Labor is likely to reflect this fact and most estimates put June s job gains above 170 000  significantly higher than May s level of 138 000 

	And unlike the period immediately after the presidential elections  June s manufacturing gains and indications of wider economic improvement are backed up official and more well recognized indicators  In the first quarter  U S  GDP increased by 1 4  according to the Department of Commerce s third and final estimate  which  though modest  came in above earlier estimates 

	It is now widely believed that the economy picked up pace in the second quarter  Fresh data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow model predicts that growth hit a 3  pace during this period  Last month s durable orders report was dismal but still showed that production of durable goods had increased by 2 8  over the first five months of this year 

Manufacturing Awaits Policy Initiatives 

	Prior to 2016  manufacturing had suffered years of stagnation due to a drop in worldwide demand  a decline in oil prices and a surging dollar  However  the sector staged a steady recovery in 2016 and continues to expand  regardless of the recent drop in oil prices  The only missing link at this point seems to be the plethora of policy promises which President Trump had reiterated during his presidential campaign 

	Now  industry insiders claim that June s pickup in the ISM Index is particularly notable because it has occurred without the promised policy level boost  In recent months  the Trump administration has faced fierce opposition in its attempts to enact policy changes  As a result  the manufacturing sector continues to wait for a clearer position on regulations  taxes and tariffs on imports 

	However  in a recent article  Vice President Mike Pence was quick to point out that during the first five months of Trump s tenure  manufacturing had added 55 000 new jobs  Pence also claimed that Trump has cut regulations to the extent that businesses in the U S  will now enjoy savings of  18 billion every year  Additionally  Trump has approved the Dakota and Keystone pipelines  exited the Paris Accord and is rolling back the Clean Power Plan  all of which Pence claims will significantly aid manufacturing 

Our Choices

	June s reading of the ISM Manufacturing Index indicates that the sector has experienced a notable improvement  The report also signals a pickup in broad based economic growth which is likely to boost the sector in the months ahead 

	Picking up select manufacturing stocks looks like a prudent option at this point  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics

12760,234275,AVY,EnerSys  ENS  Q4 Earnings   Revenues Beat  Guidance Slashed,opinion,Industrial battery manufacturer  EnerSys   NYSE ENS   kept its winning streak alive for the fifth consecutive quarter  The company s fiscal fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings came in at  1 28 a share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 21 by 5 8   The bottom line fared even better on a year over year comparison  improving 24 3  from the prior year figure of  1 03  The number also steered past the projected range of  1 19  1 23 For fiscal 2017  the company s adjusted earnings per share of  4 75 were up 20 9  year over year EnerSys  diligent restructuring initiatives have produced tangible improvements in short term productivity  which drove bottom line growth  In addition  decent top line performance proved conducive to earnings growth Inside the HeadlinesDuring the quarter  net sales were up 3  to  626 8 million year over year  The figure also trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  619 million  The year over year increase was influenced by robust organic volume and higher pricing of products  In addition  revenues from acquisitions also supplemented growth For full year 2017  the company s total sales were  2 367 1 million  up 2 2  from fiscal 2016  While higher sales in Asia  up 7 5   and America  up 4 4   drove the top line  this was largely offset by poor sales in the EMEA region  down 3 1   In terms of geography  both the Asian and EMEA regions recorded a year over year decline  While the Asian region net sales dipped 16 9   EMEA net sales were down by 2 5   both on a year over year basis  However  the Americas witnessed a modest year over year sales improvement of 10 2   offsetting some of this decline  While currency translation woes and organic sales decline marred total sales in both the EMEA region and Asia  positive contributions from acquisition and organic growth drove the same for the Americas EnerSys  operating earnings for the quarter totaled  51 9 million  Gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 26 6   Improvements in gross margins came on the back of improved favorable product mix and benefits from restructuring programs Enersys Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    LiquidityAt the end of the fiscal fourth quarter  EnerSys had cash and cash equivalents of  500 3 million  up from  467 1 million at the end of fiscal third quarter 2017  The company s long term debt was  587 6 million  inching down from  600 6 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter During the quarter  net cash from operating activities came in at  246 0 million compared with  307 6 million recorded in the prior year quarter GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release  EnerSys slashed its fiscal first quarter 2018 guidance  wherein it expects adjusted earnings per share to lie in the range of  1 10  1 14  from the earlier guided range of  1 21  1 25  This guidance excludes projected charges of 4 cents from restructuring programs and 1 cent from acquisition related expenses The recent price increases administered by the company are taking longer than expected to take hold  which  in turn  is attributable to the drab guidance  Also  EnerSys anticipates higher commodity cost pressure during the fiscal first quarter to weigh down on the financials Our TakeEnerSys ended fiscal fourth quarter 2017 on a decent note  with both top  and bottom line beats and impressive year over year growth  Going forward  the company believes its long term growth drivers are intact  which will continue to drive growth for the fiscal 2018  These factors include robust motive power  aerospace and defense businesses  Also  telecommunications business is expected to act as a catalyst  driven by the rise of data usage However  the drab guidance for fiscal 2018 is unlikely to go down well with the investors  We believe that high seasonality in the demand of the company s products  currency fluctuations and fall of commodity prices pose as major concerns that can thwart growth substantially  Also  softness in EnerSys  motive power business is expected to put pressure on fiscal 2018 top line performance Stocks to ConsiderEnerSys

12764,234279,AVY,5 Manufacturing Stocks To Buy For Second Half Of 2017,opinion,"Fresh data from the Institute of Supply Management released on Monday showed that the manufacturing sector is in fine fettle  The institute s manufacturing index hit a record level in June  well above that observed immediately after the presidential election of 2016  Instead of being based merely on positive sentiment  manufacturing data is now being bolstered by recently released data which hints at a pickup in GDP 
As of date  the ISM Manufacturing index has expanded for 10 successive months with the latest report reflecting broad based improvement across most sectors  The report also reveals that a strong uptick in demand has taken place  which is why it would be prudent to invest in select manufacturing stocks going into the second half of 2017 
Sharpest Growth in Three Years
In June  the ISM Manufacturing Index increased from 54 9 to 57 8  its highest level since August 2014  It is also significantly higher than the estimated level of 55 1  This increase of 2 9 points represents the largest expansion witnessed since the first half of 2013  More importantly  growth was witnessed across 15 of the 18 industries which form part of the survey  indicating that the expansion was broad based in nature 
Delving into the details  the New Orders Index increased from 59 5 in May to 63 5 in June  The Production Index increased from 57 1 to 62 4 while the Employment Index gained 3 7 points  rising from 53 5 to 57 2  The New Export Orders Index increased from 57 5 to 59 5 
An increase in order backlogs was experienced  with the associated index rising from 55 to 57  At the same time the prices index fell from 60 5 to 55  the lowest witnessed since November  indicating that raw materials prices are rising at a slower rate now  
Economic Growth Likely to Pick Up
Even though manufacturing makes up only 12  of total economic activity  its fortunes are used to gauge those of the broader economy  Given the improvement in the report s Employment Index  jobs growth likely rebounded last month following a decline in May  Data to be released by the Department of Labor is likely to reflect this fact and most estimates put June s job gains above 170 000  significantly higher than May s level of 138 000 
And unlike the period immediately after the presidential elections  June s manufacturing gains and indications of wider economic improvement are backed up official and more well recognized indicators  In the first quarter  U S  GDP increased by 1 4  according to the Department of Commerce s third and final estimate  which  though modest  came in above earlier estimates 
It is now widely believed that the economy picked up pace in the second quarter  Fresh data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow model predicts that growth hit a 3  pace during this period  Last month s durable orders report was dismal but still showed that production of durable goods had increased by 2 8  over the first five months of this year 
Manufacturing Awaits Policy Initiatives 
Prior to 2016  manufacturing had suffered years of stagnation due to a drop in worldwide demand  a decline in oil prices and a surging dollar  However  the sector staged a steady recovery in 2016 and continues to expand  regardless of the recent drop in oil prices  The only missing link at this point seems to be the plethora of policy promises which President Trump had reiterated during his presidential campaign 
Now  industry insiders claim that June s pickup in the ISM Index is particularly notable because it has occurred without the promised policy level boost  In recent months  the Trump administration has faced fierce opposition in its attempts to enact policy changes  As a result  the manufacturing sector continues to wait for a clearer position on regulations  taxes and tariffs on imports 
However  in a recent article  Vice President Mike Pence was quick to point out that during the first five months of Trump s tenure  manufacturing had added 55 000 new jobs  Pence also claimed that Trump has cut regulations to the extent that businesses in the U S  will now enjoy savings of  18 billion every year  Additionally  Trump has approved the Dakota and Keystone pipelines  exited the Paris Accord and is rolling back the Clean Power Plan  all of which Pence claims will significantly aid manufacturing  
Our Choices
June s reading of the ISM Manufacturing Index indicates that the sector has experienced a notable improvement  The report also signals a pickup in broad based economic growth which is likely to boost the sector in the months ahead 
Picking up select manufacturing stocks looks like a prudent option at this point  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics

12774,234289,AVY,Is Parker Hannifin  PH  Set For Another Earnings Beat In Q3 ,opinion,"We expect Parker Hannifin Corporation   NYSE PH   to beat earnings expectations when it reports third quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Apr 27 
Last quarter  the company posted its sixth consecutive earnings beat  recording a positive surprise of 36 4   Parker Hannifin boasts an average positive surprise of approximately 12 4  over the trailing four quarters 
We expect the company to post an earnings beat in the about to be reported quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model conclusively shows that Parker Hannifin is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is perfectly the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is currently pegged at  0 54   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  1 87 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  1 86  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Parker Hannifin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Zacks Rank  Parker Hannifin has a Zacks Rank  1  This  when combined with the company s Earnings ESP of  0 54   makes an earnings prediction likely 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum 
Growth Factors This Past Quarter
Over the past couple of quarters  Parker Hannifin witnessed impressive bottom line and margin growth due to successful cost containment actions and the  Win Strategy   We believe that fiscal third quarter 2017 financials are expected to benefit substantially from the improvised Win Strategy  which focuses on key areas such as customer engagement  customer experience and profitable growth 
Moreover  the company s diligent business streamlining efforts  undertaken over the last few years  have simplified the bureaucratic organizational structure and created a  leaner  frame  The business restructuring efforts and cost reduction initiatives are expected to generate significant operating margin improvement and profitability for the soon to be reported quarter 
In addition  Parker Hannifin s strategic acquisitions  which have played a key role in supplementing organic sales growth  are expected to drive top line growth for the soon to be reported quarter  During the second quarter  the company completed the buyout of air filtration systems provider  CLARCOR Inc   for roughly  4 3 billion in cash  We believe that this buyout will unlock multiple sources of recurring revenue streams for the company and significantly boost its filtration product sales 
Similarly  other recent buyouts  namely  Helac and Arnold J ger Holding GmbH s operating units are also expected to boost hydraulics product and global sealing sales  This apart  the company s extensive distribution network that caters to maintenance  repair and operations  MRO  markets  are expected to fuel the sales of aftermarket parts  thus benefiting the third quarter fiscal 2017 top line

12802,234317,AVY,Week In Review  NFP Fails To Lift USD  Indices Close Higher,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Friday s nonfarm payrolls headline number showed that 227K jobs were added to the US economy in January but those results were blunted by an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4 8   Average hourly wage growth also disappointed  rising 0 1  compared to the 0 3  gain expected  The US dollar fell on the news  Its recent slide continues  The Dollar Index finished the week down 0 6  at 99 73 
Gold and oil bounced higher to end week  but copper and iron ore fell on Friday after China s central bank surprised markets and raised interest rates in what appears to be an effort to deflate asset bubbles and reduce longer term financial risk 
Though US equity markets started the week on unsteady footing when the Dow  NASDAQ and S P 500 all moved lower in reaction to the the confusion caused by Trump s hastily enacted immigration and refugee ban  Friday s presidential move to roll back restrictions put in place by the Dodd Frank Act buoyed markets  in particular financials  The Dow Industrials Index saw its biggest daily gain in two months  and Tech Indices including the NASDAQ 100 are now near all time highs  The Dow recovered to closed the week down just 0 1  while the SPX and NASDAQ both finished up 0 01 
The FOMC s less than hawkish stance in Wednesday s monetary policy statement brought into question the possibility of three interest rate hikes during 2017  While the Fed did point to several signs of a strengthening US economy  including improving business and consumer sentiment  job growth  and increasing inflation during recent quarters  they also said that  near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced   an indication they are unsure where the economy might be headed in the short term  This too weighed on the dollar 
Dollar slips against FX majors
The US dollar ended the week lower against most of the majors   and finished January down 2 6   its worst January performance in 30 years 

The euro is currently at 1 0783  encountering strong resistance at 1 08  However  the single currency could see a boost after Germany s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble  that the euro s exchange rate is too low for Germany and that  the ECB must make policy that works for Europe as a whole  
The yen is trading at 112 65  The safe haven Japanese currency has been gaining as risk off sentiment grows  Additionally  despite leaving monetary policy and interest rates unchanged on Monday  the Bank of Japan raised its growth forecast to 1 4  from the 1 0  target it cited last October 
Sterling is one of this week s underperformers  down to 1 2484 versus the dollar  The cable has been driven lower by disappointing UK construction and services PMI  Additionally  though the Bank of England upgraded their UK growth forecast during their policy meeting on Thursday  the central bank kept interest rates at current historic lows  In his speech  BoE Governor Mark Carney cautioned that   the Brexit journey is really just beginning  While the direction of travel is clear  there will be twists and turns along the way  
Major commodities gain
Crude oil rose 1 3  on the week  to close at  53 86  Brent is at  56 80  Despite weekly US crude oil inventories rising by a reported 6 466M  and US rig counts climbing by 17 to 583  which would normally drag prices down  worries over fresh US sanctions on more than two dozen Iranian  Chinese  and Emirati individuals and business for supporting Iran s ballistic missile program are providing support 
Gold jumped 2 5  this week to  1 221 85  propelled by the weaker dollar and trader demand for safe havens 
Earnings reports show growth   and upside
Last week was a busy week for quarterly financial reports  More than 20  of S P 500 companies reported  including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
Apple reported Q1 2017 earnings per share of  3 36 on  78 35B in revenue  thanks to higher iPhone sales in the holiday quarter and 18 4  growth in Apple s services business 
ExxonMobil Q4 EPS came in at  0 41 against an estimate of  0 70  quarterly profits fell 40  YoY after a more than  2B writedown charge in the value of some of their assets 
Facebook Q4 2016 EPS came in  1 41 vs an expected  1 11  revenue also beat expectations  coming at at  8 81B vs an expected  8 46 billion 
Amazon s Q4 EPS  at  1 54  came in better than the expected  1 14  However  their holiday season sales and revenue from their cloud computing division AWS came in lower than expected  at  43 74B vs  44 6B  disappointing investors 
With more than half of all S P 500 companies having reported earnings  YoY profit growth is currently estimated at eight percent

12814,234329,AVY,5 Top Stocks To Buy With Solid Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price  Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price Finding Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Meanwhile  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning StrategyLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for

12816,234331,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Avery Dennison  AVY  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of office products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 78 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Avery Dennison 
For Avery Dennison  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Avery Dennison will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Avery Dennison would post earnings of  1 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 45  delivering a surprise of  0 68  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Avery Dennison doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avery-dennison-avy-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378475,200378475

12833,234348,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Is In Oversold Territory  What s Next ,opinion,"Avery Dennison Corp   NYSE AVY   has been on a bit of a cold streak lately  but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock  And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at AVY given that  according to its RSI reading of 26 07  it is now in oversold territory 
What is RSI  
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet  AVY s low RSI value isn t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround  as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late  This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Avery Dennison s earnings consensus 
Over the past two months  investors have seen 3 earnings estimate revisions move higher  compared with just none lower  at least when looking at the key current year time frame  And the consensus estimate for AVY has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days  as estimates have risen from  3 92 share two months ago to just  3 96 share right now  
If this wasn t enough  Avery Dennison also has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy which puts it into rare company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now  or holding on   as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long  You can see

12857,234372,AVY,Industrial Machinery Stock Outlook   Aug  2016,opinion,"We believe that during the Apr Jun  16 quarter macro headwinds  including unfavorable foreign currency movements and weak economic conditions in some developed and developing nations  played spoilsport for many industrial stocks  However  the impacts of such adversities are believed to have ebbed compared with the previous quarter  Toward the end of the second quarter  the United Kingdom decided to exit the European Union  adding to the existing concerns in the global economy 
Per a Jul 2016 report  the International Monetary Fund   IMF   has lowered its world economic outlook by 0 1  for both 2016 and 2017 to 3 1  and 3 4   respectively  Economic growth forecasts for advanced economies have been lowered by 0 1  for 2016 and by 0 2  for 2017  while the same for the emerging economies remained unchanged 
Industrial Machinery Nation wise Description
One of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks is industrial production  which measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below 
The United States  The country s industrial production in the second quarter fell roughly 1  year over year  while easing to a decline of 0 5  in July  The initial month of the third quarter recorded growth in utilities and manufacturing output  offset by weak mining activities        
Job market showed weakness in the second quarter  evident from an average jobs addition of 153 000 per month  down from 209 000 in the preceding quarter  In July  jobs addition was 255 000  while the unemployment rate was 4 9   In addition  unfavorable foreign currency movements and economic uncertainties worldwide led to weak export demand for the U S  manufactured machinery 
According to the U S  Census Bureau  export demands for U S  machinery declined 5 7  year over year in the first half of 2016  A 12 4  decline was recorded in shipments of farm machinery  while construction and mining machinery saw 23 1  and 45 8  fall  respectively  The exception was a 4 2  increase in shipments of industrial machinery  New machinery orders were down 5 3   while order backlog decreased 7 7  
The IMF has reduced its growth projections for the U S  economy by 20 basis points  bps  to 2 2  for 2016  while it reiterated 2 5  growth projection for 2017 
Japan  The country s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels  unfavorable exchange rates  aging population and a huge public debt  Also  consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory level since it suffered from a 3  rise in national sales tax in Apr 2015  In addition  the country is facing adversities of weak economic conditions externally  
According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders fell nearly 9 2  in second quarter 2016 as against growth of 6 7  in the previous quarter  The fall in core machinery orders has triggered concerns over the future of capital investments by companies 
Orders from manufacturing clients declined 13 4   while the same from the government clients fell 13 3   The agency predicts core machinery orders to grow 5 2  in third quarter 2016  while total machinery order is expected to increase 4 3  The IMF lowered its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 0 3  for 2016 while increasing it by 20 bps to 0 1  for 2017 
China  In second quarter 2016  China s GDP grew 1 8  sequentially  above 1 2  growth recorded in the previous quarter  while on a year over year basis  the same advanced 6 7   Though the country is still struggling with capital outflows and forex issues  a slight improvement in infrastructure investment and higher oil prices have worked in the country s favor 
In July  the country s industrial production increased 6  year over year  slightly below 6 2  in June and flat compared with May  The increase was driven by an improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors  offset by weakness in the mining sector  In July  the country s exports decreased 4 4   while imports dropped 12 5  
The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow by 6 6  in 2016  up 10 bps from the previous projection  while it expects 6 2  growth in 2017 
India The country sindustrial production in Jun 2016 increased 2 1  year over year  Expectations of a strong demand  improved policies and better monsoon conditions are factors that will influence the country s growth  going forward  The government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world 
Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country  these strategies will improve the domestic job markets as well as demand for industrial products  According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 4  in both 2016 and 2017 
Brazil For 2016  the country projects a gloomy outlookas a result of low private investments and inadequate infrastructure  The country s unemployment rate increased to 11 3  in second quarter 2016  up from 10 9  recorded in the quarter ending Mar 2016  Also available data reveals that the country s industrial production fell 6  year over year in June  
The IMF predicts the country s output to decline by 3 3  in 2016  but improve to 0 5  in 2017  The recovery is dependent on foreign direct investments and expansion of industries like tourism  steel and electricity 
Eurozone  Industrial production in the Eurozone rose by 0 6  month over month in Jun 2016  while inched up 40 bps year over year  The unemployment rate was high at 10 1  in Jun 2016  but stable compared with the previous month

12873,234388,AVY,Industrial Machinery Stock Outlook   May 2016,opinion,"First quarter 2016 results seem to be hindered by the same headwinds that had adversely influenced the previous four quarters  While economic uncertainties prevailed in some major developing and developed nations  soft commodity prices and adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency moves kept the growth momentum restricted for a few industries in the first quarter 
	As a result of the weakening health of the global economy  the International Monetary Fund   IMF   lowered its world economic outlook to 3 2  for 2016 and 3 5  for 2017  Economic growth forecasts for advanced and emerging economies have been lowered by 20 basis points  bps  for 2016 and 10 bps for 2017 
	The level of industrial activity is measured in terms of industrial production  which comprises the output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below The United States
	We believe industrial products stocks in the U S  are negatively influenced by the prevailing macro headwinds  Industrial production in the country fell roughly 2 2  in first quarter 2016 as compared with a 3 4  decline in the previous quarter  The job market showed relative weakness in the quarter  evident from an average jobs addition of 209 000 per month  down compared with 282 000 in the preceding quarter 
	To add to the woes  unfavorable foreign currency movements and economic uncertainties worldwide led to weak export demand for U S  manufactured machinery  According to the U S  Census Bureau  export demands for U S  machinery declined 1 6  year over year for the first two months of 2016  A 12 1  decline was recorded for shipments of farm machinery  while construction and mining machinery saw a 24 4  and 44 9  fall  The exception was a 22 7  increase in shipments of industrial machinery   
	New machinery orders were down 0 9   while order backlog decreased 8 3  
	The International Monetary Fund   IMF   has reduced its growth projections for the U S  economy by 20 basis points  bps  to 2 4  for 2016 and by 10 bps to 2 5  for 2017 Japan
	The country s economy is struggling with its internal issues as well as facing the adversities of weak economic conditions externally  Low investment levels  unfavorable exchange rates  aging population and a huge public debt are some headwinds affecting the country s progress    
	According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders fell nearly 9 2  in February as against the previous month s growth of 15   The fall in core machinery orders has triggered concerns over the future of capital investments by companies 
	Orders from manufacturing clients declined 30 6  while the same from the government clients grew 25 9   The agency predicts core machinery orders to grow 6 4  in the first quarter 2016  while total machinery orders are expected to increase 2 2  
	The IMF predicts the economy to grow by 0 5  in 2016  inching down by 10 bps in 2017  These projections reflect a 50 bps and 40 bps downward revisions from previous forecasts for 2016 and 2017  respectively Emerging NationsChina  In first quarter 2016  China s GDP grew 1 1  sequentially  below the 1 5  growth recorded for fourth quarter 2015  while on a year over year basis increased 6 7  versus 6 8  in the year ago period  Despite the fall  the country s economy seems to be stabilizing 
	In March  the country s industrial production increased 6 8  year over year  an improvement from the 5 4  average growth for January and February  The increase was driven by an improvement in mining  manufacturing and utilities sectors  Also  the country s exports increased 11 5   Imports dropped 7 6  
	The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow by 6 5  in 2016 and 6 2  in 2017  reflecting a 20 bps increase over the previous projections   India  The country s industrial production in Feb 2016 increased 2  year over year  Expectations of strong demand  improved policies and better monsoon conditions are factors that will influence the country s growth going forward  The new government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world 
	Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country  these strategies will serve to improve the domestic job markets as well as demand for industrial products  According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 5  in both 2016 and 2017 Brazil  For 2016  the country projects a gloomy outlook as a result of low private investments and inadequate infrastructure  The country s unemployment rate increased to 10 9  in first quarter 2016  up from 9  recorded in the quarter ending Dec 2015  Also available data reveals that the country s industrial production fell 9 8  year over year in February 
	The IMF predicts the country s output to decline by 3 8  in 2016  remaining flat in 2017  The recovery is dependent on foreign direct investments and expansion of industries like tourism  steel and electricity Eurozone
	Industrial production in the Eurozone fell 0 8  month over month in Feb 2016 while inched up 80 bps year over year  Though the unemployment rate was high at 10 2  in Mar 2016  it represented a 20 bps improvement over the rate of 10 4  in February    
	The IMF revised down its growth projections for the Euro Area by 20 bps to 1 5  for 2016 and by 10 bps to 1 6  for 2017 Zacks Industry Rank

	As of May 9th  we have Q1 results from 95 2  of the companies in the S P 500 s Industrial Products sector  Total earnings for these Industrial Products companies are down  21 3  from the same period last year on  8 6  lower revenues  with 70  of the companies beating EPS estimates and equal proportion coming ahead of revenue expectations  For the quarter as a whole  total earnings for the sector are expected to be down  22 8  on  9 4  revenues

	Other billion dollar stocks in the S P 500 group with Zacks Rank  2 and long term earnings growth rate in excess of 7  include Parker Hannifin Corporation  NYSE PH      Ingersoll Rand Plc     W W  Grainger  Inc      Eaton Corporation plc     Emerson Electric Co     and Avery Dennison Corporation  NYSE AVY     
	Non S P 500 billion dollar stocks in the machinery industry  with strong long term earnings potential  are AO Smith Corp      Rexnord Corporation    and Atlas Copco AB    Going Forward
	We believe global uncertainties will likely restrict the growth of machine and tool manufacturers  going forward  The much needed improvement in the economy as well as industrial products sector can only be achieved on the back of effective governmental policies  huge infrastructural investments  creation of more jobs and emphasis on trade relations ",2016-05-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/industrial-machinery-stock-outlook---may-2016-200128946,200128946

12922,234437,AVY,What Makes Avery Dennison  AVY  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Avery Dennison  AVY  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Avery Dennison basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Avery Dennison  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Avery Dennison
For the fiscal year ending December 2019  this maker of office products is expected to earn  6 56 per share  which is a change of 8 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Avery Dennison  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 6  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

12923,234438,AVY,Avery Dennison  AVY  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Avery Dennison in Focus
Based in Glendale  Avery Dennison  AVY  is in the Industrial Products sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 15 41   The maker of office products is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 52 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 01   This compares to the Office Supplies industry s yield of 1 7  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 08 is up 3 5  from last year  Avery Dennison has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10 68   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Avery Dennison s current payout ratio is 34   meaning it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  AVY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 56 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 8 25  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that AVY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avery-dennison-avy-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200383682,200383682

With a year to date return of 11 3  and a 62  earnings beat ratio so far this quarter  the industrial products sector is a mixed bag 
The Office Supplies industry within industrials has returned 16 8  YTD and posted an earnings beat ratio of 100  so far  Zacks  1  Strong Buy  ranked Ennis   NYSE EBF   and Zacks  2  Buy  ranked Avery Dennison Corp  NYSE AVY    are investment opportunities here  EBF earnings are expected to grow 13 95  this year after the recent upward revision post earnings  Both 2019 and 2020 estimates for AVY are up post earnings  Both companies have a VGM score B 

 
The Uniform and Related segment within industrials has returned 11 6  YTD and posted mixed results so far  Zacks  2 ranked Cintas Corp    NASDAQ CTAS   is an opportunity here  The company is expected to post earnings growth of 12 3  this year on revenue that will grow 6 1

And that isn t all  If you re willing to take a little bit of risk  there s Zacks  1 ranked Alarm Holdings  and Axon Enterprise   NASDAQ AAXN   in the Security   Services industry  Both stocks have been smashing estimates over the past year with average four quarter beats of 27 3  for ALRM and 391 7  for AAXN  They are expected to report by month s end  so estimates may get revised around then  Both have a growth score A 

 
Conclusion
We re likely not at the bottom of the selloff  so there will be a few days of uncertainty  especially considering the fact that the U S  and China don t appear closer to a deal  And that s one thing that could be bad news for the sector  The other factor is positive  i e  the Fed taking a moderate stand on interest rates  So the names with positive VGM scores would be safer

United Parcel Service s shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year  gaining  5 9  vs   7 5   The Zacks analyst likes UPS  efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and buybacks  In 2018  the company rewarded shareholders to the tune of  4 2 billion through the aforementioned shareholder friendly measures  
Continuing its pro investor approach  in February 2019  UPS increased its quarterly dividend by 5 5  to 96 cents per share  Robust free cash flow generation by UPS supports the possibility of a dividend hike going forward as well  E commerce growth is an added positive at UPS and it aided the company s fourth quarter 2018 results similar to the past few quarters  
The company anticipates cross border e commerce volume to grow by 28  over the next three years  However  the company s high capital expenditures are limiting bottom line growth  Trade war related tensions and high debts pose further challenges to the company

Shares of Morgan Stanley have lost  2 5  over the past three months  underperforming the Zacks Investment Banking industry  which has gained  2 1  over the same period  The company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  having beaten expectations in three of the trailing four quarters 
The Zacks analyst thinks its efforts to strengthen wealth management business  organically and through acquisitions   focus on corporate lending  steady loan growth  higher interest rates and normalized levels of trading activities will likely aid revenues  Also  the company s steady capital deployment activities reflect a strong balance sheet position  
However  a slowdown in debt originations will hinder underwriting fee income growth  Further  mounting operating expenses is a major near term concern for the company 
 You can   
CME Group s shares have underperformed the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry over the past year  losing  8 7  versus  5 7   CME Group s fourth quarter earnings per share beat estimates and improved year over year  The quarter witnessed increased volatility and higher customer demand for diverse risk management products  which drove strong trading volumes of more than 20 million contracts per day  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company remains well poised for growth on a strong market position with varied derivative product lines  Efforts to expand and cross sell its core exchange traded business via new product initiatives and a global reach are positives  It intends to focus more on over the counter clearing services on interest rate swaps as well as foreign exchange  
Also  the buyout of Nex Group will help CME Group generate  200 million in run rate cost synergies  annually  by 2021 end  Also  the company targets 1x debt to EBITDA by 2020 end  However  escalating expenses are putting pressure on margins

Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Avery Dennison is 18 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 8 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of  0 2  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Avery Dennison is 14   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 12 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Avery Dennison  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Avery Dennison has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

President  Investor Relations and Finance  Please go ahead  madam Cindy Guenther    Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceThank you  Jennifer  Today  we ll discuss our preliminary unaudited fourth quarter and full year results  Please note that throughout today s discussion  we ll be making references to non GAAP financial measures  The non GAAP measures that we use are defined  qualified and reconciled with GAAP on schedules A4 to A8 of the financial statements accompanying today s earnings release and the appendix of our supplemental presentation materials We remind you that we ll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results  These forward looking statements are made subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in today s earnings release  On the call today are Mitch Butier  Chairman  President and Chief Executive Officer  and Greg Lovins  Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I ll now turn the call over to Mitch Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Cindy  Good day  everyone  I m pleased to report another year of strong adjusted earnings growth with EPS up 9  or 15  on a constant currency basis  despite lower than usual organic growth of 2  due to challenging market conditions  As you know  our focus in the slower top line growth environment is on protecting our margins in the base business  while driving faster than average growth in high value categories like RFID  We are executing well on both fronts  while investing to drive future growth and further strengthen our competitive position We are largely on track to achieve our long term financial target that we communicated three years ago  Greg will walk you through the scorecard in a moment  Our consistent performance reflects the resilience of our industry leading market positions  the strategic foundations we ve laid and our agile and talented workforce  Our mission is to create value for all of our stakeholders through innovation  operational excellence and highly disciplined capital allocation  These fundamentals drive the successful execution of our core strategies in particular for keeping outsized growth in high value categories  driving profitable growth in our base business and attaining our ambitious 2025 sustainability goals In 2019  we made good progress on all of our strategic priorities  High value categories and emerging markets remain our two key catalysts for GDP plus growth across our entire portfolio  with over half of our total sales linked to one or both of these  In 2019  high value categories and emerging markets again grew faster than the average  High value categories were up mid single digits  with RFID alone contributing nearly a full point to total company sales growth Our base business declined modestly  reflecting LGM market share that we see is at the tail end of the last inflationary cycle that we discussed previously  Importantly  LGM s volume trend improved in the back half of the year  as we recovered that share  We expect this volume improvement trend to continue into 2020 Our continued focus on operational excellence  which has long fueled our industry leading service and quality was again a key enabler of significant productivity gains  The combination of product reengineering  restructuring and the deployment of lean operating principles enabled us to again expand margins  further enhance our competitiveness and continue providing a funding source for reinvestment  Equally important  we continue to make solid progress toward our 2025 sustainability goals  You ll be able to read more about this in our new integrated annual report that will come out in March Just a few highlights  As of year end 2019  we ve reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30  since 2015  over 85  of our paper is now certified to be sustainably sourced  close to 95  of our operations are landfill free  and we further improved our already top notch employee engagement scores Now looking at how our strategies played out in each of our segments  Label and Graphic Materials delivered modest organic growth under challenging market conditions  The base business was flat overall for the year  which as I mentioned reflects that share loss that we largely recovered by year end  High value categories once again  grew faster than the base  albeit at a slower pace than we re used to due to softer end market demand  Likewise  emerging markets also grew faster than average though slower than usual with strength in India and South America  offsetting weak demand in North Asia  At the same time  LGM s adjusted operating margin expanded another 30 basis points to 13 3  in this already high return business  as we completed the restructuring of the business  European footprint mid year Over the past couple of years  LGM has successfully navigated through a significant inflationary cycle as well as the subsequent transition to the modestly deflationary cycle that we ve been seeing more recently  demonstrating the resilience of our business model  Given our strong leadership position in the industry  we are willing to take some near term share risk through these cycles knowing that our superior product quality  service and cost position will ultimately went out  So  while 2019 proved more challenging  reflecting both market driven headwinds and some missteps on our own part  we are well positioned for profitable growth in 2020 and beyond with excellent returns in this business Retail Branding and Information Solutions sales increased by more than 5  on an organic basis  driven by over 20  growth in high value categories that is RFID and external embellishments  The base of apparel business declined modestly reflecting market demand that was impacted by trade related uncertainty  While there are signs of potential resolution of this uncertainty  some customers may further rebalance their supply chains  Our global footprint  along with our differentiated product and service capabilities gives us a significant competitive advantage to win over the long term  as we partner with our customers to support their evolving sourcing strategies Enterprisewide  RFID products and solutions grew by more than 20   generating roughly  365 million of sales  reflecting ongoing penetration of apparel as well as expansion in relatively new verticals  including food  beauty and logistics Our total pipeline of customer engagements continue to expand  Compared to this time last year  our number of customer engagements from business case to rollout is up 50   driven primarily by categories outside of apparel  As the leader in ultra high frequency RFID  we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities with industry leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best most experienced team in the space  And we continue to build out this platform  increasing our level of investment to drive growth both organically and through acquisitions and external partnerships To that end  our purchase of Smartrac s inlay business  which we expect to close late this quarter represents an excellent strategic fit for us  Combined RFID becomes a more than  500 million business  expected to grow 15  to 20  annually over the long term  Smartrac s capabilities complement our existing product offerings and process technologies  while expanding our intelligent labels platform to better serve industrial and retail segments  And their global manufacturing footprint  likewise complementary to our own  strengthens our inlay manufacturing capacity and capabilities Turning to profitability  RBIS  adjusted operating margin expanded another 120 basis points for the year  The team has done a tremendous job transforming RBIS into a simpler  faster and more competitive business over the past four years  and we re pleased with the performance we re seeing here Shifting now to Industrial and Healthcare Materials  Although sales growth was modest for the segment  we believe we outpaced the market across most categories  And importantly  we made substantial progress toward our 2021 profitability target  driving 140 basis points of adjusted margin expansion  We ve strengthened our management team here and fine tuned our strategies  We remain confident that this segment will deliver significant value over the medium to longer term All in all 2019 was another solid year  As we reflect back on the last few years  we are pleased with how we have leveraged our foundational strengths in operational excellence and innovation to consistently make progress toward our long term goals to deliver GDP plus growth and top quartile returns on capital We have driven outsized growth in high value segment  while also growing profitably in our base businesses  We have substantially reduce the environmental impact of our operations  while focusing increasingly on the development of innovative more environmentally friendly products  We have continually driven productivity that has enabled us to ramp up our pace of investments in high value segment  particularly RFID  while also expanding margins  And importantly  this progress has been made possible by our amazing team that s dedicated to delivering for all of our stakeholders in a dynamic environment  while upholding our long standing commitments to integrity and excellence As we look to 2020  we are confident  we will continue to make progress in our strategic fronts  including the next evolution of our leadership structure and wave of productivity initiatives  As you know  we have had a theme over the last few years to move more and more decision making closer to our markets both to increase speed and lower costs  Along these lines  we are now consolidating our corporate and group functions for LGM and IHM In addition to making the leadership structure nimbler this and other productivity initiatives  we ve recently launched will yield significant savings through 2021  enabling us to continue to increase our pace of organic investments  while also expanding margins  So once again  we re pleased with the progress we ve made toward our long term goals over the last few years and in 2019 specifically  and we expect to make continued progress in 2020 As for guidance  we expect adjusted EPS of  6 90 to  7 15 with our outlook reflecting improved volume growth and continued productivity gains  partially offset by incremental investments and transition costs associated with our next wave of restructuring actions I ll now turn the call over to Greg Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mitch  and hello everyone  I ll first provide an update on our performance against our long term goals and then walk you through fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2020 Slide 7 of our supplemental presentation materials provides an update on our progress against the five year targets that we communicated in 2017  and recall that this represents our third set of long term goals  after meeting or beating our previous two sets of long term targets  As you can see  we are largely on track specifically  over the past three years  sales growth on a constant currency basis is in line with our target up 5 7  annually  While organic growth was close to 4   just slightly below our target due to the generally slower demand environment in 2019  And reported operating margin hit nearly 11  in 2019 or 11 7  on an adjusted basis  up from roughly 10  in 2016  And due largely to that combination of strong top line growth in margin expansion  adjusted earnings per share was up 18  annually Return on total capital  adjusting for the distortion related to the termination of our U S  pension plan came in close to 20  for 2019  well above our 17  target that reflects top quartile performance relative to capital market peers  And our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt to EBITDA ratio below the low end of our target range Our consistent progress toward achieving these long term goals reflects the diversity of our end market  our strong competitive advantages and our resilience as an organization to adjust course when needed  Together  these give us confidence in our ability to deliver GDP plus growth and top quartile returns on capital over the long term Now at the same time that we communicated our financial goals through 2021  we also laid out a five year plan for capital allocation  which you can see on Slide 8  We re tracking well against this plan  starting with strong cash flow generation  and we ve put a total of  2 4 billion to work over the first three years of this cycle allocating they are largely in line with our long term plan  And clearly  our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue our pace of investments for organic growth and acquisitions  while also continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way Now  let s focus on the fourth quarter  Overall financial results were solid with adjusted earnings per share of  1 73  up 14  versus prior year and about a nickel  better than our expectations  We grew sales by 2 1  on an organic basis and currency translation reduced reported sales growth by 1 9 points in the quarter  Adjusted operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 11 9  and we realized  18 million of restructuring savings  net of transition costs in the quarter  due in part to LGM s restructuring in Europe And our cash generation has been strong  as we delivered  512 million of free cash flow for the year  up roughly  83 million compared to 2018  And this increase reflects both profit growth and improved working capital efficiency  The fixed and IT capital spending  total fixed and IT capital spending came in at  257 million in 2019  which was in line with prior year  and a bit lighter than we had expected  due to the delay of some spending related to project timing at year end  Utilizing our strong cash flow  we returned  427 million in cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and a higher dividend in line with the average amount of cash distributed to shareholders over the preceding two year period So turning to segment results for the quarter  Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 1 5  on an organic basis  driven by the net effect of volume and mix  partially offset by pricing  LGM s base business and high value categories were both up low single digits in Q4  The base business sales trend improved from earlier this year  reflecting the easier comparisons due to the timing of share loss at the end of 2018 and early 2019  as discussed previously  And high value category growth slowed in the quarter reflecting the decline in graphic sales due to a challenging prior year comparison in North America as well as generally softer end market demand in the quarter Stepping back to look at LGM sales trends through the course of 2019  organic growth has been relatively stable between 1  and 1 5  each quarter  In the first half though  volume and mix represented a net negative with price adding roughly 2 5 points  On the second half  volume and mix were net positive with price becoming a headwind by the fourth quarter  Given the sequential deflation that came through in the third and fourth quarters  we do expect pricing to be a roughly 1 5 point headwind to LGM s organic growth in 2020  with the toughest price comp impacting this year in the first quarter Breaking down LGM s organic growth in the quarter by region  North America declined at a low single digit rate  reflecting what we believe was a relatively flat market along with lower prices  Western Europe grew at a low single digit rate  driven by modest market growth and share gain  partially offset by pricing  Emerging markets were up low to mid single digits with relative strength in South Asia  Eastern Europe and South America  partially offset by a modest decline in China  And operating margin for the segment was strong  up 40 basis points on an adjusted basis to 13 3   as the benefits of productivity initiatives and the net impact of raw material deflation in pricing were partially offset by unfavorable product mix Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions  RBS delivered another quarter of strong top line growth  up 5 2  on an organic basis  driven by continued strength in RFID and external embellishments  which were up more than 20  on a combined basis  Our base business  adjusted for the migration of products to higher value RFID solutions was up slightly versus prior year  a modest improvement compared to Q3 and in line with our expectations  Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded by 140 basis points to 13 6   as the benefits from increased volume and productivity were partially offset by higher employee related costs and growth related investments Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment  sales declined by 1 1  on an organic basis  as the low single digit increase for industrial categories was more than offset by mid single digit decline in healthcare  We continue to make solid progress on the margin front in IHM beating our 10  margin goal for the full year  For Q4 specifically  adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 10 2   as the benefits of productivity gains and strategic pricing initiatives more than offset higher employee related costs So turning now to our outlook for 2020  we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of  6 90 to  7 15  We ve outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 14 of our supplemental presentation materials  We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 2  to 3  with the midpoint of that range  reflecting the carryover effects of the share  we recaptured in LGM  partially offset by expected price reductions associated with the deflation that we ve been experiencing Our 2020 fiscal year contains 53 weeks ending on January 2  2021  The extra week  which you pick up in the fourth quarter is expected to add about one point to reported sales growth with no impact on organic growth  And note that the extra week crosses over the New Year s holiday  so it s expected to be a low volume week with lower than average profitability  and we expected to add an estimated  0 10 benefit to EPS And we expect that the Smartrac acquisition will add about 1 5 points of growth for the year assuming the deal closes late this quarter  Given transition cost and interest expense  we expect the acquisition will be modestly dilutive to earnings in 2020  roughly offsetting the benefit of the extra week  So the effects of the two will not be equally distributed through the year At recent rates  currency translation is a 30 basis point headwind to reported sales growth  with a headwind in the first half  particularly in the first quarter becoming a slight tailwind in the fourth quarter  And we estimate incremental pre tax savings from restructuring  net of transition costs will contribute between  30 million and  40 million in 2020  And note that a meaningful portion of the savings associated with the restructuring charges we ve taken recently will not be realized until 2021  likely in the order of  30 million We expect that both the GAAP and adjusted tax rates will be in the mid 20s for the full year  with variability in the GAAP tax rate from quarter to quarter  as usual  And we just anticipate spending  220 million to  230 million on fixed capital  and IT projects  down from the previous two years  as anticipated  And cash payments associated with our restructuring initiatives are likely to come in around  35 million  roughly  20 million lower than the past year  And we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of roughly 84 million Finally  while the Coronavirus situation in China is very fluid and it s early days to assess its full impact  we factored in up to a nickel headwind to our EPS guidance  reflecting the mandated delays and starting backup following Lunar New Year  that s impacting many regions in China in which we operate  And of course  our first priority is ensuring the health and safety of our employees and that s the focus of our team right now So in summary  we re pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long term goals in 2019  and we re committed to delivering exceptional value through our strategies for long term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation And now  we ll open up the call for your questions Cindy Guenther    Vice President  Investor Relations and FinanceJennifer Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W  Baird   Co  Please proceed with your question  Please go ahead  Your line is open Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystSorry about that  Hey guys  how are you Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  good Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystI guess  first off on the 2 5  core sales growth that you re guiding toward the midpoint  Can you sort of break out that construct further by segment  I know you called out a 1 5  or so price headwind for LGM  but what about volumes for each of the segment  And for the Coronavirus impact in the nickel that you have baked in  will that impact do you think both segments LGM and RBIS or is it specific to one Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So first Ghansham on the growth our 2  to 3  as I talked about includes volume growth a bit higher than that  with about a 0 5 of price headwind in LGM  which is about a point for the full company  Should we expect a little more volume growth  particularly in LGM some of the carryover share gains that we had in 2019  And then within RBIS  we expect to continue to see strong growth in RFID contributing similar level of growth for the company that we saw in 2019  So I think that s the biggest drivers of growth between LGM and RBIS for the year We look at the Coronavirus impact most of what we factored in that nickel is related to the materials businesses since those are generally serving demand  it s accredited in China  and that s the biggest impact  And that Nickel basically is based on about a week starting up later post Chinese New Year Within RBIS  the factors there are generally serving demand in the other regions  So we do foresee some potential delays of shipments from Q1 into Q2 depending on how this plays out over the next couple of months  but the demand we think wouldn t be as effective that would be in the materials businesses Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So just to add to that  obviously a fluid situation  Our first priority as Greg noted earlier is ensuring the safety and health and well being of our teams and second to ensuring we re supporting our customers  as they work to support their overall end market demand as well through this environment  So pretty fluid  Our guidance and considers just one week basically lost sales and lost consumption for the direct    for the consumption in region  just the shift from Q1 and Q2 for end demand that s serviced from China to outside of China Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystAnd the confidence  Mitch  on the volume improvement  is that baked on visibility you have on share gains or are you assuming a better macroeconomic backdrop as the year unfolds  What do you have embedded in there Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe use the base broad economic forecast that you would be looking at as well for 2020  But the specific improved trend just reflects the improved trend we saw in 2019 particularly LGM  If you recall the first half we re comping lower share positions within LGM  within that business Then hopefully on the RBIS side outside of RFID  which we continue to expect continued strong growth both there and external embellishments  But we had some negative impacts from the volatility just around the tariff situation and so forth  So that s    we do expect an improvement overall  but lot of it s just comping some weaker trends that we saw particularly in the first half in LGM Ghansham Panjabi    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystOkay  And then for my second question on RFID legacy Avery RFID has been growing pretty steadily at call it 20  or so a year  How does that compare to Smartrac in terms of their growth rates  What does it add from a technology standpoint to Avery and which particular end markets  are you getting incremental exposure to  I think you called out industrial and some    and retail ability  So just more clarity there  Thanks Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So Smartrac was the leader and developer and manufacturer in RFID inlays  The new technology it brings us in areas such as NFC  some near field communications  as well as the sensors around moisture and temperature sensors and so forth  And a number of new applications  I mean  they obviously serve the base apparel business like we do But they also bring a number of new applications  such as interactive garments that provide    enable people  for example in ski jackets to have real time interaction through social media using connected and smart appliances  toys  there s a number of various end applications  And from an end market perspective increased expansion exposure within retail  and then also in the automotive sector as well  So those are some of the new capabilities and technologies that it brings And as far as growth  their growth rate is below ours  So we ve talked about our long term growth objective being 15  to 20  plus organically  We ve been delivering around 20  as you suggested Ghansham  We re now saying the combined entity  we expect to be 15  to 20   The reason the growth was slower was just they were growing slower in retail  with Avery organically taking a bit of share each year in the space  Then two  just automotive saw a little bit of a slowdown  particularly in 2019 for all the other reasons that we ve been talking through So very strategic acquisition  brings us great capabilities  and we re confident and we re going to be able to deliver 15  to 20  growth with the combined entity with margins above the average profile consistent with what we ve been delivering so far OperatorOur next question comes from the line of George Staphos with BofA Securities  Please proceed with your question George Staphos    BofA Securities    AnalystHi  everyone  Good morning  Thanks for taking the question Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHI  George George Staphos    BofA Securities    AnalystHow are you doing  First question  I had was on the restructuring Mitch and Greg  if you could provide a little bit more detail and to the extent possible I recognize that you can t share everything obviously  but what s involved with the next restructuring action you mentioned I think combining some back office or organizational structure between LGM and IHM what else is involved  down the road  might we see some further production capacity melded together or folded in given the investments that you ve made  And what did you say is your actual net benefit from productivity and restructuring actions this year  I know there s some that will trail into  21 and beyond  but what do you get this year net of transition costs Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So I ll answer the first part of the question  Greg will cover the outlook for the savings  So specifically  George  I mean  again next wave of restructuring actions that we ve    are recently unfolding  the biggest single one there than the charge in Q4 related to the consolidation of the functions between IHM  corporate and LGM  So it s exactly what you called out We see an opportunity to move faster and reduce costs by better integrating and removing that extra functional level to be able to deploy more of those resources locally for driving growth So that s the largest area of the restructuring  There is a number of other initiatives  and we ll comment on those in due time Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Thanks  Mitch  So I think from the savings perspective in 2019  we had about  50 million of restructuring savings  net of transition costs in the year  As we said earlier  we expect us to be about  30 million to  40 million in 2020  but about  20 million to  25 million of that being carryover from the actions that we did in 2019  The largest part of that carryover of course come in the first half from that European footprint action OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global Markets  Please proceed with your question Anthony Pettinari    Citigroup Global Markets    AnalystGood morning  In LGM it sounds like high value products were really strong for the year  but Graphics and Reflectives are down low single digits in 4Q  I think you talked about a tough comp  but I think you also mentioned demand maybe being a little bit softer  And I was wondering if you could tease out the impact of those two factors and kind of any thoughts on what you re seeing in Graphics and Reflectives in 1Q or what you expect Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So not much view we get in 1Q  just given the early start to the year and where we are right now  I think in the fourth quarter  we did have probably an even split between the challenging comps  particularly in North America from prior year and a little bit of slowness across the other regions from a Graphics perspective  Still last year  we grew in the    I think low to mid single digit range for Graphics overall for the year  So we would expect to get closer to that level for full year 2020 as well Anthony Pettinari    Citigroup Global Markets    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then just on RFID  the Japanese producer that made an announcement about printable ICs that could maybe reduce tag prices to  0 02 or less  And I guess without talking about any particular competitor  do you think printable IC technology is something that is    could potentially be impactful to the RFID business  is it really something that s new  Just any    just general thoughts about that in RFID Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  That development  specifically relatively early stage  but I m not going to talk too much about the specific development  But overall  we were quite close to the developments in the industry  We re a leader in the space  And we look at anything that expands the product offering including lowering the cost even if it s got more reduced storage capacity has been good for the industry and good for us So it s something we re close to and following  But I gave too many specifics  but there s a number of developments going on  just like we re developing within our pragmatic venture investment that we have another route to low cost basically circuitry if you will  integrated circuit  So  yes  we re close to it  We think it could be exciting for the overall industry and exciting for us OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystYes  Thanks for taking my question  So with regard to the deflationary environment  do you expect to give all raw material benefits that you are    that you should be seeing back in the form of price or do you get to keep or capture some of it at this point  I guess how should we be thinking about that as we look at 2020 Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think from a 2020 perspective right now  we re expecting price and raw material input cost to be relatively neutral year over year  So as we went through the back half of 2019  we saw sequential deflation start to pick up in Q3  a little bit more than in Q4  really largely centered around paper coming down in the back half of the year And as you know  typically when we have price up or price down  as the quarter still lags  we probably kept a little bit of that in the back half of last year and then we ll pass that through more into the    as we enter 2020  So I would expect 2020 to be closer to neutral from a price and raw material input cost perspective Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd just to build on that  we don t think of it as passing through necessarily and so forth  It s basically each of the we re talking to the average  and every single region  every single product category is different  so it depends on where the inflation is happening as far as across the spectrum between our base and higher value segment  as well as whether it s paper or more chemical space  And right now  it s more paper based  which all us and all of our competitors tend to be equally exposed to from a commodity standpoint Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo it varies  We re going to continue to manage it  I think we ve    as I commented on  we did it successfully through the last inflationary cycle and now we re in a modest deflationary  Our guidance assumes that it s    as Greg said relatively net neutral OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Michael O Brien    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey guys  it s actually Michael O Brien filling in for Adam  Thanks for taking my question  Just one on IHM quickly  obviously nice margin expansion this year  Can you talk about sort of what your outlook is for 2020 and how far you think you can take that Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So our expectations on IHM as you said  we had margins up little over a point in 2019  And we had said when we re sitting here a year ago  we were targeting 10  margins in LGM in  19  We delivered a little bit better than that  Our expectation in 2020 is to continue improving our margins  and we re targeting 11  or better in 2020 on the path toward our long term target of 12 5  or higher  So we re continuing to improve or expect a continued improvement in 2020 and then further improvement again in 2021 Michael O Brien    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Thanks  And then just back to input costs for a second  you mentioned paper has been deflationary probably the biggest  Can you    can you just give us a sense of how deflationary it s been just on a percentage basis Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So I think for the full year  19  we still had net inflation year over year  starting to see that deflation in the back half  I would say  kind of in the low to mid single digit range from a percentage perspective  What we re expecting in 2020 is kind of low single digit deflation consistent with what we talked about before about a point and a half or so and price down as well in 2020 Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd much of that carryover Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerExactly Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOn both fronts OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan Securities  Please proceed with your question Jeffrey Zekauskas    JPMorgan Securities    AnalystThanks very much  Is Smartrac a profitable business  Or can you talk about its profit characteristics in rough terms Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So overall  I mean  I ll just talk about the business in terms of    we talked about EPS  we expect it to be a hit in 2020 related to integration costs and everything else that goes along with the first year of acquisition  Next year we already expect the EBITDA margins    their EBITDA margins now are above our company average  They will be above the company average again  next year just like our RFID business  And we expect to be commensurate with our RFID businesses EBITDA margins in 2022  So that s where the profitability is now  and we expect it to be comparable to our existing RFID business in a couple of years time Jeffrey Zekauskas    JPMorgan Securities    AnalystOkay  Great  And in terms of raw material costs year over year in the fourth quarter  were they down about  10 million roughly Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So in Q4  we were down  as I said a minute ago kind of low to mid single digit percentage from a deflation perspective  particularly in    largely in LGM because that s obviously where we use the primary amount of our paper  So IHM for instance doesn t use as much paper  as a percentage of its materials OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Paretosh Misra    Berenberg Capital Markets    AnalystThanks for taking my question  First on the RFID side  is there any interest to grow any other technological capability in that business  for example maybe scanners or sensors or maybe more printers or maybe even some software Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So we    overall we refer to it as a building out leveraging RFID to build out our Intelligent labels platform  And one of the reasons for the shift in the languages to not limit ourselves  so thinking just about the    at the time  UHF RFID inlay technology  So yes  we are looking broadly beyond the specific technologies that we have    rollout from a legacy standpoint had We already are in the printers business  So we did manufacture printer RFID enabled printers  We have    we are investing more and more in the information solutions capabilities  which information solutions is a key aspect of RBIS  core business as far as managing data between the retailers and brands and their globally outsourced apparel manufacturers  so building on that And as I mentioned earlier  Smartrac actually does bring some sensor technology with it as well  So we are looking primarily around technologies that link the physical to the virtual world and enable the Internet of Things  So heavy focus around the inlays capability and looking at other    other capabilities on the periphery to invest and to enable further growth Paretosh Misra    Berenberg Capital Markets    AnalystI see  Thanks  And then on the    in the LGM base business  if you could maybe just talk about the outside the inflation  deflation  but just the supply demand balance that you re seeing  And when do you think you might be in an environment  where you might be able to raise prices Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSorry if your question is about what the supply demand environment is  I think we ve talked about that overall  But what we re    our outlook is going into 2020 on growth overall  the volume trends have been improving in the second half of  19  We expect it to continue to improve in the 2020  And from a pricing standpoint  we re very disciplined  look at ourselves being the market leader  not just doing what s right for our business  but the industry  And when I talk through managing successfully through the inflationary cycle raising prices multiple times to move ourselves to where we wanted the business to be and adjusting course  as we started to get in the deflationary cycle  So our pricing actions  we talked about it broad based here  But it s very specific targeted customer by customer  product by product and so that s what informs our decisions around pricing both up and down OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley Investments  Please proceed with your question Neel Kumar    Morgan Stanley Investments    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking my question  Can you just talk about your cadence of volumes through the fourth quarter and what level they had been at so far in January Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So again as we talked about a little bit earlier  our volumes particularly in LGM were a little bit stronger in Q4 than they have been earlier in the year  So in LGM in the first half  as we said  volume and mix was a net down year over year and Q4  we started or in the back half  we started to see improvement in volumes including in the fourth quarter  as we ve picked up some of that share gain  as we ve talked about already Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOverall the read in Q4 is difficult month to month because of timing of holiday shifts  Thanksgiving  Christmas moving a little bit earlier every  every period  So the overall trend macro that Greg laid out is the right one to focus on as we go into January  January is also very difficult to read into all of East Asia because of Lunar New Year is relatively meaningless as far as the trends outside of that  And what we re seeing in January is consistent with the revenue guidance that we re giving  with    looks like again  around timing of holidays and so forth  There might have been a little bit of deferral of some shipments in North America from Q4 into Q1  a little bit maybe more shipments that we expect in Europe in Q4 versus Q1  So they basically balance out in total Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  And when you look at organic growth in the first quarter that will be our largest price headwind year over year  so that have an impact on the quarter certainly compared to the full year impact on price Neel Kumar    Morgan Stanley Investments    AnalystOkay  Great  That s helpful  And then you mentioned that 2019 capex was a bit lighter due to the delays in spending  but then your 2020 capital spend guidance is still coming down about  30 million or  35 million  Can you just talk about what s driving that  And is the 2020 capex a decent run rate to think about going forward Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we have our long term    we laid out a five year capital allocation plan  which basically had  250 million on average spend over that period  I know that s a loose average  We spent a little bit more than that in the last couple of years  And we did say that we would have a    bit of higher during those two periods  We ve been able to spend a little bit less partially because of the delay  as Greg commented on as well as we ve found ways to spend a little bit less on the existing projects that we had planned  So we    our five year average that we ve laid out was  250 million is less than that in 2020  as we ve    as we walk through  And if you pull back from the numbers  we ve also discussed  we ve gone through a period of recapitalization of our footprint in North America and Europe  which is a key driver of the greater investment in 2018 and  19  And obviously that s now complete and that s not something that happens all that frequently OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Christopher Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Christopher Kapsch    Loop Capital Markets    AnalystYes  Thanks for taking my questions  So just a follow up on Smartrac is the way you describe the profitability of that business  I m trying to understand why you re suggesting it would be dilutive  It looks    I think you said it s more profitable than your RBIS segment or at least consistent with your RFID portion of your segment and we know what we paid for it  the annualized sales rate  So just trying to understand  are you just not    if you re not excluding your integration costs as one time in nature to describe it s dilutive because it looks like it should be accretive Gregory S  Lovins    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Chris  so this is Greg  So the modest negative in 2020  as you said  include some of our integration  project management cost of that integration as well as some interest costs related to the funding of that acquisition  And then of course  related to amortization  So I think earlier  Mitch was referring to EBITDA margins being at or above    sorry our company average  and similar to our existing RFID business Obviously  we haven t closed the deal yet  So we re still working through the exact amortization impacts  but that will have an impact at the EPS perspective  So right now  with the integration costs and the incremental interest costs related to    we expect a modest negative in  20  And as Mitch said earlier roughly breakeven to slightly positive in year two Christopher Kapsch    Loop Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And then within your LGM segment you described some of the high growth categories as sluggish  I think Graphics in particular  Can you just elaborate on what may have changed there because the    the cadence of that business  I think had been generally a pretty positive or sustain a decent growth trajectory  So just wondering if there was an inflection in the quarter or anything specific that s contributing to the weakness in that business  Thanks Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerChris  is your question about Graphics Christopher Kapsch    Loop Capital Markets    AnalystYes  Graphics  specifically Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So Greg talked through the growth that we saw all of 2019 specifically in Q4  there were headwinds around tough  some tough comps and so forth  Aside from that the Graphics within LGM  LGM vast majority of their revenue is tied to consumer non discretionary  Graphics is a little bit more cyclical given that it s tied to car wraps and other things that can in a period of uncertainty be deferred for a bit  So generally as you think across cycles  this one is a little bit more cyclical than the rest of Labels and Graphics Materials  Overall that we saw growth for 2019 and specifically within Q4  as you ll see quarter to quarter  there is some choppiness OperatorOur next question is from the line of George Staphos with BofA Securities George Staphos    BofA Securities    AnalystThanks  Two follow on questions  guys  thanks for taking them  First of all  Mitch  can you talk a little bit further about how you view the strategy for IHM and how it s been evolving company I think has been saying for several years now that it s a core business and you view it as analogous to LGM in terms of what you can do to improve margins  Certainly some of the questions that we get from investors  clients don t necessarily always see it that way  So how do you see the strategy in IHM evolving  And with this restructuring  how you see the management structure changing or not within   within IHM  That s question number one Question number two  Can you just update us on sustainability trend  as regards closing the loop on your products from RFID to LGM Label Materials  Thank you  and good luck in the quarter Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  George  So from Industrial and Healthcare Materials standpoint just broadly  I mean this is a near adjacency to Labels and Graphics Materials  It s pressure sensitive material  You leverage our adhesives capabilities both innovation as well as just the capacity that we have as well as it s the coating capability  So if you were to look in the plants that would look similar to the specialty assets that we have within LGM  The difference is they are used for functional materials  they re not printed on  So it s    the adjacency is very much from a back end perspective  they are separate markets  so we will continue to have separate leadership running these businesses  as we do today So that is  overall  what the linkage to LGM and the synergies  what we ve been talking about over the last couple of years is creating more linkage on that back end manufacturing  R D and so forth as well as the support functions  integrating that so that we can have very focused dedicated commercial and general management leveraging that core capability across the two to attack the markets  And then broadly  those    these are spaces that have secular tailwinds within the market  There is a migration of    from mechanical fasteners like nails and screws to tapes and adhesives and that s something that we see in the broad market that we want to continue to invest in  So    so that s on IHM On sustainability  we ve obviously have made tremendous progress and the industry leader on many fronts on this  We are out early with the drive toward and committing to a set of 2025 goals back in 2015 making great progress on that both on reducing the environmental impact of our operations  as well as innovating products and solutions  You asked specifically about RFID and LGM  So within RFID  RFID is a great enabler to support our customer sustainability goals  With increased tracking you can have read much  much greater reduction of waste  whether that would be in apparel as well as within food and so forth  So RFID  we see it as a great enabler to reduce waste through the    through the entire value chain And from an LGM perspective  here we ve been focusing constantly  with long standing tradition  we would call it  Think Thin  so reducing the material content of our materials  But on top of that we ve really been focusing more of our R D efforts around coming out with innovative products that are focused on recyclability So enabling more efficient recyclability of the end package  which includes CleanFlake and we re focusing on next gen Innovations there as well as using more recycled content in our actual products  We had some launches at Labelexpo that came out with the first ever recycled PE face liner    face material as well as recycled PET products and so forth  So we re using our innovation prowess to be able to continue to be the innovation leader for the space and meeting our customers  sustainability goals OperatorMr  Butier  there are no further questions at this time  I will now turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks Mitchell R  Butier    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Well  thank you everybody for joining us  The fourth quarter capped a very solid year  and we re positioned well going into 2020  Thank you all again for joining us  and we look forward to seeing many of you at our
