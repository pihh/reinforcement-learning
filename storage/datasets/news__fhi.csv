OfficerThank you  Ray  Good morning  As of today  we have officially changed our name to Federated Hermes  Inc  and we are unveiling an updated corporate identity next week  focused on a commitment to responsible investing to achieve financial outperformance  The new name reflects the combining of two active management firms  Federated Investors  Inc  and Hermes Investment Management Federated Hermes offers world class active investment management and engagement services across a wide range of asset classes for investors around the world  guided by the conviction that responsible investing is the best way to sustainable wealth creation  Beginning on Monday  we will trade under the ticker FHI Moving onto our business performance and looking first at equities  assets reached an all time record high of  89 billion at the end of 2019  an increase of 23  from 2018  For the fourth quarter  in addition to positive market impact of about a little over  5 billion and gains from PNC funds acquisition  which closed in mid November  a little over  2 billion  net sales of combined equity and separate accounts were slightly positive  Equity mutual fund sales were positive in the fourth quarter  just under  230 million  and for the full year of about  625 million We had 16 equity funds with net sales in Q4 led by Kaufmann Small Cap  Hermes Global Equity ESG  Hermes Global Emerging Markets  and Hermes SDG Engagement funds  On a full year basis  equity gross sales increased 45  and net redemptions were down 81   Using Morningstar data for the trailing three years at the end of 2019  one quarter of our equity funds were in the top quartile and more than half were above median Looking at the strategic value dividend strategy  recall its objective is to provide a high and growing dividend income stream from high quality companies  the domestic funds 12 months distribution yield was 3 8   which ranked it in the second percentile of its Morningstar category at the end of 2019  The domestic strategic value dividend strategy had combined mutual fund and SMA outflows of about  350 million in the fourth quarter  down from  580 million in Q3 Looking at early first quarter results  combined fund and SMA net sales for this strategy were about  30 million through January 24th  Overall combined equity fund and SMA net redemptions year to date through January 24th were negative by  76 million  There were some lumpy redemptions in one of our European mandates Turning now to fixed income  equity    or assets increased to another record of  69 billion at year end  On a full year basis  gross sales were up about 6  and redemptions decreased 8   Full year net sales were slightly negative   119 million  compared to  3 2 billion negative in the prior year  For the fourth quarter  net sales of  1 4 billion combined with gains from PNC acquisition of about  450 million and market gains of  1 2 billion to move assets to the record high level On the fund side  we saw net sales of High Yield Funds just under  500 million and Ultrashort funds just over  300 million  among others  Separate account net sales included multi sector  Total Return  and High Yield strategies  At year end  using Morningstar data for the trailing three years  we had seven funds  21  in the top quartile  and 20 funds or 59  in the top half  Combined  fixed income fund and SMA net sales are  19 million year to date through January  These net positive sales have been led by Total Return Bond Fund  High Yield activity and Ultrashorts Moving to money market  Assets increased about  36 billion or 10  in the fourth quarter  including about  11 billion from the PNC acquisition  Money market assets increased  94 billion or 31  for the full year to close 2019 at record high assets of  396 billion  Money market strategies continue to have a significant yield advantage  compared to average deposit rates  Money market yields also compared favorably to applicable direct market rates and longer duration securities  Our money market mutual fund market share  including sub advised funds at year end was about 8 8   up from about 8 4  at the end of Q3 and 7 9  at the end of 2018 Taking a look    now at our most recent available asset totals  with Federated as of January 29th  Hermes  January 17th  Managed assets were approximately  583 billion  including  401 billion in money markets   90 billion in equities   70 billion in fixed income   18 billion in alternative   4 billion in multi asset On the money market mutual fund asset side  the assets were  283 billion  RFP and related activity levels continued to be solid and diversified in the fourth quarter with interest in MDT  Kaufmann and Global Emerging Markets for equities  high yield  liquid credit  and short duration for fixed income  We began 2020 with about  450 million in net institutional mandates yet to fund  all on the fixed income side On the international side  we have    had a good response from clients for the initial new funds developed for US distributions that are sub advised by Hermes  Assets in these funds were just over  75 million at the end of the year with about  44 million externally sourced by the subtraction method that will tell you what the seed assets are  We are evaluating further US mutual fund launches using Hermes  strategies  We are actively presenting Hermes  strategies with our institutional customers and are working with Hermes to develop opportunities for them to offer Federated strategies to their clients We are progressing on the expansion of the EOS stewardship and engagement business in the US and are working to hire several new engagers  EOS assets under administration reached  877 billion at the end of the year  up from  781 billion at Q3 and about  500 billion at the end of 2018 Hermes  managed assets at year end were at  49 billion  up from  44 billion at the end of the third quarter and  42 6 billion at the end of 2018  Hermes  fourth quarter net sales were  1 3 billion all third party  Favorable exchange rates and market gains contributed to the increase in assets as well  We are looking to grow our business relationships and opportunities both inside and outside the US  including alliances and acquisitions to complement our domestic and UK  European  Asia Pac  and Canadian operations  Tom Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Chris  Total revenue was up about  18 million or 5  from the prior quarter  due mainly to higher money market revenue of about  12 million  primarily from higher average money market assets  Equity and fixed income revenue also increased from Q3  primarily from higher average assets Performance fees of  2 8 million were recorded in Q4  compared to  1 5 million in Q3  2019 totaled performance fees of  7 4 million mostly from Hermes  strategies  Hermes  performance fees in 2017 were approximately  7 4 million and  8 5 million in 2018  Revenue was up about  191 million or 17  for the full year  due mainly to higher money market revenue of  115 million and the inclusion of a full year of Hermes results in 2019  compared to half of 2018  which accounted for  96 million  These increases were partially offset by lower domestic equity  multi asset  and fixed income revenue of about  19 million Looking at operating expenses  comp and related decreased about  800 000 from the prior quarter  due mainly to lower incentive compensation expense of  4 million  partially offset by severance pay of about  2 7 million  resulting from the combining of certain administrative  operational  sales and investment teams  Distribution expense increased about  5 million in Q4  compared to the prior quarter and  53 million for the full year  due mainly to higher average money market fund assets  As a reminder for Q1  our revenue is negatively impacted by fewer days in the quarter  partially offset by lower related distribution expense  In addition  payroll taxes and employee benefit costs are seasonally high in Q1  compared to Q4 Expenses related to the PNC deal totaled about  1 3 million  During Q4  these costs  which were primarily recorded previously as professional service fees    previously in previous quarters as professional service fees  were capitalized as part of the asset purchase intangible asset  Subject to finalization of the PNC deal asset valuations  we do not expect an increase in amortization of intangible asset expense  due to the nature of the recorded assets The decrease in other operating expense line item for Q4  compared to Q3 was due largely to the currency exchange rate impacting both the valuation of US dollar assets at Hermes and the foreign exchange hedges used by Hermes to swap US dollar based revenue in the pounds in order to line up with their largely pound based operating expenses  In Q4  this resulted in an expense credit of  1 8 million  compared to the  1 2 million in Q3 of expense  in other words  a  3 million variance  This Q4 expense credit was partially offset by the overall negative impact of exchange rates on Hermes  reported Q4 operating results estimated at about  1 3 million across all operating line items The increase in total operating expenses for 2019 versus 2018 was primarily due to the aforementioned inclusion of Hermes  full year results  Also higher distribution expense primarily from higher average money market fund assets and higher incentive compensation and related expense Non operating income expense of  1 4 million from Q3  primarily due to an increase in the market value of securities held by consolidated funds of  3 4 million  offset by lower private equity carried interest on assets managed by a non consolidated entity  The carry was  5 4 million in Q4  compared to  6 8 million in Q3 Non operating income increased  51 4 million in 2019  compared to 2018  primarily due to the 2018 FX loss in connection with the Hermes acquisition of  29 million  primarily higher equity carried interest on assets managed by the non consolidated entity of  9 million and an increase in the market value of securities held by consolidated funds of  7 million  As we ve said previously  we are not able to forecast future private equity carried interest  In 2019  carried interest recorded was  11 3 million  In four of the previous five years  carried interest was approximately  3 million  In the fifth year  the carry was about  13 5 million The  2 4 million increase in net income attributable to non controlling interest in subsidiaries from Q3 was primarily from consolidated funds and from Hermes  At the end of 2019  cash and investments were  341 million  of which about  276 million was available to us Jess  we would like to open the call up for questions now Questions and Answers OperatorCertainly  Ladies and gentlemen  at this time we will conduct a question and answer session   Operator Instructions  We are now ready to begin  Our first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Good morning  folks  and congrats on the new name  Maybe just to start off with that  on the name change  maybe  Chris  if you just want to elaborate a little bit    right now instead of doing this when the deal closed  And then if you can just talk a little bit about the new marketing program  what you intend to do specifically and what the expense impact you expect for 2020 on    with that new marketing program J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  In terms of the timing of the name change  the excitement and all of the work that was done to get the deal together was also one of the reasons it didn t happen right away  There was a lot that goes into changing the name of two organizations whose lifetime has been under a different nomenclature  We were able to combine though the fiduciary heritage of Federated and the ESG and responsible investing activities of Hermes  and felt that once we got all organized as funds on the block where we are selling them with a responsible investment office opened at Federated  with the integration of ESG into money markets at Federated  and then well on the way in several other of our investment management teams  and with the acceptance that the clients have had  we felt this was a very good timing Behind the curtain  in terms of internal  we announced all this internally last year at our sales conference  which is next week  wherein we have the 230 high powered engine machines coming into Pittsburgh  and we felt this was a perfect time to launch that into the marketplace  so it was both an external and an internal decision making Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerYes  On the expense side  you know  it s a forecast  So    it s a forecast  but somewhere around  5 million advertising  signage   Technical Issues  business cards  names of products  There s a lot that s involved in doing that and we look forward to moving forward Federated Hermes Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThat s helpful  And then maybe just the third party sales  it looks like that did    on the net sales basis a little bit  did tick up in the fourth quarter  Maybe if you have any kind of expectation  given    especially given the branding and the additional marketing  and of course the more recent excitement about ESG  so to speak  What are your expectations for third party sales for Hermes  products in 2020 J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerSaker  that s your turn Saker Nusseibeh    Chief Executive Officer Hermes Fund Managers LimitedSo all that I can say is  the RFP activity is very high  and we have seen net sales to continue in this    beginning of this quarter  If I were to give you the numbers  I m going to give you the numbers in pounds  because that s the numbers that I see  In terms of inflows last year  that s gross inflows  we saw about GBP8 billion of gross    just over GBP8 3 billion  that s gross inflows coming out last year  And I d expect something slightly ahead of that without the sales in the United States through this year  It s not an exact answer  but I m not going to give more of a guidance than saying it s going to be    we believe  better than the year just ended Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystRight  OK  If I could just sneak one more in on the admin service fee increase in 4Q  19 versus 3Q  what was the driver of that and what should we    it looks up to  70 million from  64 million  What should we be thinking for a run rate in 2020 in that J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo Brian  that s driven by mutual fund average assets generally and given the volumes  money market mutual funds more specifically  So that will correlate to the change in average assets going forward Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  Great  Thanks very much for all the color OperatorWe ll move next to Patrick Davitt at Autonomous Research Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystHi  good morning  guys  So you talked about the  5 million in marketing  How should we think more broadly about the expense trajectory bringing in a full quarter of the PNC assets in 1Q and then beyond now  Technical Issues Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerSo the expenses on PNC  we ve got the    Chris went through the list of the money markets and the equity and the fixed  and we re not    we said today we don t expect to have amortization related to that  So the expenses with the money markets will primarily be related to distribution payments and all the other funds merged into our existing funds  so where there is distribution payments there  We also picked up a great team in Cleveland with three funds  so we re picking up the expense of that team and at Cleveland office and the connections into Federated and the new efforts to sell and distribute that funds    those three funds in a wider fashion  So we re pretty excited about the whole outlook on the merger and the growth of the new funds Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystI guess more    I mean  more broadly though  like do you have a view on including that  5 million of extra marketing where expenses will be  kind of  in 2020 versus 2019  Flattish  up a bit Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerNo  we talked about  5 million in 2019 related to Hermes and that included a breadth of    broad list of things  new products  people  as Chris mentioned  in responsibility office and kind of across the Board  So we would expect to see    and then when you start new funds and you hire new people  you have a continuing expense  So we think that some of this expense related to advertising and the other changes might    all of it might not reoccur  but then we might switch to do more advertising into the future  So we ll just see  So what we can talk about is basically a  5 million number for 2020 Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystAnd that    is that on top of the  5 million in Hermes  you had in 2019  Or does this kind of move into now this Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think it s    I d say when we hire people  then this is in addition to that Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystYes  OK Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerSo we didn t go through and say we spent exactly  5 million  That was an estimate from work that we had done in advance and do we hire all the people or are we going to hire the rest of them in 2020  It s not an exact science  We are trying to give you some indication of what we were looking to do and we re trying to implement it Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  Thanks a lot OperatorWe ll move next to Dan Fannon at Jefferies Daniel Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  Just a follow up again on expenses  I guess  first on comp  4Q here  you had revenues sequentially rise  but comp down  Just curious if there was anything specific in that number  And then you had the normal seasonal step up  as you mentioned for payroll  Just remind us for you guys how much that is and anything else that  I guess  as you kind of bridge between 4Q and 1Q  that might be more notable J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo Dan  on the second part of that  the bump up in payroll tax and 401 k  seasonality will probably be in the  3 million range for Q1  compared to Q4  And as Tom mentioned  a lot of our revenue    most of our revenue is based on    is calculated on a daily basis  And we didn t work through the numbers  We re coming into 2019  we estimated about  5 million for Q1 of  19 of lower sequential net revenue  so it is a significant change in Q1  because of the fewer days Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerAnd the last thing    the first part of your question was  why the recalibration of the down in the incentive compensation and it s basically what it is  We re looking every quarter to get that number right  and coming to the end of the year and recalibrate everything and we had to adjust down Daniel Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And then could you elaborate a bit  I think you    on the equity year to date trends  the negative  I think it was  76 million and you talked about some international products maybe that saw some outflows  I guess a little more color on that  and I think    I guess you said the backlog and I think the activity levels are there    are positive  So just    if there s anything else to unpack there  please J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerThe    there was a lumpy redemption that came out of one of our Hermes funds  and I don t have any more to say on it than that  It was over  100 million and that was greater than what was the negative and that s why I mentioned it is    as lumpy  But when you have big customers  you get big moves  We ve discussed that before  There is nothing going on in the performance that move was not a performance move  So it doesn t worry us in terms of future flows Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerAnd on the forward numbers  the  450 million that we talked about was fixed income  There are some institutional type of wins  but we expect those to go into funds and that sometimes happens as well  and that s probably a couple of hundred million dollars  but we did not include that in the  450 million  that s all fixed income Daniel Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorWe ll go next to Michael Carrier with Bank of America Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning and thanks for taking the questions  So maybe first one  just on the Hermes Federated  like the rebranding  And then maybe just going a little bit more in detail and particularly on the US side  when you look at maybe 2020 versus 2019  just like what initiatives maybe are in place  whether it s by the  you know  the different distribution channels  whether it s through the trust  the banks or the retail  some of the products that were launched  what are the sales force  which products are they going to be focused on  Just any more granularity to try to see if that traction starts to pick up within the USA J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe are very  very excited about what now amounts to a broad based family of international products to bring to our US distribution  This includes the products as Tom mentioned from Cleveland  New York products  Pittsburgh products and London products  that now represent a complete array  And part of the effort as I mentioned in our sales meeting next week will be to focus on these products into the future  so that s one pretty big push  Another area that we re going to be making a bet on is Asia Pac through Harriet Steel s operation inside Hermes  And we think that is something that is going to be    get some focus as well And as you know on the institutional side these things are not    these sales are not made in a short timeframe  It takes a minimum of a year  sometimes into the second year before you begin to actually win mandates having cloud the ground  it s just the timing that s involved  So those are some of the things Internally    and this wouldn t be for 2020 that we re talking about  but internally  we re looking at getting organized the private markets area  We already announced the completion of the purchase of MEPC  which is a real estate development company that the pension scheme in Hermes had worked on for many years  We re looking at the private equity side of it as well  We ve added people to the infrastructure side and we re trying to get that all organized  We re building into the future  but as I said  that s not a 2020  that s down    more down the road  So those are some of the main things Deborah Ann Cunningham    Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of Global Liquidated Markets   Senior Portfoli Speech Overlap  This is Debbie  Can I also mention  basically the full integration of ESG analysis into our credit review process for all of our liquidity product  that was something we had been driving toward since the 2018 acquisition and accomplished that in 2019  That was evolutionary  not revolutionary  it will continue to develop  but we have absolutely included from the analysts and the engagers the information that s coming out of the Hermes proprietary model and used that within the qualitative aspects of our credit analysis process for our money market fund Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  And then just quick follow up  just on that fixed income side  so in the quarter  you saw pretty good strength and then it sounds like that s continuing into 2020  Just anything  particularly in the quarter  just given that the number was over  1 billion  just anything that was more lumpy that you would call out Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerWell  on the institutional side  Mike  there were some good wins on the multi sector side and so institutional accounts are  by definition  lumpier when they come  We also saw a return to strength in high yield  so in    with the yield challenges in the marketplace  high yield came back into more significant flows  And we mentioned    that s continued early into the first part of 2020  the Total Return Bond Fund  So it s the spread products that have been responsible for the inflows Ultrashorts were a meaningful part of the Q4 positive  just to correct  they are actually a little bit negative in the first part of 2020  and that s really just more technical analogous to what happens in the money market fund side  where money tends to come in especially late in the year and then we go value  Phonetic   you can kind of think of that as much more like long cash than that the spread products that really have driven the inflows on fixed income Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Thanks a lot OperatorWe ll move next to Bill Katz at Citi William R  Katz    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Thank you very much for taking the question this morning  Just to spend a little time talking through some of the choppiness on the multi asset and the alternative buckets  if you re seeing better growth elsewhere  sort of wondering what might be going on underneath that just as we think ahead J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  those sales are slow and take a long time  and as you ve noticed  the numbers are roughly flat  and that s one of the reasons I mentioned that we were looking to get better organized on the ownership and    of those entities  Even though we control some of them  we have to get those things organized  first  before we decide to make big investments into them into the future  And that s why I characterized it as getting organized this year with ideas of having them put points on the board next year  And that s pretty much the theme in all of those private markets  I think the multi asset credit product  however  has    had good strong positive flows  good reflection on the new product  and I d ask Saker to comment on that particular one Saker Nusseibeh    Chief Executive Officer Hermes Fund Managers LimitedSo if I may    Chris  I ll comment just briefly on the private markets and then on to this one  On the private market one  I will just remind people that it s a longer sales cycle  because generally speaking the assets remain with us for many  many years to come  It also affects our income because quite oftentimes  there are two kinds of additional revenue besides the fee revenue we get  which is the management fee revenue  One is performance fees in property funds generally speaking  and then a carry fee in private equity funds  And that means that it s sometimes difficult to look on them on a quarter by quarter or a year by year basis for these two reasons And if you look at our multi assets  this is a capability that we ve been holding over several years  It exhibits the same standards of alpha that others have  And again  just to remind everybody  the Hermes product offering effectively is all high market    high active share  which means very different from Benchmark  integrated ESG and has very strong performance fees and that is beginning to come in multi assets and that s why we re seeing the inflows coming through as we are in other parts of the business J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerI ll make one other comment  Saker doesn t make a comment like this  because of the reason I m going to say that we did have  1 6 billion in sales in private equity  but those are basically numbers that we already had before where they re just rolling over  but it is a positive indicator about the underlying strength of the organization William R  Katz    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  I ll follow up offline  I m just trying to track into the outflows you re talking in your disclosure  Just one last question  Just in terms of how you think about a lot of different flows  different segments  different geographies  How do you think about the interplay between net new assets on the long side of the business    long only side of the business versus fee rates from here Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerWell  the fee rates are    we haven t had immediate or current or grand disputations on those in our plans  especially for this year  On the institutional side  they are generally individually negotiated as per the disclosures we ve made  On the fund side  there are the normal discussions with distributors about sharing and the regular marketplace that is unchanged  So we aren t currently dealing with meaningful reductions in fee rates William R  Katz    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorWe ll move next to John Dunn at Evercore John Dunn    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  Thank you  I wonder  if you could give us a little more flavor of the Hermes sale discussions with institutional clients  and maybe how big an opportunity that could be  and if we could start to see more of an impact in the second half of 2020 J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  since Saker was on that road show with the institutions  I will let him comment and then I will add Saker Nusseibeh    Chief Executive Officer Hermes Fund Managers LimitedThank you  So we continue to see a strong interest in our products for institutional clients  Again  to remind everybody  before the majority stake was acquired by Federated  we already had some marquee clients in the United States  So although we weren t big  it s not as if we were not known  but these sales  as you well know  typically take some time to come through  but we re seeing a lot of positive reception  some to our fixed income  It might surprise some of you  but some to our US small cap and certainly to our SDG fund as well  So we are hopeful that this will begin to come through in this year and translate into assets J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would add a couple of things  We are adding to our institutional sales force here  it s like one sies  two sies  but it is because we have a lot of confidence in these mandates  And at the macro level  one of the reasons is exactly the reason for the combining of the name  You bring Federated s fiduciary heritage  which is a drive for performance  an alpha hunter and active manager with Hermes  who shares exactly those views along with a lifetime commitment to responsible investing  This is the overall message that we are bringing to the institutions and we think we are able to bring it in a unique way  because of the focus on the fiduciary and because of the beauty of the engagements the way Hermes has done it And the way Hermes has done it that makes it unique is it is a third party effort  So there is a group that does EOS that sends the 40  team into various companies to get data that looks forward into what is going to happen in addition to taking all the data that s backward looking as to how people did do  And these kinds of things are good messages in the institutional world  And if you have the numbers to go along with it  we think it makes for an excellent project John Dunn    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  And then just one on strategic value dividend  It seems to be trending in a better direction  but what do you think we are in the sales cycle for that and maybe just some of the environments in the past where you ve    that have been good for that strategy J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  in terms of the sales cycles  as I ve mentioned  we ve seen the sales continuing to increase and redemptions continuing to decrease  And so far in January  it s a positive flow story  Part of the reason for that is in continuing low rate environment  this 3 8  distribution yield with a growing dividend stream is a very  very viable product  And people  at least some of the thoughts from the marketplace are that they are continued interest in this product and they are continually interested in the yield  Some are not willing to jump full scope into the market  but they like getting the yield to keep them interested  So overall  the tone we re finding from the broker deal or SMA world is that they are cautiously optimistic and that s a good situation for strategic value dividend John Dunn    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much OperatorWe ll move next to Kenneth Lee at RBC Capital Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my question  Just one on the Hermes EOS  You touched upon    mentioned that you are in the process of hiring new engagers right now  Wondering what other further milestones would you expect for    in the near term and could we potentially see implementation in the US sometime this year  Thanks J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  the implementation is in the US this year  We ve already hired some and there are more on the docket  And overall  my expectation is we ll cross    we ll go from  877 million  over  1 trillion in assets under administration in some time frame here in the future  I hate to put exact date on it  It s Saker s Leon Kamhi who runs it  I ll let him tell you about it Saker Nusseibeh    Chief Executive Officer Hermes Fund Managers LimitedSo we ve    we  already prior to this of course  engaged with companies in the United States  Our commitment to increase our key engagement capability in the US is partly    was partly also to service the fund managers within the Pittsburgh in New York and Boston offices for Federated  because our view has always been that the use of ESG  which we pioneered from 30 years ago and the use of stewardship  which we pioneered again from 30 years ago  and formalized 15 years ago with the launch of the EOS team is in fact the way in which helps us find better data on companies and helps us add alpha  So this has always been a commitment there The increase in people in the States  engagers allows us a deeper engagement with American companies and a better way of servicing our increasing number of US based clients  And again to remind people  we run EOS in a different way from others  We run it as a kind of a club where all of our clients decide collectively on the topics that they want to pursue with the companies and the companies they want to talk to  including  by the way  the teams that we have here who act as a client  So the Federated Hermes teams act as a client to the EOS  And this is different from perhaps others out there who are trying to enter the stewardship arena by pursuing what they see as the right teams to pursue Now  that allows us to focus on companies in a way of improving the long term performance in that way actually release better value creation and wealth creation in the long term  So we are there  we ve added more people  There is a segment of the floor in Pittsburgh  which is already EOS  and that will continue to grow over time  It s something we ve been building for 15 years  we are the market leaders  we will continue to build Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thanks  And I guess one follow up  if I may  just on the money market funds  You touched upon that money market fund rates are still favorable  compared to some competing products  Wonder if you can just give us a little further details in terms of the current competitive landscape  Thanks J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerDebbie Deborah Ann Cunningham    Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of Global Liquidated Markets   Senior PortfoliSure  I ll take that one  Deposit rates are still    I think over the last spring bank brokerage deposit rate index came in at 14 basis points  So it s not much above where most funds were in a zero rate environment and we re no longer in a zero rate environment  Most of our funds are somewhere  on a net yield basis  between  160 and  180  The interest rates went down with the coronavirus over the course of the last several weeks and concerned about what that might do from an economic activity perspective and how the Fed may need to react  The Fed  however  on Wednesday confirmed rates and actually raised IOER and the RRP  which is overnight lending by 5 basis points  So that s beneficial to our products and has made the yield curve look a little bit more attractive on a fund basis  So I don t expect those yields to drop very much  So when you re talking about deposit rates  you re talking at least 150 basis point advantage over what most customers in those types of accounts are receiving at this point Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thanks OperatorWe ll move next to Ken Worthington with JP Morgan William Cuddy    JP Morgan    AnalystGood morning  This is Will Cuddy filling in for Ken  So first  the compensation ratio has bounced around a little  Could you remind us of how you think about the growth of compensation relative to revenue over the long term  And more specifically  with the revenue growth  how should we be thinking about that trending over time Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerYes  Will  this is Tom  We don t look at it based on revenue  We are more granular in the US in terms of how the sales force is  how the compensation is done there and that s based on how sales go  And of course  then you go to investment management and a huge portion of their pay is on and incentive is on how performance is done  Then the operation and the rest of the non sales  the non investment management are more tied to an operating income view  So that would have a little bit of revenue look at it  but it s certainly more of a bottom line approach  And we don t look at the ratio comp to revenue  We ve never calculated that  We ve never used that in our budget process  We re really doing a build from ground zero and up William Cuddy    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  got it  Thank you  And did I hear correctly earlier it s  1 6 billion of sales in private equity  And if so  what products are seeing those sales Thomas Donahue    Chief Financial OfficerWe re referring to Hermes did a press release actually in November talking about Hermes GPE raising  1 6 billion for private equity  and Saker  you might want to comment on that more  but essentially the point that Chris was making is  business is largely rolling over from other successful vehicles and it s a good indicator of the quality of the results that have been delivered through that   Saker Nusseibeh    Chief Executive Officer Hermes Fund Managers LimitedSo the way that our private equity business works is that we raise tranches that go into essentially funds  although they re not funds in the sense that you think about them in the United States  but they re in fact private equity funds  And each tranche raises money over a set amount of time and then it s closed  And then the performance is calculated over the next  depending on the fund  between three and five years  and then the carry is paid out accordingly  And this increase was getting around to primarily all of our existing clients  We re very pleased with the performance of our previous funds  which remember  when a private equity fund performs  you actually give the money back  because you re selling an underlying asset and therefore reinvesting it back into our new fund  which then allows us to go out and invest it again  And so the cycle starts again  and that s typical for private equity cycles  And the clients are widely dispersed  including some major clients we ve got in North America as well Raymond J  Hanley    Senior Vice PresidentAnd Will  it s Ray  Just from a reporting standpoint  you won t see the  1 6 billion  We would not put that in there as a new sales  So it s not in the Q4 number  Those are commitments going forward  And as Saker indicated  they ll largely roll over from existing mandates  So you won t see that in the numbers  but it s obviously a very positive development William Cuddy    JP Morgan    AnalystJust as a quick clarification  so of the  1 6 billion  like is that mostly reup  so it s not new clients coming in  it s just    it s just them rerolling back into the new fund Raymond J  Hanley    Senior Vice PresidentYes  yes William Cuddy    JP Morgan    AnalystGot it  Thank you Saker Nusseibeh    Chief Executive Officer Hermes Fund Managers LimitedAnd sorry  and remember  we make our money in two ways in private equities  One is we make our money obviously on the management fee  but also we make our money on the carry on the upside that we create and alpha we create for our clients over the long term  And it s a bit different than property where it s performance fee and slightly over a shorter time horizon  but they both have that basic model within it OperatorWe ll move next to Robert Lee with KBW Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Good morning  guys  Most of my questions were asked  but I guess I will ask the inevitable capital management question  I mean  Chris  knowing you like to hit on acquisitions  dividends and buyback  just with the apparently increased earnings power of the company  kind of  coming through the last quarter  this quarter  any sort of changes  particularly maybe in how you re thinking of the dividend or repurchase part of that  because I guess you haven t raised the dividend in a while and payout ratio is  I guess  trending toward a little bit lower than peer average  So how do you think of that J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we certainly don t want the price to go down to improve that ratio  but acquisitions remain on the table and doing all of these other things  which we talked about on capital assets  I mean  we are looking at all the things I mentioned on the marketing side  I m not going to go through them again  We have some internal things we re doing on our data management and warehousing and we ve accelerated those  We re putting a new CRM in  We re going with salesforce for the Federated part of it  which Hermes already has that  So that ll be put together and that will take a few bucks So internal is added to that list of the dividend  share buyback  and acquisitions  Now  in dividends  we always look at that in April and we are well aware of all of the statistics that you re commenting on and we will have a hardy look at that in April  On share buybacks  we were up a little bit from our polite activity in the past and we continue to be active on that  And that s about as much as I can give you on that activity Robert Lee    KBW    AnalystOkay  That was all I had  Thanks for taking my question OperatorWe ll return to Patrick Davitt at Autonomous Research Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for the follow up  I remember some chatter last year  you had kind of mentioned that there were some discussions to maybe roll some of the BTPS money that had come out back into other strategies  Are those discussions ongoing  Any update on the potential for some of that money to come back in J  Christopher Donahue    President and Chief Executive OfficerSaker Saker Nusseibeh    Chief Executive Officer Hermes Fund Managers LimitedWell  I just realized I had my mute on  I had the mute on  sorry  As I said  we have some rollover of money from BTPS  but net net  we have net decline as per the plan that we agreed with them  when the majority stake was purchased  but we continue to show them other stuff that we have  particularly in money market and fixed income  And again  they are an institutional client and you d expect them to take some time  I would repeat what I said  I think  previously on these calls  which is the following  As you would expect the net fee basis that I can    that we can charge BTPS is commensurate with their size  which means  as they free capacity in our high alpha  in demand funds  and we sell the same capacity to new clients  our margins actually go up Patrick Davitt    Autonomous Research    AnalystRight  OK  Thank you OperatorWith no other questions holding  I ll turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing comments Raymond J  Hanley    Senior Vice PresidentWell  that concludes our call and we thank you for joining us today Operator Operator Closing Remarks
