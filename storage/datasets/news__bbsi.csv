6922,228437,BBSI,Is Barrett Business  BBSI  A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Barrett Business Services  Inc    NASDAQ BBSI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Barrett Business has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Barrett Business s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 14 37 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Barrett Business has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 11  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Barrett Business stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Barrett Business has a P S ratio of about 0 76  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 44x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Barrett Business currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Barrett Business a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the PEG ratio for Barrett Business is just 1 26  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  BBSI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Barrett Business might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives BBSI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen none estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period  This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 27 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 9 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Barrett Business Services  Inc  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineBarrett Business is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank and a Zacks Rank  3  among Bottom 23  of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Outsourcing industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch  The report is only available for a limited time

6942,228457,BBSI,Trade War Heats Up  Here Are The Winners   Losers ,opinion,"Wall Street now braces for a full fledged trade war between two of the world s largest economies as the United States bumped up tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese products  Unfortunately  last minute talks between U S  trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese vice premier Liu He failed to salvage months of encouraging reports hinting at substantial progress in trade talks   Tariffs on Chinese goods have risen to 25  from 10   and Beijing has pledged to retaliate  China s Commerce Ministry said that  the Chinese side deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures   The Ministry added that  it hoped that the U S  and the Chinese side will work together to resolve existing problems through cooperation and consultation  The situation might worses as President Trump threatened to levy tariffs on all Chinese goods with America  And this means imposing tariffs on the remaining  325 billion worth of Chinese products  His moves will invariably affect more than 5 000 China made products  including fresh and frozen foods  chemicals  textiles  metalwork  building materials  electronics and consumer goods But  why are the United States and China at odds  China has always faced Trump s wrath  Trump criticized trade imbalances between the countries  Protection of intellectual property rights by the way continues to be a bone of contention for the economies  Chinese delegates said that they will deal with such issues but Trump wants  strong enforcement language   to police any deal  China views the trade war as U S   attempt to curb its growing influence across the globe Nonetheless  investors are worried that the trade war might easily destabilize an already slowing global economy and raise tensions between the superpowers regarding South China Sea and industrial espionage  The International Monetary Fund  in the meantime  warned a tariff war would pose a  threat to the global economy   The body  which aims to ensure global financial stability  asked for a speedy resolution With possibilities of a heightened U S  China trade war looming  the stock market is bleeding  But not all stocks are facing the brunt  Let us  thus  look at the potential winners and losers from the trade war  Two Tech Stocks That Avoid U S  China Trade ExposureTechnology stocks aren t in great shape  especially  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Thanks to trade related issues  Apple has trimmed its fiscal first quarter sales forecast  citing slowdown in iPhone sales in China  Chipmakers  revenues are also expected to be impacted if China retaliates  Intel Corporation  NASDAQ INTC  has cut its revenue forecast for 2019  citing lower demand from China But  two tech behemoths are less vulnerable to trade related concerns   Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Mark Mahaney  lead technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets  said that these companies have a low exposure to China at roughly 1  to 2  Additionally  Facebook is less pricey when its price earnings ratio is considered  Netflix  incidentally  keeps producing top notch original content which should consistently drive revenues  Shares of Facebook and Netflix have advanced at a solid pace so far this year  While Facebook jumped 43 9   Netflix soared 35 5   Facebook currently flaunts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while Netflix has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Why Thinking Small is Not the Only OptionIn the wake of the present trade scenario  investors seem to be shifting to small cap stocks  This is because such stocks tend to have higher proportion of domestic sales compared to large caps  But  in reality  the difference isn t much  Per data from FactSet Research  small cap stocks in the Russell 2000 index derive nearly 20 6  of their revenues from outside the United States  while stocks from the broader S P 500 obtain about 30 3  In this context  companies that derive most of their revenues from the United States should remain unaffected  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  chipped in that CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   rakes in 100  of its sales from the United States  Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU   is another company that draws 95  of sales from the country  Goldman added  Hence  it s natural that these companies stand to gain the most from the trade war escalation  After all  their profits aren t getting eroded due to the limited exposure to foreign markets While shares of CSX Corporation have risen 25 8  on a year to date basis  Intuit gained 22 6   Both the companies boast a Zacks Rank  2 Service Firms Are Big GainersService firms are safe bets for now  Such firms are unperturbed by trade retaliations as they have less foreign sales exposure compared to goods companies  Service stocks also incur lower foreign input costs that might be subject to tariffs  Such input costs mostly related to direct materials  labor and factory overheads Some may argue that growth in the service sector  the main component of the U S  economy  has slowed for the second straight month in April  This is because the ISM nonmanufacturing index was 55 5 in April  compared with 56 1 in March  Let s admit  the current level is still above 50  indicating expansion  At the same time  job gains in the service sector continued to rise in April  whereas job gains in the manufacturing sector dropped for the third straight month Some of the service stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio are Barrett Business Services  Inc    NASDAQ BBSI    Insperity  Inc    NYSE NSP    G III Apparel Group  Ltd   NASDAQ GIII    Stifel Financial Corp    NYSE SF   and Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS    All of them have gained more than 25  so far

Not So Lucky Ones One of the biggest area affected by trade tensions is the U S  automotive industry  Last year  China had increased tariffs from 15  to 40  on any U S  manufactured automobile entering the country  And now  with China contemplating more tariffs  things are surely not looking up for U S  automakers  General Motors  NYSE GM   in particular  projected  1 billion extra costs this year owing to tariffs  Harley Davidson also cautioned that its tariff related costs are expected to increase from  23 7 million in 2018 to more than  100 million this year What about heavy equipment makers  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  has claimed that tariffs would cost the company  250 million to  350 million in 2019  while Deere   Co expects U S  tariffs on Chinese imports to cost around  100 million this year Last but not the least  Archer Daniels Midland  the processor and seller of agricultural commodities  products  and ingredients  said that trade tensions will disrupt its supply chain and eventually dent earnings Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 7 stocks to watch  The report is only available for a limited time ",2019-05-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-war-heats-up-here-are-the-winners--losers-200420268,200420268

illegal migrants coming through Mexico  and into our Country  STOP   He added that the  tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied at which time the Tariffs will

6945,228460,BBSI,U S  Service Sector Expands At A Brisk Pace  Top 5 Winners ,opinion,The service wing of the U S  economy picked up in May  recovering from a 20 month low  This provided some relief to an economy that was losing momentum early in the second quarter  thanks to weak reports on consumer outlays  and housing and manufacturing activities  to name a few  Bittering trade relation between the United States and China coupled with impending U S  tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico isn t doing any good to the economy either Nonetheless  increase in the new order index  a slight uptick in business activity and improvement in employment point to underlying strength in the service sector  Thus  investing in service oriented companies at the moment seems judicious U S  Service Sector HummingAccording to the Institute for Supply Management  ISM   the non manufacturing index  NMI  came in at 56 9 in May  topping analysts  estimates of a slight dip to 55 4  It was also higher than April s two and a half year low of 55 5  The non manufacturing sector  thus  saw uninterrupted expansion for the 112th consecutive month  indicating that the broader economy is on track for steady growth this year  After all  the non manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 90  of the economy  while any reading above 50 indicates that the said sector is expanding Notably  16 of all 18 non manufacturing industries reported expansion  led by education services  transportation and warehousing  utilities  real estate  finance   insurance  healthcare  construction  mining  retail trade  and information Lest we forget  a NMI reading above 48 6  indicates expansion of the broader economy as well  U S  GDP expanded at an annual pace of 3 1  in the first quarter of this year  per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  It was way higher than analysts  expectations of 3  growth  Strong contributions from real gross domestic income drove GDP numbers  Uptick in state and local government spending  increase in exports and improvement in nonresidential fixed investment also helped drive economic growth The solid first quarter GDP report followed 2018 s GDP numbers that matched the growth rate attained in 2015   the highest since the 2007 2009 Great Recession New Orders  Business Activity RiseThe index for new orders jumped to 58 6 in May  an increase of 0 5 percentage points from the April reading of 58 1  New orders  thus  increased for the 118th successive month  The pick up in new orders suggests that the service sector is poised to gain in the coming months Business expectations issued in May continue to be encouraging  The business activity index came in at 61 2  showing an increase of 1 7 percentage points from the April reading of 59 5  This highlights an uptick in business activity for the 118th consecutive month as well Employment Subindex ImprovesLike expansion in new orders and business activities  companies increased hiring in May  The non manufacturing employment index came in at 58 1  above the April reading of 53 7 Market pundits were impressed by the employment report  citing that 12 out of 18 non manufacturing industries showed increased employment in May  Moreover  most of the economists expect a healthy rise in service sector job growth after the Labor Department releases its May employment report Top 5 GainersGiven the

6946,228461,BBSI,Trade Tensions Simmer  5 Service Stocks To Buy Now ,opinion,The Chinese government recently threatened to retaliate if President Trump follows through his plans to impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports  Meanwhile  Trump claims China  broke the deal   This led investors to believe that trade talks between the countries are on the brink of collapse China s trade issues have now rattled markets  But  what do you buy in a trade war  Simply  invest in service firms as they are less exposed to any trade policy and their strong fundamentals insulate them from any tariff induced volatility How Did Wall Street Fare U S  stocks went on a roller coaster ride on May 8  The Dow did manage to end in the green  but just barely  The blue chip index went up 0 01   The Dow  by the way  had already suffered its largest percentage decline on May 7 since Jan 3 After spending much of the day in the positive territory  the broader S P 500 regrettably declined 0 2   while the tech laden Nasdaq dropped 0 3   Both the bourses had seen their biggest daily drop on May 7 since Mar 22 The Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   referred to as Wall Street s fear gauge  has mostly been calm since the start of this year  But now  it is moving up and is on track for its biggest monthly gain  This index of expected volatility for the S P 500 over the coming 30 day period had already touched an intraday high on May 7  The VIX is now up 61   since a 75  jump last October Trade Uncertainty Keeps Wall Street on ToesUncertainty over the Sino American trade talks led to a rocky trading session  Stocks did turn green after White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that Beijing is willing to make a trade deal with the United States  But  stocks slipped on reports that China is considering counter measures for Trump s latest tariffs Even though China s top trade negotiator  Vice Premier Liu He  is expected to participate in talks this week with Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that  the escalation of trade friction is not in the interests of the people of the two countries and the people of the world   After all  a trade war will hamper economic growth and eventually squeeze corporate profits Lest we forget  Trump recently escalated the trade war by announcing that the tariffs imposed on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods will be increased from 10  to 25   In fact  he has threatened to levy tariffs on all Chinese goods with America  And this means imposing tariffs on the remaining  325 billion Chinese goods  His moves will invariably affect more than 5 000 China made products  including fresh and frozen foods  chemicals  textiles  metalwork  building materials  electronics and consumer goods Trump upended months of encouraging reports that the United States and China are making substantial progress in trade related issues  While protection of intellectual property rights continues to be a bone of contention for the economies  Trump is desperate to bridge the difference between imports and exports in order to boost the manufacturing sector How to Play This Trade Ambiguity Service firms are safe bets for those who are wondering where to invest  This is because such firms are unperturbed by trade retaliations as they have less foreign sales exposure compared to goods companies  Service stocks also have less foreign input cost that might be subject to tariffs  Such input costs mostly include direct materials  labor and factory overheads Some may argue that growth in the service sector  the main component of the U S  economy  slowed for the second straight month in April  And rightly so  The ISM nonmanufacturing index came in at 55 5 in April  compared to 56 1 in March  But let s admit that the current level is still above 50  indicating expansion and not shrinkage  At the same time  job gains in the service sector continued to improve in April  whereas job gains in the manufacturing sector were low for the third straight month 5 Solid ChoicesWe have  thus  selected five solid service stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   The search was also narrowed down with a  of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these

6948,228463,BBSI,5 Business Services Picks To Defy Dismal Jobs Data ,opinion,Job additions in the United States slowed significantly in May  raising fresh questions about the state of the economy  Wage increases also came in below expectations  leading economists to predict that a rate cut is in the offing  The broad based decline in hiring occurred before a step up in U S  China trade tensions  which is likely to act as a drag on the economy However  things aren t as dismal as they seem at first glance  Firstly  unemployment remains at a 50 year low  A broader measure of joblessness declined to a near 20 year low  Further  layoffs remain low and the current pace of job gains is high enough to absorb the growth in the working age population Professional and business services remain at the forefront of job gains  Adding stocks from this sector looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult Unemployment Remains at 50 Year LowThe U S  economy added only 75 000 jobs in May  significantly lower than the consensus estimate of 180 000  This is the second time in four months that job additions have come in under the 100 000

26 000 jobs  respectively  However  the largest contributor to job additions was professional and business services with 33 000 new jobs  The sector has added 498 000 jobs in the last 12 months These have been the three fastest growing sectors for the economy during the current nearly decade long economic expansion  This comes as no surprise as services have remained a bright spot even as trade related conflicts weigh on the broader economy After two straight months of decline  the ISM services index staged a strong rebound in May  The gauge hit 56 9  last month  exceeding both the consensus estimate of 55  and April s reading of 55 5   It was also the second highest reading for the year with 16 service oriented industries registering an expansion Our ChoicesMay s dismal job figures have come as a bolt from the blue  leading to fresh concerns about the U S  economy  However  the unemployment rate remains at a 50 year low and other gauges of jobless have registered a decline  This could likely be a temporary blip before the jobs market resumes its robust trajectory Professional and business services remain at the forefront of job gains  Adding stocks from this sector looks like

6951,228466,BBSI,Should Value Investors Pick Barrett Business Services  BBSI  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Barrett Business Services  Inc    NASDAQ BBSI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Barrett Business Services has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 85  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 11  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Barrett Business Services  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 41  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Barrett Business Services has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 41  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Barrett Business Services has a P S ratio of about 0 64  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 28 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  BBSI is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Barrett Business Services currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Barrett Business Services a solid choice for value investors   What About the Stock Overall   Though Barrett Business Services might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives BBSI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the current year estimate has seen one upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period  This has had a notable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 17 2  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has increased by 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Barrett Business Services  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite the mixed analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom Line  Barrett Business Services is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A solid Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Outsourcing industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  However  a bullish industry rank  among bottom 31  of more than 250 industries  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a

6961,228476,BBSI,5 Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows To Scoop Up Big Gains,opinion,Crunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises may be a preferred method for scooping up big gains in the impending Q1 earnings season  But looking beyond profits and assessing a company s cash position can be far more rewarding because that indicates its true financial health This is because even though profit is a company s goal  cash is the lifeblood for its existence  development and success  and indeed a measure of its resilience  In fact  even a profitable business can fail if its cash flow is uneven and eventually file for bankruptcy  But a company with a healthy cash position has the capability to effectively tide over any market mayhem and still be on the growth curve  besides enjoying flexibility to make decisions  chase potential investments and run its growth engine To find this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5 year average cash flow per common share  This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time In addition to this we chose Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company s future performance Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This sieves out low priced stocks  of B or better  This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks  Importantly  this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their individual industry

The Process 
Every morning I go through a few of my scans to find buy candidates for the day   Depending on the current state of the market the size of the list will vary  usually its no more than 50 names   My process is based on market structure not on beliefs or myths of what works  or what doesn t work   They are certain behavioral patterns that have been around for 100 years that are based on market structure  these behavioral patterns are recognizable  observable  and quantifiable   On daily basis we have 3 000 stocks that we filter based on certain market structures that gives us an edge of a higher probability than a random outcome   Once the list is narrowed to a handful of names the market will further narrow down the list by getting us in or keeping us out of these names with a range expansion move 
 I don t look at charts in your conventional cookie cutter manner  or have rules as to where the stock should be whether its 15  off its 52 week highs or above or below certain moving averages etc 
These are what I consider  tight set ups  that will trigger a buy signal for me if  and only when they break the previous day s high   On a regular trading day I would indiscriminately take every trigger because you just don t know which one will be the big winner  you might have an idea but in the end you don t know 
How much you put at risk per trade depends for the most part what your current outlook is for the market over the next 0 5 days 
Put these names on your trading platform  set the alerts at yesterday s high for each name  once the alert goes off take a look at the chart  decided within 3 seconds whether or not you are going to buy it  decide how much you want to risk on the trade and your stop loss  hit the buy button  and leave the rest up to the market  wash  rinse  repeat 
A few things that you should know about this swing strategy 
 Its main goal is to get you in when stocks are moving and keep you out in choppy sloppy markets  it is imperative that you allowed the market to get you in only when the stocks go through their previous day s high 
Your awareness of how the market is behaving is crucial  this will give you an idea of how hard to push the envelope   My best indicator for this is my rolling 5 day watch list 
Swing trading is a numbers game  you are going to be wrong half the time  risk management is above all  and many times you will have nothing to do like yesterday because the market did not get you in  We are not looking for any action  we are looking for the right action 
Don t be penny wise  don t try to anticipate a move just because the chart looks good   You can have a great looking tight set up with a stock coiling for 10 days but who is to say that it won t coil for another 5 days   If you anticipate the range expansion you might buy something that is not ready to go and it will only frustrate you and lower your odds of a winning trade 
For me this list is a one way list   long bias   I do not look at this list as a long or short list  long and short are two different games with different dynamics 
You need to be extremely organized   Most if not all your work will be done pre market and you will spend the day just executing or you can just automated it with buy orders after 9 45am

6971,228486,BBSI,4 Stocks To Watch  AMRN  AUDC  TDOC  TEX,opinion,"Amarin Corporation plc  NASDAQ AMRN  is beautiful  In this market rally it immediately responded  On Tuesday  it took out resistance and closed at a new high at 21 92  popping 1 64  or 8 29   to 21 43  on 14 million shares  Targets are 25  and maybe 27 1 2 
AudioCodes Ltd   NASDAQ AUDC  had a fantastic day on Tuesday  It blew out earnings report  exploding on 1 2 million shares  the best volume I ve ever seen on this stock  It jumped 2 32 or 24   to 12 01  reaching a high of 12 17  There were days when it hit 5 000 earlier in the year  but never a million  It could be an explosive breakaway day  I m looking for a move to 14 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Teladoc  Inc   NYSE TDOC   unfortunately  looks like it s completely reversed that beautiful trend  On reversal day it was at 89  but has dropped all the way down to 62  bouncing weekly in my opinion  to 72  On Tuesday it was down another 1 96  or 2 8   to 67 18  on 2 2 million shares  It might roll over  If it uses that volume to get through resistance  look for a rollover that gets it down to 55 and 53 
Terex Corporation  NYSE TEX  also got whacked on Tuesday  dropping 1 12  or 3 4   to 31 74  on 2 1 million shares  Some of these stocks are extremely oversold looking for a bounce  I do think some of them need to be closely monitored for a potential snapback consolidation  this one in particular  before it rolls over anymore  Eventually  I m looking for 29 and 25

7037,228552,BBSI,5 Increasing Cash Flow Backed Stocks You Can Buy Now,opinion,Putting one s hard earned money in stocks with high profits and impressive earnings surprise records is a popular trend during the final leg of a reporting cycle  However  looking beyond profits and figuring out a company s ability to generate cash flows seem to be more prudent This is because cash indicates a company s true financial health  It offers the flexibility to make decisions  the means to make potential investments and the fuel to run its growth engine  In fact  even a profit generating company might face bankruptcy while meeting obligations  if it is low on cash flow  However  a sturdy cash balance can cushion these firms in case of market turbulence To find this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money a company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the following screen to bet on stocks with rising cash flows Screening Parameters To find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5 year average cash flow
