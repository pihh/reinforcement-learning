24149,245664,BOOM,Is DMC Global  BOOM  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DMC Global Inc    NASDAQ BOOM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DMC Global has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 62  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 35  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DMC Global s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 46 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that DMC Global has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 74  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for DMC Global s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  DMC Global has a P S ratio of about 1 74  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 23 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DMC Global currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DMC Global a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for DMC Global is just 0 59  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 46  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  BOOM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DMC Global might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of B  This gives BOOM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter estimate witnessed no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to two downward revisions  whereas the current year estimate also witnessed no upward revision compared to two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate declined 13  in the past two months  whereas the current year estimate fell 0 54   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DMC Global Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDMC Global is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 4  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may

24188,245703,BOOM,Caterpillar Or Deere  Which Industrial Stock Is A Better Pick ,opinion,Per the Institute for Supply Management s latest report  Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for April was at 52 8   Although it has declined from the March reading of 55 3   the manufacturing sector has been witnessing growth for 32 consecutive months  led by continued expansion in new orders  production activity and employment  The PMI has averaged 57 2  over the last 12 months  Notably  a reading above 50  indicates expansion in manufacturing sector  This instils optimism in the sector However  the implementation of tariffs on steel imports into the United States last year dealt a severe blow to the manufacturing stocks  Given that steel is a primary raw material  every company involved in manufacturing bore the brunt of rising steel prices owing to tariffs  Though this can be mitigated to some extent with price increases  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers  The Trump administration announced that it will impose a 5  tariff on all imported goods from Mexico beginning June 10  Trump plans to gradually increase that tax to 25  until the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border stops  This new concern regarding a U S  trade dispute with Mexico along with the ongoing U S  trade war with China have traders and investors on tenterhooks Further  the industry has been plagued with shortage of skilled laborers  higher wage costs and flaring up transportation expenses for quite some time now  Given these concerns  the  sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  has declined 9  compared with the S P 500 dropped 0 9  over a year s time  Despite this underperformance  earnings for the Industrial Products Sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  rose 1 2  in the first quarter of 2019  Per the latest  report  the sector is expected to register a decline of 1 3  in earnings in the second quarter of 2019  However  the decline is not limited to this sector alone  In the June end quarter  nine of the 16 Zacks Sectors are expected to witness drop in earnings  In fact  the Industrial Sector s decline is anticipated to be the least among all  The scenario is likely to improve in the back half of the year  with projected growth of 3 4  in earnings for the third quarter  followed by rise of 10 3  in the fourth quarter The sector has an estimated long term earnings growth of 10 4   higher than the S P 500 s 9 5   This instils optimism in the sector  Continued improvement in residential and non residential construction  and revival in infrastructure demand bode well for the industry  Mining companies are also resuming capital spending on the back of rising commodity prices  Notably  oil and gas extraction is driving improvement in the mining sector  Further  the recently passed tax reform is likely to act as a catalyst by expediting manufacturing investment in factories  new equipment and other capital goods  Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT   and Deere   Company   NYSE DE   are two heavyweights hogging the limelight in the sector with market capitalization of  69 7 billion and  45 1 billion  respectively  While Caterpillar is the world s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment and also dabbles in agricultural equipment  Deere is the one of the world s foremost producers of agricultural equipment as well as a leading manufacturer of construction  forestry  and commercial and consumer equipment  Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  currently and a VGM Score of B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B  combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   offer the best investment opportunities for investors   You can see  Investors keen on this sector is likely to be inquisitive about which one has the more attractive prospects  Let s analyze both these stocks on some key metrics and see which deserves to be part of your portfolio  Price Performance Caterpillar s stock has declined 19 4  in the past year while Deere s shares have dropped 8 3   The Industrial Products sector has gone down 9  over the past year while the S P 500 dipped 0 9   Deere has fared better in this regard  Valuation The EV EBITDA metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry or sector and has an edge over other metrics such as P E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies  Compared with sector s EV EBITDA ratio of 13 1  Caterpillar and Deere are both cheaper propositions with respective reading of 8 0 and 11 2  Caterpillar is cheaper in terms of valuation  Long Term Growth Expectations In terms of long term earnings growth expectations  Caterpillar scores above Deere with a projection of 12 0  compared with the latter s 7 9   Dividend Yield For income investors  Caterpillar has a higher dividend yield  2 80   than Deere  2 19    Both have better dividend yields compared with the overall sector s 1 99   Caterpillar wins this round  Inventory Turnover Ratio Inventory turnover ratio evaluates the efficiency of an industrial company s manufacturing process  A high inventory turnover ratio ensures that the company is able to manage inventory effectively to generate revenues and avoid wastage  This is one of the most important financial ratios  which is widely used by industrial companies to measure its ability to utilize inventories  In the last year  the inventory turnover ratio for Deere and Caterpillar has been 3 97  and 3 19   respectively  lower than the sector s level of 4 42   However  Deere has registered better inventory turnover than Caterpillar  Return on Assets Return on assets  ROA  is one of the key financial ratios for industrials as they rely heavily on inventory to create revenues  An above average ROA denotes that the company in question is generating earnings by effectively managing assets  Coming to Caterpillar and Deere  ROA for the trailing 12 months  TTM  is 8 7  and 4 6   respectively  The Industrial Products sector s ROA stands at 6 5  Caterpillar leads on this front compared with Deere Earnings Surprise HistoryCaterpillar has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters  while Deere missed in all of them  Caterpillar has an average positive earnings surprise of 0 45  while Deere has a negative earnings surprise of 0 45   Estimate RevisionsOver the past 60 days  for Caterpillar  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has moved up 0 4  to  12 25 while the estimate for fiscal 2019 for Deere has gone down 8 5  to  10 27 Earnings ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar for the fiscal 2019 is currently pegged at  12 25  indicating an improvement of 9  from the year ago quarter  The earnings estimate for Deere for the current fiscal is pegged at  10 27  suggesting growth of 9  from the year ago reported figure  Conclusion Improvement in construction sector and cost cutting efforts will drive margins for both the companies  Though Deere s results will continue to bear the brunt of continued weakness in agriculture sector owing to lower farm income  the recently announced  16 billion aid program for American farmers impacted by the trade war will provide some respite  Replacement demand also continues to sustain Deere s order activity driven by the pressing need to replace older fleet  Both the companies will be hit hard by the escalating tariff war  Our comparative analysis shows that Caterpillar holds an edge over Deere when considering share valuation  ROA  dividend yield  earnings surprise history  estimate revisions and long term growth expectations  Deere only scores on inventory turnover and price performance  On comparison  Caterpillar is clearly a better stock as of now  Some Other Stocks Apart from Caterpillar  investors interested in the industrial products sector may also consider

24272,245787,BOOM,Want To Invest Safely  Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks,opinion,Leverage is a well known business strategy of using borrowed funds to finance the purchase of inventory  equipment as well as other company assets  These funds can be also utilized to pay back the company s prior debt  Companies can obtain such funds either using debt or equity Statistically  companies prefer debt over equity  This is because debt is available easily and is cheaper than equity financing  Moreover  in case of debt financing  notwithstanding whether the interest charges are from a loan or line of credit  the interest payments are tax deductible  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  In particular  one should keep in mind that debt financing remains a feasible option as long as the companies succeed in generating a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate  Exorbitant debt financing might even lead to a corporation s bankruptcy in a worst case scenario Especially  in times of crisis  no one can be fully sure of how a company will perform the next day  On top of that  the ones bearing large amount of debt are more prone to bankruptcy  Therefore  the debt level of a company is an important point of consideration while making an investment decision Considering the fact that uncertainty can hit the share market anytime  it is better to take measures beforehand than repent later  This is why investors needs to look for stocks that are relatively less leveraged  since a corporation with zero debt hardly exists Therefore  to safeguard one s portfolio from notable losses  the real challenge for an investor is determining whether an organization s debt level is sustainable  A debt free corporation is rare to find  Historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company With Q1 earnings over for most companies  investors must be eyeing the ones that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the past couple of quarters  However  blindly pursuing high earnings yielding stocks  which have a high debt to equity ratio  might drain all your money before you know The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 19 stocks that made it through the screen Mobile Mini  Inc    NASDAQ MINI    It is the world s leading provider of portable storage solutions through

Other major bourses  including the Dow Jones Industrial Average  Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks  surged more than 11   The indexes recouped the losses incurred in the final months of 2018  when fears of a global recession sent markets across the globe sliding What Led the Gains The first quarter gains were predominantly led by a sharp rebound from the Christmas Eve lows  Fed s patient stance with interest rates hikes as global growth slows and increasing optimism in U S  China trade negotiations The Fed s latest comment that the rate increases are on a pause is

24478,245993,BOOM,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Avoid The Perils Of Debt,opinion,Leverage is an investment strategy adopted by corporations wherein borrowed capital is used to expand operations and amplify possible returns from risk capital  Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance capital projects Empirically  most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates  This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when the amount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect the company s bottom line Therefore  to safeguard one s portfolio from notable losses  the real challenge for an investor is determining whether the organization s debt level is sustainable  A debt free corporation is rare to find  Historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company With Q1 earnings around the corner  investors must be eyeing companies that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the past couple of quarters  However  blindly pursuing high earnings yielding stocks  which have a high debt to equity ratio  might drain all your money before you know The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectationZacks Rank  1 or 2  Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen WellCare Health Plans  Inc    NYSE WCG    It offers government sponsored managed care services through Medicaid  Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans  The company

Leverage is an investment strategy adopted by corporations wherein borrowed capital is used to expand operations and amplify possible returns from risk capital  Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance capital projects 
Empirically  most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates  This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well 
Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when the amount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect the company s bottom line 
Therefore  to safeguard one s portfolio from notable losses  the real challenge for an investor is determining whether the organization s debt level is sustainable  A debt free corporation is rare to find  Historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios 
Analyzing Debt Equity
Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  Equity
This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company 
With Q1 earnings around the corner  investors must be eyeing companies that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the past couple of quarters  However  blindly pursuing high earnings yielding stocks  which have a high debt to equity ratio  might drain all your money before you know 
The Winning Strategy
Considering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns 
However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors

24489,246004,BOOM,6 Solid Relative Price Strength Stocks To Make You Rich,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains Screening ParametersRelative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0Relative

24645,246160,BOOM,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks For Safe Investing,opinion,Leverage is something that constitutes an integral part of running a business  But failing to understand its complexities can prove to be detrimental  With capital being one of the basic factors of production  companies need exogenous funds to finance their corporate expenses  run operations smoothly as well as expand the realm of their business Among equity and debt   the two most common options used to boost a company s future earnings   debt is more popular  This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing However  resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments In this context  it is imperative to note that the debt scenario in the United States is quite disturbing at this moment  Huge spending on wars  big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation s burden over the years  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150  of the economy s GDP in 2047 from 77  currently Nevertheless  this should not shift investor attention from U S  stocks since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country boasts the largest stock market in the world  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  avoiding those with high debt loads This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play as it measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears  To choose a corporation that is not so heavily indebted  several leverage ratios have been developed over the years  with the debt to equity ratio being the most popular Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company Now investors must be eyeing companies that have exhibited solid earnings growth in recent times  But  in the uncertain world of investment  markets can falter  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth and not considering their debt level is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt

24755,246270,BOOM,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Harsco  HD Supply  Aggreko And DMC Global,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 13  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Harsco Corporation   NYSE HSC    HD Supply Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ HDS    Aggreko  LON AGGK  PLC  and DMC Global Inc    NASDAQ BOOM   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Industrial Services Industry on a Roll  4 Stocks to Bet OnThe Zacks  industry is riding on an improving overall economy  Increased investments in e commerce and digital capabilities  and growth in end markets will further boost the industry Rising Demand a BoonIndustrial Services primarily includes providers of industrial equipment products and MRO  maintenance  repair and operations  services  These items  repair components  cutting fluids  lubricants  safety supplies and other consumables  are utilized in production and plant maintenance but are not directly related to customer s core products or services Customers of this industry primarily belong to commercial  government  healthcare and manufacturing space  Given that MRO inventory accounts for as much as 40  of their annual budget  improved outlook and increased customer spending bode well for Industrial Services  Further  the evolution of e commerce has significantly impacted MRO demand with every passing year  In the United States  business investment and exports are two major indicators of MRO spending  Business investment is likely to grow supported by favorable financial conditions  expanding global markets  lower capital costs and an improving regulatory climate Improvement in end markets like recovery in manufacturing activity  residential and non residential construction  ongoing revival in the oil and gas industry and economic growth will continue to drive the industry  The recent tax reform is likely to lead to higher capital spending and attract incremental foreign capital to the United States  in turn  bolstering exports Inflation Remains a HeadwindInflation has hit Industrial Services hard  particularly metal based products  In fact  the recent heightened trade tariffs resulted in the industry dealing with higher costs of raw material and threat of undercutting business spending  Also  distributors continue to pass along higher prices to customers  However  it may not always be possible or adequate to cover rising product inflation in an intensely competitive environment  consequently limiting margins  With United States and China coming to a truce over the trade war  this will provide a relief to the industry Industry Outperforms S P 500  Valuation InexpensiveThe Industrial Services industry  which is a 17 stock group within the Zacks  Sector  has outperformed its own sector and the S P 500 over the past year  Notably  the industry has gained 10 2   while the S P 500 dipped 0 9   Meanwhile  the Industrial Products sector declined 16 8  The industry s valuation looks really cheap now  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its enterprise value to earnings before interest depreciation and amortization  EV EBITDA  The industry currently has a forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 10 2  which looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large  The trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio for the S P 500 is 11 0  A comparison of the industry s EV EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the industry is trading at a decent discount  The Industrial Products sector s forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 12 3 is above the Industrial Services industry s 10 2 How to Play the Industry We suggest a few Industrial Services stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and are witnessing upward estimate revisions  You can see  Earnings estimate revisions is the most crucial factor impacting stock prices  Stocks with rising earnings estimates have a tendency to perform better than other stocks in the group  even if the industry fundamentals remain sluggish  We have zeroed in on four such stocks below Harsco Corporation The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings per share has moved 2  up over the past 90 days  In a year s time  this Zacks Rank  1 stock has gained 26   Furthermore  this Camp Hill  PA based company delivered average four quarter

company has a Zacks Rank  2 and average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 6 91  Aggreko PLC  This Glasgow  U K based company carries a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal

24757,246272,BOOM,7 Stocks With Recent Price Strength To Enhance Your Returns,opinion,Investors are always on the lookout for a winning strategy  which is easier said than done  When markets are rattled by widespread global growth concerns  it is difficult for even the most perceptive investors to come up with a foolproof plan No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be safer to look for stocks that are winners at present and have the potential to gain further Here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing price increase  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously scaling higher  there must be solid reason backing the rise or else it probably would have yielded like the losers  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational However  recent price strength alone cannot weave the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Here are seven of the 13 stocks that made it through this screen Weight Watchers International  Inc

Stocks in this week s article include  Weight Watchers International  Inc    NYSE WTW    Johnson Outdoors Inc    NASDAQ JOUT    Enova International  Inc    NYSE ENVA    DMC Global Inc    NASDAQ BOOM   and MSA Safety Inc    NYSE MSA   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Stocks with Recent Price Strength to Enhance Your PortfolioInvestors are always on the lookout for a winning strategy  which is easier said than done  When markets are rattled by widespread global growth concerns  it is difficult for even the most perceptive investors to come up with a foolproof plan No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be safer to look for stocks that are winners at present and have the potential to gain further Here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing price increase  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously scaling higher  there must be solid reason backing the rise or else it probably would have yielded like the losers  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational However  recent price strength alone cannot weave the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners And that s what we re screening

24762,246277,BOOM,Industrial Services Industry On A Roll  4 Stocks To Bet On,opinion,The Zacks  industry is riding on an improving overall economy  Increased investments in e commerce and digital capabilities  and growth in end markets will further boost the industry  Rising Demand a Boon Industrial Services primarily includes providers of industrial equipment products and MRO  maintenance  repair and operations  services  These items  repair components  cutting fluids  lubricants  safety supplies and other consumables  are utilized in production and plant maintenance but are not directly related to customer s core products or services  Customers of this industry primarily belong to commercial  government  healthcare and manufacturing space  Given that MRO inventory accounts for as much as 40  of their annual budget  improved outlook and increased customer spending bode well for Industrial Services  Further  the evolution of e commerce has significantly impacted MRO demand with every passing year  In the United States  business investment and exports are two major indicators of MRO spending  Business investment is likely to grow supported by favorable financial conditions  expanding global markets  lower capital costs and an improving regulatory climate  Improvement in end markets like recovery in manufacturing activity  residential and non residential construction  ongoing revival in the oil and gas industry and economic growth will continue to drive the industry  The recent tax reform is likely to lead to higher capital spending and attract incremental foreign capital to the United States  in turn  bolstering exports  Inflation Remains a Headwind Inflation has hit Industrial Services hard  particularly metal based products  In fact  the recent heightened trade tariffs resulted in the industry dealing with higher costs of raw material and threat of undercutting business spending  Also  distributors continue to pass along higher prices to customers  However  it may not always be possible or adequate to cover rising product inflation in an intensely competitive environment  consequently limiting margins  With United States and China coming to a truce over the trade war  this will provide a relief to the industry  Industry Outperforms S P 500  Valuation Inexpensive The Industrial Services industry  which is a 17 stock group within the Zacks  Sector  has outperformed its own sector and the S P 500 over the past year  Notably  the industry has gained 10 2   while the S P 500 dipped 0 9   Meanwhile  the Industrial Products sector declined 16 8    The industry s valuation looks really cheap now  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its enterprise value to earnings before interest depreciation and amortization  EV EBITDA   The industry currently has a forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 10 2  which looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large  The trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio for the S P 500 is 11 0  A comparison of the industry s EV EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the industry is trading at a decent discount  The Industrial Products sector s forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 12 3 is above the Industrial Services industry s 10 2  How to Play the Industry  We suggest a few Industrial Services stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and are witnessing upward estimate revisions  You can see   Earnings estimate revisions is the most crucial factor impacting stock prices  Stocks with rising earnings estimates have a tendency to perform better than other stocks in the group  even if the industry fundamentals remain sluggish  We have zeroed in on four such stocks below  Harsco Corporation   NYSE HSC    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings per share has moved 2  up over the past 90 days  In a year s time  this Zacks Rank  1 stock has gained 26   Furthermore  this Camp

24793,246308,BOOM,Buy 5 Low Beta Stocks To Tide Over Market Volatility,opinion,To invest successfully  one needs to do extensive and in depth research  A smart investor will never follow the herd by believing that only risky stocks can yield impressive returns  Risky stocks do prove lucrative but that s when the market is bullish We have created a strategy which clearly shows that a portfolio of less risky stocks can also generate impressive returns when a few parameters are taken into account  Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months Here are five of the 19 stocks that fit the bill Based in Nelsonville  OH  Rocky Brands  Inc     NASDAQ RCKY   is primarily involved in designing apparel and footwear  The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 264 6   We expect the stock to see year over year earnings growth of 29 3  in 2018 Urban Outfitters  Inc    NASDAQ URBN    based in Philadelphia  PA  is a wholesaler and retailer of a variety of consumer goods  The company

NYSE USM   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Buy 5 Low Beta Stocks for Immunity to Market VolatilitySmart and successful investors never follow crowd  instead  they focus on extensive research for creating a proper investment strategy  Following the crowd blindly and investing in risky stocks will fetch handsome returns only when the market is bullish In this article we have presented a strategy which clearly shows that less risky securities could also reward investors with impressive returns Beta UnderstandingBeta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market  we are considering S P 500 here  If a company has a beta of 1  it means that the relative volatility of the stock is the same as that of the S P 500  In the same way  if the stock s beta is greater than 1 then it is more volatile compared to the market  Conversely  a beta below 1 signifies less volatility Now  if a portfolio s beta is 3  it is three times more volatile than the market  Hence  if the market is projected to give 20  return  the portfolio will then definitely contribute 60  return which is amazing However  the opposite case also holds true  If the market slips 20  then the portfolio return plummets 60  which is surely a matter of concern And that s what we

Legacy Reserves LP  NASDAQ LGCY  has a beautiful chart  This swing trade continues to give after breaking out of a flag  and then it broke out again  popping 71 cents  or 11   to 7 20  on 1 25 million shares on Wednesday  Targets are 8 00  and then 10 11 going forward 
Pandora Media  Inc   NYSE P  popped 33 cents  or 4 6   to 7 50  on 13 million shares on Wednesday  After the breakaway gap  I put a swing on it because of the break in the declining topsline and the base  With the breakaway gap  I would love to see a consolidation for a bit  and have it run to 8 1 2  and then near 10  Those are my targets 
Semtech Corporation  NASDAQ SMTC  had a swing put on it today as it broke out 1 30  or 3   to 43 50  on 361 400 shares traded on Wednesday  across key resistance  Now it needs to take out the recent highs at 44 85  If it does that  and it may do it as early as Thursday  I m looking at high 40 s  and then low to mid 50 s

such a strategy is easier said than done  When markets are shaken by widespread global growth concerns  it is difficult for even an insightful investor to come up with a foolproof approach No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be safer to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing price increase  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners And that s what we re screening for

24867,246382,BOOM,Buy 4 Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows Ahead Of Q1 Earnings,opinion,Investors would find it easier to crunch profit numbers and evaluate surprises in the impending Q1 earnings season  However  an assessment of the company s cash position which reveals its true financial health can be far more rewarding Even a profit making company can have a dearth of cash flow and fail to meet its obligations  But a company s resiliency can be fairly judged when its efficacy in generating cash flows is assessed This is because  cash gives a company vitality and strength  It offers flexibility to make decisions  the means to make potential investments and the fuel to run the growth engine  It is the key for its existence  development and success and can indeed be referred to as the lifeblood of a company To find this efficiency  one needs to consider its net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing

whopping 120  year over year   This can be attributed to continued strength in many of its end markets as well as incessant focus on cost control  Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 11 by a margin of 34   The quarterly performance marked the company s fifth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth after a string of dismal performances for four years  Following the upbeat results  Caterpillar s shares advanced 3 77  in pre market trading  Including one time items  Caterpillar reported earnings per share of  2 74 in the quarter compared with 32 cents per share in the prior year quarter Caterpillar Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Improved End Markets Drive RevenuesRevenues improved 32  year over year to  12 9 billion in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 6 billion  The company witnessed higher sales volume owing to improved end user demand and favorable changes in dealer inventories  End user demand improved across all regions and most end markets  Sales increased across all regions with Asia Pacific and North America leading the pack  Higher Sales Lead to Imporved Profits In the reported quarter  cost of sales increased 26  year over year to  8 6 billion  Gross profit advanced 42  to  4 3 billion  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 20  to  1 3 billion due to higher short term incentive compensation expense and targeted investments  Research and development  R D  expenses rose 4  year over year to  443 million  Adjusted profit before taxes were pegged at  2 6 billion  a substantial improvement from  1 5 billion in the prior year quarter  Higher sales volume and favorable price realization were somewhat offset by higher selling  general and administrative  SG A  and research and development  R D  expenses  Manufacturing costs were flat as lower warranty expense and the favorable impact from cost absorption were negated by higher material costs  freight costs and short term incentive compensation expense  All Segments Deliver Growth Machinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales surged 33  year over year to  12 2 billion  Sales of Energy   Transportation gained 26   owing to higher sales across all applications  Sales at Resource Industries improved 31  driven by higher end user demand for equipment in all regions  Construction

of  2 billion  substantial improvement from  0 2 billion in the year ago quarter  At the Energy   Transportation segment  operating profit improved 60  to  874 million higher sales volume and favorable price realization  partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense and targeted investments  The Resource Industries reported operating profit of  378 million in the quarter  a 136  surge from  160 million in the prior year quarter thanks to higher sales volume and favorable price realization which was partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense and a slightly unfavorable impact from currency  Construction Industries  profit soared 76  to  1 1 billion due to favorable price realization  higher sales volume  However  higher SG A R D expenses  material costs  primarily for steel  and freight costs somewhat negated these gains  Financial Products  revenues went up 4  to  733 million  Financial Products  profit was  139 million in the quarter  down from  186 million in the prior year quarter  The increase can be attributed to higher average earning assets in Asia Pacific and higher average financing rates in North America  partially offset by an unfavorable impact from lower intercompany lending activity in North America  Financial Products  segment profit was  141 million in the first quarter of 2018  compared with  183 million in the prior year quarter due to an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial  partially offset by an increase in net yield on average earning assets  Financial Position Caterpillar ended the first quarter 2018 with cash and short term investments of  7 9 billion  down from  8 3 billion at 2017 end  ME T operating cash flow for the quarter was  948 million  lower than  1 5 billion in the prior year quarter mainly due to higher short term incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of 2018  compared with the first quarter of 2017  Caterpillar repurchased  500 million of shares in the reported quarter  The debt to capital ratio at ME T was 34 4  as of first quarter 2018 end  lower than 36 6  as of 2017 end  Robust Backlog At the end of first quarter 2018  Caterpillar s backlog was at  17 5 billion  up from  15 8 billion at 2017 end  The increase was mainly driven by higher backlog at Construction Industries and Energy   Transportation  while backlog at Resource Industries remained flat from 2017 end  Hikes Guidance for 2018 Backed by strong first quarter 2018 performance  improving demand across all regions and end markets and continued global economic growth  Caterpillar now expects adjusted earnings per share between  10 25 and  11 25 for fiscal 2018  The company had earlier provided adjusted earnings per share guidance of  8 25  9 25 for the fiscal  All the segments as well as regions are expected to log growth in the year and contribute to improved volumes  However  improved price realization is anticipated to be partially offset by material cost increases due to higher commodity prices   Over the past year  the Caterpillar stock has outperformed the  it belongs to  The company has delivered a return of 59   while the

24975,246490,BOOM,5 Low Leverage Stocks You Will Love On Valentine s Day ,opinion, When you combine ignorance and leverage  you get some pretty interesting results     Warren BuffettIndeed  in the complex world of investment  understanding the amount of financial leverage a company bears is crucial  Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance its capital projects  Now a comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates Moreover  when a company opts for equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well  Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible However  given the uncertainty surrounding the economy in recent times  no one can be fully sure of how a company will perform the next day  Companies bearing large amount of debts are more prone to financial crisis  especially at times of high interest rates With the Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates for the United States thrice in 2018  the market scenario does not seem to be much in favor of companies opting for debt financing  That said  for the investor  the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he she is investing has a sustainable debt level  since a debt free corporation is rare to find  This is where the concept of  leverage  comes in  Leverage simply indicates the level of debt a corporation carries at present  Historically  several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company s credit level to support prudent equity investments  The most popular among them is debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a better investment pick Although companies reflecting high earnings growth should be the ideal investment choices  those with high leverage might not generate satisfactory returns  So companies with low leverage instead of high earnings will be your perfect choice on Valentine s Day The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure safe returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success  Score of A

much leverage     Andrew Ross SorkinFinancial leverage is a popular investment strategy that refers to the amount of debt that a company uses to finance its operations  Although debt brings with it

24978,246493,BOOM,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Avoid Interest Rate Risk,opinion,In the world of business finance  leverage is a popular investment strategy  through which companies borrow funds to finance business expansion  purchase inventory and other assets as well as support other aspects of business operations  Since companies have limited funds  they need exogenous funding to boost their financial resources from time to time for expansion of operations  So  a company can rarely avoid borrowing funds Although one may resort to equity financing  in corporate finance  debt financing is a more viable option due to its cheap availability  Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible Yet  the word  debt  is unnerving for many  This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more  it also carries the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future  In fact  the related amount of interest expense may overwhelm the borrower if it does not earn sufficient returns to offset the interest expense  This is particularly a problem when interest rates rise or the returns from assets decline With the current macroeconomic scenario in the United States being in favor of interest rate hikes  the market seems to be not so suitable for borrowers Nevertheless  this does not mean that equity investments are too risky and investing in stocks might not lead to perceived returns  After all  in spite of such high debt levels  the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP   representing a quarter share of the global economy per the latest World Bank figures In fact  it has been an inherent instrument for corporations to increase their earnings  However  the problem is that companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt  especially in periods of high interest rate Considering this  the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently  avoiding those that carry high debt loads  So the crux of a safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks This is where the significance of financial

24998,246513,BOOM,Can U S  Manufacturing Survive A Trade War  5 Top Ranked Picks,opinion,In the latest episode of a developing trade conflict between the two largest economies in the world  China has announced fresh tariffs on 106 U S  products  The move is likely to exacerbate fears surrounding an impending trade war between the two countries  However  an actual date from which these duties would be levied was not announced Meanwhile  key White House officials downplayed trade war concerns  hinting that there was still room for negotiations on the issue  Also  despite a few jitters  recent data from the sector indicates that manufacturing is in fine fettle  This is why investing in selecting manufacturing stocks makes for a profitable option at this time Trump Administration Allays Trade War Fears  On Wednesday  key White House officials attempted to allay concerns about a possible trade war with China  Instead  they chose to characterize proposed tariffs as a  threat   designed to aid the U S  economy  In an interview with Fox Business Network  President Trump s economic advisor Larry Kudlow said tariffs were  just the first proposal  when it came to resolving a lingering trade dispute Kudlow added that back channel discussions and negotiations would also come into play  Meanwhile  Trump tweeted   We are not in a trade war with China  that war was lost many years ago by the foolish  or incompetent  people who represented the U S  At the same time  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to confirm whether proposed tariffs would indeed be imposed  Meanwhile  China s Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai said his country would prefer to resolve this trade dispute via discussions  However   it takes two to tango   he added Latest Data Reflects Sector ResilienceThe latest report on the U S  manufacturing sector depicts an extremely positive picture  New orders for goods manufactured in the United States increased by 1 2  in February  While factory orders came in under the estimated level of 1 5   it represents a strong rebound from January s decline of 1 3   Notably  orders for machinery increased by 1 2   Orders for mining  oil and gas field machinery increased by 1 8  Moreover  the ISM index for national factory activity was recorded at 59 3 in March compared with 60 8 in February  Notably  the February ISM manufacturing reading marked its highest level in 14 years Additionally  the IHS Markit U S  Manufacturing PMI came in at 55 6 in March compared with 55 3 in February  The average PMI reading for the first quarter of 2018 reflects the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2014   Read   Our ChoicesEven though China s latest salvo has increased chances of a trade war  the prospects for negotiations on the issue remain bright  Also  White House officials have refused to confirm if proposed tariffs would at all be imposed  China has also indicated its willingness to enter into talks on the issue Meanwhile  the latest economic data on the sector remains extremely encouraging  Adding manufacturing stocks to your portfolios looks like a prudent option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have

25049,246564,BOOM,Buy 5 Best Stocks With Accelerating Earnings ,opinion,Investors are always on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a significant jump  For that to happen  finding out stocks with consistent earnings growth is imperative  This is because earnings not only serve as the indicator of a company s profitability but also influence the share price  Generally  better than expected earnings growth leads to an upsurge in the share price But  there is another metric called earnings acceleration  which works even better in boosting the share price  Studies have shown that the majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before their positive price moves  So  what exactly is earnings acceleration Earnings Acceleration for Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incrementally growing earnings per share  EPS  of a company  Or  in other words  it is the increase in a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth within a stipulated frame of time But  why is it better than earnings growth  This is simply because in case of earnings you pay for something that has already been reflected in the stock price  However  in case of earnings acceleration you select stocks that haven t caught the attention of the investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to an uptick in the share price Increase in the percentage of earnings growth makes us believe that the company is in sound shape and has been on the right track for a consistent period of time  A sideways percentage of earnings growth  on the other hand  indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  If the earnings growth percentage moderates  share prices are more likely to tank Hence  investment in stocks having solid earnings acceleration is a profitable strategy as it considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates The Winning StrategyLet s look for stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  In addition to this  we have added the following parameters Current Price greater

company But why is it better than earnings growth  This is because in case of earnings acceleration you select stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet and consequently  are on the verge of price appreciation  Earnings acceleration considers both the direction and the magnitude of growth rates  Conversely  in case of earnings growth you pay for something that has already been reflected in the stock price More often than not the difference between good stocks and great stocks is determined by the increase in the percentage of earnings growth  This makes us believe that the company is in sound shape and has been on the right track for a consistent period of time  On the other hand  sideways percentage of earnings growth can potentially signal a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times send prices down Hence  investment in stocks having solid earnings acceleration is a profitable strategy The Winning
