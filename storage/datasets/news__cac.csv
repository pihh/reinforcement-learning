6799,228314,CAC,Small Business Optimism Hits 4 Month High In April  5 Picks ,opinion,Small business organizations may become hidden gems for investors in 2019  Wall Street rallied in the first four months of this year  Aside from large cap stocks  small caps also witnessed significant growth  Market turmoil started in May owing to renewed trade tensions between the United States and China At this juncture  small cap stocks are likely to emerge as diamonds in the rough  pushing aside large caps  Strong fundamentals of the U S  economy and immunity to external disturbances have increased these stocks  popularity Small Business Optimism JumpsOn May 14  the National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  reported that the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index rose 1 7 points to 103 5 in April  marking its 4 month high  The NFIB cited strong fundamentals of the U S  economy and solid GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019 as the primary reasons for the optimistic views A net 9  of all seasonally adjusted owners reported higher nominal sales in the past three months  reflecting an improvement of four points  Moreover  20  owners are expecting higher real sales volumes  marking a gain of one point  The frequency of reports of positive profit trends improved five points sequentially Why Small Business Is Important Small corporates create significant amount of jobs in the U S  economy  More than 50  of the newly created jobs in the private sector originate from this sector  These people constitute a large part of customers for big businesses Moreover  small companies are a major part of the supply chain management systems of large companies for innovative and technologically superior inputs  Additionally  small businesses often end up being an important part of corporate America s customer base Meanwhile  the Russell 2000  RUT     the benchmark index of small cap stocks    has jumped up 12 3  year to date Small Caps Are Important During VolatilitySmall cap stocks carry some special features which make them very useful under a volatile market  Small cap stocks are mostly immune to any external shock since the United States is the primary market of their products  This is aiding this segment to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility Owing to their domestic business strategy  small cap stocks are immune to the movement of the U S  dollar   A strong U S  dollar will make exports of large companies uncompetitive  However  small cap stocks remain unaffected by foreign exchange volatility Small cap companies generally benefit first from an improving domestic economy  A strong economic condition tends to coincide with rising interest rate  However  in order to fund expansion  small cap companies are less likely to take the debt route compared with their large peers making them less sensitive to the interest rate movement Additionally  reduction of corporate tax from 35  to 21  is a major catalyst for small cap companies  These companies book almost all of their revenues in the homeland  As a result  a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate is immediately accretive to their cash flow Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in small cap stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential  We have narrowed down our search to five stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can

6811,228326,CAC,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Limbach  Health Insurance  Fibrocell  Camden And First Business,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  May 16  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Limbach Holdings Inc    NASDAQ LMB    Health Insurance Innovations Inc    NASDAQ HIIQ    Fibrocell Science Inc    NASDAQ FCSC    Camden National Corp    NASDAQ CAC   and First Business Financial Services Inc    NASDAQ FBIZ   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Small Business Optimism Hits 4 Month High in April  5 PicksSmall business organizations may become hidden gems for investors in 2019  Wall Street rallied in the first four months of this year  Aside from large cap stocks  small caps also witnessed significant growth  Market turmoil started in May owing to renewed trade tensions between the United States and China At this juncture  small cap stocks are likely to emerge as diamonds in the rough  pushing aside large caps  Strong fundamentals of the U S  economy and immunity to external disturbances have increased these stocks  popularity Small Business Optimism JumpsOn May 14  the National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  reported that the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index rose 1 7 points to 103 5 in April  marking its 4 month high  The NFIB cited strong fundamentals of the U S  economy and solid GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019 as the primary reasons for the optimistic views A net 9  of all seasonally adjusted owners reported higher nominal sales in the past three months  reflecting an improvement of four points  Moreover  20  owners are expecting higher real sales volumes  marking a gain of one point  The frequency of reports of positive profit trends improved five points sequentially Why Small Business Is Important Small corporates create significant amount of jobs in the U S  economy  More than 50  of the newly created jobs in the private sector originate from this sector  These people constitute a large part of customers for big businesses Moreover  small companies are a major part of the supply chain management systems of large companies for innovative and technologically superior inputs  Additionally  small businesses often end up being an important part of corporate America s customer base Meanwhile  the Russell 2000  RUT     the benchmark index of small cap stocks    has jumped up 12 3  year to date Small Caps Are Important During VolatilitySmall cap stocks carry some special features which make them very useful under a volatile market  Small cap stocks are mostly immune to any external shock since the United States is the primary market of their products  This is aiding this segment to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility Owing to their domestic business strategy  small cap stocks are immune to the movement of the U S  dollar   A strong U S  dollar will make exports of large companies uncompetitive  However  small cap stocks remain unaffected by foreign exchange volatility Small cap companies generally benefit first from an improving domestic economy  A strong economic condition tends to coincide with rising interest rate  However  in order to fund expansion  small cap companies are less likely to take the debt route compared with their large peers making them less sensitive to the interest rate movement Additionally  reduction of corporate tax from 35  to 21  is a major catalyst for small cap companies  These companies book almost all of their revenues in the homeland  As a result  a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate is immediately accretive to their cash flow Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in small cap stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential  We have narrowed down our search to five stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Limbach Holdings Inc  provides commercial specialty contract services in the United States  It operates in two segments

6812,228327,CAC,5 Top US Focused Stocks To Buy As Trade Negotiations Stall ,opinion,The year old trade conflict between the United States and China  which looked like being close to resolution in the first four months of this year  has been deteriorating again since the first week of this month  According to CNBC  the U S  China trade negotiations appear to have been stalled as it remains unclear what the two sides will discuss Consequently  trade sensitive stocks  especially the ones that have large exposure to China or other international markets  lost a good chunk of value  At this juncture  it will be prudent to invest in domestic business focused stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank Trade War ResurfacesWall Street faced extreme volatility following President Donald Trump s tweet on May 5  in which he expressed his displeasure about the progress of U S  China trade negotiations and threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods On May 10  the U S  government hiked existing tariff rates to 25  from 10  on  200 billion of Chinese exports  In 2018  the Trump administration imposed 25  tariff on  50 billion of Chinese goods  Moreover  President Trump threatened to levy 25  tariff on another  325 billion of Chinese goods China had imposed  110 billion tariffs on U S  exports in 2018  Following the hike of U S  tariff  the Chinese authority imposed 25  tariff on an additional  60 billion U S  goods effective Jun 1  2019 Trump Declares National Emergency in TelecomOn May 15  President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency  preventing U S  corporates from using information and communications technology equipment from sources as this  poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States  Following the order  the Department of Commerce added Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies and its affiliates to the Bureau of Industry and Security  BIS  Entity List  Another Chinese telecom giant ZTE  HK 0763  may also face the same fate  The latest move by the U S  government further jeopardized the lingering trade related disputes between the two countries Global Economic Slowdown ConcernsMarkets are uncertain about when the U S  China trade tension will be resolved or if at all they will be  President Trump added to the prevailing ambiguity on May 13  when he said that people will come to know whether a trade deal is at all possible in the next three to four weeks If no progress is made at all and a full  fledged trade war rages  then in addition to these two countries  the global economy will also see a slowdown  On Apr 9  the IMF reduced global economic growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3  compared with 3 5  projected in January and 3 7  forecast in October  The IMF cited trade related conflict as the primary reason for lowering global economic growth rate Why Domestic Stocks Investors are concerned that intensifying trade conflict will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be vulnerable in the international markets  Domestic business oriented companies are mostly immune to any external shocks since the United States is the lone market for their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility Our Top PicksAt this stage  investment in domestic business focused stocks with strong growth potential will be lucrative  We have been able to narrow down our search to five stocks  which have moved higher in the past month and still have upside left  All five stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

Chicago  IL   May 21  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  SB One Bancorp   NASDAQ SBBX    Camden National Corp    NASDAQ CAC    Middlesex Water Co    NASDAQ MSEX    The Joint Corp    NASDAQ JYNT   and NexPoint Residential Trust Inc    NYSE NXRT   
Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  
5 Top U S  Focused Stocks to Buy as Trade Negotiations Stall
The year old trade conflict between the United States and China  which looked like being close to resolution in the first four months of this year  has been deteriorating again since the first week of this month  According to CNBC  the U S  China trade negotiations appear to have been stalled as it remains unclear what the two sides will discuss 
Consequently  trade sensitive stocks  especially the ones that have large exposure to China or other international markets  lost a good chunk of value  At this juncture  it will be prudent to invest in domestic business focused stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank 
Trade War Resurfaces
Wall Street faced extreme volatility following President Donald Trump s tweet on May 5  in which he expressed his displeasure about the progress of U S  China trade negotiations and threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods 
On May 10  the U S  government hiked existing tariff rates to 25  from 10  on  200 billion of Chinese exports  In 2018  the Trump administration imposed 25  tariff on  50 billion of Chinese goods  Moreover  President Trump threatened to levy 25  tariff on another  325 billion of Chinese goods 
China had imposed  110 billion tariffs on U S  exports in 2018  Following the hike of U S  tariff  the Chinese authority imposed 25  tariff on an additional  60 billion U S  goods effective Jun 1  2019 
Trump Declares National Emergency in Telecom
On May 15  President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency  preventing U S  corporates from using information and communications technology equipment from sources as this  poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States  
Following the order  the Department of Commerce added Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies and its affiliates to the Bureau of Industry and Security  BIS  Entity List  Another Chinese telecom giant ZTE  HK 0763  may also face the same fate  The latest move by the U S  government further jeopardized the lingering trade related disputes between the two countries 
Global Economic Slowdown Concerns
Markets are uncertain about when the U S  China trade tension will be resolved or if at all they will be  President Trump added to the prevailing ambiguity on May 13  when he said that people will come to know whether a trade deal is at all possible in the next three to four weeks 
If no progress is made at all and a full  fledged trade war rages  then in addition to these two countries  the global economy will also see a slowdown  On Apr 9  the IMF reduced global economic growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3  compared with 3 5  projected in January and 3 7  forecast in October  The IMF cited trade related conflict as the primary reason for lowering global economic growth rate 
Why Domestic Stocks 
Investors are concerned that intensifying trade conflict will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be vulnerable in the international markets  Domestic business oriented companies are mostly immune to any external shocks since the United States is the lone market for their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility 
Our Top Picks

Executive OfficerThank you  Sarah  Good afternoon and welcome to Camden National fourth quarter earnings call Before I provide an overview  I d like to welcome two analyst and their firms who initiated coverage of Camden National Corporation since our last call  We re joined by Wally Wallace from Raymond James and Jake Civiello from Janney Securities  I will note  Jake is traveling right now and may not be on the call  And they join Damon DelMonte from KBW  who has covered Camden since 2015 Earlier today  we announced record annual earnings for 2019 of  57 2 million or  3 69 per diluted share and fourth quarter earnings of  15 2 million or  0 99 per diluted share  We re very pleased with our strong finish to 2019  which led to a return on average assets of 1 3   return on average equity of 12 44  and a non GAAP efficiency ratio under 56  Net interest income increased 8  over 2018 and EPS was up 9   Debbie will provide a deeper look into our financial performance  but I d like to take a few moments to highlight some additional information During 2019  our average loans grew 8  over 2018  while our average deposits grew 14  the similar time period  This resulted in a loan to deposit ratio of 87   which positions us very well against our Northern New England peers   Indecipherable  loan growth was 2  in 2019 due to elevated prepayments throughout the year  Our guidance for 2020 is still mid single digit loan growth Our focus on deposits will continue as we enjoy both the pricing and liquidity impact of a strong deposit base  but I ll repeat my caution from prior quarters that we do remain cautious as we see aggressive pricing on deposits  particularly from competitors who have higher loan to deposit ratios and less liquidity than we do I d like to share that our Wealth Management group reached an important milestone by achieving over  1 billion of assets under management at December 31  2019  When combined with assets administered by our brokerage group  we have received nearly  1 5 billion of client assets Behind the scenes  our commercial  retail  wealth  brokerage and treasury management teams work collaboratively to present Camden National s full set of products and services  More importantly  our analytical capabilities such as credit underwriting investment research combined with our technology capabilities positions us strongly against competitors much larger than we are  which complements our ability to position our decision makers at the table with customers and clients Although we ve seen great progress on many strategic fronts  we have not lost sight of asset quality  As of December 31  2019  non performing assets reached a historical low of 0 25  of total assets and non performing loans that were 0 36  of total loans  This is the result of a strong credit card culture  starting with the lenders and working through our underwriting teams  equally as important are the special assets and collection teams who do a great job in those instances  when our customers are behind on loan payments or unable to pay their loans We are one of the banks required to adopt the new accounting standard  CECL  in the first quarter of 2020  We continue to be very pleased with our work on CECL up to this point and our overall readiness for adoption in the first quarter  We are currently working with our auditors as they wrap up their reviews and we fully expect to share the impact at the end of the first quarter Our capital at the end of 2019 was well in excess of regulatory capital requirements as shown by our total risk based capital ratio of 14 44  and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9 55   Our total common equity was 8 66   which we feel positions us very well in the current environment  With our strong capital position  we were still able to redeploy over  20 8 million of capital through the repurchase of over 488 000 shares of our stock during the year and pay  19 million of cash dividends to our shareholders in 2019 In addition  in the fourth quarter  we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of  0 03 per share or 10   With this most recent increase  our payout ratio for the fourth quarter was 33  and current yield was 2 86   based on last Friday s close of business stock price  Our book value per share ended the year at  31 26  up 12  from  27 95 at the end of 2018 And we announced last quarter that Debbie will be retiring on April 30th  2020  We re currently working with recruiters to find a replacement with the goal of having a person on board just prior to Debbie s retirement  I do want to thank Debbie for    not only her service  but working hard to make a smooth transition And with that  I d like to turn it over to Debbie to review our financial performance Deborah A  Jordan    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Greg  and good afternoon everyone  We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter operating results with net income of  15 2 million  a return on average assets of 1 35  and a return on tangible common equity of 16 26   Net income increased 9  compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  with revenue growth of 8  and operating expenses  up 5   In comparing results to the previous quarter  net income increased  750 000 or 5  with revenue growth of 4  and a lower credit provision  partially offset by a 4  increase in operating cost between periods On a linked quarter basis  fee income increased  1 2 million or 11  with growth in most fee categories  plus an unrealized gain on equity securities of  866 000  Mortgage banking fees declined almost  500 000 between periods due to seasonality  However  we posted strong gains of  2 2 million for the quarter as we benefited from refinancing activity  Our mortgage pipeline at December 31st was  90 million compared to  135 million at September 30th Net interest income grew  316 000 or 1  from the previous quarter with a 3 basis point increase in our net interest margin to 3 12   The margin expansion was the result of a 14 basis point decline in funding costs from the third quarter while the asset yield decreased 9 basis points or 12     12 basis point decline  when excluding loan prepayment income We were able to lower funding cost to 94 basis points for the fourth quarter due to changes in rates and funding mix  Overall borrowing cost declined 20 basis points reflecting the cuts in the Fed Funds rate  while total deposit costs decreased 8 basis points with the repricing of indexed deposits and active management of exception pricing We also experienced our typical deposit seasonal inflow with average checking accounts growing 3  between the third and fourth quarter  which allowed us to reduce higher cost borrowings  We are extremely happy to have margin expansion during the fourth quarter  however  we maintain our outlook of margin compression in 2020  Camden National remains asset sensitive  and the ability to reprice deposits lower  may be limited due to market competition Total loans outstanding of  3 1 billion declined slightly from September 30th with the CRE portfolio decreasing 1  and the consumer and home equity balances declining 3   This was partially offset by growth in the residential portfolio of 1   As Greg mentioned  elevated prepayments have impacted loan growth for the year Operating expenses of  24 8 million for the fourth quarter increased 4   compared to the previous quarter  primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation associated with exceeding budget expectations for the year  On a non GAAP  efficiency ratio for the quarter reached 55 64  As disclosed in our earnings release  we will be closing three banking centers in April of 2020  Current employees at these locations will be redeployed into surrounding banking centers and will be integral to the customer transition  On an annual basis  this translates to a reduction in operating expenses of approximately  1 million That concludes our comments on the fourth quarter results  We re now happy to open call for questions  Thank you Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from Damon DelMonte with KBW  Please go ahead Damon DelMonte    KBW    AnalystHey  good afternoon guys  How are you doing today Gregory A  Dufour    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood  Damon Damon DelMonte    KBW    AnalystGood  So first question  I just want to talk a little bit about the margin  Debbie in your prepared remarks  you indicated you expect some pressure likely as we go through 2020  Can you put a little framework around that as far as how much you re expecting and maybe a range of that Deborah A  Jordan    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Glad to hear your voice  Damon  We had a great fourth quarter on the margin and it did exceed expectation  Part of it was the prepayment income that was recorded in the fourth quarter and so that was about a 3 basis point less  But even with that  we did have a slight increase in our margin between quarters  We have    as we ve talked about in the past  the seasonality of our deposit base  third and fourth quarter are really strong and we were fairly aggressive on the exception pricing of readjusting some of our preferred pricing down  So  very happy with our management of the cost of funds When we look at the first quarter  we expect above a 5  outflow of deposits  So we ll have shifting from checking accounts into borrowed funds  and so that certainly impacts the margin for the first and second quarter of each year  My take is  it will be down around 3 05   3 06  mark for the first half of next year    this year Damon DelMonte    KBW    AnalystOkay  Great  Okay  that s helpful  Thank you  And then with regard to the three branches that are being closed  I believe you said in April that goes into effect  so we can kind of build in some    all those cost savings starting in the second quarter  And would that just be in the occupancy line or how should we think about modeling that Deborah A  Jordan    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I would build it in    certainly in the latter part of the second quarter occupancy  personnel  There s seven employees in those banking centers now  they will be filling vacant positions that are in other locations  And so certainly in the personnel cost line  there ll be a reduction in run rate as well Damon DelMonte    KBW    AnalystGot you  Okay  great  And then if I could just squeeze one more in  just kind of broadly on the loan outlook  where are you seeing the best opportunities in your footprint for growth right now Gregory A  Dufour    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I ll take that  Damon  We re still seeing it  obviously it s oriented in Southern Maine  in New Hampshire  some of that is due to just the the economy in that part  it s tends to be stronger than North of Portland  But also we ve hired some lenders in there that have done extremely well The other part of it is  is that  we ve been doing hiring focusing on C I lenders as well  so we do get a little bit of a product diversification coming through there  With that said  we ve had some good years and our Bangor market probably had one of our stronger years lending wise  Lewiston Auburn also had a good 2019  And then in Mid Coast  albeit there  we have a much higher market share but that s held up real well So it was one of these time periods of everything was kind of focused in doing the right things that did temper the prepayments  We expect the same thing to continue in 2020  Our goal is to have    all markets are important to us  and to get more than our fair share of any growth that s out there Damon DelMonte    KBW    AnalystGreat  Okay  that s all I had  I ll step out for now  I appreciate the color  Thank you Gregory A  Dufour    President and Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from William Wallace with Raymond James  Please go ahead William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystThanks for taking my call  Good afternoon  Greg  Debbie Gregory A  Dufour    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi Wally Deborah A  Jordan    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerHello William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystMaybe just to follow up on the last line of questioning  your loans were actually down in the second half of the year  What gives you confidence that    I m assuming there is pay off pressures that s driving that  I m just curious  what gives you confidence in the mid single digit guide for 2020  Is there anything you re seeing that gives you confidence in your outlook that prepays will decline or that production will accelerate Gregory A  Dufour    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  it s    I won t say it s necessarily on the prepayments declining because they ll still be pretty steady because of the interest rate cycle  I think it s really just as we re expanding and developing the talent that we have in the lending staff as well as in our underwriting capabilities  it gives us that focus  The economy and what we re seeing in activity is still strong  So we can pick that up and cover what s being prepaid and then some    albeit not that any year is easy  but it will be tougher to your point Deborah A  Jordan    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Wally  I hope we see prepayment settle down a little bit because when we look at fourth quarter  CPR  Phonetic  both on the CRE side and the residential side were in the 20  Phonetic  CPR rate    historically it s around 15 each  And so my hope is  we ll see some of these larger transactions came through and certainly impact that rate We had record mortgage originations in 2019 and we re still investing in that and new lenders on the mortgage side  And the CRE side  we actually had strong originations  I think that was record originations in the CRE side too  So continuing to do more of that with a little relief on the prepayment side William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  And then if you kind of look  Debbie  to the commentary you said around net interest margin  you said 3 05   3 06  in the first half of the year  the next two quarters or so  you will start to get deposits back  Would you think that there is a decent chance that you could see a bottom in the first half of the year  And then assuming the Fed is on pause and then some expansion in the second half as you get the deposits back and can shift your funding mix a little bit Deborah A  Jordan    Executive Vice President  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Typically  we would see that the one caution that and Greg and I both referenced  which is the competitive environment would be the one wild card  But normally  yes  we would see that lift in the first    the second half of the year  We ve been successful  let s hope we continue to be successful to manage the pricing down William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  And it s good to see that you identified some opportunity in the branch network  Are there    I think you said  based on    I can t remember the wording in the press release  an analysis or something of the network  Is there more work being done around the branch network to find opportunities or do you feel like you ve kind of identified the opportunities for now  with these three Gregory A  Dufour    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  how I d phrase it is that  we do it on a more continuous basis  So obviously these three were the ones that we landed on for this round  And as we ve discussed before  some of it  Wally is dependent upon leases expiring  it could be even looking at the staff  albeit with this one  all of them will be redeployed in the franchise  So we take all of those factors in So on one hand  I do want to stress  it s something that we re always looking at fine tuning  measuring those things of    if there are more on the list  But on the other hand  I don t want to    and sometimes this is more internally as well as for communities that there s several others that are kind of on the bubble here  because then you get staff and communities and customers waiting for the other shoe to drop So we typically just say  look this is what is obvious to us now
