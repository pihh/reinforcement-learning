93429,314944,XLNX,Why Xilinx Stock Fell 10  This Morning,news,"What happened
Shares of Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  fell as much as 10 2  on Wednesday morning  following a mixed third quarter report on Tuesday evening 
So what
The maker of programmable logic devices saw third quarter sales falling 10  year over year to  723 million  while adjusted earnings declined 26  to  0 68 per share  The Street consensus was calling for earnings near  0 59 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of  731 million  The company also set a low bar for fourth quarter revenue  aiming for roughly  765 million  while the analyst consensus had pointed to approximately  825 million 

Now what
Xilinx pinned the soft revenue on  global trade headwinds  and slowdowns in both wired and wireless network deployments  The company is implementing several cost cutting measures  including a 7  headcount reduction and stricter limits on discretionary expenses  5G wireless rollouts have been boosting Xilinx s sales in recent quarters and are still seen as a long term upside  but management said that there s a lull right now between the first and second major waves of 5G installations in key markets like China and South Korea 
 The unprecedented change in US China relations in trade clearly has an impact on the industry and specifically our business  and at a time that s really unfortunate right at the beginning of deployment of 5G   CEO Victor Peng said on the earnings call   It is important to remember we re still in the relatively early innings on 5G and it started out much stronger and earlier than people predicted  Now we re having a soft spot  but we have the right kind of engagements with top OEMs and there s still many more innings to come  
Several analyst firms lowered their target prices for Xilinx based on the weaker revenue and rather extreme cost cutting measures  but many of these target cuts remain paired to  buy  recommendations  This price drop looks like a solid buy in window for the long haul  and Xilinx shares are still trading at a lofty 27 times forward earnings estimates  or 38 times trailing free cash flows  Don t be fooled by the lower sales and earnings in this particular report    Xilinx is still a promising growth investment for patient buyers ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pohrq,2070770

93432,314947,XLNX,Xilinx Stock Drops After Company Announces Job and Other Expense Cuts,news,"Shares of field programmable gate array  FPGA  manufacturer Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  dropped 10 7  on Wednesday following the company s fiscal 2020 third quarter report  They dropped slightly more on Thursday  Investors had expected it to be a tough period for the chipmaker  and revenue and earnings did decline  as management had laid out a few months prior   
However  the company had a few unexpected surprises in store for shareholders and employees  a 7  reduction in its workforce through layoffs and a slowdown in hiring  and a cost reduction plan to make business more efficient  It isn t the end of the world  as Xilinx s FPGAs still have a future in the development of data centers  5G mobile networks  and automotive technology  but cost cutting at this level tends to throw shade on a stock s growth prospects  Don t panic just yet  though   

Business is officially in pullback mode
The trade war between the U S  and China had started to take a toll on Xilinx  but up until the three months ended Dec  28  2019  the chipmaker was still notching year over year growth  In the most recent quarter  though  sales fell 10  from the year prior to  723 million  and adjusted earnings per share fell 26    
There was some good news  though  Even with sales of FPGAs in reverse  gross profit margin on products sold improved to 66 8   compared with 64 8  in the prior quarter  Still  operating expenses grew again  as they have been all year  which meant a steep drop for the bottom line    thus all but eliminating a strong performance through the first half of the fiscal year   

Pp   percentage point  Data source  Xilinx   
CEO Victor Peng said the expectation is that Q3 will be a trough and that business will rebound from here  but it will be a gradual rebound rather than a fast turnaround  Fourth quarter 2020 revenue is expected to be  750 million to  780 million  up 6  sequentially but down 8  from a year ago at the midpoint of guidance  Gross margin should also improve again  forecast to be 67 5  to 69 5   and operating expenses should be  351 million to  355 million    which includes a  17 million to  20 million benefit from cost cuts but a  25 million to  30 million charge related to severance pay  
Aligning costs with reality
Things don t look great at the moment for Xilinx  but it s important to remember that the chipmaking business is a cyclical one    even for hardware that is benefiting from strong secular tailwinds  Before investors get too distressed over the quarterly update  there are a few factors to bear in mind 
First  Xilinx s data center business is still healthy  Second quarter sales from the segment were an all time record  and while Q3 and Q4 are both going to come in lower  cloud computing is still pushing demand higher and is expected to do so for years to come  Automotive is another segment that should provide long term growth as FPGAs find their way into the advanced driver assist packages available in most new cars  However  data centers and autos alone only accounted for 28  of sales in Q3   
That leaves the wireless and mobile segment as the primary source of pain  At about a third of overall revenue  the division s year over year tumbles made a big impact on Xilinx s results the past couple of quarters  Even with trade tension between the U S  and China easing recently  Huawei remains out of the picture  Peng said  however  that even if the White House lifts its ban on doing business with the Chinese tech giant  he doesn t see revenue coming back to the pre ban level  5G mobile deployment has also taken a breather as telecoms gear up for the next big push  which has meant delays in purchases from Xilinx for the time being   
As a result  Peng and his team are declining to provide any specific guidance on fiscal 2021  Paired with the cost cutting announcement  that cloudy view is what has the stock in retreat once again  the stock price is off nearly 40  from all time highs reached in spring 2019   Xilinx will likely return to growth in fiscal 2021    as data centers and autos are expected to grow and the company starts to lap the Huawei sales ban    so the aggressive cost cutting is likely more a realignment of the business with reality rather than a reason to panic  Nevertheless  the Q4 report in another few months will be an especially important one to watch  indicating just how long the current slump will last and how strong of a rebound can be expected  Stay tuned ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp4sf,2072341

Consensus Estimate of  726 million as well  Weakness in the WWG business is a major overhang on the company Management now anticipates a more gradual recovery in revenues than what it had earlier envisioned in the beginning of the fiscal third quarter  Higher than anticipated softness in WWG business is likely to persist as a dampener in the fiscal fourth quarter However  in order to drive operational efficiency  the company is reducing its global workflow by 7  and taking several steps to control discretionary spending The impact of Huawei ban and other trade related uncertainties

With me are Victor Peng  our CEO  and Sumeet Gagneja  our Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer  As a search for our new Chief Financial Officer remains ongoing  for this call  Victor will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and the business outlook for the March quarter of fiscal year 2020  Sumeet and I will participate in the Q A portion of the call  as needed Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today  we may make projections or other forward looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company  We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially  We refer you to the documents that the company files with the SEC  including our 10 Ks  10 Qs and 8 Ks  These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward looking statements In addition to GAAP financial measures  we will be disclosing certain supplemental non GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company s financial results  We provide these measures to facilitate period to period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non recurring unusual items  such as amortization of intangibles and certain one time items related to acquisitions  We believe that sharing these non GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company s ongoing core business  A reconciliation of non GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live  It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website Let me now turn the call over to Victor Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Matt  and good afternoon  everyone  Let me jump right into our results for the third quarter and provide an update on our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 Overall  the quarter played out largely as we anticipated  Total revenues were  723 5 million  near the midpoint of our expected revenue range  We made a concerted effort to reduce operating expenses and achieved better than expected operating margin and GAAP earnings per share of  0 64  non GAAP operating earnings per share of  0 68 Now I ll turn to highlights for the third quarter  The Advanced Products category constituted approximately 70  of total revenues in the third quarter  a decrease of 4  year over year  Zynq based revenue grew 26  year over year  despite the impact of a weaker Wired and Wireless business  The Zynq SoC platform  which includes Zynq at 28 nanometer and both MPSoC and RFSoC at 16 nanometer  represented 23  of total revenues  which is higher than the year ago period  We continue to see strong Zynq traction across our target markets  which is a positive indicator of our progression transitioning to platforms  Our overall customer engagement momentum continues to build as we position for the long term profitable growth by executing on our strategy of growth in the data center  5G and the automotive market  as well as accelerating growth in our core markets In the Communication markets  we are actively engaged with a global non Chinese OEM for second generation 5G radio design that includes beam forming and is based on our 7 nanometer Versal ACAP  Beyond Communication  Versal continues to be well received by customers across several end markets  While production shipments at Versal is expected to begin in late FY  21  we have already recognized initial revenue from early shipments to customers In the Data Center  Alibaba Cloud announced that Xilinx is powering the data center and is being used by their cloud services enterprise customers  They also shared that unprecedented traffic during Singles Day in China has proven the reliability and security of their systems platform running on our FPGAs  In addition  Supermicro unveiled two new Alveo systems that power compute platforms to accelerate some of the most algorithmically demanding workloads in the enterprise and in the cloud On the Software front  as announced earlier  the latest Vitis platform is now available for download and free to users who purchased Alveo development board  We also announced the availability of the Vitis AI inference development platform that empowers software developers to utilize deep learning acceleration frameworks like TensorFlow and Caffe  Lastly  we announced our Zynq MPSoC is powering Baidu s production ready Apollo Computing Unit for automated valet parking  the industry s first dedicated computing solution for this emerging automotive application Moving to a review of our business groups and core markets of the third quarter  Our core markets performed as expected with some adjustments in mix across our AIT and ABC markets  We saw less than expected declines in A D and ISM  while macroeconomic and trade related headwinds impacted automotive more than expected  We saw increased revenue from emulation and prototyping customers in TME market  albeit somewhat less than expected  This mix of revenue help to drive a higher blended corporate gross margin in the quarter The Data Center Group performed as expected and benefited from sales of both compute and networking products to hyperscale customers  Networking revenue from Solarflare somewhat outperformed expectations in the quarter  We also saw increased revenue from customers shipping storage class memory  However  this was offset by weaker demand from high performance computing and some crypto customers The Wired and Wireless group performed largely than anticipated  with both wireless and wired down sequentially  Wireless revenue meaningfully declined because of the anticipated baseband ASIC transition and some program related delays with one of our global OEMs Now moving on to the financials  As I mentioned  total revenue was  723 5 million  down 10  year over year and down 13  sequentially  Data Center Group revenue increased 8  year over year  but was down 16  sequentially from a record quarter  Wired and Wireless group revenue declined 18  year over year and was down 29  sequentially  Note that we had one communications customer that represented greater than 10  of revenues in the third quarter  AIT revenue declined 10  year over year and it was down 5  sequentially  ABC revenue increased 10  year over year and was up 2  sequentially Gross margin was in line with expectations with GAAP gross margin of 67  and non GAAP gross margin of 68   GAAP operating expense at  324 million and non GAAP OpEx at  318 million were both meaningfully below guidance of  330 million due to significantly reduced hiring and discretionary spending  GAAP operating income was  159 million or 22  operating margin  Non GAAP operating income was  174 million or 24  operating margin  Our GAAP tax rate was approximately 2  and non GAAP tax rate was approximately 5   GAAP net income was  162 million and diluted earnings per share was  0 64  a 31  year over year decrease  Non GAAP net income was  171 million and non GAAP diluted EPS was  0 68  a 26  decline from last year Diluted share count decreased to 252 8 million and gross cash was  2 4 billion with  1 2 billion in long term debt  Accounts receivables decreased to  254 million and that is 32 days down from 37 days last quarter  Overall  we generated  324 million in operating cash flow  During the quarter  we repurchased approximately 2 8 million shares at an average price of  93 70 per share and paid dividends of  93 million Turning now to the outlook for the fourth quarter  We still believe Q3 will be our low quarter for fiscal  20 from a revenue perspective  However  our revenue recovery is now expected to be more gradual than we had anticipated at the start of last quarter  We expect total fourth quarter revenue to be between  750 million and  780 million  which at the midpoint of the guidance is down approximately 8  year over year  but up approximately 6  sequentially  Fourth quarter revenue growth is being driven by meaningful improvement in our core markets and moderate growth in DCG  but is significantly offset by greater than anticipated weakness in WWG  We expect modest growth from our distribution channel For core markets  we are on track with our prior expectations for strong sequential revenue growth as programs for multiple emulation and prototyping customers ramp  Both A D and ISM are expected to be up in Q4  Auto is also expected to recover in Q4 as ADAS demand increases relative to Q3  AVB and consumer are expected to be somewhat weaker  For DCG  revenue is expected to grow moderately  albeit somewhat less than prior expectations  We expect continued contributions from compute acceleration  driven by a mix of cloud and high performance compute customers  We expect to see slower revenue ramp from storage and networking customers and we expect additional cloud customer POCs to move into production  But revenue will likely continue to be lumpy given that we re in the early stages of scaling the DCG business The most significant change to our outlook is in WWG  We now expect Q4 revenue from both Wired and Wireless customers to decline more than previously anticipated  The additional negative impact to our wireless business are result of a slowdown in 5G rollout across multiple regions as many operator take a pause before the next wave of infrastructure deployment  In addition  wired revenues are being impacted by a broad based weakness in demand across multiple customers  Note that these headwinds are in addition to the impact of the loss of revenue from Huawei since last May  We now expect WWG revenue to be down in FY  20 versus FY  19 Fiscal Q4 non GAAP gross margin is expected to improve to approximately 69 5   Given the more persistent revenue headwinds we re facing  we re taking several actions to drive structural operating efficiencies across the company  We plan to reduce our global workforce by approximately 7  through a targeted reduction in force and meaningfully slower attrition replacement  In addition  we are taking several actions to reduce further discretionary spend and realize additional operating efficiencies across the business Excluding severance charges related to the reduction in force  non GAAP operating expense is expected to be approximately  318 million  which reflects the adjusted spending profile  This includes approximately  17 million to  20 million of savings from various operating expense reduction actions we plan to take in the fourth quarter  This is offset by expenses related to 7 nanometer tape out in the quarter and increased legal expenses  Non GAAP other income is expected to be approximately  8 million due primarily to an anticipated IP settlement for the customer that was recently acquired  Finally  our tax rate is expected to be approximately 8  In closing  we are faced with persistent trade related impacts to our business and other headwind  We are taking thoughtful and decisive actions that  while painful  we believe are in the best interest of all Xilinx s stakeholders  We continue to see a great long term opportunity and secular growth trends in data center  5G infrastructure and automotive markets as well as TAM expansion and share gains across our foundational core markets  We remain extremely focused and committed to our strategy to drive profitable growth as a leader in adaptable platforms Operator  we ll now open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThe floor is now open for questions   Operator Instructions  And your first question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Joseph Moore    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Thank you  I wonder before you had said that the impact of the baseband transition would be largely done by the March quarter  is that still the case  And what are you kind of thinking about the progression of wireless beyond that  particularly as you know  assuming that we don t get Huawei back into the mix  Can you grow from there  Is it going to take a while  Just what do you think is the progression there Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Joe  I mean  what we said is the baseband impact did occur in the last quarter as expected  So that    you re correct if you re implying that s not new news  You re right  That s not new news  Really  the additional pressure we re feeling in the current quarter is from slow down in deployments across multiple geographies and then both weakness both on the wireless side as well in the wired side  that level of weakness we did not anticipate last quarter when we kind of gave the overall guide for the second half In terms of how we see things going forward  we re not giving guidance for FY  21  but I guess broader picture  what I would say is  clearly in the near term  we have some meaningful headwinds here  Huawei remains on the Entity List and that I really think that from that perspective  we don t think about that is even if that were to change in the Entity List that account revenue would be at levels that it used to be  I think it s just the reality of it and that s how we think about it now  However  we re still relatively speaking in the first phase of the point for 5G and you ve heard me and I m sure other people talk about  when we talk to all our customers  they feel like three waves of technology roll out  And so  it s certainly been more challenge as first wave  When we think about the longer term  we still think this is a good growth opportunity for Xilinx  particularly because we ve been innovating with things like RFSoC and Versal ACAP  And we ve got really good engagements as I had alluded in my prepared comments  already with some customers for the second generation and that s actually using our 7 nanometer Versal ACAP  So that s how we think about the big picture Joseph Moore    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  And just to clarify my question in terms of the baseband transition  Is that an ongoing headwind beyond the March quarter or the impact of that kind of mostly done in the current quarter Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerI guess  the way we think about it  it s mostly done  it s factored in exactly  If not  it s not like a one time event  it was    we expect it would happen    it did happen in that quarter and we keep it out Joseph Moore    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi guys  Thanks very much for taking the question  Victor  when you were talking about the Wireless business in your prepared remarks  you talked about the ASIC transition  You mentioned something about a program delay at one of your customers  How significant or insignificant were those two dynamics in the December quarter  And I guess more importantly  at your Investor Day  you guys talked about 3x to 4x more opportunity in 5G relative to 4G given more base stations  higher content and higher market share  Outside of Huawei having issues  has anything changed there or is everything still very much intact long term  Thank you Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Let me deal with the last portion first  It s exactly as you said  Huawei is significant  but if you sort of  OK  understand that and move on from that  we still do think it s a significantly larger opportunity than 4G  Now back to sort of the issue around one customer s program delay  really the bigger    higher oder bit on the the headwinds that we re seeing in Q4 causing us to see a more gradual recovery from the Q3 which we didn t anticipate was going to be kind of a confluence of kind of a perfect storm thing  It is really the general slowdown in deployment in multiple geographies and that s affected essentially all of the OEMs that we re working with  right  that we re still working with and allowed to work with  The program delay was another factor  but I think the way you should think about it is the highest order bit is just a pause or slower deployment that we are seeing across the    from the carriers and that s reflected in the OEM customers that we have and multiple of them in all the different regions Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna  Your line is open Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna Financial Group  LLLP    AnalystHey guys  thanks for the question  So I guess  first on WWG  So this pause  is it purely geographic or is it also    does it have something to do with the applications they re addressing  For example  moving from baseband to remote radio head or to massive MIMO  And then if you could talk about where we are with RFSoC and how you think that roll out will go Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  On the broader question  I don t think it has to do with a roll out of a particular technology and you re right  there are different types of technologies that fall out of the umbrella of 5G  It just    it seems as though the multiple operators that cover multiple regions are    done some initial deployments and are just taking a pause  My position is that they are seeking more profitability before they further invest  But in any event  we talked to you both carriers as well as our OEMs and we see that fairly broad  So I guess  again  then in terms of the longer term view and all that again  I think that the long term view still seems very    like a very good opportunity for us  And again  we have to keep in perspective that we re only in the very first phase and deployments will come back  it s just like we have a pause right now that we didn t anticipate Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna Financial Group  LLLP    AnalystGreat  And then on Data Center   Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerI m sorry  I just really as I didn t quite answer the RFSoC Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna Financial Group  LLLP    AnalystI m sorry Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo RFSoC  we do have that being deployed and with different OEMs that cover different multiple regions as well  both in sub 6  but also we think there is some strength there in millimeter wave bands  We re still relatively speaking in the early stages  but it is deployed  So it is out there and in multiple regions and through multiple OEMs  So apologize  I didn t quite cover that initially Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna Financial Group  LLLP    AnalystNo problem  Thank you  Victor  And on the Data Center side  nice progress on Alveo cards  but I think in your roadmap  you had AI Core either coming out soon or actually maybe even sampling now  maybe talk about where we are there and have you had any feedback from any hyperscalers or customers Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think so  I think when you re talking about the AI engine  I think that s respect to our Versal product  and we do have some early Versal development boards  So just to clarify some of the brand names  I think there is good excitement in multiple markets I kind of alluded to the 5G  but certainly in Data Center  that s being evaluated  And also in other markets as well  even in  let s see  one application that even though it s just in the initial silicon people are already doing some deployments in terms of very high resolution camera where they are also doing some image recognition due to some augmented reality for an interesting entertainment experience  And so I think that s a good indicator of not only quality of our initial silicon  but also the breadth that people are using AI on that platform  not just in what s considered the cloud  but maybe you call that    some people might call that an edge application  right  So  yeah  it s still early days  but we re pretty excited about the diversity and the traction that we re getting Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna Financial Group  LLLP    AnalystThanks  Victor OperatorYour next question comes from the line of C J  Muse from Evercore  Your line is open C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystYeah  good afternoon  Thank you for taking the question  I guess  a question on the restructuring  Can you walk through what is permanent versus temporary and can you help us kind of understand how you will plan to deliver both the operating margins in this more subdued environment as well as obviously invest  I guess most importantly  in the coming SoCs as well as the software stack in the coming few years  Thank you Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  C J   it s a good question  Look  I mean  now when we first started seeing some weakness  we took some proactive actions to control expenses that s reflected in the Q3  Really what happened is late in the year as we saw that some of these headwinds that we just walk through were more severe  And also I think the ongoing persistent effect of the whole China US trade situation and the Huawei business that I reflected  it was clear that we had to do something that was more structural  right  So it s very painful  Something for us as a company to impact some of our employees  but a good portion of this is a matter of reducing labor and that s both from that targeted reduction in force  as well as significantly controlling even attrition replacement  So that labor component obviously is an ongoing thing Now some of the other things that we re doing just many other actions in terms of discretionary spend but we also even looked at program  I think that s what you re alluding to  We spent a lot of time thinking about that  of course  because our goal and I think we ve achieved that  and how we re coming out here is to not further impact both near term business nor the grade or long term opportunity  which we remain very confident in  And I think you heard me mention in the prepared remarks that we expect a certain level of OpEx savings in the quarter  but we re doing a tape out in 7 nanometer in the quarter  So that somewhat offsets all of that So we are still very much committed to executing to our strategy and I think again there is some difficult decisions here  but I think we ve struck a right    a good balance of things that will bring us in a more reasonable profitability profile  like you said in a more subdued near term revenue environment  but not in any way materially impacting anything in the future or for that matter even the near term business  I do think that as we drive and recovering grow out of it  does position us to have maybe more efficiency in the business and leverage because we will watch very carefully our OpEx  even as we get back to a growth trend C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerWelcome OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird  Your line is open Tristan Gerra    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystHi  good afternoon  Could you give us some color on the weakness you see in the Wired business  Also I m trying to reconcile the commentary that 5G wireless deployments are taking across geographies  but in the US  the ramp has barely started  So maybe if you could elaborate and I know you ve already got a few questions on the topic  but if you could elaborate on the reasons for the pause  And when do you expect to rebound and with specifically ramp in the US Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  as you know  we really serve virtually all the OEMs that support all the different geographies  including of course the US and without getting into specific customers  we do see this broad softness and the feedback we re getting is because they are also not seeing some demand materialize across the regions and that includes the US  I do think that this is not necessarily something that is    it s hard to tell for visibility right now  but I don t think this is something that s going to necessarily persist until the second wave comes  It s just that clearly after they ve done some deployment  it just appears from both when we talk to carriers as well as the multiple OEMs that there seems to be a pause now and again where that s we see right now  Yeah  it s hard for us to predict exactly the timing of when that will restart  But again  I will come back to you  When I look at the engagements we already have going actively in the next wave of equipment  I feel good about that we still have good opportunity there  And when there is more deployment  the current generation of equipment  then obviously that could also help our business recover Tristan Gerra    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystOkay  And then could you give us a quick sense of your mix at 7 nanometer versus 16 nanometer Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  16 nanometer  our portfolio there is on track to break all the records that we have and we hold the most successful product family in the programmable space with our 7 series back in the 28 nanometer generation  We re clearly outpacing that  And that s due not only to the fact that how we executed  but the innovations we have with MPSoC  RFSoC and a number of other areas that s tremendously successful and that revenue is going to continue to grow for some number of years  7 nanometer  remember is just still in a sampling stage  right  So we re not in production  but we re getting very good traction  I mentioned multiple markets communications and one area that more of a video and broadcast kind of area  Data center  where we re getting good look at aerospace and defense  a lot of strong demand  but that will take time as it usually does for us in some of these markets to ramp to sort of more meaningful revenue  But we have logged revenue already  particularly in the development board  So very encouraging signs Tristan Gerra    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen  Your line is open Matthew Ramsay    Cowen   Co     AnalystYes  thank you very much  Good afternoon  Victor  I wanted to ask and I guess it s a little bit related to C J  s question on the reduction in force  but more specifically  as you guys look at prudent cost cuts and the like going forward  the level of investment and has that level of investment changed in the Vitis software stack that you guys introduced And I guess the second part of the question is  separate from the investment  how the early engagement has been on that software stack with customers across the business  And if there is anything to highlight there on that progression  That would be really helpful  Thank you Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  yes  Yeah  thanks  Maybe I didn t touch on that part of it  First  I guess  I really like to say on a relative basis  some of the labor related reductions that we re doing  on a relative basis we re doing more in SG A than in R D in general  OK  We are also again continue to invest in the areas that are critical for our growth So I think you re both making the point that it s not just silicon road map  it s also what we re doing on software IP and so forth and we fully agree  So my comments were    didn t mean to sort of imply that we are just looking at tape out  We are also    yeah    we are also focused more on everything we need  all the ONUs that we need to execute our resource strategy and move into platforms and be a much more mainstream targeted platform  Everything we see in terms of  for instance  Vitis  those  Indecipherable  when we announced new webinars and training  they fill out immediately  So that s really encouraging  I know at the end of day everyone as we certainly are looking for the revenue  But when I look at other things to measure in terms of developers  in terms of just hits we get on various videos that we do in training  it s all looking very promising  so Matthew Ramsay    Cowen   Co     AnalystThank you  And just as a quick follow up  In the Data Center portfolio  I wanted to ask if you could give us an update on the traction you guys might be having on the design win side in the SmartNIC space  And if that revenue can be material to the company over the next 12 to 18 months  Thanks Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think I kind of mentioned that for instance  Solarflare revenue last quarter was a little higher than expected  I think that was a record for them  It s till relatively modest revenue  I think that does bode well and we    that integration is going very well  And clearly  I think  the position will get even stronger when we really fully realize all the positive synergies of their expertise in software and system level expertise with our execution on hardware and platforms  So I do think that think the SmartNIC opportunity is significant  And I think thinking in terms of a year and beyond is reasonable and I think it will be  it will grow for multiple years OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO  Your line is open Ambrish Srivastava    BMO Capital Markets Corp     AnalystHi  thank you  Victor  I just had a question on the ASIC transition that you experienced this time  And you said that this was  so this is a one time and it s done  But when wireless starts to ramp again  why should it not occur again  i e  you see growth and then you ll see a headwind again  Just kind of help us understand the dynamic and why would this not repeat or would it repeat again  it was my first question And the second was given the what seems to be a pretty sizable reduction  what does it say about the longer term mid teens growth target that you have laid out for the company  Thank you Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Look  on the first part  I think when we said that we expected ASIC replacement in the basement  I think from the very early stages when we had strong upside and in 5G deployment  we said that we ordinarily don t get baseband wins and because there was an early rapid deployment in South Korea and the only way anybody can get to market was they using our technology  which is one of the value adds that we had was we now enable people to be agile and get things to market quickly  We had that  but we didn t expect longevity there  I know it s a competitive marketplace  everybody hears about that  but I want to bring people back to    we ve competed against ASIC at our customers for well over a decade  I mean Huawei has high silicon and has had high silicon for a long time  Clearly  everybody is aware that there was a meaningful impact when we couldn t ship the Huawei and clearly  we weren t totally replaced by ASIC by high silicon Huawei  That s just one example  I mean  I know you guys are familiar with all the other OEMs  they have ASIC teams  right  So  this is nothing new  And I don t take that lightly by any means either  I think we are able to still win against ASIC  even our own customers  because we are continuing to innovate    innovate with things like RFSoC  with things like Versal on the software and IP side  So yeah  look  I mean  could this happen again  It could  but we traditionally have really good strength in radio  We re innovating  we re moving rapidly and we continue to be very focused on this business  So we maintain that we feel like in the long term that this is a very big opportunity despite those very significant impacts of the trade situation here So that was all on the ASIC side  so I m sorry  can you repeat the second part of your question Ambrish Srivastava    BMO Capital Markets Corp     AnalystYeah  So that s helpful perspective  Thanks for that  What I was asking was given the reduction what seems    I can t remember the last time we saw such a big reduction for you guys  but what does that speak to the mid teens growth that you have laid out for the company Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  look  we re not    as I said before  we re not going to give guidance to FY  21 now  We look to do that in the next call  But what I would say is that we absolutely are committed to getting back to double digit growth  I think this is a recognition of the fact that it s going to come up a little bit more gradually to get to that kind of a run rate  We re committed to doing that and we ve recognized that because it is going to take longer  We ve had to take some difficult steps here  but I think we re building this to    continue to execute our strategy and fulfill  I think a very significant opportunity we have not only 5G  but again  data center  our core markets and in automotive as well Ambrish Srivastava    BMO Capital Markets Corp     AnalystOkay  Thank you  Good luck Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open JiHyung Yoo    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystHi  This is JiHyung for Ross  Thank you for letting me ask the question  It looks like DCG even with some moderating growth in the March quarter looks to be potentially up 20  for the year versus the prior guidance for up 30   So I guess what has changed in DCG growth  Are some of the transitions from customer proof of concept to production actually been moving slower than expected previously Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Look  I mean we re not giving you an overall reassessment of that  But I think  the takeaways  it is still growing double digit  And in fact  when we close out this fiscal year  that d be two consecutive years of double digit  I think in general  it s still a reflection as you said some of these things like proof of concept have taken a bit longer  I think it s also just  we re growing the business  It s an emerging market  it s not quite at scale where you get the usual puts and takes of certain things are maybe a little bit slower than you get other upsides  it s fairly small business so far in an absolute sense  even though it s growing very well  And I think I ve said on a previous call that as we get to higher scale and just more diversity of design wins and different timing of the different programs that we ll see less quarter to quarter volatility  But I do think  for the continued near term  I think the better measure to see is are we sustaining that good double digit kind of growth and the quality of kind of wins that we get  the engagements that we have and on those basis  we still feel very good about the business JiHyung Yoo    Deutsche Bank Securities    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And if we just compare as Xilinx s growth to Intel s PSG business  clearly the company  Xilinx has had some good market share gains in the last calendar year  So  I guess even within the head face of Huawei challenges  so  I guess can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mentioned a few times in my prepared remarks that our core markets  it s a key part of our strategy to continue to accelerate growth in our core market  And if you look at how that played out  I mean  our core markets are growing very solidly  right  And to your point  some of that is share gains  some of it s also TAM expansion  right  Those markets have different types of profiles  if you will  in terms of how quickly things move to market  But even in those markets  we re seeing the transitions of Zynq being very  very strong  RFSoC  a strong interest in some early design and activity that haven t fully played out  just because the time constant tends to be a little bit longer  but it s a key to our business and has been progressing quite well and we do fully expect to continue to take share  but also grow the TAM  right OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America  Your line is open Jamie Zakalik    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  this is Jamie Zakalik on for Vivek  Thanks for letting me ask a question  Is the pace of 5G FPGA replacement similar to the pace that you ve seen in past cycles  And is this replacement limited to the baseband  And then on the radio side  do you see Marvell s Avera business as a direct competitor in the digital front end or is it more a complementary product Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerI guess first  the thing of how to think about is 5G similar to the 4G or what is the level of similarity  And I really must say  I know that there s been a lot of marketing hype around 5G  but I really must say it is a radically more disruptive set of standards and sets of technologies  So I think it is significantly different  which is why we and many other companies have invested so much and are saying how it s going to be changed  once it s fully deployed  how much will it change things from automobiles  the homes  the IoT  it s simply not data and voice  right  which is what 4G is all about  So  I really do think it is meaningfully different even when you cut through some of the marketing buzz  Now  in our side of it  we re also the value we deliver to our customers in 5G is meaningfully different to  meaningfully upgraded  right  A good portion of our products are not just pure FPGAs and our now state of the art FPGAs are so much more powerful than back in the 4G era  So I think on both fronts  the opportunity  the magnitude of disruption is larger  And then what we bring to the table is larger On the competition side  everybody s up their game  There s a lot of people that have been consolidated out  the players left are pretty good at what they do  right  ourselves included  I don t want to get into specifics about a specific competitor  All I would say again is it s not anything new for us to compete with ASIC solutions with ASSP solutions  including ASIC solutions from our own customers  it s not new  It s not easy and we have to create real value  We have to provide excellent support  great quality and those are the things that we ve been doing and that s what we will remain focused on Jamie Zakalik    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  And then a quick follow up  You mentioned one customer  I think that was greater than 10  of sales in Q3  Could you give some details on who that customer was  Was it Huawei  If not  could you give any details on what percent of revenue Huawei was in the quarter  And just confirm that you re still removing Huawei from forward looking guide  Thank you Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So a quick clarification  We don t have any meaningful revenue from Huawei  because they re still on the Entity List  And we had taken Huawei out starting from the last quarter  My comments about Huawei is really about even on a go forward basis  even if they were moved from Entity List  it s pretty clear now given that they remain on the Entity List as long as they have that that revenue will never be at the level that we used to have  So it is definitely not Huawei  but we don t share the details of the specific customer for 10  Jamie Zakalik    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorAnd there are no further questions at this time  I will turn the call back over to Mr  Victor Peng  CEO  for some closing remarks Victor Peng    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Yeah  Look  before we close the end of this call  I just want to share that clearly we re not where we expect to be if we go back to the start of this fiscal year  I think the unprecedented change in US China relations in trade clearly has an impact on the industry and specifically  our business and at a time that s really unfortunate right at the beginning of deployment of 5G  We proactively made some very difficult decisions including the very painful one of doing a targeted reduction in force  But I think that is the appropriate thing to do given a slower  a near term revenue growth trajectory  And I think what that does do is  again position us very well once we get back to a growth trajectory in terms of efficiency in the business and leverage  But I think it s important not to lose sight of the fact that our core markets as we ve discussed a few times  both in prepared remarks as well as in the Q A is very  very solid  It s growing very well on an annual basis  It s a core part of our strategy to accelerate that growth At the same time  Data Center business  while it s an emerging market and still not fully at scale  tend to have some burstiness  Phonetic  from a quarter to quarter basis  it looks like we will achieve double digit growth on an annual basis for two consecutive years and we continue to see greater opportunity there  And even with 5G  we ve talked about that quite a bit  It is important to remember we re still in the relatively early innings on 5G and it started out much stronger and earlier than people predicted  Now  we re having a soft spot  but we re engaged  We have the right kind of engagements with top OEMs and there s still may more innings to come  So  we remain bullish in terms of our overall long term outlook in those growth drivers So with that  thank you for being on the call and turn it back over to Matt Matt Poirier    Senior Vice President  Corporate Development and Investor Relations  and TreasurerSo  thanks for joining us today  We ll have a playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific  8 PM Eastern time today  For a copy of our earnings release  please

93466,314981,XLNX,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday  29th January,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    It s peak earnings season time  with updates due from a cast of thousands including Tesla  Facebook  McDonald s  Boeing and General Electric  They will all struggle to take attention away from Apple  which is set to open at a new record high after posting blowout earnings for its fiscal first quarter late on Tuesday  The coronavirus death toll has now hit 132  but markets are refusing to panic more than they already have done  Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will say later whether he expects any impact on the U S  economy from the outbreak  but the Fed s policy meeting  which winds up today  isn t expected to result in any change to interest rates  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  29th January  
1  Coronavirus death toll hits 132  as disruption to business spreads
The number of deaths from the novel coronavirus reached 132  while the number of confirmed cases hit 6 000  While the virus continues to spread  the relatively low apparent mortality rate  SARS killed nearly 10  of those it infected  has allowed a degree of relief to seep through to financial markets 
However  the dip in economic activity in China and further afield continues to take shape  Toyota suspended production in the country  while Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  said it would close 2 000 branches temporarily  joining McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and KFC owner Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   The U S  and Japan both started evacuating citizens from the country  while British Airways suspended all flights to China 
China s transport ministry said overall trips during the current new year holiday season were down 7 2  on the year   a less dramatic decline than earlier figures had suggested 
2  Apple s blowout earnings
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  stock is expected to open at a new record high after results for the company s first quarter of the current fiscal year came in well ahead of expectations  Strong sales of iPhones and its wireless AirPod earbuds  as well as higher revenue from its app store  all contributed 
Revenue rose 9  to  91 82 billion  also assisted by sales of wearables and streaming subscriptions  The company predicted revenue of  63  67 billion in the current quarter   a wider range than usual due to the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak  Apple has suppliers in Wuhan  where factories have pushed back their scheduled reopening date to Feb  10  according to reports  In addition  the company faces a hit to retail sales in China  where it has cut store opening hours 
The support to the market from Apple s earnings after the bell on Tuesday was slightly undermined by weaker than expected updates from chipmakers Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  and Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  
3  Earnings season hits its peak  with stocks set to open higher 
Earnings season is set to reach its peak  with reports due from   among others    Facebook  Tesla  General Electric  Mastercard  AT T  Boeing  McDonald s  Paypal  Mondelez  ADP   Southern  Anthem  Dow  Marathon  T  Rowe Price  Stanley Black   Decker and Archer Daniels Midland 
For now at least  U S  stock markets are indicated to open higher  supported by the Apple update and by an easing of fears about the coronavirus impact 
By 6 25 AM ET  1125 GMT   Dow 30 futures were up 62 points or 0 2   while S P 500 futures were up 0 3  and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0 4  
European stock markets were all solidly higher  with strong updates from   Banco Santander    MC SAN  and pharma giant Novartis leading the way 
4  Fed seen on hold  comments on repo  virus likely to grab headlines
The Federal Reserve will announce the results of its monetary policy meeting at 2 PM ET  to be followed at 2 30 by Chairman Jerome Powell s press conference 
The meeting is not a  live  one  in the sense that there are no expectations for any change interest rates  Instead  the focus is likely to be on what Powell says about the Fed s balance sheet policy  and whether or when it expects to withdraw repo funding that was initially supposed just to ease the market over the year end period  but which has since seemingly morphed into an unofficial relaunch of quantitative easing 
Powell s comments on the impact of the coronavirus on the economic outlook will also be of interest 
5  GOP senators feel the heat
The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump may turn out not to be the foregone conclusion that everyone expected 
The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had told his colleagues he didn t yet have enough votes to be sure of blocking Democrat demands for witnesses such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton to testify 
Bolton s memoir reportedly contains first hand accounts of Trump candidly explaining that he was withholding military aid to Ukraine   which had been authorized by Congress   pending the announcement of a criminal investigation into his political rivals ",2020-01-29,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-29th-january-2070285,2070285

93468,314983,XLNX,Xilinx  XLNX  Down 2 9  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   Shares have lost about 2 9  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Xilinx due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Xilinx Q2 Earnings Top Estimates  Q3 View DisappointsXilinx delivered second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings of 94 cents per share  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents as well as the prior year quarterly figure of 87 cents Further  revenues rose 12  year over year to  833 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  827 million as well Rebound in datacenter business was a key driver  Additionally  better than anticipated 5G product demand from other global communications OEMs is a tailwind However  the suspension of shipments to Huawei due to the export ban imposed by the U S  government induced weaker than anticipated Wired and Wireless Group  WWG  revenues Management mentioned that in the second half of the fiscal business restrictions  soft demand for communications products and macro related weakness will offset strong overall growth in data center and improvement across the company s core vertical market The impact of Huawei ban and other trade related uncertainties forced the company to provide a downbeat outlook for third quarter fiscal 2020 Nonetheless  the company expects growth revival in the fiscal fourth quarter  backed by a broad customer base that includes TME  aerospace and defense  automotive plus industrial customers  Computational storage and SmartSSD market is likely to remain a key driver Quarter in DetailProduct wise  Advanced product revenues declined 29  year over year  contributing 74  to total revenues  However  the same from core products  26  of total  decreased 19  from the year ago quarter Growing demand for the company s 16 nanometer UltraScale  family has been the key driver  The company is also benefiting from strong demand for its Zynq platform  boosted by the adoption of MPSoC family in wireless and across core vertical markets  Deployment of RFSoC by multiple wireless customers and in other end markets is a positive On the basis of end markets  WWG revenues  38  of total revenues  rose 24  year over year but fell 8  sequentially  Decline in wired business due to shipping restrictions to Huawei and softness of demand from other customers was a dampener Automotive  Broadcast and Consumer group  ABC   16  of total revenues  increased 9  year over year and 6  sequentially  attributable to double digit growth in automotive business  Deterioration in consumer business was a downside A D  Industrial and TME  AIT  revenues  36  of total revenues  rose 7  on a year over year basis  aided by solid growth in A D  Management mentioned that significant decline in TME was an overhang Data Center revenues  10  of total  increased 24  from the year ago period and 92  on a sequential basis  primarily owing to growth in sales to storage customers  Moreover  additional hyper scale customer demand and limited growth from cryptocurrency customers were an upside  Solarflare contributed  5 million to revenues in the fiscal second quarter Geographically  the company registered year over year growth of 29  in Asia Pacific and 12  in North America  While Europe and Japan declined 19  and 8   respectively MarginsGross margin came in at 66 6   down 300 bps year over year  Product and customer mix in AIT and customer mix in DCG were dampeners The company posted non GAAP operating income of  217 million  down 7 9  year over year  However  operating margin contracted 560 bps to 26  Balance Sheet and Cash FlowXilinx exited the fiscal second quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately  2 52 billion compared with  2 88 billion sequentially The company has total long term debt of about  1 25 billion Xilinx generated  224 million of cash from operations compared with  298 million in the earlier reported quarter OutlookOn the earnings call  management mentioned that the company forecasts WWG business to be down significantly in the fiscal third quarter due to removal of revenue expectation from Huawei  While wired is expected to recover in the fiscal fourth quarter  wireless is anticipated to remain bleak  Management expects base band ASIC transition and unexpected program delays with some communication customers to be persistent concerns Management expects Solarflare buyout to contribute  10 million in the December quarter  However  pause in hyper scale customer orders in the fiscal third quarter is likely to dent DCG revenues  Further  macroeconomic headwinds are likely to affect customer demand in both AIT and ABC markets in the fiscal third quarter Xilinx projects revenues in the range of  710  740 million  Gross margin is forecast to be 67 69   Operating expenses are projected to be  339 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 For fiscal 2020  the company expects total revenues between  3 21 billion and  3 28 billion  Non GAAP gross margin is projected in the range of 66 5 68 5   Non GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be around  1 3 billion for the full fiscal

Wong said that while chip stocks will continue to face headwinds  shares of Xilinx  which makes programmable chips known as Field Programmable Gate Arrays  or FPGAs  reflect the cautious outlook in the industry after its recent plunge

The chip company s continued growth in the face of these headwinds was also cited as a supportive factor

 Reuters     Xilinx Inc   O XLNX  on Wednesday forecast current quarter and full year revenue below Wall Street estimates  the second major chipmaker this week to flag the impact of a prolonged U S  China trade dispute on its business 
The company said the forecast takes into account the impact from the U S  government s restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and assumes no revenue from the Chinese telecommunications firm 
Xilinx  which has resumed some sales to Huawei since the ban in May  said the U S  government has not approved its license applications to permit shipping more products to Huawei 
Shares of Xilinx  which makes programmable chips used in data centers  were down nearly 2  in extended trading 
The bleak outlook spooked investors and analysts alike  with  Huawei  finding 35 mentions in Xilinx s post earnings call  as brokerages scrambled to figure out the breadth of what Xilinx Chief Executive Officer Victor Peng described as a  significant impact  
 We really hope that the governments can come to agreement and resolve this structural issue so we can continue to engage with Huawei   Peng said 
On Tuesday  chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc s  O TXN  current quarter revenue forecast also missed Wall Street targets  as it blamed the trade war 
Trade uncertainty is causing some customers to exercise caution in ordering  Peng noted  echoing similar concerns from Texas Instruments a day before 
Xilinx said it expects third quarter revenue of between  710 million and  740 million  well below analysts  average estimate of  844 9 million  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
 We believe that third quarter will be our low point and we expect to see a return to sequential revenue growth in our fourth quarter   the company said 
Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said the tepid forecast takes away any further risks related to Huawei 
Xilinx expects fiscal year 2020 revenue of between  3 21 billion and  3 28 billion  below estimates of  3 4 billion

we don t care about the top line The  screen looks for companies with strong sales and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   as well as a Zacks Style Score of A or B for growth  But that s not

Hasbrois one of the world s biggest toymakers and game manufacturers  Popular and legacy brand names include Monopoly  Play Doh  Nerf  My Little Pony  Mr  Potato Head  and Playskool 
Tariffs Hit Q3 Earnings Hard
The ongoing trade war between the U S  and China has deeply impacted Hasbro s financial performance this quarter  as many retailers delayed or even cancelled toy and game orders for the upcoming holiday season due to the tariff threat 
Both the company s top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In particular  revenue of  1 58 billion was basically flat compared to the prior year  analysts were expecting a 9  gain 
Breaking sales down by segment  Franchise brands slumped 8  and Hasbro gaming fell 17  year over year  One bright spot was the company s Partner brands  up 40  over last year  this strong growth was due to many of Disney s  DIS  properties selling well  like Marvel  Frozen 2  Star Wars  and Descendants 3 
 The threat and enactment of tariffs reduced revenues in the third quarter and increased expenses to deliver product to retail   said CEO Brian Goldner in the company s earnings release 
Analysts have turned bearish on Hasbro  with four cutting estimates in the last 60 days for fiscal 2019 
While earnings are expected to see positive growth for the year  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 69 cents for that same time period from  4 76 to  4 07 per share This sentiment has stretched into 2020  While earnings could continue positive growth  our consensus estimate has dropped 44 cents in the past two months 
HAS is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Shares of the toy retailer have gained only 5 4  since January HAS plunged as much as 18  in the wake of its earnings report compared to the S P 500 s rise of about 11 6  
Bottom Line
Looking ahead  Goldner anticipates that additional tariffs  those scheduled to take effect on December 15  will likely continue to impact retailers  direct import shipments from China  85  of its toys are manufactured in China  even though Hasbro is planning on shifting some production to countries like Vietnam and India  any threat of tariffs will likely continue to weigh on shares

3 Sales   Earnings Growth Winners
We here at Zacks are always talking about the Zacks Rank  which harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions  But that doesn t mean we don t care about the top line 
The  screen looks for companies with strong sales and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   as well as a Zacks Style Score of A or B for growth  But that s not all  because this screen also seeks out effective management via ROE and good liquidity via the current ratio 
That s a lot of parameters  But the stocks that pass the test are strong and stable growth picks  We ve highlighted three below  
Copart 
So how much have shares of online vehicle auctions leader Copart gained so far this year 
50   Can I hear 60   What about 70  
Nope  In the end  shares of this company are up 75  year to date 
That performance is all the more impressive when you consider that the Auction   Valuation Services space is in the Top 7  of the Zacks Industry Rank with an advance of nearly 60   So it takes A LOT to outperform this area in 2019  
CPRT has accomplished this with positive surprises in 13 of the past 15 quarters  Meanwhile  the company is also strengthening its footprint in key international markets  such as the U K  and Germany 
In the fiscal fourth quarter report  its fiscal year ends in July   the company announced earnings per share of 60 cents  The result beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 5  and improved nearly 43  from last year 
Revenue jumped 20 8  to  542 6 million  which also easily topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  507 million 
Since that was its fourth quarter  we can also tell you how it performed for the entire year  Fiscal 2019 earnings of  2 25 beat our consensus by 4 cents and improved from last year s  1 73 
Meanwhile  revenue of  2 billion was inline with expectations and up from  1 8 billion in the previous year 
Over the past two months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending July 2020  has gained 6 4  to  2 67 
In the same time period  expectations for next fiscal year  ending July 2021  are up 6 6  to  2 90  Therefore  analysts currently expect earnings growth of 8 6  for next fiscal year 
CPRT will report again on November 19   
Lululemon 
It s the 21st century  We can t be expected to go to yoga class in some raggy old shorts  What are we barbarians 
And what if we want to grab a coffee or go shopping when we re done downward dogging  What if we re not even going to workout  but just want tolook like we did 
That s where Lululemon first gained attention  They understood that people would shell out tons of money for clothes that they re going to sweat in 
But the athleisure world has become much more than yoga  If you take a look at LULU s website today  you ll also see undergarments  sweaters and winter jackets 
Shares of the company have soared more than 68  so far this year  which dwarfs its industry s gain of around 17   It has put together 10 straight quarters of positive earnings surprises and 15 straight quarters of positive sales surprises 
And it doesn t look to be slowing down   
In its fiscal second quarter release  LULU reported earnings per share of 96 cents  which was more than 35  better than the previous year  That marked a positive surprise of 7 9    
Revenue of  883 4 million was 22  better than last year s  723 5 million and over 4 6  atop the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Total comparable sales increased 15   or 17  on a constant dollar basis 
LULU attributed the solid results to its  Power of Three  growth pillars  which are production innovation  omni guest experience and market expansion 
The company now expects fiscal 2019 earnings between  4 63 and  4 70  compared to the earlier outlook of  4 51 to  4 58  It also raised its outlook for revenue to between  3 8 billion and  3 84 billion  instead of  3 73 billion to  3 77 billion 
As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending in January 2020 is up 2 2  over the past two months  Likewise  analysts have boosted expectations for next fiscal year  ending January 2021  by 1  in that time 
Those advances may not seem like a lot  but next fiscal year s outlook of  5 59 is nearly 18  better than this fiscal year s  4 74 
LULU will report again on December 5 
KeySight Technologies 
Ever since spinning off from Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  back in 2014  KeySight Technologies has been making it look easy

The Electronics   Measuring Instruments industry is in the Top 4  of the of the Zacks Industry Rank with a year to date return of approximately 48   But KEYS has easily outperformed its space by gaining more than 66  in 2019

Analysts have boosted next fiscal year s outlook by 7 5  in that time to  4 90  That number also suggests year over year improvement of nearly 7

93530,315045,XLNX,Xilinx resumes some Huawei sales  but lower forecast sends shares down,news,"By Stephen Nellis and Munsif Vengattil
 Reuters     Xilinx Inc   O XLNX  said it had resumed some sales to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd but forecast current quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates on Wednesday  citing the impact of U S  restrictions on selling to the Chinese telecommunications firm 
The forecast and sent the chipmaker s shares down 5 78  to  125 50 in extended trading  Xilinx makes programmable chips that are used in data centers to speed up tasks like artificial intelligence work  as well as chips that are used in 5G telecommunications base stations 
Company executives did not disclose how much revenue the Xilinx derives from Huawei  but said no single customer accounted for more than 10  of its revenue and that Xilinx has cut its sales expectations for Huawei by more than half 
Chief Executive Victor Peng said that Xilinx stopped all sales to Huawei in May when U S  restrictions took effect  Peng said that during the fiscal first quarter ended June 29  Xilinx determined that some of its products  such as its older  28 nanometer chips and some chips not designed for 5G gear  could legally could be sold to Huawei 
Xilinx resumed shipping those chips and has also applied for licenses with the U S  Commerce Department to resume selling other products to Huawei 
On a conference call  analysts pressed the company on whether Huawei might speed the transition to fully custom chips made by its HiSilicon unit to replace Xilinx s chips  Peng told analysts he did not think that would happen quickly 
 They re certainly not going to give up on 5G   Peng said   They ve architected it in certain ways  That s not something that anybody could just change on a dime  
The company said it expects second quarter revenue of between  800 million and  850 million  below analysts  average estimate of  852 5 million  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
Peng told analysts that the company continues to ship chips to other companies building out networks for 5G  the next generation of wireless data communications  including ZTE  HK 0763  Corp  SZ 000063   which had previously been the target of U S  restrictions but has since had them removed 
Other chipmakers  such as Broadcom Inc  O AVGO   have said they expect other electronics makers to step in and eventually fill in lost Huawei sales  but Peng told Reuters that is less likely to happen in the market for 5G gear 
 Infrastructure is just different  There s not as many people who can do it   Peng told Reuters in an interview   It s a well known fact that the Chinese operators have favored the domestic suppliers  such as Huawei and ZTE  among others 
Flores said that the company was  not reiterating or updating our full year guidance  for the full fiscal 2020 year and that its outlook was  somewhat moderated by trade related concerns   In May  the company said it expected between  3 45 billion and  3 6 billion in revenue  Xilinx it will give more details on its full year forecast in October ",2019-07-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xilinx-resumes-some-huawei-sales-but-lower-forecast-sends-shares-down-1933858,1933858

93535,315050,XLNX,Top Stock Reports For Procter   Gamble  T Mobile   Zoetis ,opinion,"Thursday  August 29  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features updated research reports on 16 major stocks  including Procter   Gamble  PG   T Mobile  TMUS  and Zoetis  ZTS   These research reports have been hand picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Procter   Gamble s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry in the past year  gaining  45 4  vs   25 8   The Zacks analyst thinks that this can be attributed to the company s impressive earnings history  It delivered its 17th straight earnings beat in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  with sales beat in seven of the last eight quarters  
Earnings benefited from its ongoing productivity efforts  while strong organic sales growth backed by higher shipment volumes and favorable price mix boosted the top line  The company also provided upbeat guidance for fiscal 2020  It is gaining from focus on product improvement  packaging and marketing initiatives  and productivity and cost savings plan  
However  adverse foreign currency rates are hurting the company s top and bottom lines  The company expects currency headwinds to hurt its top line in fiscal 2020  Moreover  global economic challenges and stiff competition poses concern 
 You can   
Shares of T Mobile shares have outperformed the Zacks National Wireless industry over the past year  gaining  16 8  vs   5 1   The Zacks analyst likes the fact that T Mobile has cleared most of the regulatory and shareholder approvals for its game changing merger with Sprint  
The New T Mobile will have about 127 million customers and a strong closing balance sheet  and is expected to bring robust competition in the 5G era  T Mobile continues to invest in its network and prepare for nationwide 5G with the aggressive rollout of its 600 MHz spectrum  The wireless carrier has introduced 5G millimeter wave network in six cities including New York and Los Angeles  
However  a highly competitive and saturated U S  wireless market remains a major headwind  Intensifying competition is likely to limit its ability to attract and retain customers and may adversely affect operating results  The company launched several low priced service plans which have enhanced its revenues  but not significantly improved the bottom line 
 You can   
Zoetis s shares have outperformed the Zacks Drugs industry in the past year  gaining  40  vs  21 2   Zoetis  second quarter earnings and sales beat estimates on the back of growth in new parasiticide products  Simparica and Stronghold Plus  and vaccines  a solid dermatology portfolio  and the addition of Abaxis  diagnostics platform  
Livestock product sales returned to growth as well in the second quarter  The Zacks analyst thinks the Abaxis acquisition has strengthened the company s presence in the animal health diagnostics market  Moreover  Zoetis  five year collaboration agreement with Regeneron will further diversify its portfolio  Shares have outperformed the industry in the year so far  
However  growth in the cattle market is expected to be limited in 2019  based on the challenging market conditions for beef and dairy customers  Moreover  growth in the swine market is being impacted by the African swine fever in China

93557,315072,XLNX,Options Traders See Big Earnings Swings From XLNX  FFIV  CTXS ,opinion,"Three companies reporting earnings after the close on July 24  are chipmaker Xilinx  Inc   NASDAQ XLNX   application delivery specialist F5 Networks  Inc   NASDAQ FFIV   and software stock Citrix Systems  Inc  NASDAQ CTXS   There s notable data to discuss out of the options pits for all three  so let s take a closer look at the shares of XLNX  FFIV  and CTXS 
Xilinx Keeps Rallying Into Earnings
XLNX stands out because of its volatile earnings history  posting three straight quarters of double digit percentage moves after earnings  Last quarter  for instance  the shares sold off 17 1  the day after the company reported  Options traders are pricing in another huge move this time  too  expecting a 12  swing for Thursday s session  As for sentiment  there be a slight bearish tilt  since the Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 1 20 ranks in the top quartile of its annual range 
Speaking of that last earnings sell off  the shares have been trying to rally back from that  as they bottomed around the round  100 mark shortly afterward  They were last seen trading up 1 6  at  126 20  which would be their highest close since that quarterly report  Going back further  Xilinx sports a year over year lead of 84 4   though Benchmark this morning began coverage with a tepid  hold  rating based on valuation concerns 
F5 Networks Short Interest Pops
FFIV certainly has been no where close to as volatile as XLNX  but the options market is betting that changes soon  The shares have averaged a post earnings swing of just 3 4  in the past eight quarters  and this time speculators are pricing in a much bigger 7 7  move 
Some seemingly are betting on more downside  since short interest keeps rising  up 14 7  in the last reporting period  It would now take short sellers five days to cover  based on average daily trading volumes  The bearish bias isn t surprising since the stock has dropped 15 8  in the past year  hitting a 52 week low of  131 53 at the end of May  The shares were last seen trading at  145 56  struggling below the 80 day moving average 
CTXS Shares Face Chart Resistance
Finally  CTXS is like FFIV in that it hasn t been particularly volatile after earnings in the past two years  with an average swing of just 2 7  the day after quarterly reports  Yet this time the options market is pricing in a move more than double that of 6 7   Some of these traders may be betting on the move to go the upside  since 2 111 long calls crossed in the past 10 days at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Cboe Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   compared to just 99 puts 
Citrix Systems was last seen trading down 1  at  100 46  The shares are down 7  in the past 12 months and are now facing off with the 200 day moving average  a level that s acted as resistance on multiple occasions in recent months ",2019-07-24,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/options-traders-see-big-earnings-swings-from-xlnx-ffiv-ctxs-stocks-200443647,200443647
93558,315073,XLNX,Xilinx  XLNX  Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates,opinion,"Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 97 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 94 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 74 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 19   A quarter ago  it was expected that this computer chipmaker would post earnings of  0 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  2 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Xilinx  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductors   Programmable Logic industry  posted revenues of  849 63 million for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 11   This compares to year ago revenues of  684 37 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Xilinx shares have added about 49 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Xilinx 
While Xilinx has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Xilinx was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 92 on  856 63 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 91 on  3 50 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Semiconductors   Programmable Logic is currently in the bottom 4  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xilinx-xlnx-q1-earnings-beat-estimates-200444342,200444342

93583,315098,XLNX,China s Huawei restricted from using U S  suppliers,news,"By David Shepardson and Karen Freifeld WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The Trump administration on Thursday officially added China s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to a trade blacklist  immediately enacting restrictions that will make it extremely difficult for the telecom giant to do business with U S  companies   The Commerce Department issued a rule  promised on Wednesday  putting Huawei and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries on its so called Entity List  a move that bans the company from buying parts and components from American firms without U S  government approval  Obtaining such approval will not be easy  The U S  government will review license applications under a  policy of presumption of denial   according to a posting on the Federal Register   The order takes effect immediately  a Commerce Department spokesman said  although it will not be formally published in the Federal Register until Tuesday   Huawei  the world s largest telecommunications equipment maker  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The action comes as the world s two largest economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U S  officials call China s unfair trade practices   In a one two punch  the order came a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U S  companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk  The United States believes Huawei s smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans  allegations the company has repeatedly denied  The Commerce Department first gave notice on Wednesday that it was adding Huawei to the list  Huawei has been  involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States   the order says   As an example  the order cites a criminal case pending against the company in federal court in Brooklyn  New York  over allegations Huawei violated U S  sanctions against Iran  Huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case  It notes that the indictment also accuses Huawei of  deceptive and obstructive acts   Members of Congress and administration officials said the move would make it difficult for Huawei to sell many products because of its dependence on U S  suppliers  COLLATERAL DAMAGE  Washington lawyer Douglas Jacobson  a trade expert  said there would be collateral impact on the U S  companies that sell to Huawei    While the intent is to punish Huawei  ultimately U S  companies are also being penalized   Jacobson said  Analysts cut price targets on several microchip companies  including  Xilinx Inc   NASDAQ XLNX   Shares of Xilinx closed down 7 3 percent  while those of rival chipmaker Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc fell 4 percent  Given the order  the likelihood that Commerce will grant licenses to allow sales is negligible  Jacobson said  Still  history shows the government could offer reprieves  In 2016  Huawei s smaller rival ZTE Corp  HK 0763  was added to the entity list over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re export of U S  items to sanctioned countries   U S  companies were prohibited from selling parts and components to ZTE for about two weeks  before the Commerce Department issued a series of temporary general licenses that allowed the company to continue to do business with U S  suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later  
The saga of ZTE did not end there  In April 2018  the Commerce Department slapped a ban on American companies selling components to ZTE after accusing it of breaking an agreement  leading ZTE to cease major operations until it struck a new deal last summer ",2019-05-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/chinas-huawei-restricted-from-using-us-suppliers-1871137,1871137
93584,315099,XLNX,Dow Stays Positive Amid G20 Jitters,opinion,"Just as last week was all about the Fed  this week will be focused on the G20 meeting in Japan when President Trump and China President Xi will be talking about trade 
	While the market was pretty sure that the Fed would keep its dovish tone and leave the door open for rate cuts later this year  it s much less encouraged that something good will come out of the summit 
	Therefore  the major indices were sluggish to start the week  They all had somewhat positive mornings  but finished the session right around the lows of the day 
	The Dow still managed a positive close  but just barely  It was up 0 03   or about 8 points  to 26 727 54 
	The S P slipped 0 17  to 2945 35  while the NASDAQ was off 0 32  to 8005 70 
	Stocks have enjoyed three straight weeks of gains  which included the S P reaching a new record last Thursday and the Dow coming within 1  of its own milestone 
	So the silver lining of today s sluggish market is that these indices remain in striking distance of new all time highs  With a rate cut expected to be on its way  the Trump Xi meeting that begins on Friday could be a big factor in when those new records are made 
	The bar really isn t that high for the summit  The odds are not in favor of a breakthrough that puts a swift end to the trade conflict  Investors would be content if the two guys had a nice photo op and promised to get back to the bargaining table  They would be thrilled if any additional tariffs were postponed during the talks 
	The market heads into the final week of June with the makings of a strong month  which is a welcomed change after May  The only problem is that we may be in store for a slow week since the G20 meeting won t happen until Friday  So this solid month may end with a yawn   
	Now would be a good time for a couple of those positive trade headlines Today s Portfolio Highlights  Counterstrike  Last week s FOMC meeting has sparked a gold rush  but Jeremy doesn t want to chase the precious metal  Instead  he notes that silver is once again being ignored even though it tends to move along with its flashier counterpart  The editor decided that the right move was taking a 10  allocation in ProShares Ultra Silver ETF  AGQ   The plan is to hold onto this fund for a month or two and enjoy the ride higher should the Fed continue its dovish sentiment  By the way  the editor also added 5  to the portfolio position in former market darling Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   which is challenging its 50 day moving average and seems ready for a breakout  The service now has a total allocation in this programmable devices developer of 14  to 15   Read the complete commentary for more  including a chart on silver Surprise Trader  The Food   Confectionary space is in the top 5  of the Zacks Industry Rank  so Dave is interested in the upcoming report for Simply Good Foods Company  SMPL   This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  consists primarily of nutrition bars  ready to drink shakes  snacks and confectionery products marketed under several brand names including Atkins   It reports before the bell on Tuesday  July 2 when analysts expect year over year earnings growth of 40   The editor added SMPL with a 12 5  allocation  He also decided to sell Synopsys  NASDAQ SNPS  for a 10 4  return in less than a month after this computer software company recently continued its string of positive earnings surprises  Read the complete commentary for more on today s moves TAZR Trader  Splunk  SPLK  is an  18 billion provider of a software platform that collects and indexes data and enables big customers like Home Depot  NYSE HD   Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE   and Coke to harness their  big data  in real time  Kevin eyed the stock last week as a potential buy as it s trading under 8X sales that are still growing at 25  and just busted through the  2 billion annual mark in Q1  New bullish coverage this morning keeps the average Street price target over  150 with BofA ML and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  at  166 recently  Kevin smells a great opportunity here to pick up an innovative and growing name in the lucrative data analytics space at a great price  Therefore  the editor added SPLK on Monday  Read the complete commentary for a detailed look at this new buy  Black Box Trader  All three of the stocks that were sold this week brought profits to the portfolio  The positions that left the service today are

93585,315100,XLNX,Keysight  KEYS  Up 9 6  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Keysight  KEYS   Shares have added about 9 6  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Keysight due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Keysight Surpasses Q2 Earnings   Revenues EstimatesKeysight delivered second quarter fiscal 2019 non GAAP earnings of  1 22 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents  Further  the figure soared from 83 cents reported in the year ago quarter and came higher than management s guided range of 93 99 cents per share Non GAAP revenues increased 9  year over year to  1 093 billion surpassing the higher end of management s guided range of 1 06  1 08 billion  Non GAAP core revenues  excluding the impact of currency and revenues from acquisitions concluded within the last 12 months  increased 12  year over year Meanwhile  GAAP revenues advanced 10  from the year ago quarter to  1 090 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 062 billion Management is optimistic about capitalizing on key growth segments of a number of end markets  The company s focus on launching new solutions for growth markets like 5G  IoT  next generation wireless  high speed datacenters and automotive   energy is a key catalyst Restructuring ActivitiesIn a bid to remove ambiguity in the reporting processes  Keysight removed Services Solutions Group  SSG  as a discrete reportable segment from first quarter fiscal 2019 The financial reporting is now realigned into three segments  namely Ixia Solutions Group  ISG   Electronic Industrial Solutions Group  EISG  and Communications Solutions Group  CSG  Keysight restructured reporting segments as part of its go to market plan  Notably  SSG revenues are reflected in CSG and EISG adjusted according to the respective services delivery The company has provided previously reported figures adjusted accordingly to streamline comparison Quarter in DetailOrders grew 14  year over year to  1 121 billion during the reported quarter  Notably  core orders grew 16  CSG includes commercial communications  CC  and aerospace  defense   government  ADG  end markets  Non GAAP CSG revenues climbed 8  to  676 million CC revenues of  431 million improved year over year on the back of  double digit  growth in orders driven by research and development  R D  solutions related to technologies like 5G  400 Gigabit Ethernet  GbE   and LTE Advanced and Wi Fi testing ADG revenues dipped 1  year over year to  245 million  Higher spending across the United States and China was offset by weakness in international end markets Keysight stated that orders for 5G solutions recorded triple digit growth year over year for the quarter under review  Acquisition of Ixia  in particular  is enabling the company to unveil new offerings in 5G domain  including the latest 5G User Equipment Emulation scalable solution In fact  Keysight boasts of a robust 5G portfolio comprising comprehensive set of test and design solutions enabling telecom companies to accelerate 5G deployment We believe the company s strength in 5G testing and design solutions hold promise  The collaborations to develop of Open RAN 5G network with companies like AT T  NYSE T   Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   to name a few  is likely to enable Keysight in proliferating the 5G space  Alliance with Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Technologies  Inc   a subsidiary of Qualcomm remains noteworthy Moreover  the company teamed up with Nokia  HE NOKIA  to roll out the Open Test Automation Project  OpenTAP  Non GAAP EISG revenues increased 6  to  299 million  primarily owing to strength in automotive  general electronics and next generation parametric tests In the reported quarter  the company witnessed robust R D investments in autonomous driving  electric and hybrid electric vehicles  and connectivity  It is to be noted that Keysight now has four automotive customer centers globally  One in the United States at Detroit  MI  one in Europe at Boeblingen  Germany  and two in Asia at Shanghai  China and Nagoya  Japan ISG reported non GAAP revenues of  118 million  increasing 32  year over year on the back of adoption of network visibility solutions Region wise  non GAAP revenues from Americas advanced 11  from the year ago quarter to  426 million  39  of total revenues   Non GAAP revenues from Asia Pacific surged 13  on a year over year basis to  487 million  45    Non GAAP revenues from Europe declined 4  on a year over year basis to  180 million  16   Margin HighlightsNon GAAP gross margin was 64   expanding 200 bps from the year ago quarter CSG and EISG gross margin of 63 4  and 61 3  expanded 520 and 230 bps  respectively  on a year over year basis  Meanwhile  ISG gross margin contracted 410 bps to 71 5  Non GAAP operating margin expanded 570 bps on a year over year basis to 24 6  Balance Sheet   Cash FlowKeysight ended the reported quarter with cash   cash equivalents of  1 277 billion  up from the previous quarter of  1 098 million As on Apr 30  2019  the company reported total debt  short term plus long term  of  1 79 billion compared with  1 79 billion reported in the previous quarter Cash flow from operations during the quarter came in at  221 million compared with previous quarter s reported figure of  240 million Free cash flow was reported at  192 million compared with previous quarter s figure of  209 million During the reported quarter  the company repurchased approximately 344 000 shares for a total of  30 million Guides WeakFor the third quarter of fiscal 2019  the company expects GAAP revenues to be in the range of  1 018 billion to  1 058 billion  Meanwhile  non GAAP revenues are expected in the range of  1 02  1 06 billion Non GAAP earnings per share are projected in the range of 97 cents to  1 05 per share Notably  the outlook for the third quarter was impacted by Keysight s connection with the Chinese telecom giant  Huawei  This electronic measurement solutions provider was perceived as a  small direct customer  and was anticipated to benefit from 5G technological development with Huawei  The program was focused on technology verification and system program validation Keysight generates significant portion of revenues from outside the United States rendering it susceptible to exchange rate volatility owing to sluggishness in China and trade war  The new trade restrictions are likely to impact revenue growth in the forthcoming quarter 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates 
VGM Scores
Currently  Keysight has a strong Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side  putting it in the middle 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been trending upward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  It comes with little surprise Keysight has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-06-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/keysight-keys-up-96-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200435655,200435655
93586,315101,XLNX,Xilinx  XLNX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27  
Revenues are expected to be  850 54 million  up 24 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 72  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xilinx 
For Xilinx  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 81  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xilinx will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Xilinx would post earnings of  0 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  2 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Xilinx doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xilinx-xlnx-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200440763,200440763

93693,315208,XLNX,Current Market Cycle Appears To Be Topping Out ,opinion,"Summary

The S P 500  SPX  rose by 1 1  last week  up 32 points to 2940
Stronger than expected economic growth propelled stocks higher
Our projection this week is for a small decline in the stock market  followed by a pop to the upside

The stock market posted modest gains last week  as the focus moved from geopolitics to earnings and ultimately pushed stock indexes to new all time highs  as I pointed out in the latest Market Week show 
The majority of companies continue to beat earnings and sales expectations  however  it is notable that they are beating estimates that have been consistently lowered  Just this quarter  32 companies in the S P 500 have guided earnings lower  compared to only 6 who has raised guidance  according to FactSet 
On Wednesday  chipmaker Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  beat expectations for both earnings and revenue but perhaps not by as much as Wall Street had hoped for  as the stock fell by 17   In fact  this appears to have had broader implications as the semiconductor sector  SMH  was down by 3  from that point 
The big economic news though was on Friday when Q1 GDP exceeded expectations with 3 2  annualized growth compared to expectations of 2 0   This was due in part to higher than expected government spending at the state and local levels  In any case  the news pushed stocks higher by 0 5   even as the 10 year notes were also higher 
The stronger growth though creates a quandary for the Federal Reserve who recently paused its path of increasing interest rates due to expectations of slower growth  The central bank will meet this week to discuss its economic outlook 
S P 500  SPX  Daily Chart 
Turning forward  our approach to technical analysis uses market cycles to project price action  While strong upside momentum has carried stocks higher for the better part of this year  we believe this may be starting to wind down 
Our analysis of the S P 500 is for stocks to begin to roll over  within the context of its current intermediate cycle  shown on the chart above  For this week  we see a small blip lower and then a move back to the upside  as a new minor cycle begins 
For the remainder of May and possibly into June  we believe downside risks will increase  based on longer term market cycles  Yet once this correction is over  our call is for another upside move into the latter part of this year  based on the longer term market cycles ",2019-04-28,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-rose-again-last-week-as-the-current-market-cycle-appears-to-be-topping-out-200412043,200412043

Is U S  China Trade Deal a Reality  5 Top Picks
On Apr 17  both The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported that the United States and China are trying hard to reach a deal to end the prolonged trade related conflict by early May  President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could sign the deal later that month or the first week of June 
In this regard  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are likely to reach Beijing in the week of April 29 for the final round of discussion  As a follow up to that procedure  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to come to Washington in the week of May 6  for the last round of negotiations 
Notably  on Apr 4  President Trump had twitted that a trade deal with China is possible in the next four weeks 
Trade War Upsets Economy
Wall Street witnessed extreme volatility throughout 2018 primarily owing to trade related issues  Imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum by President Trump created a ruckus in the global economy  Notably  the Trump administration has already imposed  250 billion tariffs on Chinese goods while China levied  110 billion of retaliatory tariffs on U S  imports   
On Apr 9  the International Monetary Fund reduced the global economic growth forecasts for 2019  The new growth projection is 3 3  compared with 3 5  projected in January and 3 7  forecast in October  For the IMF  the prevailing trade conflict between the United States and China is the key concern for the global economy 
National Security Concerns Dominate Trump s Decision
The Trump administration is gravely concerned about China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier in the fields of high tech sophisticated products  The implementation of tariffs stems from the Trump administration s concern that China is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft 
On Mar 27  Reuters reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including the protection of U S  intellectual properties to resolve the trade disputes  On Apr 4  White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow claimed that China has acknowledged for the first time that the United States has legitimate and genuine concerns about IP theft  forced technology transfer and cyber hacking by Chinese companies 
Other Likely Gains for US  
On Jan 18  Bloomberg reported that China has offered to ramp up imports from the United State in the next six years  Total value of the imports will likely be  1 2 trillion  which will bring down the United States  massive trade deficit with China to zero in 2025  Notably  the United States had a trade deficit of  323 billion with China in 2018 
The U S  Trade Representative s office said that China has provided assurance of importing  a substantial amount  of agricultural  energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States  The Trump administration wants China to lift tariffs on U S  agricultural products or at least shift those to other products  If this happens  the trade deal will allow Trump to portrait it as a win for U S  farmers

93788,315303,XLNX,Xilinx  XLNX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  48 4  
Revenues are expected to be  825 59 million  up 22 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 62  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xilinx 
For Xilinx  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Xilinx will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Xilinx would post earnings of  0 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 92  delivering a surprise of  8 24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Xilinx appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xilinx-xlnx-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407686,200407686

93820,315335,XLNX,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Xilinx  XLNX  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Xilinx currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if XLNX is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this computer chipmaker holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For XLNX  shares are up 1 81  over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductors   Programmable Logic industry is up 1 81  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 74  compares favorably with the industry s 9 74  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Xilinx have risen 45 72   and are up 93 31  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 12 64  and 11 26   respectively 
Investors should also take note of XLNX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  XLNX is averaging 3 070 471 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with XLNX 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost XLNX s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 49 to  3 50 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that XLNX is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Xilinx on your short list ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-xilinx-xlnx-is-a-great-choice-200406868,200406868

93846,315361,XLNX,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Xilinx  XLNX ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   This company  which is in the Zacks Semiconductors   Programmable Logic industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This computer chipmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 12 12  
For the last reported quarter  Xilinx came out with earnings of  0 92 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 85 per share  representing a surprise of 8 24   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 75 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 87 per share  delivering a surprise of 16  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Xilinx lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Xilinx has an Earnings ESP of  3 41  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-03-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-xilinx-xlnx-200402749,200402749

last year  However  the SOX has advanced 16 1  year to date Why Trade Solution is Important for Tech Sector China is the largest trading partner of the United States  A trade spat with the United States resulted in significant slowdown of the Chinese economy  However  a strong Chinese economy will give U S  technology companies a solid boost as China is the largest market for high tech products  Notably  the IMF has identified trade war as the primary factor for a perceived global economic slowdown in 2019 On the other hand  China also plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  In 2018  the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinses imports worth  300 billion in two phases  Most of these products are from the high tech industrial sectors  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it raised prices of high tech equipment and several electronics products Most importantly  the major concern of the Trump administration was the intellectual property theft by Chinese companies in the guise of producing goods for the American tech giants  National security concerns lead to the imposition of tariffs At this juncture  an amicable solution to the U S    China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants  Moreover  clinching a lasting agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for U S  tech behemoths Other Positives for Tech SectorThe technology sector is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation  The last few years witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing  predictive analysis  artificial intelligence  AI   self driving vehicles  digital personal assistants and Internet of Things  IoT   which have set the stage for robust growth  Research firm IDC estimates that worldwide technology spending on IoT will reach  1 2 trillion by 2022 Out Top PicksAt this

fiscal 2019 earnings release on Feb 21  In fact  shares of Keysight have gained 38 8   outperforming the  s rally of 34 9   on a year to date basis The company s impressive price performance can be

benefiting from solid demand of its electronic design and test instrumentation systems  primarily from telecom vendors Keysight boasts of a robust 5G portfolio  The company s 5G product design validation solutions ranging from Layer 1 to 7 enable telecom and semiconductor companies to accelerate their 5G initiatives  Further  the company s 5G network emulation solutions facilitate end to end processes from development to deployment  accelerating the 5G device architecture  The solutions offer cost efficient test techniques with high flexibility and control capabilities  reducing timetomarket Additionally  collaborations with Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM    Xilinx   NASDAQ XLNX   and AT T   NYSE T   are expected to strengthen presence in the 5G network emulation market  Notably  the acquisitions of Ixia  Anite and AT4 Wireless have enriched the company s 5G solutions portfolio We believe intensive infrastructure investments in 5G deployment and positive trial testing results hold promise  In fact  per ResearchAndMarkets data  global 5G market is anticipated to reach  251 billion by 2025  witnessing a CAGR of around 97  from 2020  Based on its portfolio strength  we believe that the company is well poised to gain from this robust growth prospect Apart from strength in 5G domain  Keysight s efforts in other emerging growth markets like Internet of Things  IoT  and high speed data centers  bodes well for the top line  Particularly  management s focus on Automotive and Energy  and Aerospace and Defence domains augur well in the long haul In fact  growth in revenues from Aerospace  Defence and Government end market deserves a special mention  In fiscal 2018  the non GAAP revenues from these domains came in at  972 million  up 14 6  over fiscal 2017  Moreover  estimated higher spending on aerospace and defense globally in 2019 bodes well in this regard Keysight is expected to benefit from the growing proliferation of electronic content in vehicles  momentum in space and satellite applications  and rising adoption of driver assistance systems globally Underlying RisksThe aforementioned points will enable Keysight  currently carrying Zacks Rank  3  Hold   to remain afloat in difficult times  However  stiff competition and leveraged balance sheet remain major concerns Further  Keysight derives a significant proportion of its revenues from outside the

93899,315414,XLNX,5 Top Tech Picks As US   China Head For A Likely Trade Deal ,opinion,On Mar 14  President Donald Trump said that the United States will probably get final information on a possible trade deal with China within the next three or four weeks  A deal between the two largest trading nations of the world will end a year long bitter tariff war between them  Wall Street witnessed severe volatility throughout 2018 primarily owing to trade disputes  The technology sector was the worst sufferer of trade conflict and market volatility However  since the beginning of 2019  positive developments on the trade war front have reinstated a bull run on Wall Street  putting the spotlight  not so surprisingly  on the technology sector yet again  A final solution to the trade dispute will be major boon for the technology sector  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in tech stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential Technology Sector Soaring in 2019    The technology sector carries the highest weightage  20 1   within the 11 sectors of the broad market S P 500 index  Technology stocks suffered a severe setback in 2018 and Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  declined 2 9   The tech laden Nasdaq Composite plunged 3 9  in 2018  However  in 2019  XLK is the best performer of the S P 500  gaining more than 16 7   The Nasdaq Composite is also up a little more than 15  Within the technology sector  the performance of semiconductors is worth mentioning as the industry had a rough 2018  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  was down 2 6  last year  However  the SOX has advanced 16 1  year to date Why Trade Solution is Important for Tech Sector China is the largest trading partner of the United States  A trade spat with the United States resulted in significant slowdown of the Chinese economy  However  a strong Chinese economy will give U S  technology companies a solid boost as China is the largest market for high tech products  Notably  the IMF has identified trade war as the primary factor for a perceived global economic slowdown in 2019 On the other hand  China also plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  In 2018  the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinses imports worth  300 billion in two phases  Most of these products are from the high tech industrial sectors  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it raised prices of high tech equipment and several electronics products Most importantly  the major concern of the Trump administration was the intellectual property theft by Chinese companies in the guise of producing goods for the American tech giants  National security concerns lead to the imposition of tariffs At this juncture  an amicable solution to the U S    China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants  Moreover  clinching a lasting agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for U S  tech behemoths Other Positives for Tech SectorThe technology sector is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation  The last few years witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing  predictive analysis  artificial intelligence  AI   self driving vehicles  digital personal assistants and Internet of Things  IoT   which have set the stage for robust growth  Research firm IDC estimates that worldwide technology spending on IoT will reach  1 2 trillion by 2022 Out Top PicksAt this stage  it will be lucrative to invest in tech stocks to gain from a possible U S    China trade solution  We have been able to narrow down our search to five stocks  which have moved higher and still hold potential provide further

93923,315438,XLNX,Markets Unlikely To Reach New Highs Until China Trade Settled ,opinion,"The broad markets slowed this past week  with the Standard and Poors 500 Index  SPX  closing Friday at 2804  up 19 points for the day  but dead flat for the week  It appears that SPX bounced off resistance around 2817  the highs reached in mid October and early November after the first couple of downdrafts last fall  It will be difficult for the market to make new highs until the trade negotiations with China reach a conclusion  Trading volume on the S P 500 continues to run well below average  but trading volume broke above the 50 day moving average  DMA  on Thursday s decline  It is a nervous market 
The S P 500 volatility index  VIX  closed at 13 5  on Friday  almost precisely at its close the previous Friday  Volatility rose this week as the market weakened but then declined Friday as the market strengthened  This level of volatility is far from calm and complacent  but not really alarming either  It just underscores the cautious nature of this market 
Whereas the S P 500 index solidly broke above its 200 DMA last week  the Russell 2000 Index  RUT  cannot quite make that break higher  This week s trading just tracked sideways along the 200 DMA  The severity of last fall s corrections is evident in RUT s chart with the 50 DMA so far below the 200 DMA  The gap is closing but remains significant 
The NASDAQ Composite index closed Friday at 7595  up 63 points  NASDAQ confirmed last week s break out above its 200 DMA by consistently trading above the 200 DMA all week  Wednesday s weakness bounced off the 200 DMA to recover for a gain and close higher 
My analysis of the market s condition remains the same as the past several weeks  The series of corrections that lasted through December 24th were not based on solid economics  The excellent revenues and earnings reported during this earnings cycle are exceptional  but you wouldn t know it from the broad market averages  The market has recovered significantly  but the China trade negotiations remain the largest worry for market analysts 
My market index iron condor positions are all profiting from this slowly rising and almost sideways market  We now have booked a full year with no losses 
In spite of the overall market being rather sluggish this week  a few stocks continue to make new highs  CYBR  LLY  IBRT  and XLNX all were called away from me this week because the stock price had traded so much higher than I could not roll the calls out for a reasonable credit 
Until we see a definitive resolution of the China trade negotiations  this market will be volatile  Some stocks are trading bullishly in spite of the overall market  Be picky and be cautious ",2019-03-02,Dr. Duke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/treading-water-200394141,200394141

winners However  investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52 week high mark Also  as a stock keeps scaling new highs with time  one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always mean an impending decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted  even if there are no company specific driving forces Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52 week high stocks  trading near the high

93946,315461,XLNX,Profit From Stocks Hitting New Highs ,opinion,"Today  we decided to focus on a powerful concept  buying stocks at new highs 
Some investors don t like to buy stocks reaching new 52 week highs  But if somebody asked you what your best stocks are  it s likely you would name the stocks moving up the most in your portfolio and vice versa 
The most basic idea is that the winners in your portfolio are the ones going up  If a stock is underperforming the market or going down  you ll quickly identify it as one of your worst holdings  With that said  it makes sense that some of these stocks will be reaching new highs along the way 
Don t Be Afraid of New Highs
I know many investors are hesitant to buy stocks making new 52 week highs  But there really isn t any reason to be  Some may worry that they have already missed the mark at that point  or that now it has more room to fall  Still  a stock making a new 52 week high is a  good thing   just as one falling to a new 52 week low is a  bad thing  
On top of that  would the person who doesn t want to buy stocks making new highs be upset if a stock they owned broke out to a new 52 week high  Statistics have also shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs  And aren t these the stocks we all dream about 
Now obviously  the fundamentals need to be there  and you should try to keep an eye on valuations  But if you were in a stock making new highs and cheering it on  it seems odd to be afraid of one doing the same just because you haven t bought it yet 
Think about this  A stock just made a new 52 week high  which is great news  Guess what  Last year it made a new 52 week high as well  And the year before that  And the year before that  Can you imagine all the money you d be leaving on the table if you were afraid of being in stocks every time they made a new high 
Parameters
  Current Price 52 Week High greater than or equal to  80
Stocks that are either at a new 52 week high  or have just hit it and are still trading within 20  of it  or are climbing towards their 52 week high and are within a 20  striking distance 
  Percent Change in Price over 12 Weeks greater than 0
Even though we re looking for stocks trading near their highs  I want to make sure the price momentum over the last 3 months is positive 
  Percent Change in Price over 4 Weeks greater than 0
The same goes for the last month as well 
  Zacks Rank equal to 1
Only Zacks Strong Buys for this one 
  Price Sales Ratio less than or equal to Industry Median
As mentioned before  the P S ratio shows how much you re paying for every  1 of sales the company makes  For this screen  we re requiring the P S ratio to be less than the median P S for its Industry  Note  different industries will have different averages or medians for different items  A P S of 1 is not such a great bargain if the median for its Industry is 0 7  But it s a great find if the Industry s median is 1 5  This parameter lets us focus in on  discounted  valuations germane to their industry  And this allows these stocks to still be considered undervalued even as their stock price continues higher 
  P E  using F1 Estimates  less than or equal to Industry Median
Just like the P S ratio  we re looking for stocks whose P E is below the median for their respective Industry  Including proven valuation metrics when using price momentum screens gives the trader a significant advantage 
  Projected One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to Industry Median
While the P S and P E ratios searched for stocks with valuations below their Industry s median  This item is looking for stocks with projected growth rates above the median for its Industry  In order for a stock to continue to go higher  there needs to be a reason for it to do so  And strong growth of course is an important part of that 
  Current Avg  20 Day Volume greater than Previous Week s Avg  20 Day Volume
This helps find stocks where the volume has increased in the recent week vs  the previous week  Once again  if the price is climbing on increased volume  that shows increased demand or buying coming in  And the more buying demand there is for a stock  the more it should climb 
  All of the above parameters are applied to stocks with a Price greater than or equal to  5 and an Average 20 Day Volume of greater than or equal to 100 000 shares 
  Percent Change in Price over 12 Weeks   Percent Change in Price over 4 Weeks equal to Top   5 
The screen is then narrowed down to produce no more than 5 stocks at a time  The way we re doing it with this item is by combining the percentage price change for both the 12 week and 4 week periods to select the top 5 stocks  Why  If the 12  week   price change is solid  but the 4 week change is relatively weak  that might mean the stock is retreating from its high rather than advancing towards it  On the other hand  if the 12 week gain came largely from just the last 4 weeks worth of gains  while that s impressive  it shows that the trend prior to the most recent period wasn t as robust  This item tries to find the best gainers on both time horizons in an effort to see that momentum carries forward 
There are 5 new stocks coming thru this screen this week  Here are 3 of them 
Spirit AeroSystems Holdings  Inc   SPR 
Canadian Solar Inc   CSIQ 
Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   Inc   XLNX 
Get the rest of the stocks on this list and start looking for the newest companies that fit these criteria  It s easy to do  And it could help you find your next big winner  Start screening for these companies today with a free trial to the Research Wizard  You can do it

featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA    Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD    Xilinx  Inc    NASDAQ XLNX    Inphi Corporation   NYSE IPHI   and Cree  Inc    NASDAQ CREE   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Right NowSemiconductor stocks were flying high until last fall  driven by the likes of Nvidia  Since then  shares of many chip stocks have been hammered on the back of worries about a slowing Chinese economy  among other concerns Last week  Nvidia saw its quarterly revenues sink 24   Despite the downturn  shares of NVDA popped because the company had warned Wall Street of a major slowdown as it deals with declining demand from cryptocurrency miners  which has also impacted firms like Advanced Micro Devices  Looking ahead  Nvidia appears to be heading for a major slowdown in 2019 in the historically cyclical semiconductor industry With that said  the industry will remain highly valuable within the larger tech industry as we head toward an even more digitized world  Therefore  now might be a great time to think about buying semiconductor stocks as valuations become more attractive and secular growth trends remain Today  chips help power everything from video games to data centers  Semiconductor companies are also poised to help drive forward the growth of the Internet of Things  artificial intelligence  autonomous vehicles  and much more These emerging tech trends have created new consumer demand  and the semiconductor makers are delivering  So  let s take a look at three Zacks buy ranked semiconductor stocks right now that have performed rather well as of late 1  Xilinx  Inc Xilinx s Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform is situated to help support the expansion of everything from artificial intelligence and machine vision to databases and data compression  The company s stock price has surged 65  in the last six months and its position in the Semiconductors   Programmable Logic industry  which currently ranks  1 out of the 265 industries in our Zacks system  could help this climb continue   Xilinx posted record third quarter revenue and declared a quarterly cash dividend of  0 36 a share  Looking ahead  the company is projected to see its fiscal Q4 revenues surge roughly 23  from the year ago quarter  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  Plus  the company s bottom line is expected to soar nearly 47  and XLNX has earned a ton of positive earnings estimate revisions for Q4 and beyond  Xilinx is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is trading at 31 8X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates to match its industry s average 2  Inphi CorporationInphi is a leader in high speed data movement interconnects that provides semiconductor components and optical subsystems to networking OEMs  cloud and telecom service providers  and more  Like Xilinx  IPHI stock has surged over 26  in the last six months to outpace its industry s 3  average climb  The Santa Clara  California based company is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that rocks an industry matching PEG ratio of 1 41 Inphi s adjusted first quarter earnings are projected to swing from a loss of  0 05 a share in the prior year quarter to  0 28 per share  which would mark a 660  bottom line expansion  On top of that  the company is expected to see its quarterly revenues surge by 34 7   Long term  Inphi s expected EPS growth rate rests at 18 5   on an annualized basis 3  Cree  Inc Cree is a manufacturer of LEDs and semiconductors that enhance the value of solid state lighting  power and communications products  The company s  SmartCast  platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms  CREE sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has experienced gains of 21 2  in the past three months to top its broader industry s 13  climb Peeking ahead  analysts expect Cree s current fiscal year earnings  which ends in June  to skyrocket 310   That growth is expected to continue to the tune of another 63  in the following year  Current estimates also see Cree s revenue growth in these years reaching 10  and 11   respectively  which means the company might not see the pullback some on Wall Street expect other semiconductors to witness in the near future Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about

	Stocks didn t like hearing that President Trump and President Xi of China wouldn t be meeting before the trade deadline at the beginning of March  which is supposed to signal higher tariffs  And it didn t help that White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said there was still  a pretty sizable distance  between the two countries 
	Nevertheless  trade negotiations pick up again next week as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer make their way to China  And there s always a chance that the upcoming deadline could be extended if progress is being made 
	Trade is back at the front of the market s mind  so the headlines we get out of those meetings next week will have a big say on whether this winning run stretches to 8 weeks  In the meantime  though  the editors used the market s recent hiccups to make some moves  including buying positions at reduced prices or taking double digit profits to play it safe  Take a look at their trades below     Today s Portfolio Highlights

94015,315530,XLNX,Get Explosive Returns With The Filtered Zacks Rank 5 Strategy,opinion,"Zacks Rank  1 stocks outperform the market in good and bad times  With that said  there are over 200 stocks that hold a Zacks Rank  1 at any given time  Therefore  it is extremely helpful to understand how to apply filters to the Zacks Rank in order to narrow the list down to a more manageable and tradable set of stocks  
Today we are going to show investors how to add two relatively simple filters to our Zacks Rank  1 criteria that narrows down the number of stocks and often increases its performance as well 
Parameters
Clearly  there are only three items on this screen  But together  these three filters can result in some impressive returns 
  Zacks Rank equal to 1
Starting with a Zacks Rank  1 is often a strong jumping off point because it boasts an average annual return of over 25  per year over the last 30 years 
    Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0
Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks 
The Zacks Rank looks at earnings estimate revisions for the current year  F1  and the next year  F2   The additional component factors in current quarter  Q1  estimate revisions  The idea is pretty simple 
A company that has experienced downward revisions for the current quarter could soon see longer term negative revisions  Meanwhile  if a company has earned positive earnings revisions for its current quarter  it might signal that more upward revisions could be coming down the road  which would make it an attractive buy  
    Broker Rating Change over 4 Week equal to Top   5
Top 5 stocks with the best average broker rating changes over the last four weeks 
In this screen  we are searching for positive broker rating changes or upgrades over the last four weeks  On top of that  we want to cut down on the number of stocks that come through  So  we configured the screen to select the top 5 stocks with the best broker rating upgrade 
Investors should note that broker ratings typically lean toward the upside  Therefore  our screen makes sure that the brokers are getting more bullish  or at the least not getting less bullish  or even bearish  on the stock 
It is worth noting that the actual broker ratings do not matter as much as the upgrade itself  because stocks with broker rating upgrades have been proven to outperform their counterparts that do not earn positive broker rating changes or downgrades 
Alone  these two items added to the Zacks  1 Rank produce impressive and powerful results 
 
So  for a great and reliable way to trade some of the best Zacks  1 Ranked stocks  try the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 strategy and trade fewer stocks for even bigger returns 
This strategy comes loaded with the Research Wizard and is called bt sow filtered zacks rank5  It can be found in the SoW  Screen of the Week  folder 
Here are three of the five stocks that qualified for the Filtered Zacks Rank5 strategy

94043,315558,XLNX,Here s Why Xilinx  XLNX  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Xilinx currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for XLNX that show why this computer chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For XLNX  shares are up 2 86  over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductors   Programmable Logic industry is up 2 86  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 25 81  compares favorably with the industry s 25 81  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Xilinx have increased 21 92  over the past quarter  and have gained 52 08  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved  0 09  and  5 1   respectively 
Investors should also take note of XLNX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  XLNX is averaging 3 178 299 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with XLNX 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost XLNX s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 29 to  3 41 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that XLNX is a  1  Strong Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Xilinx on your short list ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-xilinx-xlnx-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200379564,200379564

Calix  Inc   CALX   one of our swing trades  continues to do great  popping 20 cents  or 2   to 10 75  on 425 380 shares traded  On Thursday it made a nominal new high at 10 82  which is the highest this stock has been since 2014  That s 4 1 2 year high and it trending beautifully  Although it s been up seven days in a row  it may get some rust here  but if it does consolidate  it could set up a nice consolidation between 10 10 1 4  That would be a buyer for a move up to 12  and near 14  maybe 13 90 
Ciena Corporation  CIEN  is doing great  Look at this move on Thursday  this stock jumped 1 23  or 3 21   to 39 39  on 1 9 million shares  and reached a high of 39 54  That s the highest move for this stock since 2007  a 12 year high  It looks to me like my targets are 41 1 2 and 45  I could be had  we ll see  good momentum 
Clovis Oncology  Inc   CLVS  is looking great  gaining 90 cents  or 3 91 to 23 94  on 2 2 million shares on Thursday  I love this chart  Any stock that comes down and gets implosive on big volume  reverses with five steps up  a step back  it s up four waves up with five underway  or it may be one and two of three of five waves up  At the very least  though  this is a bull flag that  if it takes out the 25 1 2 area  it could see 31 32  This one could really get going  I think I m am going to put a swing on CLVS 
eHealth  Inc   EHTH  is like a rocket ship  running up another 3 29 to 6 41  or 54 61  on 3 4 million shares on Thursday  with a high of 55 42  That was huge volume  It s one of my top picks of the year  Since the end of December  it has gone from 34 to 55  It may be near a peak short term  It looks like it s headed to an area  which is going to be overhead resistance  Right now  there is going to be some resistance at 55  The all time high came in at 63  and change  in 2014  and may very well be the target  Keep stops under Thursday s low for protection at 50 3 4 
First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  swing has an amazing chart  It had a big down trend  formed a long base  retested  popped out  pulled right back  formed a platform  and on Thursday  it ran 2 06  4 43   to 48 60  on 1 9 million shares  reaching a high of 48 86  I think this solar stock is going to lead solar s higher to 55  and 57

94045,315560,XLNX,Top Stock Reports For PayPal  Honeywell   Kraft Heinz ,opinion,"Friday  January 25  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including PayPal  PYPL   Honeywell  HON  and Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
PayPal s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet Software industry in the past year   7 9  vs   4 3    The Zacks analyst thinks PayPal s portfolio strength remains its key growth driver  Venmo s improving monetization efforts and its increasing adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the company s user base  
A rising number of merchants using One Touch and growing availability of Choice are major positives  However  intensifying competition from major players in the finance and payment industry poses a risk to the company s market position  
PayPal continues to suffer from foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rate risks  Further  the antitrust issues in the U K  regarding the company s acquisition of iZettle remain major concerns  Additionally  sale of the company s U S  consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony is expected to continue impacting its top line growth 
 You can   
Shares of Honeywell have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the past six months  losing  11 3  vs  a  14  decline  The company reported better than expected second quarter 2018 results  The company s top line performance improved 6   year over year  organically  
Honeywell believes sturdier demand for its innovative technology solutions will continue to drive the company s segmental revenues in the quarters ahead  The Zacks analyst thinks stronger sales volumes  increased productivity and ongoing commercial effectiveness actions will like drive near term profitability  
The company is currently facing inflationary headwinds across its entire supply chain process  Inflation in logistics  transportation and in certain material prices might continue to weigh over Honeywell s profitability in the upcoming quarters 
 You can   
Kraft Heinz s shares have declined  14 9  over the past three months  underperforming the Zacks Diversified Food industry which is down  7 1  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Kraft Heinz has been benefitting from improved volume mix in almost all segments and consumption growth in the United States  
The company has solid innovation initiatives planned in the foodservice space to fuel growth across all regions  It is also making innovation efforts in its growing e commerce channel  Its well designed saving and productivity efforts are other positives  This is mainly attributable to continued softness in the Canada region  stemming from product discontinuations and higher promotional expenses  
Sales in this region have been falling year over year for three straight quarters now  Moreover  escalating overhead and input costs has been a deterrent to the company s performance  In fact  such costs more than offset growth in organic sales while also impacting overall profitability in the third quarter

94067,315582,XLNX,Xilinx  XLNX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 8  
Revenues are expected to be  770 84 million  up 22 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xilinx 
For Xilinx  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xilinx will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Xilinx would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 87  delivering a surprise of  16  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Xilinx doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xilinx-xlnx-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200376180,200376180

What s Next for Xilinx 
While Xilinx has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Japan s flash manufacturing PMI fell to 50 0 from 52 6  It is the lowest reading since at least August 2016  The silver lining to the disappointing news is that it appeared to bolster demand at the 20 bond auction  which saw the bid cover jump to 4 57x  the most since last summer  After contracting in Q3 18  mostly due to disruptions caused by natural disasters  the recovery in Q4 seemed lackluster  and 2019 is off to a soft start

The ECB meeting is the main focus  After the disappointing flash PMIs  there is more talk about Draghi more formally recognizing that the balance of risks has shifted to the downside  We are still are reluctant to go that far  The ECB has only changed its risk assessment with fresh staff forecasts  A changed risk assessment would also seem to require a policy response  It is not clear that the Executive Board is prepared to do so quite yet  The euro fell every day the ECB met last year except in September  Draghi is expected to be dovish and much seems to have been discounted  As we have suggested  we look for the market s focus to shift from the ECB to the US  where next week the FOMC meets  patient and flexible  i e  not rate hike until at least mid year and no predetermined course  and jobs data at the end of the week that  normalizes  after the large jump in December   We expect the euro to begin recovering from the lower end of its two three month range 
The PMIs were poor  German manufacturing PMI slipped below the boom bust 50 level  49 9 from 51 5   The services PMI rose to 53 1 from 51 8  This allowed the composite to edge higher and at 52 1 is a two month high  France was the opposite  Manufacturing rose improved from 49 7 to 51 2  This was more than offset by the slump in services to 47 5 from 49 0  The composite fell to 47 9  a four year low  Outside of the two largest economies  the Markit survey found output growth slowed to its lowest level since November 2013  Italian figures won t be out until early February  but it plays on fears that the Italian economy may have contracted in Q4 18 after slumping in Q3  For the euro area as a whole  both manufacturing and services fell  and the composite eased to 50 7 from 51 1  the lowest since July 2013  
Growing confidence that Brexit will be delayed from the end of March saw sterling approach  1 31 today after shooting above  1 30 yesterday  News that the government s International Trade Secretary Fox  one of the cabinet s leading Brexiters signaled a potential delay was seen as a sign that Prime Minister May is also moving in that direction  Apparently  Labour and other opposition parties already have done so  While a postponement eases the sense of urgency  some fear it extends the uncertainty  which weighs on the economy 
Norway s central bank left rates steady at 75 bp  Although it signaled it may still raise rates again  as early as March  it recognized the high degree of uncertainty  The market is pricing in one hike for the Norges Bank this year  while policymakers seem to signal two  The next monetary report will be delivered on March 21  Economic forecasts will be updated then  The krone strengthened against the euro to its best level since mid December 
It is the third session that the euro has not risen above  1 14  There are almost 2 bln euros in options at  1 1400  1 1405 that expire today  The euro is holding above this week s low near  1 1335  The low for this month has been about  1 1310  which is where the lower Bollinger Band  two standard deviations for the 20 day average  is found  We had thought last week s high for sterling   1 30  had exhausted the move  but it reached almost  1 3100 yesterday and is consolidating today  Although  1 30 was resistance  it is unlikely to act as much support  There is an option for GBP433 mln struck there that expires today  The euro slipped below GBP0 8700 for the first time since mid November today  and the downside momentum eased  Initial resistance is seen near GBP0 8720

Two votes in the U S  Senate ostensibly that could lead to the end of the partial government shutdown will be held today  The biggest risk is that neither bill passes  There might be some response to the headline  but the failure of both bills would indicate there is not a majority for either  extreme  position and it would point in the direction of a compromise 
Separately  Markit reports its flash PMI readings for the U S  They are expected to be a little softer  The Leading Economic Indicator for December is expected to have slipped by 0 1  after a 0 2  increase in November  The partial government shutdown is shaving U S  growth by a little more than 0 1  a week according to most estimates 
Canada s larger than expected fall in retail sales yesterday   0 9    the largest decline since April fans fears that the economy may have contracted in November  The November GDP will be reported next week  Monthly GDP contracted in September before recovering in October  The U S  dollar is testing yesterday s high near CAD1 3355  which is also the greenback s best level since January 7  The CAD1 3365 area corresponds to a retracement objective and the 20 day moving average  A move above there would target CAD1 3420 CAD1 3450 ",2019-01-24,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/poor-emu-pmi-compounds-ecbs-challenge-200378746,200378746

Notably  investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced  considering the high price level  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52 week high mark However  a stock can maintain the momentum and

of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting 52 week high fail to scale higher despite having potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always mean an imminent decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments

Nutrien Ltd   NYSE NTR   a fairly new issue  is a merger  When we had a swing on it  it worked its way higher  then had a 3 wave  corrective  and broke support  It had a secondary support and trendline and ran right back up  On Tuesday  NTR was up 2 78  or 5   to 56 98  on 3 6 million shares  I think it s going to take out 58 short term  and then 63

94274,315789,XLNX,Xilinx  XLNX  Q4 Earnings  Revenues Beat Estimates  Up Y Y,opinion,California based chipmaker  Xilinx Inc    NASDAQ XLNX    reported better than expected earnings for fourth quarter fiscal 2017  marking its 12th consecutive quarter of earnings beat  Quarterly earnings also marked a significant year over year improvement The company s earnings of 57 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents  The figure also increased 5 6  from the year ago quarter on the back of strong top line growth Xilinx  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   RevenuesXilinx reported fiscal fourth quarter revenues of approximately  609 5 million  up 6 7  year over year  In addition  the figure came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  606 million  The quarter marked the sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth  On a sequential basis  the company s revenues grew roughly 4 1  The robust revenue growth was mainly driven by strong sales of the company s 16nm  20nm  and 28nm products  Notably  all the three products achieved record sales level during the quarter  The company also revealed that majority of the growth was contributed by solid performances in the automotive and test measurement and emulation markets On the basis of End Market  sales at the Communications   Data Center division inched up 1  from the prior year quarter  but declined 3  sequentially  Sales at the Industrial  Aerospace   Defense division increased 14  on a year over year basis and 8  sequentially  Revenues at Broadcast  Consumer   Automotive decreased 4  year over year and 13  sequentially Product wise  revenues from Advanced products increased a whopping 36  year over year and 9  sequentially  driven mainly by strong sales of the 28 nm  20 nm and 16 nm products  On the other hand  as expected  revenues from core products declined 11  from the year ago quarter  However  the figure remained flat sequentially Geographically  on a year over year basis  revenues from North America  Europe and Asia Pacific increased 2   17  and 1   respectively  On the other hand  revenues from Japan declined 7  year over year MarginsGross margin for the quarter expanded 30 basis points  bps  year over year to 69 5  and came in at the higher end of the company s guidance range of 68 70   The year over year improvement in gross margin was mainly driven by favorable end market mix Operating expenses increased 15 2  to  250 2 million  which was  6 million higher than the company s previous forecast  This was so because Xilinx accelerated some 16 nm tape out expenses to extend its technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense  Moreover  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses amounted to 41 1   reflecting a 310 bps year over year increase Operating income declined 2 6  year over year to  164 4 million mainly due to higher operating expenses  In addition  operating margin contracted 270 bps as the benefit from improved gross margin was more than offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues Net income for the quarter came in at  153 4 million as compared with  145 million in the year ago quarter Balance Sheet  Cash Flow   Shareholders  ReturnXilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately  3 32 billion compared with  3 25 billion in the previous quarter  The company has total long term debt  excluding current portion  of about  995 2 million During the quarter  Xilinx generated cash of  306 million from operations and incurred  20 million as capital expenditure  Additionally  the company paid  81 8 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth  108 1 million during the quarter In fiscal 2017  Xilinx generated cash of  934 million from operations and incurred  51 8 million as capital expenditure  Furthermore  the company paid  333 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth  522 million during the fiscal Concurrent with the fiscal fourth quarter results  Xilinx announced that its board of directors has raised the quarterly cash dividend to 35 cents from 33 cents  The raised dividend will be paid on Jun 1 to shareholders of record date as on May 16 GuidanceFor first quarter fiscal 2018  the company expects revenues in a range  600  630 million  mid point  615 million   The mid point of the company s guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  612 08 million Gross margin is anticipated to be between 68  and 70   Operating expenses are likely to be around  242 million  which includes approximately  1 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles  Tax rate is projected to be between 12  and 15  Our TakeKeeping its earnings streak alive for the 12th successive quarter  Xilinx reported better than expected results  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts  Also  the company s top and bottom lines both increased year over year  Its revenue guidance for the fiscal first quarter is also impressive as it is higher than our estimate at the mid point Shares of this California based chipmaker rallied 4  higher in the after hour trade on the back of solid quarterly results and an encouraging guidance  Notably  the stock outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year  In the said period  shares of Xilinx gained 43 4   outperforming 40 4  growth recorded by the Semiconductor Pro Logic Device industry Rising demand for 28 nm  20 nm and 16 nm nodes  driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment  are expected to remain growth drivers  The company s product launches should further aid revenues However  a slowdown in the Chinese economy  along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia Pacific region  could adversely affect Xilinx s near term results  Stiff competition from peers is another material headwind Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Xilinx has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are STMicroelectronics   NYSE STM    Texas Instruments   NASDAQ TXN   and Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ

Last Week s Developments 
Last Friday  the Shanghai Composite increased 0 1  as investors digested a series of economic reports ahead of the release of the third quarter GDP report  Investors awaited GDP data eagerly in order to gain further insight into the state of the economy  Meanwhile  data released on Thursday indicated that both exports and imports declined in September  However  data on inflation was encouraging with producer prices increasing for the first time in almost five years 
The CSI 300 advanced 0 1   gaining 1 6  over last week  The benchmark index rose by 2  over the same period  posting its highest weekly gains for two months  Shares in Hong Kong increased  reducing the highest weekly losses in a month  Encouraging data on producer prices helped the Hang Seng gain 0 9   cutting its weekly loss to 2 6   The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index moved 1 1  higher  reducing its weekly decline loss to 3 3  
Markets and the Economy This Week
The benchmark index declined 0 7  on Monday  suffering its worst loss in three weeks  Monday s decline was largely a result of late session losses in U S  dollar denominated B shares  A fall in the value of the yuan led to these losses  which in turn dampened investor sentiment  The CSI 300 moved 0 8  lower  The Shanghai B share index slumped 6  following concerns over the value of the yuan which sank to a new six year low versus the dollar 
Meanwhile  shares in Hong Kong hovered near their lowest level in around 45 days  Investors remained tentative ahead of a series of economic reports scheduled for release this week  expecting them to provide clearer indications about the health of China s economy  The Hang Seng moved 0 8  lower while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index declined 0 6   All the major sectors suffered declines with services and telecom shares leading the losers 
The Shanghai Composite rebounded on Tuesday  gaining 1 4  after U S  dollar denominated B shares listed in Shanghai firmed after Monday s selloff  Investors switched their attention to the plethora of economic reports scheduled for release this week  Market watchers opined that the B share market was volatile because it was plagued by poor liquidity  Investors were picking up shares on the cheap since Monday s selloff was fuelled by fear and not based on fundamentals 
Shares in Hong Kong posted their largest increase in 45 days  boosted by the rebound in stocks listed on the mainland s exchanges  The Hang Seng gained 1 6   The Hang Seng China Enterprises index advanced 1 9   Another catalyst for an increase in Hong Kong s shares was a spurt in the growth of new loans  China s banks lent 1 22 trillion yuan   181 billion  in September  exceeding expectations and touching their highest level in three months  
The benchmark index ended Wednesday nearly flat following the release of encouraging economic data  Third quarter GDP increased by 6 7  on a year over year basis  consistent with the second quarter s increase  Higher government expenditure and resurgence in the real estate markets helped to negate the impact of sluggish exports  Nearly all the sectors closed nearly unchanged even as infrastructure stocks emerged as the leading gainers 
The CSI 300 gained 0 2   In contrast  shares on Hong Kong declined after positive GDP data failed to boost flagging investor sentiment  The Hang Seng declined 0 4   The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index moved 0 8  lower  An early rally in government owned companies petered out by the end of the day due to profit taking  Nearly all the sectors closed in the red with materials and industrial stocks emerging as the leading losers   
The Shanghai Composite closed nearly unchanged once again on Thursday as investors evaluated the series of economic reports released this week  The CSI 300 increased 0 1   Investors were largely unaffected by the outcome of the final U S  presidential debate  Market watchers took the view that encouraging third quarter GDP data was mostly a result of expansive government stimulus 
Stocks in Hong Kong moved higher after China increased the retail prices of petroleum  This in turn led to a jump in energy shares  The Hang Seng index increased 0 3  while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 0 5

company s 16nm Ultrascale   20nm Ultrascale  and 28nm Zynq products  Moshe Gavrielov  Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer said that  The growth from these products was driven by a broad base of markets such as data center  automotive  test   measurement  wired and wireless communications and space  Furthermore  the company s wireless business rebounded  mainly driven by 4G business in

94319,315834,XLNX,Semiconductor M A  The Best Takeover Targets,opinion,"If you ll indulge me for a second  back in June I predicted that we d see a groundswell of takeover activity in the semiconductor space 
Well  it s happened  In fact  it s turned into a full on tidal wave 
At the time of my initial forecast  roughly  80 billion worth of chip mergers and acquisitions  M A  had been announced for the year  That represented a 100  jump over the same period in 2014 
But a recent flurry of activity has jacked the total even higher  After British based Dialog Semiconductor s  DE DLGS  almost  5 billion deal for Atmel Corp   O ATML   total deal volume now stands at an all time high of  110 billion  according to Bloomberg 
And with two months left in 2015  that total is poised to go higher still 
Here s why the trend is set to continue   along with a shortlist of top takeover targets 
Hunt or Be Hunted
The intensifying pace of M A activity has created a unique dynamic in the chip sector 
 It s buy or be sold   as Alex Lidow  Chief Executive of Efficient Power Conversion Corp   recently told The Wall Street Journal 
Or as I originally said   Deal making always begets more deal making   Why 
Well  at the simplest level  it s the only way to stay competitive in a consolidating industry 
But there are other  more specific factors that drive the urge to merge in the chip sector 
A Smarter Way to Get Connected
Madonna was right when she said we re  living in a material world   But we re also now living in a digital world 
With many more devices  systems  and networks connected  it requires more semiconductor chips  As a result  it means device makers want to simplify their supply chains by purchasing system solutions  not countless discrete chips from multiple parties 
In turn  it s compelling chip companies to acquire complimentary technologies so they can provide those systems solutions 
 Customers more and more want to have fewer suppliers  more value  and pieces that work together   says Jalal Bagherli  CEO of Dialog   Remember  his company recently announced a deal to do just that  
At the same time  chip companies are jockeying for position as the next major growth trend   the Internet of Things  IoT    ramps up 
Chip demand is expected to increase by 30  to  432 billion by 2019  according to PricewaterhouseCoopers  And the main driver of that growth is IoT  including industrial and automotive applications 

Costs Down  Profits Up
Then there s the classic motivation for a merger  to cut costs and increase profits 
Take Skyworks Solutions Inc  s  O SWKS  recent  2 billion offer for PMC Sierra Inc   O PMCS   for example 
In the official press release  Skyworks pitched the deal to its shareholders as a way to cut costs and boost profits  Specifically  management forecast  75 million in annual cost savings and an additional  0 75 in earnings per share 
But what s the biggest asset a company needs to complete a deal  Cash  Right now  cash remains abundant  with almost limitless financing available  too  That provides all the ammunition necessary to keep funding the unprecedented levels of M A activity 
In fact  Morgan Stanley  N MS  analysts estimate the largest chip companies could individually take on as much as  82 billion in financing 
To put that in perspective  Avago Technologies Ltd  s  O AVGO   37 billion acquisition of Broadcom Corp   O BRCM  on May 28 represented the largest tech acquisition in history at the time  So we re talking about enough financing capacity to fund a deal more than twice that size 
Of course  with so many deals already in the books   276 this year alone   the list of available targets keeps shrinking  But that s good news for investors 
Slimmer Pickings  Higher Premiums
Fewer available targets means fierce bidding wars will become commonplace  forcing buyers to pay higher premiums to get deals done 
We re already seeing that play out with PMC Sierra 
At the beginning of October  Skyworks offered  10 50 per share  But last week  Microsemi Corp   O MSCC  submitted a competing bid worth  11 50 per share 
However  I fully expect Skyworks to sweeten its offer to win the bidding war for PMC  Even PMC realizes a higher bid is likely in the offing 
In a statement  the company said   PMC s board of directors believes  after consultation with its financial advisers and outside legal counsel  that the Microsemi proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal  
The original bid from Skyworks represented a 37  premium to PMC s share price  The Microsemi offer bumped that premium to 50   But the final price could push shareholders  payday north of 60  
My point is this  Who doesn t want to own a stock with that much upside potential in the near term 
So what chip companies are prime takeover targets 
The Most Likely Suspects
Here s the list I originally provided in June  based on the names most frequently mentioned by multiple analysts as potential acquisition candidates 
Xilinx Inc  O XLNX 
Maxim Integrated Products Inc  O MXIM 
Cavium Inc   O CAVM 
Lattice Semiconductor Corp   O LSCC 
M A Com Technology Solutions Holdings Inc   O MTSI 
Skyworks Solutions  O SWKS 
Speculation about Maxim and Cavium is picking up  Yet both stocks appear fairly valued  based on the consensus price targets  That suggests the upside is limited 
That being said  I never recommend buying a stock simply for the takeover potential  There need to be other factors  too 
With that in mind  Lattice has the most upside potential  Shares are trading at roughly a 70  discount to the consensus price target  And as a self described leader in smart connectivity solutions  the company s broad end market exposure makes it an attractive acquisition for a suitor s product portfolio
As for the next mega merger  I still think the  15 billion market cap Skyworks is the most likely candidate  given its strong growth  20  plus on both the top and bottom lines   systems solutions  and increasing exposure to the IoT ",2015-10-30,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/semiconductor-m-a:-the-best-takeover-targets-269753,269753
