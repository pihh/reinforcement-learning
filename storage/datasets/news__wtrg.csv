The rate review request will enable the company to make infrastructural investments worth  100 million  specifically toward water treatment and distribution system upgrade  The revised rates will hike monthly water bill to  37 27 from  32 06 for an average residential customer that consumes 3 869 gallons 
Importance of Investments   Rate Raise 
 companies provide24X7 drinking water and wastewater services to industrial  commercial and residential customers  To provide clean and safe water services  it is mandatory for these companies to frequently strengthen and upgrade their infrastructures  Thus  water utilities require constant funding to strengthen aging infrastructures by replacing soiled pipelines  Recently  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  announced the availability of  2 6 billion fund to assist states  tribes and territories with improved drinking water and wastewater infrastructure 
As most water utility companies are regulated  they depend on the commission for rate hikes  To recover investments related to upgrade or installation of the distribution systems  regulated companies file for rate hikes  Also  these hikes enable the companies to undertake further investments 
Investment Plans
The companyaims to invest  8  8 6 billionfrom 2019 through 2023  These spending are expected to improve its earnings by 7 10  per year in the aforesaid period from 2017 levels  A significant chunk of  7 3 billion fund will be directed to strengthen the regulated businesses  The latest rate hike would enable American Water Works to duly make these investments
