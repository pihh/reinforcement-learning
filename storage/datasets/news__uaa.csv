188993,410509,UAA,Buy Under Armour Before North American Growth Turns for the Better,news,"There s no denying it s been a frustrating few years for Under Armour  NYSE UA   NYSE UAA  shareholders  The company has faced more than its fair share of staggering headwinds  a string of sporting goods retailer bankruptcies  sputtering growth from its core North American business  revelations of  and changes to  its toxic male dominated company culture  the more recent surprise resignation of Kevin Plank as CEO  and concerns over the outcome of a years long accounting probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice 
I generally favor buying shares of businesses as they work from a position of strength    winners tend to keep on winning  after all  But with Under Armour stock down around 60  from its late 2015 peak    and off nearly 25  from last year s highs even as the broader markets surged to record levels    I think now might be exactly the time investors should consider opening or adding to a position 

For one  Plank remains Under Armour s executive chairman and  brand chief   And despite his missteps at the helm as CEO  I think the company can still benefit from his vision 
A crucial inflection point
I also believe the perspective of new CEO Patrik Frisk could be exactly what Under Armour needs right now  Formerly Under Armour s chief operating officer    and the architect of a multiyear restructuring plan  which just finished its third year  to reduce costs  improve inventory management  and rightsize the company s infrastructure as it dealt with the slowdown    Frisk is now positioned to spearhead an inflection point in Under Armour s longer term growth trajectory 
During last quarter s conference call  Plank noted   2020 will will be the first year since our transformation began that we will have the ability to put the right resources combined with the scale behind our brand marketing efforts  
Indeed  over the first few weeks of January  we ve seen Under Armour begin to ramp up its newest ad campaign with the tag line  The Only Way Is Through     a fitting assertion considering the company s own persistent struggles 
The accounting probe remains a risk  But Under Armour says it has cooperated with every request from SEC and DOJ officials  It further continues to insist that the practices in question    namely  alleged shifts in recorded revenue to make sales trends appear healthier    were  entirely appropriate   and even commonly used in the broader retail industry 
Meanwhile  Under Armour has still managed to maintain its momentum overseas  international revenue grew a modest 5  year over year last quarter  up 8  at constant currencies  to  368 million  or roughly 26  of total sales 
But the more pressing tailwind for Under Armour stock could come from growth turning positive once again in North America  where sales fell 4  last quarter   This development could be imminent  judging by recent results from competitors like Nike  which just posted 5  quarterly growth in North America last month  and lululemon athletica  which saw domestic sales rise 21  in Q3  followed by an encouraging early release of its holiday quarter s results last week  
The key for investors  then  will be to make sure they re holding Under Armour shares before the benefits of its new brand marketing take hold  and before that North American inflection becomes evident  Once that happens  I see no reason Under Armour can t reclaim its status as a market darling ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pm2qe,2066535
188996,410512,UAA,Consumer discretionary names could see bumpy ride,news,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK  Reuters    A raft of earnings reports from consumer discretionary companies and U S  retail sales data set for the coming week could help investors determine to what extent the coronavirus is hitting consumer demand 
The S P consumer discretionary sector  SPLRCD  has been among the index s best performers this year  gaining about 3 4  and trailing only the technology  SPLRCT   utilities  SPLRCU  and communications services  SPLRCL  sectors 
But discretionary stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if companies warn that the coronavirus outbreak is weighing on their earnings outlook  Coronavirus concerns could also show up in the U S  retail sales report for January  due on Friday 
 It could have an impact on the year  not just the quarter   said Kim Forrest  chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh   People are going to freak out a little bit   you are going to have your retail investor that is going to say they don t want to be in  the sector  anymore because it s not growing  
Analysts expect retail sales to show an increase of 0 3  in January from the previous month  matching the increase seen for December 
Companies expected to report include  Hilton Worldwide   N HLT    Under Armour   N UAA   MGM Resorts  N MGM  and  Expedia  Group  O EXPE   Coronavirus concerns have already weighed on some of these stocks   MGM shares tumbled around 10  in late January after the spreading outbreak shuttered casinos in Macau  But they rebounded more than 2  in the latest week 
In recent weeks KFC licensee Yum China  N YUMC  said it could report an operating loss in the first quarter and take a significant hit to sales and productivity due to the coronavirus outbreak after it was forced to shut nearly a third of its stores in China 
The announcement came on the heels of a similar warning from U S  cafe chain Starbucks  O SBUX   which said it would delay a planned upward revision to its outlook for the year and expected a material but temporary financial hit 
Disruptions to the global supply chain caused by the coronavirus could also pressure consumer names  China accounts for over 10  of global trade in goods excluding energy and intermediate foods  Oxford Economics said in a report 
Some areas  such as capital goods   which are used to produce other goods or services   are likely to be at greater risk  the firm said 
Historically high valuations may also make some stocks in the sector more vulnerable to a pullback  The forward price to earnings ratio for the sector is over 22  approaching levels not seen since June 2009  That compares with its 20 year average of 18 3 and the current 18 5 for the broad S P 500  SPX  
Companies that have expanded their online sales may be better able to weather disruptions  analysts said 






 It may put the leaders in a big lead and the laggards in a bigger lag   said JJ Kinahan  chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago   We are going to continue to see the gap grow  ",2020-02-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/consumer-discretionary-names-could-see-bumpy-ride-2079519,2079519
189015,410531,UAA,4 Reasons Under Armour Will Head Lower in 2020,news,"Under Armour  NYSE UA   NYSE UAA  was once hailed as the  next Nike  NYSE NKE    but the footwear and athletic apparel maker s stock has tumbled nearly 40  over the past five years as its growth decelerated  That s a painful drop  and I think that decline could continue in 2020 for four simple reasons 
1  Competition from Nike and Adidas
Under Armour is struggling to keep pace with Nike and Adidas  OTC ADDY Y  in three key areas  North America  overseas markets  and direct to consumer  DTC  sales 
Under Armour s North American sales fell 4  annually last quarter  marking its fifth consecutive decline in a market that generated 71  of its revenue  Nike and Adidas reported 5  and 16  annual revenue growth in North America  respectively  in their latest quarters 

UA s international sales grew 5  annually last quarter  but that barely offset the weak growth of its North American business  Nike posted double digit sales growth across all its overseas markets last quarter  while Adidas posted double digit sales growth across all its markets except Europe 
UA s DTC sales    which come from its website  apps  and first party stores    fell 1  last quarter  Meanwhile  Nike s DTC revenue rose 17  on a constant currency basis last quarter  led by its 38  growth in digital revenue  Adidas  DTC revenue also grew by the double digits last quarter 
That competition caused Under Armour s double digit revenue growth to drop to the low single digits in 2017 and 2018  and analysts expect just 2  revenue growth in 2019 
2  Two regulatory probes
Last November  the Wall Street Journal reported that Under Armour faced probes from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice regarding inflated revenue figures  The report claims that UA dumped inventories intended for factory stores to off price retailers in the final days of each quarter in 2016 
That alleged move  which wasn t previously disclosed to investors  likely boosted UA s revenue and reduced its inventories at the expense of its gross margins  These probes could result in fines and force UA to restate its revenue over the past three years    which would cause its multi year slowdown to look even worse 
3  Management changes and unclear plans for the future
Under Armour s accounting issues might have been caused by the leadership of three different CFOs between 2016 and 2017  But that s not the only major management change over the past three years 
UA s chief designer Dave Dombrow resigned in early 2016 to work at Nike  UA rehired Dombrow later that year after its infamous  Chef Curry  disaster  but he failed to revive UA s flagship Curry shoes with new designs  UA then hired Kasey Jarvis  the former VP of Product and Design at Black Diamond Equipment  to replace Dombrow in early 2019  Founder and CEO Kevin Plank  who led the company for over two decades  also resigned on Jan  1 and was succeeded by COO Patrik Frisk 

All those management shifts raise troubling questions about UA s future  For now  UA s main strategy for 2020 is to cut costs and improve its gross margin  then invest any excess cash into fresh marketing campaigns  It isn t planning to enter the higher growth athleisure market to challenge companies like Lululemon 
Those listless plans indicate that UA will likely continue to struggle against Nike and Adidas  which are both executing multi year expansions with marketing blitzes and aggressive brick and mortar expansions into urban and overseas markets 
4  The stock s valuation
UA s revenue growth is sluggish  but analysts expect its cost cutting efforts to boost its earnings 26  this year and 41  next year  At first glance  that growth rate seemingly justifies its forward P E ratio of 45 
Yet I think that those forecasts are too optimistic  UA s revenue growth is still decelerating as its core growth engines sputter out  it faces intense competition from two bigger rivals with deeper pockets and clearer marketing strategies  and the ongoing regulatory probes could exacerbate its current problems 
I don t mind paying a premium for a growth stock with a promising business and irons in the fire  But UA doesn t deserve to trade at a high multiple    it deserves to go lower until it can grow its core business again ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd7q9,2052066

The S P 500 index eked out a small win on the first trading day of the week    but Under Armour  NYSE UAA   NYSE UA  shareholders weren t so lucky  By close of trading   A  shares of the sportswear maker s stock dropped nearly 7  in early trading  closing the day down 6 5   while  C  shares of the stock did only a little bit better  falling 5 5  initially before closing the day down 4 7  
You can thank J P  Morgan for all of that 

So what
On Monday  J P  Morgan resumed coverage of Under Armour stock at a level lower than its last reported opinion    in essence  downgrading Under Armour from  overweight  to  neutral  
 We see the cadence of North America revenue second half weighted   warned the analyst    an indication that first half sales will not be great   Wholesale and new full price store openings  will show  sequential improvement   but not enough improvement to offset sales lost from reduced sales of discounted merchandise 
Now what
As a result  the analyst forecasts only 3 8  sales growth for the full fiscal year 2020  nearly a full percentage point    or  240 million    below the growth forecast by most other analysts  Whereas most analysts are forecasting  5 54 billion for Under Armour s sales this year  J P  Morgan thinks  5 3 billion is a more likely number   
The good news  Even with this lower than expected growth for Under Armour  J P  Morgan thinks its shares are worth about  23  Now that the stock has sunk below that price as a result of the analyst s downgrade  it may be worth thinking about buying Under Armour again ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/peg59,2053548
189021,410537,UAA,Why Under Armour Stock Gained 14  in December,news,"What happened
Under Armour  NYSE UAA   NYSE UA  stock outperformed the market last month  rising 14  compared to the 3  increase posted by the S P 500 index  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence 
The rally put shareholders in solidly positive territory for 2019  but the stock s 22  full year gain was still a bit below the S P 500 s 29  improvement   

So what
Under Armour didn t issue any business updates last month  but larger rival Nike  NYSE NKE  did    and that report implied good news for the sports apparel industry  Nike announced accelerating growth in the U S  market  which is a far more important geography for Under Armour  The footwear and athletic apparel leader also described healthy inventory holdings for retailers heading into the holiday shopping season 
Now what
Under Armour s fiscal fourth quarter results will show whether those positive industry trends translated into a faster pace of expansion for the company as it ended 2019  That report is due out in early February  Just as important  the consumer discretionary company s management will announce its 2020 outlook at that time  Investors are hoping that this prediction forecasts a return to growth in the U S  market after more than a year of stubborn declines ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pewlq,2054029
189022,410538,UAA,Does Under Armour s 5 Year Plan Make the Stock a Buy ,news,"Under Armour  NYSE UAA  NYSE UA  shareholders may be either extremely satisfied or sorely disappointed  depending on when they invested  If they invested when shares first came public in 2005  they re up well over 500  and handily beating the market  But if they invested in September 2015  they picked the worst possible time to buy 

UAA data by YCharts
Under Armour is an underdog in athletic apparel compared to the current alpha dog of the space  Nike  which has a market capitalization of  158 billion and over  40 billion in trailing 12 month  TTM  revenue  Under Armour s market cap is under  10 billion with roughly  5 billion in TTM revenue  This picture paints an opportunity for Under Armour  Growing into a company even half the size of Nike would provide today s investor outsize returns 
But investors need to look past simple market cap and revenue comparisons  Under Armour s stock currently trades at almost 90 times trailing earnings  Nike trades at only 35 times earnings for perspective  Now  Under Armour s high valuation could be warranted if the underlying business was performing well  One year ago  the company released its 2023 strategic growth plan  Before buying Under Armour s stock  investors should measure the company s progress toward its stated goals  and whether reaching those goals support the stock s sky high valuation 
Protect the brand
The plan is broken into two priorities  and the first is to  protect  the Under Armour brand  The company rose to prominence on the back of its moisture wicking technology    an innovative product at the time  At this stage in the company s life  protecting its brand means innovating new products to meet what users want from athletic apparel  

In April 2019  Under Armour brought one such innovation to market  UA Rush  which weaves minerals into the fabric  which the company says has an infrared effect  The claim is that as heat is reflected back into the body  blood flow and oxygen circulation improve  thus increasing the wearer s strength and endurance   
Another newer product  introduced in 2018  is Under Armour s HOVR line of connected running shoes  These chip equipped sneakers track your running performance and integrate with the company s popular MapMyRun app  Management is clearly pleased with how these shoes are selling  they ve mentioned them in every earnings call since release   but they are less innovative than UA Rush  Both Nike and adidas have products similar to HOVR  To be sure  it is important to keep up with industry trends  but I wouldn t consider HOVR sneakers as accomplishing the company s innovation priority the same way as UA Rush does   
Under Armour needs more true innovations  One analyst asked about future innovations on the third quarter 2019 earnings call  Management responded that it was  really excited  about its  innovation pipeline  but was light on details  Until those details are clearer  investors should withhold their excitement 
Financial performance
The strategic plan s second priority is to  perform   and Under Armour s management laid out six financial targets it will gauge its performance by  All are important  but its goals for revenue growth  earnings per share  EPS  growth  and annual operating cash flow are the easiest to understand and most indicative of whether progress is being made toward the other three goals  
In 2019 Under Armour hoped to grow revenue in the low  to mid single digits  It will report on the year in mid February  Then from 2020 to 2023  it hopes to grow at a mid  to high single digit compound annual growth rate  CAGR   and a low double digit CAGR after that  The EPS CAGR goal is more aggressive at 40  leading up to 2023  And finally  the company is aiming for annual operating cash flow to be  700 million by 2023  
Since three quarters of fiscal 2019 have already been reported  we can judge this plan against the company s performance up to this point  For the first three quarters of 2019  Under Armour s revenue was up less than 1  compared to 2018 s results for the same period  and operating cash flow was down 14   The company did earn  0 24 per share  and it deserves credit for that EPS turnaround  but underperforming revenue and operating cash flow targets so far puts the plan s future in question  To be fair  investors can expect operating cash flow to improve in the upcoming fourth quarter  as it typically spikes at the end of the year  But Under Armour s revenue typically peaks in the third quarter 

UAA Cash from Operations  Quarterly  data by YCharts
This means that the company underwhelmed in the first year of this five year plan  And it only gets harder from here  It doesn t seem reasonable to expect the company to grow revenue at least mid single digits in 2020  when it likely didn t even muster 1  in 2019   
Is Under Armour a buy 
In light of performance compared to plan so far  I don t believe Under Armour is a buy  In fact  this is what inspired me to sell my shares recently  I love the brand s innovations  and will likely continue using its products  And it could be worth revisiting once Under Armour is meeting or beating its own expectations as double digit revenue growth and 40  EPS CAGR might support a high valuation  But right now  Under Armour isn t getting it done  and I believe there are plenty of other better growth stocks out there  
For example  in the second quarter of Nike s fiscal 2020  it reported adjusted revenue growth of 13  and EPS growth of 35   That revenue growth is what Under Armour is forecasting four years from now  and the EPS growth is more significant since it s a much more profitable company  Not only is it outgrowing Under Armour  but it trades at 29 times forward earnings estimates compared to 45 times estimates for Under Armour  Additionally  Nike stock pays a modest 1  dividend yield  which Under Armour does not ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfh2p,2055078

Cisco  CSCO 
Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  will report results on February 12 after the close of trading  and the stock has been difficult to deal with in recent months  The trade war with China has damaged the company and hurt sales  The chart for Cisco doesn t reveal much  except that the RSI is now trending higher  and it would suggest to me that longer term the stock is likely to start rising again 






Roku  ROKU 
Roku has been trending lower for some time  and the RSI suggests that the trend isn t about to change  The chart appears to be a falling triangle  and I have noted it for some time  The stock has been unable to clear the downtrend on multiple attempts  I think that means that shares fall following results and head lower towards  116 and perhaps  105

NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  has been trending higher and has managed to find some excellent support around  236  I think shares will continue higher towards  268  I believe Intel s results in the datacenter are a good sign for NVIDIA

Donahoe  who has been on Nike s board since 2014  will join the sneaker maker from cloud computing firm ServiceNow Inc  N NOW   where he was CEO for more than four years  Prior to that  he led online retailer eBay  O EBAY  for the seven years through 2015 
Nike s Parker had said last year he would remain CEO and chairman of the footwear maker beyond 2020  with his remarks coming in the midst of a series of executive departures and probes on workplace complaints 
The move comes days after the world s biggest footwear maker shut down its Nike Oregon Project training group  following the recent four year ban of the center s founder and coach Alberto Salazar by the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  
Nike did not give any reason for Parker s exit from the top job  In an interview to CNBC  Parker said the change was unrelated to the Oregon Project or any other issues 
Parker joined Nike as one of its first footwear designers in 1979  and held several roles during his tenure at the company before taking charge as its top boss in 2006 
Credited with creating the popular Nike Air sneakers as well as other pioneering products  Parker  over the past few years  led Nike s shift to selling directly to customers online 
He will become executive chairman and continue to lead Nike s board after Donahoe takes over 
 We like that  Donahoe  comes from technology and that he comes from the digital space and we like that he is a strategist and a leader     things that have made Nike positive have been because of those sort of strengths   Jane Hali   Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said 
Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Donahoe s e commerce experience could help with Nike s online push  while Parker could focus more on product development  one of his key strengths

189086,410602,UAA,Nike  Adidas Call Tariffs  Catastrophic  in Letter to Trump,news," Bloomberg      Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE    Adidas AG  DE ADSGN  and other footwear companies urged President Donald Trump to reconsider his tariffs on shoes made in China  saying the policy would be  catastrophic for our consumers  our companies and the American economy as a whole  
In all  173 companies signed an open letter to the president  dated Monday and posted on the industry trade association s website   On behalf of our hundreds of millions of footwear consumers and hundreds of thousands of employees  we ask that you immediately stop this action to increase their tax burden   the group said 
The protest came as U S  China trade tensions escalate and Trump threatens to impose tariffs as high as 25  on Chinese goods    including all types of footwear  from sneakers to sandals  While the industry has shifted production away from China in recent years because of rising wages  shifting trade policies and a desire to make more goods at home in the U S  and Europe  the Asian country remains a shoe giant 
Adidas  for example  sourced about 18  of its 409 million pairs last year from China    putting it third behind Vietnam  which made 42  of them  and Indonesia at 28   Most production sites are run by independent manufacturing partners 
The German company made 3  of its shoes in Europe and the Americas  where it has set up two new  speed factories  that use robots to churn out high end shoes in a single day rather than rely on the weeks or months needed to shuttle components among different suppliers  Still  the vast majority of Adidas s sneakers  apparel and sports equipment gets made in Asia    and probably will for a long time to come 
Tariffs are an especially touchy subject within the footwear industry because shoe companies already pay some of the highest duties in the U S   thanks to longstanding tariffs that in some cases surpass 30   And this isn t the first time the industry is feeling the impact of Trump s trade policies  The recent pivot toward Vietnam production was in part in anticipation of the Trans Pacific Partnership  which would have allowed duty fee exporting to the U S  Then Trump exited those negotiations 
The U S  shoe industry s trade association  the Footwear Distributors   Retailers of America  estimates that the tariffs would cost U S  customers an additional  7 billion per year  The companies said in their letter that those costs would disproportionately affect working class individuals   Your proposal to add tariffs on all imports from China is asking the American consumer to foot the bill   the letter said   It is time to bring this trade war to an end  
Mnuchin  Ross  Kudlow
The letter was also sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow  It followed last week s list from the U S  Trade Representative s office of about  300 billion worth of products that could see higher import duties  including all types of footwear  Trump will discuss the tariffs with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month 
Trump has repeatedly stated that China would pay the tariffs    something his critics say is misleading or wrong  Earlier this month  Kudlow said that  both sides  will pay 
 As an industry that faces a  3 billion duty bill every year  we can assure you that any increase in the cost of importing shoes has a direct impact on the American footwear consumer   according to the letter 
That sentiment has been echoed around the industry   We don t make enough to absorb that   said Michael Jeppesen  president of global operations for Wolverine World Wide Inc   which also signed the letter   The only way it can is to be passed onto the consumer  
Puma  Skechers
Still  the companies in the letter vary in their reliance on China  Nike  for example  made 26  of its apparel and 26  of its footwear in China in fiscal 2018  German company Puma SE sourced 24  of its products from China  compared with 32  from Vietnam  And while Skechers U S A  Inc  makes around 65  of its goods in China  not all of those products are imported to the U S 
 Under Armour  Inc  NYSE UAA    which also signed the letter  currently gets about 18  of its products from China    down from 46  in 2013  The company s goal is to lower that number to just 7  by 2023

Since its founding in 1996  Under Armour has had an uphill battle to stand out in an industry that stalwarts Nike Inc  N NKE  and Adidas AG  DE ADSGn  have dominated for decades 
Celebrity endorsements and the company s aggressive use of social media and the popularity of its sweat proof apparel have helped  led by the appeal to younger consumers of its partnership with basketball MVP Steph Curry 
While Nike posted a 7  rise in North America revenue in the quarter ended May  sales for Under Armour fell 3  to  816 million  bigger than the 1 6  drop predicted by a consensus of analysts drawn up by brokerage Bernstein 
A Refinitiv consensus taking in forecasts of just three stock analysts had expected a 1 1  decline 
 We see little evidence of a material pick up in the way consumers  and especially women consumers  see Under Armour   said Neil Saunders  managing director at research firm GlobalData 
 With the sports apparel space becoming increasingly crowded  Under Armour needs to carve out a more distinct and edgy position  
The Baltimore based firm said it now expected a slight decline in North America revenue for fiscal 2019 compared with a prior forecast of flat revenue  Still it stuck to its overall growth target on higher demand for shoes and apparel abroad 
The company has been spending more to open stores and improve its online offerings in international markets  These efforts helped Under Armour post growth in its Europe and Asia Pacific markets 
It has seen some success with the launch of products including Curry sneaker  HOVR shoes and Dwayne  The Rock  Johnson s workout line Project Rock  but did not break out sales of particular lines in its main quarterly report 
The company s net loss narrowed to  17 3 million  or 4 cents per share  in the quarter ended June 30 from  95 5 million  or 21 cents per share  a year earlier 
Excluding certain items  Under Armour posted a loss of 3 cents per share  while analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents

Today the equity is trading up 0 6  at  20 87  holding a recent foothold atop the 50 day and 200 day moving averages  also near the site of its November low and mid December bear gap  For reference  a 21  move to the upside would put the athletic apparel specialist around  25 30  past its 52 week high of  24 96 from December 3  Such a move lower would have the stock right at  16 50  the site of its notable multi month low from December 

Under Armour s Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  comes in at 0 59  showing a strong tilt to calls over puts among near term options traders  More telling still  this reading ranks in the lowest annual percentile  showing that such a heavy call skew for options expiring within three months is extremely unusual 
Looking at some of the recent activity from speculators  the weekly 3 1 26 50 strike call saw the largest increase in open interest during the past 10 days  followed by the March 22 50 call and the February 21 call  Anyone who bought to open these contracts would be betting on UAA shares rising in the coming weeks 
Lastly  we d note that most brokerage firms are still bearish on the equity  with 18 of 23 handing out  hold    sell   or  strong sell  recommendations  and the average 12 month price target of  21 04 is right in line with current levels  Some analysts have begun to come around on Under Armour  however  and another strong earnings performance could spark even more bullish attention ",2019-02-12,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/uaa-stock-goes-for-5th-straight-earnings-win-200386632,200386632

189211,410727,UAA,Under Armour  Activision  Nike  Groupon And Cisco Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 11  2018   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes Under Armour   NYSE UAA    Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI    Nike   NYSE NKE    Groupon   NASDAQ GRPN   and Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   Earnings Growth Deceleration DetailsThe picture emerging from the Q4 earnings season is not great  but it is not as bad either as many in the market had feared ahead of the start of this earnings season We knew that the period of very strong growth was now behind us  But the steady negative revisions to earnings estimates for the current and coming quarters have left growth expectations for the first half of 2019 barely in positive territory  This negative revisions trend is a function of uncertainty about global economic growth  with a host of leading companies in different industries citing weakness in China  Europe and elsewhere as the driver of weak guidance We will share the current scorecard and what s on deck this week a little later  but let s first point out the key trends that we have seen from the Q4 results through Friday  February 8th First  growth is decelerating  This isn t a surprise  as we knew already that Q4 growth would be materially below the pace set in the first three quarters of the year Total earnings for the 332 companies that have reported are up  13 4  from the same period last year on  7 2  higher revenues  Earnings and revenue growth for the same cohort of companies had been  24 3  and  9 7  in the preceding earnings season  respectively The growth pace is on track to decelerate even further in the current and coming quarters  as we will show a little later Second  companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus EPS estimates For the 332 index members that have reported results already  67 2  are beating EPS estimates and only 62  are beating revenue estimates  For the same cohort of companies  the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises was 78 6  and 60 8  in the Q3 earnings season  respectively The proportion of these 332 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 46 7   which compares to 50 9  for the same group of companies in the preceding reporting cycle and 12 quarter average of 53 9  The revenue beats percentage is on the weak side relative to historical periods  but the lag on the EPS beats percentage side is particularly noteworthy  The fact is that the Q4 EPS beats percentage is the lowest in more than 3 years With Q4 positive surprises this hard to come by  one would reasonably assume that perhaps estimates had been too high  We know that wasn t the case as estimates for the quarter had fallen the most of any other recent periods Third  estimates for 2019 Q1 and full year 2019 are coming down in a major way  with the Q1 growth rate now in negative territory Negative revisions to 2019 Q1 estimates are along the same lines that we saw ahead of the start of the Q4 earnings season as well  Estimates for full year 2019 have been coming down as well  Estimates were effectively unchanged during the September quarter  but they have been on a consistent downtrend since early October  Many in the market suspect that estimates have further to drop before stabilizing Key Earnings Reports This WeekWe have more than 400 companies coming out with quarterly reports this week  including 63 S P 500 members Tuesday  February 12th  We have 15 index members reporting results on Tuesday  of which 9 will come out before the market s open and the rest after the market s close  There is no shortage of big name reporters today  but Under Armour will be the notable report in the morning session and Activision Blizzard after the market s close  Under Armour shares jumped following the Q3 earnings release on October 30th and even though the stock has since lost ground  it is still up big over the past year  up  57 3  vs   31 3  gain for Nike and  5 1  gain for the S P 500 index Activision Blizzard and other game publishers have been struggling lately  with Epic Games  Fortnight stealing their thunder  While estimates for the December quarter have been stable  the same for full year have been steadily coming down  The stock is down  34  over the past year  lagging its industry s  25 3  decline over the same time period Groupon is another notable company reporting after the close on Tuesday Wednesday  February 6th  We have 21 S P 500 members reporting results on Wednesday  with Cisco as the more prominent company reporting after the market s close  Cisco shares have outperformed the Tech sector as well as the broader market in the last 12 months  with the networking giant up  21 3  vs   4  gain for the Zacks Tech sector  The stock typically responds in a major way to quarterly releases  it was up following the last two quarterly reports Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard as of Feb 8th  2019 We now have Q4 results from 332 S P 500 members that combined account for 78  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 332 index members are up  13 4  from the same period last year on  7 2  higher revenues  with 67 2  beating EPS estimates and 62  beating revenue estimates For Q4 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 332 index members that have reported with estimates for the still to come 168 companies  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  13 7  from the same period last year on  6 2  higher revenues  which would follow the  25 7  earnings growth on  8 5  higher revenues in 2018 Q3 Earnings growth is expected to be in double digits for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy   100 3  growth   Finance   16 1    Construction   21 8   and Transportation   29 3   as the strongest growth  Tech sector earnings are track to decelerate meaningfully in

189242,410758,UAA,Here s What To Expect From Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   saw its stock price pop 0 94  during regular trading Tuesday in a sign that investors might expect big things from the retailer s Q3 financial results  especially after Foot Locker s   NYSE FL   quarterly earnings impressed last week  
Foot Locker stock soared last week after the sports retailer posted better than expected top and bottom line results  The company s comparable store sales also jumped 2 9   Foot Locker benefited from the fact that Nike   NYSE NKE    Adidas   OTC ADDYY    and Under Armour   NYSE UAA   have more selective wholesale businesses these days as they focus on their own direct to consumer sales DKS Q3 Outlook 
Dick s Q3 revenues are projected to fall 3 6  to hit  1 87 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  At the bottom end of the income statement  the company s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 13 3  from the year ago period to reach  0 26 per share 
With that said  we still need to know how likely it is that Dick s will top our quarterly earnings estimate since a beat could help its stock price climb in the near term  Luckily  we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us 
 
The Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Dick s Sporting Goods recent positive earnings estimate revision activity helps the company earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company also sports an Earnings ESP of 7 35   Therefore  investors can consider DKS a firm that could top our quarterly earnings estimate Wednesday  However  we should remember that the retailer s overall Q3 outlook doesn t appear strong 
Dick s Sporting Goods is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results before the market opens on Wednesday

189267,410783,UAA,Is The Rock Partnership Actually Bad For Under Armour  UAA  Stock ,opinion,"Shares of Under Armour   NYSE UAA   climbed 3 57  on Tuesday to close at  23 53 as part of a sustained run of success for the previously struggling sports apparel company  Some of Tuesday s gains seem to stem from news that Dwayne  The Rock  Johnson s new shoes sold out extremely quickly 
Under Armour released The Rock s  Project Rock 1  men s training shoes on Memorial Day  The shoes  which Under Armour called the movie star s first signature sneaker  were released in limited quantities for  120 on UnderArmour com and select UA retailers  The shoes reportedly sold out in 30 minutes    and are currently listed as  Sold Out  on Under Armour s website 
This is not the first time this has happened  Last April  Under Armour rolled out Johnson s  Project Rock Delta  sneakers in a similarly limited release fashion and they  quickly as well   To stop production on a blazing hot product when it s at its height of sales is a very bold business decision   Johnson wrote on Instagram last year   But our game plan here is to create a window of success where the people always win but also establish that the window doesn t stay open forever  
Johnson  who signed with Under Armour in 2016  provided metaphorical reasoning for last year s limited release  But there is a much simpler and somewhat logical business reason behind this tactic  Under Armour planned this limited release to help create buzz a tactic that other footwear players  such as Nike   NYSE NKE   do regularly so investors shouldn t worry that this is a missed opportunity to cash in 
 We believe that the limited availability  and subsequent restocking  is part of the company s plan for managing the franchise to generate buzz and promote a  call to action  and represents a positive for brand equity   Instinet analysts wrote in a note to clients 
The Rock
The question is should Under Armour investors be so excited that Johnson has started to play such a large role in the company s marketing and apparel strategy 
There is no arguing that Johnson  the former World Wrestling Entertainment   NYSE WWE   personality turned movie superstar is widely famous and hugely popular  Johnson currently boasts 107 million Instagram   NASDAQ FB   followers  which rivals Kim Kardashian West s 112 million and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo 128 million as some of the most popular people on the social media platform 
On its face  this a great sign because Under Armour only has 5 5 million followers and its second biggest star  Steph Curry  claims 20 4 million  Therefore  Johnson has the ability to promote the Under Armour brand more than anyone else at the company 
With that said  Johnson is selling shoes that people are meant to lift weights and workout in  at a time when the sportswear industry is moving toward athleisure wear and footwear and apparel that can be worn far away from the gym 
In essence  the success of Johnson s shoes and his other Under Armour apparel helps illuminate a massive problem for the company that aspires to be on the same level as Nike and Adidas   OTC ADDYY    Johnson s workout specific gear is what Under Armour originally became famous for  Meanwhile  Curry s shoes have not lived up to their outsized expectations and Under Armour s presence in the world s most popular sports  soccer  is practically nonexistent at this point 
This hasn t stopped Under Armour from climbing recently  but that is more likely due to how cheap the stock had become  Under Armour is in the midst of a major 2018 restructuring plan in which the company expects to spend between  110 million to  130 million  Tuesday s gains are also part of a much larger and longer Under Armour run  Since November 1 right after UAA reported its first ever quarterly sales decline in Q3 the company s stock price has skyrocketed  crushing the S P 500 and Nike 
With that said  UAA s massive rise has made it look very expensive  Coming into Tuesday  Under Armour was trading at 91 8X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks an all time high  and comes in far above its year long low of 29 1X 
Bottom Line
Under Armour s earnings are projected to sink about 5  year over year in 2018  and one negative revision has kept the stock at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Under Armour is expected to see some earnings momentum next year  with our current estimates calling for adjusted profits to soar about 87  from 2018 s estimated totals as the company works through its restructuring plan 
But  while some may say that any growth is good for investors  take a quick step back to look at the big picture here  Johnson cannot help Under Armour get to the heights that many hoped the company could reach because although he and his movies may have mass appeal  his apparel and shoes are far less marketable to a wide audience 
Johnson s Under Armour successes could even be the start of a bigger overall shift back to the company s roots  which would mean that its days of chasing Nike for market share are all but over

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates  There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower Under Armour  Inc  Price and Consensus
    VGM Scores
Currently  UAA has a strong Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B  The stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side  putting it in the middle 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Based on our scores  the stock is primarily suitable for growth investors while also being suitable for those looking for momentum and to a lesser degree value 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  Notably  UAA has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-03-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/under-armour-uaa-down-95-since-earnings-report-can-it-rebound-200298416,200298416
189297,410813,UAA,Should You Buy Nike  NKE  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Nike   NYSE NKE   dipped marginally on Wednesday ahead of the company s upcoming Q3 earnings report  The sportswear giant s stock is still up 6 8  since the start of the year  but recent executive level turmoil could spell trouble 
Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards and VP Jayme Martin both resigned last week amid a code of conduct related scandal  At this point  there are few details about what specifically happened  but investors should note that CEO Mark Park is now committed to staying in his role  
Aside from the possibility of a scandal and some reorganization at the executive level  Nike also faces real business challenges  Nike posted earnings of  0 46 per share last quarter  which topped our expectations by nearly 18  but marked an 8  downturn from the year ago period  The sportswear company attributed this drop to a decline in gross margin as well as higher selling and administrative expenses 
Nike also currently faces greater domestic competition from the likes of Adidas   OTC ADDYY   and Under Armour   NYSE UAA    along with new shopping habits that forced a slow transition away from brick and mortar retailers such as Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   
Nevertheless  Nike s overall sales climbed 5  last quarter  driven by international expansion  But as most investors know  past performance is no indication of future success 
Latest Outlook
For the soon to be reported quarter  our current consensus estimates are calling for Nike to post revenue of  8 83 billion  which would mark a 4 7  climb  Meanwhile  after a downturn in the previous quarter  Nike s third quarter earnings are projected to plummet 23 5  to hit  0 52 per share 
With that said  the raw top and bottom line projections do not tell the whole story  Investors still need to know a lot more if they are considering buying Nike ahead of Thursday s earnings release 
Earnings ESP Whispers
One thing many investors often consider is if a company is likely to top its earnings estimates as an earnings beat can sometimes lead to positive stock performance in the immediate aftermath of a report  Luckily for investors  we can turn to our Earnings ESP figures to gain a better understanding of Nike s chances to surprise 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Nike is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an Earnings ESP of  1 15   which means earnings estimates have been lower directly ahead of NKE s Q3 results  This means that Nike is a stock that could disappoint investors this week 
Price Performance and Surprise History
With that said  despite Nike s negative ESP figure  the company s history does show that Nike seems like it will do everything in its power to try to meet or top earnings estimates  But do these earnings beats result in at least a short term boost in stock price  Here s a look at the trend NIKE  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   As investors can see  Nike has posted an impressive streak of earnings beats  including an average earnings surprise of 22 48  in the trailing four periods  Nike has also successfully met or surpassed earnings estimates in 20 consecutive quarters  However  a positive earnings surprise has not always resulted in an immediate surge in share prices 
More importantly  shareholders should keep an eye on Nike s sluggishness in North America and growth in key international markets when it reports  Nike is set to report its fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings results after market close on Thursday  March 22

189310,410826,UAA,UAA Vs  NKE  Which Sports Retailer Has The Better Outlook ,opinion,"Shares of Under Armour   NYSE UAA   skyrocketed on Tuesday morning after the company reported better than expected fourth quarter revenues  bouncing back from its abysmal Q3  Now  as investors begin to assess the sports apparel company s prospects for a continued recovery  let s take a look at how UAA stacks up against one of its biggest industry rivals  Nike   NYSE NKE   
Under Armour reported its Q4 and 2017 results before the opening bell today  Nike  which is on a somewhat odd fiscal calendar  reported its second quarter 2018 results on Dec  21  2017  Therefore  Nike s previous quarter does not take into account the full holiday shopping period  On top of that  as most investors know  Nike is a much older and more established brand  while Under Armour is an upstart by comparison 
But investors can still easily compare these two sports apparel firms by looking at some key fundamentals 
Earnings Surprise
Under Armour reported a fourth quarter net loss of  87 9 million  based in part on a one time impact from the new tax law  along with a  36 million loss attributable to its restructuring plan  On an adjusted basis  the company posted break even earnings  falling just short of our Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 01 per share 
Nike posted quarterly earnings of  0 46 per share  which topped our expectations by nearly 18  but marked an 8  year over year downturn  The sportswear giant attributed this drop to a decline in gross margin as well as higher selling and administrative expenses 
Revenues 
Under Armour s quarterly revenues climbed 4 6  from the year ago period  UAA posted Q4 sales of  1 37 billion  which also topped our  1 31 billion consensus estimate 
The company s direct to consumer sales popped 11  to  575 million and accounted for 42  of global revenue in the quarter  This is an encouraging sign for Under Armour  which had relied heavily on wholesale revenue amid a downturn from Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  and traditional retail as a whole 
Footwear sales jumped 9 5  to  246 2 million  which is another hopeful sign for the recently struggling firm as this sector is where it will need to grow in order to compete with Nike and rival Adidas   OTC ADDYY   long term  However  apparel still accounted for nearly 70  of total quarterly sales 
Nike s sales gained 5  year over year to hit  8 55 billion in its most recent quarter  Footwear  which is Nike s dominant category  accounted for roughly 60  of total sales 
Looking Ahead
Under Armour expects its 2018 sales will jump by a low single digit figure  Our current estimates are calling for UAA revenues to hit  5 15 billion  which would mark 4 7  year over year growth  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate projects similar 4 7  earnings growth 
The company also announced a new 2018 restructuring plan that is expected to cost between  110 million and  130 million  Under Armour noted that it hopes this plan will begin to save the company at least  75 million per year starting in 2019 
Nike is projected to see its current quarter sales climb 4 39  to reach  8 80 billion  based on our current estimates  Nike s full year sales are also projected to gain 4 09  year over year to hit  35 76 billion  However  its quarterly earnings are expected to fall by over 20  to  0 54 per share  while its full year EPS is projected to sink nearly 10  
The Winner Is  
Both companies are spending more money as they try to shift more of their business online  Nike is bigger and more established around the world and in vital  valuable categories such as athleisure and footwear  Under Armour has struggled more recently  but the company has a plan to turn things around and just showed that it might be on track to do just that 
Both Nike and Under Armour are currently Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  Outlook here is mixed  but investors should be far from giving up on either of these companies

The athletic footwear focused retailer beat Wall Street expectations for earnings  revenue  and same store sales  Indianapolis based Finish Line saw its Q3 revenues jump 1 8  year over year  driven in part by a 0 8  increase in comps  Finish Line s partnership with Macy s   NYSE M   also proved to be somewhat successful  as sales in that category rose by 2 3

189332,410848,UAA,Bullish Retailers Into 2018  Which Make The List And Why,opinion,"Retailers are lurking under the radar into year end and will likely surge in 2018  The reasoning stems from end of year tax loss selling and a new corporate tax code that will cause a 20  jump in earnings across the board  Many investors are curious why they have not already shot dramatically higher with the tax plan passing  This is because buyers on the tax plan are being met with tax loss sellers  Essentially  investors with losses in retailers  which is most  are taking those losses to cancel out taxes owed on their winners  This is standard practice for smart investors 
The best trade setups for January 2018 are the retailers that are beaten down  I like J C Penney  NYSE JCP  as my top pick  The reason stems from the company report much better than expected earnings last quarter but still being very close to their mult year lows  Add in the benefit from tax reform and J C Penney  JCP  should have as much as 35  upside in the first quarter of 2018  While I do not own any yet  it is at the top of my buy list starting in January when tax loss selling is over  Other interesting plays are Under Armor  NYSE UAA  and Fossil Group  NASDAQ FOSL   The one I would avoid is Sears Holdings  NASDAQ SHLD  because it literally cannot even get any sort of bounce off its mult year lows  I worry there may be major financial trouble for that company regardless of the tax cuts passed ",2017-12-25,Gareth Soloway,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bullish-retailers-into-2018-see-which-make-the-list-and-why-200275637,200275637

189350,410866,UAA,Will Under Armour s  Good Old Days  Ever Return ,opinion,"Welcome to the sixth episode of Full Court Finance  a podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports  business  and the stock market  On this week s episode  we take an in depth look at Under Armour s   NYSE UAA   climb from startup to multibillion dollar sports apparel powerhouse  and why its fortunes changed so quickly 
Shares of Under Armour have fallen off a cliff in 2017  and Kevin Plank s company recently posted its first quarterly sales decline since going public more than a decade ago 
The reasons behind Under Armour s third quarter slump range from shifting domestic shopping habits  to declining sales at sports retailers such as Foot Locker   NYSE FL   and Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    as well as consumers  newfound love for athleisure 
On top of a need to bolster direct to consumer sales and add more non competitive apparel options  it seems that having stars such as Tom Brady and Steph Curry on its roster  and sponsoring college powerhouses like UCLA and Notre Dame  has not been enough to propel Under Armour to the heights many predicted 
Under Armour also faces increased competition from Adidas   OTC ADDYY   in North America  while the company still struggles to compete with Nike   NYSE NKE   in nearly every business segment 
However  the company s recent downturn has forced Under Armour to make some changes that investors should take note of in order to get back on track

189352,410868,UAA,Is Under Armour  UAA  Doomed To Have A Terrible 2018 Too ,opinion,Under Armour  Inc    NYSE UAA    once considered the arch rival of NIKE  Inc    NYSE NKE    has been in a spot of bother for quite some time  The stock  which was trading around  50 in 2015  is now hovering around  15 Neither Stephen Curry s  Curry One  signature shoe nor UA SpeedForm Apollo running shoes have helped the stock to drive performances in 2017  Year to date  the stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 47 7   against the  s gain of 8 1   Under Armour has also been facing issues like sluggish North America business  deteriorating gross margin  higher interest expenses and most importantly decline in the bottom line Let s Have a Closer Introspection Decline in sales in North America has been a major concern for investors in the past few quarters  The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth quarter 2016  Bankruptcies  store closures  decrease in productivity and demand along with change in fashion preference have been the major causes behind the dismal show Further gross margin  a key financial metric in determining a company s basic financial health  has persistently declined in the past few quarters  In third quarter 2017  gross margin contracted 130 basis points to 46 2  following a decline of 190 and 70 basis points in the second and first quarter  respectively  We noted that  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of 2016  gross margin declined 100  70  130 and 320 basis points to 45 9   47 7   47 5  and 44 8   respectively  Decline in gross margin has been primarily due to aggressive inventory management  regional mix and higher promotional costs Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expenses stemming from increased debt levels  In third quarter 2017  the company s interest expenses increased to nearly  9 6 million in comparison with  8 2 million in the prior year quarter  Further  it anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly  35 million in 2017 from  26 4 million in 2016 All these aforementioned headwinds have been major deterrents to the company s bottom line  which has been declining over the past few quarters  In third quarter 2017  Under Armour s earnings fell 24 1  year over year  Following the last quarter results  the company trimmed the sales guidance for 2017  giving another blow to the stock  It now expects net revenues for 2017 to rise in low single digits  down from the earlier estimate of an increase of 9 11  over the 2016 level  This can primarily be attributed to sluggish demand in North America and operational difficulties  The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of 18 20 cents  compared with the earlier estimate of 37 40 cents Stock Surges in December  Here s WhyHowever  as the old saying goes  All s Well That Ends Well   the company has displayed resilience of late  In fact  the stock has shown some signs of recovery lately  which is a big boost before we kick off 2018  Month to date  the company s shares have witnessed a sharp gain of 14 2   outperforming the industry s growth of 5 3   The recent surge can primarily be attributed to industry experts  optimistic view on company s 2018 performance Earlier  management announced a restructuring plan in order to utilize financial resources more efficiently  This will cater to the evolving demands of the changing consumer environment  In sync with this  Under Armour anticipates to incur total estimated pre tax restructuring and related charges of roughly  110  130 million in fiscal 2017  The company incurred  89 million of these charges in the third quarter The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company continues to seek opportunities for increasing global footprint and market share  Though the company generates a major portion of revenues from the North America region  it intends to expand business operations to other parts of the world  in order to mitigate the risks stemming from concentration in one geographic region  In sync with this strategy  the company has opened factory as well as brand stores in Canada and China over the years along with giving franchise licenses in several other countries Further  it has rolled out e commerce platforms in countries like Mexico  Australia  New Zealand and Chile  Another major tool used by Under Armour to broaden base is the development of an International e commerce team  In third quarter 2017  international business surged 35  to  305 million  following an increase of 57  in

Foot Locker stated that same store sales fell 6  year over year  CEO Richard Johnson said that  sales of some recent top styles fell well short of our expectations and impacted this quarter s results  At the same time  we were affected by the limited availability of innovative new products in the market  
 We believe these industry dynamics will persist through 2017   said Johnson   and we expect comparable sales to be down three or four percent over the remainder of the year  
The company was also hurt by a  50 million pre tax litigation charge related to a lawsuit regarding Foot Locker s conversion of former employee s pension plans

189390,410906,UAA,Kevin Durant Slams Under Armour  UAA   Stock Dips 2 5 ,opinion,"Kevin Durant recently spoke negatively about Under Armour   NYSE UAA    and shares of the struggling sports apparel retailer dipped about 2 5  on Tuesday  leaving some investors to wonder whether there is a connection between the NBA superstar s comments and the latest dip in UAA s stock price 
The Golden State Warriors  forward took to the podcast airwaves for a two part question and answer session on   which is part of sports and pop culture website The Ringer  During the interview  Durant touched on an array of topics  but one was very relevant in the world of sports financials 
Simmons asked Durant why Maryland colleges are unable to recruit top local basketball players  And the reigning NBA Finals MVP didn t mince words with his response 
 I think a lot of kids  to be honest  they don t choose Maryland unless they play in like an Under Armour system coming up   Durant told Simmons   Shoe companies have a real big influence on where these kids go  Nobody wants to play in Under Armours  I m sorry  The top kids don t because they all play Nike  
Durant  who grew up in Maryland  was brutally honest  In his opinion  most top young basketball players don t play in Under Armour gear  and many prefer Nike 
But Durant is a Nike athlete  He has his own expensive KD signature shoes  of which Nike is currently selling the tenth generation  More than that  Durant signed a 10 year   300 million deal with Nike in 2014 
He is playing the role of a company man  a company Durant most likely truly values and believes in  Nonetheless  Nike pays Durant more per year than the Golden State Warriors do  so it isn t hard to see why he backs his brand and disparages its competitors 
Let s not forget that Durant s MVP teammate Stephen Curry is the face of Under Armour s basketball leg  if not the whole company  And the two stars are at least cordial enough to share the basketball and the spotlight 
Durant s shoes might help Nike stock  especially heading into the upcoming basketball season  But his comments against Under Armour should hardly have swayed Under Armour investors 
The Maryland based company has taken far greater hits based on real economic and retail realities this year  In fact  Under Armour stock hit a new 52 week low on Tuesday 
Yet  Under Armour s fall is more likely to do with Finish Line s  FINL  massive one day collapse than one of Maryland s most famous sons  off the cuff remarks  also read    
Industry trends  not generalizations about what basketball shoes young players think are cool  determine stock prices  On the same day that Durant s comments made their rounds on the internet  Nike s   NYSE NKE   stock dropped by 1 86   Shares of Adidas  DE ADSGN  AG   OTC ADDYY   also fell by 1 13

189405,410921,UAA,Adidas marketing push an uphill battle against  cool  Nike,news,"By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    Sportswear firm Adidas  DE ADSGn  probably thought it had hit the marketing jackpot when Adidas sponsored Germany beat Adidas sponsored Argentina to win the Adidas sponsored World Cup     But arch rival Nike  N NKE  may have stolen much of its soccer branding thunder with quirky videos  innovative boots and amusing Tweets  not to mention the odd sponsorship coup of its own such as signing up hosts Brazil     Adidas said it had secured  victory on and off the pitch  at the soccer tournament  providing the highest scoring boots and generating 22 percent more discussion on social media than Nike 
But more than half the players displayed Nike s brightly colored shoes and it was one of Nike s new lightweight  Flyknit  boots worn by Germany s Mario Goetze that volleyed in the winning goal      Nike has been eating into its German rival s market share and some branding experts and investors don t believe throwing more cash into marketing will necessarily fix the problem     Instead  Adidas needs to spot and set more trends and create a buzz among fashion and sports mad youngsters      At the moment  Nike is cool  very cool  If you ask a 20 year old  they are not going to pick Adidas right now   said Tammy Smulders  head of marketing consultancy SCB Partners      It is not as easy as just writing a check  They need to be doing more of the viral  underground activities which brings out the cool factor of the brand  
MARKETING SPEND    After recently issuing its third profit warning in a year  Adidas said on Thursday it would boost spending on marketing to about 13 percent of sales in 2014 and to between 13 and 14 percent of sales in 2015      The company also said it would give marketing experts more responsibility and bring them closer to sales and product development staff     Adidas spent 12 4 percent of its 2013 revenue of 14 5 billion euros   19 4 billion  on sales and marketing  up from 12 1 percent in 2012 and already well above Nike  which spent 10 8 percent of sales of  27 8 billion in the year to May 31     Adidas chief Herbert Hainer admitted the company  known for its three stripes logo  was being taken on even on its home turf  But he said second quarter results   including double digit growth in Germany  Britain  Spain and Italy and a 41 percent jump in soccer sales   showed Adidas was fighting back     While Nike can focus on its  swoosh  logo and the  Just do it  slogan it has used since 1988  Adidas has to spread its ad budget across a range of brands such as Reebok  TaylorMade golf and Rockport shoes  as well as its Originals and NEO sports inspired fashion labels      They are fighting fires everywhere  Pouring money into marketing might put out some fires  but they will continue to burn elsewhere   said Ingo Speich  a fund manager at Union Investment which has a 1 2 percent stake in Adidas and has repeatedly criticized management in recent months    
YOUNG CONSUMERS
While Nike has encroached on Adidas s home territory  the German firm has failed to make serious inroads in North America  The U S  firm extended its lead to take a 15 percent global market share in 2013 compared with 10 8 percent for Adidas  according to Euromonitor     Nike has focused on exploiting social media to target young consumers  while Adidas has relied more on official partnerships with the likes of the FIFA World Cup and the National Basketball Association  NBA  
    Nike s animated film  The Last Game   featuring soccer stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar on a quest to save football from the hands of a villainous mastermind  has become one of Facebook s most shared posts ever      Nike is the cheeky challenger doing guerrilla ambush marketing  whereas Adidas follows the more orthodox line   said Andrew Walsh at sports marketing research group Repucom 
    The value of the Nike brand rose 13 percent in 2013 to  17 billion  making it the world s 24th most valuable brand  according to consultancy Interbrand  more than double the value of Adidas on  7 5 billion     Even though Adidas was thought to have forked out about  100 million to FIFA to sponsor the World Cup  two Nike World Cup ads are among the top 10 most shared ad videos so far this year  according to marketing technology company Unruly  No Adidas videos feature in that ranking  though it says its videos published during the tournament made it the most viewed sports brand on YouTube      Quite a lot of people thought Nike was the official sponsor  They manage to get the benefits without as large an upfront investment   said Leah Donlan  marketing lecturer at Manchester Business School    
TOP CLUBS
Adidas has started to replicate Nike s tactics  setting up a  news room  in Rio during the World Cup to generate a stream of social media chatter on its sponsored teams and players  Investment in social media will be a big part of its increased marketing spending and it plans to open similar news rooms in key cities around the world to continue its engagement with fans 
But Nike is also investing  launching an interactive Football app  It is kitting out more of Europe s top clubs  such as Barcelona and Paris St Germain  for the 2014 15 season  even though Adidas is ousting Nike at Manchester United  N MANU  and Italian champions Juventus from next year  Adidas CEO Hainer said the record  1 3 billion shirt deal struck with Manchester United last month   almost three times per year what Nike has been paying the former English champions   and the signing of four of the top six National Basketball Association  NBA  draft players   showed he meant business 
 We have three out of the four biggest symbols in the football club world with Real  Madrid   Bayern  Munich  and ManU  This gives us huge reach   he said  predicting the ManU deal will generate sales of 1 5 billion pounds   2 5 billion  
But not everybody is convinced      The ManU deal is too expensive  It might bring management top line growth and exposure in emerging markets  but means that the expected margin improvement will be delayed   said Stefan Guenter Bauknecht  fund manager at Deutsche Asset   Wealth Management  which holds a 1 4 percent stake in Adidas      The strategy has changed from profitable growth towards building up the top line and the brand image against Nike      Adidas acknowledges it has cut its 2014 target for its operating margin   operating income as a proportion of sales   to between 6 5 and 7 0 percent for 2014  from 8 5 to 9 0 percent  partly due to higher marketing spend 
Nike recorded an operating margin of 13 percent in the fiscal year to May 31 
 We know driving higher levels of profitability is absolutely critical to our long term success  and we will get there  But we will not get there if we are not constantly winning in the marketplace   Hainer said     
TREND SETTING
    Adidas shares  down 39 percent this year after tumbling since last week s profit warning  trade at 16 9 times forward earnings to 22 times for Nike and almost 62 times for fast growing U S  upstart Under Armour Inc  N UA  
The success of Nike s  Flyknit  shoes worn by Goetze   made out of machine knitted fiber rather than stitched together pieces   is just the latest example of the U S  firm s ability to innovate and set trends after its popular wearable  FuelBand  fitness device and  Free  barefoot feel running shoes     The Portland  Oregon based firm has also arguably been quicker than Adidas to respond to booming demand for sportswear from women that has helped drive the rise of yoga specialist Lululemon  O LULU   Adidas says it has run campaigns targeted at women in the United States and China in the last year 
The biggest recent innovation hit Adidas can boast of   which it will now be marketing even harder   is the  Boost  cushioning technology initially developed for running shoes that it is now rolling out to other sports  It expects to sell 8 million pairs of the shoes this year and 15 million in 2015     A Cowen survey of 2 500 U S  consumers published last month showed 43 percent named Nike as their first choice of athletic apparel  compared with just 13 percent for Adidas  6 percent for its Reebok brand  and 14 percent for Under Armour  More than three quarters of respondents saw Nike as a cool brand     Adidas is also struggling to dent Nike s dominance at home despite acquiring golf market leader TaylorMade in 1997 and Reebok in 2006  Euromonitor data showed its U S  market share falling to 5 4 percent in 2013  while Nike grew to 20 2 percent    
DOMINANT POSITION

189406,410922,UAA,Adidas fights to draw top talent to HQ in sleepy Bavarian town,news,"By Emma Thomasson HERZOGENAURACH Germany  Reuters    Adidas  DE ADSGn  needs world class designers  brand experts and technical whizzkids to improve its image against U S  rival Nike  N NKE   but persuading them to move to its headquarters in rural Germany is difficult 
Adidas has been losing market share to the world s biggest sportswear brand Nike  which is seen as far cooler in consumer surveys and is based near the hip U S  city of Portland  Oregon 
Adidas acknowledges it is hard to recruit at its headquarters near the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach  particularly for design  marketing and digital roles  and admits it missed trends in the U S  market  where Under Armour  N UA  has just overtaken it as No  2 behind Nike  Nike s better than expected earnings on Sept  25 underscored its ascendancy 
Adidas is responding by locating some key design roles in the United States at the same time as investing heavily in new facilities at its home base near the historic Bavarian town where Adidas was founded by shoe maker Adi Dassler in 1949 
 We need a lot of that top talent that is cutting edge  Ideally  they are working in the tech industry  in marketing organizations or are coming from top competitors  We need an environment that appeals to them   said Steve Fogarty  who is responsible for employer branding and digital recruiting
 Designers tend to gravitate to very large  international cities like Berlin  Amsterdam  London and it is a bit harder to convince them to move to the center of Germany  
Eric Liedtke  the American who took over as Adidas head of global brands in March  has promoted Paul Gaudio to the role of global creative director and moved him from Herzo to the firm s U S  base in Portland in a bid to turn around its fortunes in the world s biggest market for sporting goods  Close to 1 000 Adidas staff are based in Portland  compared with Nike s 8 500 strong workforce in the area 
Gaudio announced on Wednesday that Adidas will open a small creative studio in New York s Brooklyn district in 2015 to be led by three young footwear designers he has poached from Nike with a mission to explore design direction for the brand 
That will complement existing creative centers in Shanghai  Tokyo and Rio  but the vast majority of the company s hundreds of designers for football  outdoor  Originals fashion  training and running products remain based in Herzo 
Adidas shares are down more than a third this year  most recently suffering from a third profit warning in a year in July that the firm blamed in part on a disappointing performance in North America  particularly from its golf business 
Adidas trades at 17 times expected earnings  at a discount to Nike s 22 5 times and fast growing Under Armour s 58 times 
Despite the new designers in the United States  long serving Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer  himself a native of Bavaria  remains committed to the company s base in a region proud of its strong economy and companies including BMW  Siemens  Audi  Munich Re and Allianz 
About 3 900 of the total Adidas staff of 52 500 work in and around Herzo  about a third of them from outside Germany  and Hainer said last month the company planned to add 100 150 new staff at its headquarters every year 
GLOBAL FOOTWEAR HUB
While Bavaria has a reputation for beer festivals  lederhosen and conservative politics  Nike s home town of Portland is a city of 600 000 that prides itself on its liberal values and environmental awareness  as well as a proliferation of trendy eateries and microbreweries 
Based on a campus in Beaverton  seven miles  11 km  outside Portland  Nike s location in the American northwest also raised questions in its early days in the 1960s  with founder and Oregon native Phil Knight saying everybody originally thought it should be located in New England or the South 
But Portland has since become a magnet for the global footwear industry  helped by the relatively short hop to Asian production hubs and a youthful talent pool  prompting Adidas to move its North America headquarters there from New Jersey in 1993  and drawing U S  brands like Columbia Sportwear and Keen 
Herzo  by contrast  is a town of just 24 000 people set in rolling fields  though many Adidas staff commute from the nearby university town of Erlangen or the city of Nuremberg  known for its walled old town  gingerbread and sausages but not for the most vibrant nightlife or fashion scene 
Nuremberg has an airport with direct flights to many cities in Europe but not further afield and there is no train link to Herzo from Nuremberg or Erlangen  meaning most staff have to commute by car 
Herzo s biggest employer is family owned Schaeffler  which has 9 000 staff in the town  mostly in technical roles producing precision products for the auto and aerospace industry  It is also home to rival sportswear firm Puma  DE PUMG  
Conscious that it was not the best location for a big global consumer brand  Adidas considered leaving Herzo in the 1990s when the company was trying to rebuild its fortunes after flirting with bankruptcy following the death of founder Dassler in 1978 and then his son Horst in 1987 
But when the departure of U S  troops from Germany at the end of the Cold War freed up the military base outside Herzo  local authorities persuaded Adidas to stay  It moved its headquarters to the base in 1998 from an overcrowded office in downtown Herzo and has been expanding the campus ever since 
SAFE BUT DULL
Herzogenaurach mayor German Hacker said surveys showed that foreign inhabitants particularly value the high quality of life and security that the town offers 
 Herzogenaurach is a sheltered and manageable town  That is its charm  but you can get to big towns in 10 15 minutes if you want   he said 
One former employee  who declined to be named because they still work on a contract basis for Adidas  said they left the company because they found living in Bavaria too boring   It is so odd that this company is in the middle of farmland  It doesn t have anything to do with style   the person said 
Adidas recruiting expert Fogarty  who spent three years working in Herzo but moved back to Portland last year  says the vast majority of staff describe working in Germany as an amazing experience once they arrive 
He set up a website to extol the virtues of Herzo  featuring employees from around the world praising the rural running tracks near the office  local beer festivals and the proximity to Alpine ski slopes    
Fogarty  who often has to get up at the crack of dawn in Portland to speak to colleagues nine hours ahead in Herzo  said Adidas does not lose staff due to the location of its base as it is flexible about where people work 
     While our headquarters is technically in Herzo  the opportunity to work in many locations is already here  so why invest in moving the headquarters   he said 
However  the experience of Puma  founded by Adi Dassler s brother Rudolf after the two split a joint business  shows the pitfalls of dispersing key staff 
Puma had based its product management and design team for its lifestyle range in London to be closer to fashion trends  but decided last year to move the division to Herzo as it sought to centralize functions as part of a restructuring program 
Puma is in the process of trying to reaffirm its sporting roots after sales tumbled in recent years  Puma had lost its reputation for sports performance gear by moving too far into the fashion business 
Despite investing in fashion brands like NEO and Originals  Adidas has so far stayed true to its sporting heritage 
Adidas recently announced plans to build two new buildings   with a capacity for 3 600 staff   at its  World of Sports  campus outside Herzo and is about to open a 16 metre high climbing wall in the grounds 
The Adidas campus already features sports fields and stylish buildings including a futuristic low rise  brand center  clad in black glass that opened in 2006 and a marketing and operations office called  Laces  that opened in 2011 and features criss crossing walkways above a light filled atrium 
 You can work in a dull office in the middle of Munich or an awesome office two hours north of Munich   said Christian Dzieia  Adidas director of property development 
An on site fitness center with daily yoga and aerobics classes opened last year as well as a bilingual kindergarten for 110 children and a campus canteen revamped with input from German celebrity chef Holger Stromberg 
 We re hiring a lot of people with a huge passion for sport whose eyes light up when they walk around the campus   said Fogarty 

 You have the best of both worlds  where you can walk onto this international campus with a lot of high tech facilities and then go have lunch in a thousand year old Bavarian village

Its distance from the U S  market and top down structure have contributed to missing trends pioneered by Nike like its  FuelBand  fitness device and  Free  barefoot feel running shoes  as well as being slow to catch on to the  Athleisure  trend that has seen sports leggings becoming the new denim

189430,410946,UAA,Under Armour  UAA  To Report Q2 Earnings  What Lies Ahead  ,opinion,Under Armour  Inc    NYSE UAA   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Aug 1  before the opening bell The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this marketer and distributor of apparel  footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  In the trailing four quarters  the company s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average of 20 8  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 6 cents compared  to earnings of 1 cent reported in the year ago period  Furthermore  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at 42 cents  down nearly 28  from 2016  Notably  the estimates have remained stable in the last 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 075 million for the said quarter  up about 7 4  from the year ago quarter Under Armour forms part of the  sector that is currently placed at bottom 44  of the Zacks classified sectors  9 out of 16   Per the   total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 1 3   while revenues are projected to improve 8   We note that the broader sector has gained 2  in the last three months  underperforming the S P 500 index s growth of 4  What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Under Armour  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Under Armour has an Earnings ESP of  16 67   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 7 cents  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 6 cents  Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP but we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise Factors at PlayWe note that Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expense on account of higher debt level  Evidently  the company s interest expenses increased to nearly  8 million in the first quarter compared with  5 million in the prior year quarter  Further  management anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly  40 million in 2017 from  26 4 million in 2016 Under Armour continues to expect net revenue for 2017 to be nearly  5 4 billion  which represents an increase of 11 12  over the 2016 level  Notably  the company s revenues grew 22  last year Moreover  it expects gross margin to be down slightly year over year due to foreign currency headwinds and better performance of footwear as well as international businesses in the overall mix that has lesser margins in comparison with apparel and North American

189445,410961,UAA,Under Armour  UAA  Stock Soars On Earnings  Here s One Big Problem,opinion,"Shares of Under Armour   NYSE UAA   gained as much as 11  in morning trading Thursday after the sports apparel maker posted better than expected first quarter results on both the top and bottom lines 
Under Armour reported a loss of one cent per share  comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of four cents  The company s quarterly revenue of  1 12 billion was up 7  year over year and also edged out our consensus estimate of  1 11 billion 
The sports brand  known for its sponsorships of top athletes like Steph Curry and Jordan Spieth  saw a nice 12  gain in its accessories unit  thanks in part to strength in its men s training  youth  running  and global football segments  Solid performance in the training  golf  and team sports segments helped Under Armour s apparel division grow by 7  
 Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we re off to a solid start in 2017   said CEO Kevin Plank   By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product  continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence   we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets  
Under Armour was a darling stock for much of 2015  but shares have been steadily declining for more than a year and a half as growth in certain key areas has slowed  The company also suffered when Sports Authority a key retail partner closed all of its stores last year  Heading into today  shares were down more than 30  year to date 
And while investors are clearly rewarding Under Armour for its better than expected results  there s certainly still some cause for concern  In fact  today s report revealed one glaringly obvious red flag  footwear sales are weak 
Footwear revenue grew just 2  to  270 million this quarter  which is shocking compared to the unit s 64  growth in the year ago quarter  Today s report cited  significant strength in basketball sales and the timing of liquidations  for last year s impressive performance  and investors ought to pay close attention to what the company is revealing here 
The significance of Under Armour s basketball division should not be understated  and its growth last year can be almost directly attributed to Steph Curry s rise to stardom  A year ago  Curry was on the cusp of winning his second consecutive MVP award after leading the Golden State Warriors to the best regular season record in NBA history 
The Warriors would go on to blow a 3 1 lead in the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers led by LeBron James  a Nike  NYSE NKE  athlete  Since then  Curry has still played like an All Star  but his stardom has slipped  The Warriors missed out on a chance to be considered the best team of all time  and Steph Curry would have been the unquestionable face of that team 
In an effort to improve their odds at bringing home the title this year  the Warriors signed former MVP Kevin Durant over the offseason  Sure  Curry is still a star  but it s tougher to shine bright when another mega star is right next to you  also read    
And on top of that  several of Curry s shoe debuts have been mocked on the internet  as  sneaker heads  were less than impressed with Under Armour s designs 
Last year we were talking about whether Under Armour and Curry would be the next Nike and Jordan  but now were talking about a measly 2  growth in footwear  Under Armour still has plenty of room to grow  but let s not act like today s report didn t include at least one disappointing line

189450,410966,UAA,Here s Why Adidas  ADDYY  Is A Strong Buy Stock Right Now,opinion,"Investors should always be excited when a historically iconic brand presents a fresh buying opportunity  and that s exactly what we have right now with Adidas   OTC ADDYY    This legendary German athletic apparel maker is besting its competitors  dominating key markets  and soaring to new highs and perhaps you should find out why 
Latest Earnings Performance
Less than two weeks ago  Adidas reported quarterly revenues of  6 04 billion  gaining 19  year over year and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 84 billion  On a currency neutral basis  revenues were up 16  thanks to strong performances from the company s Adidas   18   and Reebok   13   brands 
More importantly  net income from continuing operations climbed 30  to about  484 6 million  and Adidas reiterated its guidance that calls for this category to rise in a range of 18  to 20  throughout the year 
Segment Domination
The most impressive pieces of the company s recent success have been its specific segment results  Breaking it down geographically  Adidas sales rose 31  in North America and 30  in China  significantly outpacing the growth posted by top competitor Nike   NYSE NKE   in those regions 
The story here is two fold  For one  Adidas did well in China  which will continue to be a major growth market for both Adidas and Nike  Furthermore  it bested its rival s growth rates in North America  Nike s home territory 
Adidas is benefitting from a massive ad push in the region  which was timed perfectly with a trend toward the retro styles the brand already masters  as well as a shift away from basketball shoes that has hurt Nike and Under Armour   NYSE UAA   
Adidas also saw its e commerce sales gain 53  in the quarter an impressive feat for a company that could have been hurt by the continued slump at brick and mortar stores around the world  Earlier this year  Adidas said it was doubling its online sales target for 2020 to 4 billion euros 
Estimate Revision Activity
Of course  we at Zacks are always concerned about the stock s earnings estimate revision activity  Interestingly enough  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  has seen mixed revisions for its current quarter  with one positive adjustment and one negative one coming in over the last 30 days 
Nevertheless  it is the other timeframes that look strong  Adidas has seen at least two positive revisions for its next quarter  full year  and next year earnings within the last month 
On top of its strong Zacks Rank  Adidas also sports an  A  grade for Growth and a  B  grade for Momentum  lifting its overall VGM score to  B   Solid grades in our Style Scores system help to underscore the fundamental strength of highly ranked stocks 
If Adidas can continue to match consumer trends and report impressive earnings results  the stock really could be set to break into a new range  This is one to keep an eye on for any investor interested in the consumer goods sector

Other retailers in this sector are also hurting today  Sporting goods peers Hibbett Sports   NASDAQ HIBB    Big 5 Sporting Goods   NASDAQ BGFV    and Sportsman s Warehouse Holdings   NASDAQ SPWH   are all sliding  down 3 93   0 93   and 5 23   respectively  in afternoon trading  Even hunting  fishing  and camping retailer Cabela s   NYSE CAB   took a hit today  down about 0 60  in the same time frame 
Sports retailers haven t been able to escape the wide net cast by Dick s first quarter earnings either  Giants like Under Armour   NYSE UAA   and Nike   NYSE NKE   have slipped 4 41  and 1 99  so far today  while Vista Outdoor   NYSE VSTO    Columbia Sportwear   NYSE M    Finish Line   NASDAQ FINL    and Foot Locker   NYSE FL   are all down  too

The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings of 55 cents per share on  8 47 billion in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top 
Management s decision to discontinue reporting future orders puts additional pressure on margins to excel 
Increased competition from Under Armour  NYSE UAA  and Adidas  DE ADSGN  as well as a rapidly changing retail environment puts pressure on Nike to innovate and expand globally 
Nike headlines a slow week of earnings with its highly anticipated fiscal third quarter report Tuesday afternoon  Dismal reports from Under Armour and other footwear retailers this earnings season portends pressure to the downside for Nike s announcement  As a result  analysts at Estimize cut earnings estimates 11 percent and revenue 2 percent from previous forecasts at the end of the fiscal second quarter  Despite some obvious near term headwinds  the stock jumped 15 2 percent higher in the past 3 months and historically performs well immediately through an earnings report
The Estimize consensus data earnings of 55 cents per share  reflecting a 3  increase from a year earlier  Revenue for the period is forecasted to increase 5  to  8 47 billion  marking steady mid single digit revenue growth for 8 consecutive quarters 
The fiscal second quarter restored investors  faith that Nike can stave off increasing competition  namely from Adidas  while still maintaining margins and future orders growth  In the three month period ending in November  gross profit came in at  3 62 billion with 44 2 percent margins  Future orders  on the other hand  slipped 4 percent in North America but still posted overall growth of 2 percent on a constant currency basis  Management also reveal that it would discount reporting future order figures  making margins all the more important moving forward 
With Adidas  Under Armour and Lululemon  NASDAQ LULU  all making strides in the retail industry  Nike faces an uphill battle to remain king of the hill  Nike s clear market share lead  superb brand reputation and ongoing prowess for innovation and design will help it maintain a significant gap between the competition  However growth opportunities in domestic markets are running out as Nike controls over 50  of the market in all major sporting segment  The best case for Nike is to expand global shares in Europe and Asia where its presence holds a less pronounced presence

189470,410986,UAA,How Lululemon Stock Got Stretched Too Thin,opinion,"Lululemon Athletica Inc  NASDAQ LULU  built an empire by reinventing women s athletic apparel  Since the company s inception in 1998  its comfortable and convenient athletic wear has spread rapidly through the growing yoga market  And it has inspired copycat products from the likes of Nike  NYSE  NYSE NKE  and Under Armour  NYSE UAA  
You can credit  or blame  Lululemon for the so called  athleisure  trend  where gym clothes became fashionable    and a staple of many people s wardrobes 
However  there s a difference between  first to market  and  best in market   Lululemon may have pioneered modern leggings and yoga pants  but the quality of these products hasn t always satisfied customers 
In recent years  patrons have complained that the pants end up wearing too thin   sometimes to the point of being transparent  And as you can see below  Lululemon stock has been wearing thin lately as well 

Last week  shares crashed by more than 20  after fourth quarter earnings missed expectations by one penny  Ordinarily  a little miss like that wouldn t be a big deal  But in the context of Lululemon s product quality issues     it has investors running for the exits 
Has the Vancouver based clothier stretched itself too thin  Or does Lululemon stock still have a prospect for recovery 
Lululemon s Problems
As is often the case  this earnings report sell off was about more than earnings  The  0 01 miss was just a catalyst that caused investors to act on their pre existing concerns 
One underlying cause of concern is Lululemon s product line  As we mentioned previously  the firm has grappled with a reputation for making flimsy pants  In 2013  it was hit by a major recall after customers discovered that its black yoga pants were so thin that they were see through 
More recently  it has made some aesthetic missteps  CEO Laurent Potdevin said that one cause of sluggish sales is  an assortment lacking depth and color for spring   And more broadly  leggings may not be such a profitable item going forward 
Many fashion analysts are predicting a return to heavier bottoms for women  e g  jeans  in the next few years  That s a threat to Lululemon s business  which is all about lightweight and tight fitting stuff 
What s more  many investors are getting tired of waiting for Lululemon stock to break into triple digits  The stock has been bouncing between  50 and  80 for almost five years now  and it pays no dividend 
All of these problems are deeply worrying in a retail environment that has become brutally competitive  As   investors are having concerns about Lululemon s ability to compete with its larger rivals like Nike and Adidas  DE ADSGN 
Prospects for Recovery
Lululemon stock certainly has its problems  but its outlook isn t all bad  For one thing  the recent Q4 report showed a tiny earnings miss but a fairly substantial revenue beat 
And the recent earnings miss is just about the only negative item on Lululemon s balance sheet  It has no debt  and the company has a cash surplus of more than  200 million  which it could use for share buybacks or dividend payments if things get worse 
Finally  Lululemon enforces its intellectual property rights very aggressively  It patents all of its most important products and technologies  And it s not afraid to sue competitors that imitate them  as it did with Calvin Klein back in 2012 
Willingness to defend your products is an important quality in the clothing business  Think about how big the market is for designer knockoffs 
The Bottom Line for Lululemon Stock
Lululemon isn t going to dig itself out of this hole overnight  As is the case with many clothing retailers  things are likely to get worse before they get better 
So Lululemon isn t a good buy for short term growth  But it still has potential as a long term value play  If the company can survive through the current  retail winter   then its healthy balance sheet should set it up to recover rapidly when market conditions improve ",2017-04-06,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-lululemon-stock-got-stretched-too-thin-200181460,200181460

189472,410988,UAA,Will A Takeover Offer Be In The Future For Lululemon  LULU  ,opinion,"Shares of a company typically soar after a buyout or merger is announced  The acquired company s price usually reaches how much the buyer is paying per share  which is a great way for investors to make a return  Though it is profitable  it s not easy to predict which company is likely to be bought 
 predicted last November that Lululemon Athletica Inc     NASDAQ LULU    the Canadian based athletic apparel company  was one of eight companies that might be bought out in 2017  After the company reported its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter results  the prediction might be fulfilled 
The yoga inspired sportswear company plunged in late March after its Q4 results revealed an earnings miss and flat growth for the upcoming financial quarter  Shares of the company dropped over 20  since its earnings release on March 29 
While Lululemon s fourth quarter earnings fell short  both sales and earnings improved year over year 
The key reason for the decline in investors  confidence was in the soft outlook for the upcoming quarter  Management said it  had a slow start to 2017    in its recent product line  which weighed on e commerce sales 
Despite the sluggish start to 2017  LULU remains positive on its outlook for fiscal 2017 and its goal to reach  4 billion in sales by 2020  Furthermore  Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jim Duffy  Lululemon to a Buy from Neutral  believing that its e commerce and merchandising issues will only be temporary  
Possible Buyout 
Lululemon is growing  but just not as much as what investors and analysts had hoped  With the drop in value  the company may become an attractive target in the active wear sector for large corporations like Nike   NYSE NKE   or Under Armour   NYSE UAA   
While Nike  a giant in the sportswear sector  is more likely to be the buyer  Under Armour could strive for an acquisition or merger if the opportunity presents itself 
Currently  Under Armour is struggling to post sales growth that satisfies its investors  Not only would buying Lululemon increase its sales growth  but it would also provide Under Armour with a much needed boost in female customers   
However  it could wind up working out differently for Lululemon and Under Armour  Talking to CNBC  Chip Wilson  the founder and former CEO of Lululemon  recently  
Wilson  still the largest individual shareholder of Lululemon  believed that now is a good time to buy Under Armour  as the company s sales are slowing down 
For similar reasons  the buyout or merger would be able to increase Lululemon s revenues significantly and grow its menswear section 
Perhaps a merger will soon happen between the two as both retailers look to compete against industry leaders like Nike and Adidas Inc    OTC ADDYY   
Lululemon is up 1  to  51 73 per share in afternoon trading Monday

189516,411032,UAA,Under Armour Class C Shares  UA C  Soar On Ticker Change,opinion,"Shares of Under Armour   NYSE UA   gained nearly 2 5  in morning trading Monday  but that s not the big story for investors interested in the sports apparel giant  Indeed  investors are probably looking at Under Armour s Class C shares   NYSE UA    which gained over 8 6  following the news that the company will be changing its tickers in order to fill the value gap between the two stocks 
Under Armour announced that it will change its ticker symbol for its Class A shares to  UAA  and its Class C shares will trade under the old  UA  symbol  The company hopes the move will bring new attention to its Class C shares  which originally debuted in March  Closing the value gap between the two types of shares is important to Under Armour executives because the company plans to use its Class C shares as stock based compensation in the future 
Heading into the day  Under Armour s Class A shares were trading at a 20  premium to its Class C shares  Value gaps between Class A and Class C shares typically make sense because Class A share include voting rights  and although that is also true in this case  the vast majority of Under Armour s voting power lies with CEO Kevin Plank anyway 
Since Class A shareholders have about as much power as Class C shareholders  such a wide value gap really shouldn t exist right now  Investors are already starting to pile on the company s under loved Class C shares  and it will be interesting to see just how close the stocks get before the ticker change goes into effect on December 7

189518,411034,UAA,Market s Pause As OPEC Deal Lifts Oil,opinion,"Winter is a season of recovery and preparation  Paul Theroux

When the the bi annual meeting of OPEC came this past week  rumors swirled for weeks about the possibility of a production cut  Specifically  the prime players in the drama  which it seems like is happening at every meeting  are the Saudis  and Iran  Plainly  the Saudis wanted a cut  Iran did not because they argued their production levels should be restored to pre sanction levels  Underneath the surface of the meeting  however  are urgent concerns for the decision makers of the majority of these countries  Specifically  these nations are dependent on oil revenues to subsidize their citizens  and with oil prices in the dumps for going on over two years  all have been running huge budget deficits  Many have large reserves  like the Saudis  but some don t  and so countries like Venezuela  Nigeria  Qatar  Kuwait  United Arab Emirates  and the rest of the wonderful group are feeling more than a little pressure from current conditions  So  beyond the veil of happy rhetoric was the vital importance to get an agreement to raise the price  meaning now  Low and behold  when a 1 2 million barrel per day cut was announced  the price jumped 8   For the week  oil prices were up 10   and the stock prices of the whole sector jumped in a big way  History has proven these agreements fall apart because of the inherent unreliability of these countries to honor their production quotas  Most analysts believe with the current cut  the existing glut has another six months left to work off  Oil is always important to monitor and plays a  huge  role in the global economy  Given what transpired this week  it will not change any time soon 
Elsewhere in the capital markets  the November jobs report came in at a light 178 thousand number  so it will be interesting to see what the Federal Reserve says about future interest rate moves after their next meeting  From a credibility standpoint  it is pretty much assumed they raise 25 basis points and then stop for a pause to see what happens  Of course  their actions will depend on what transpires at the outset of the next congress and the new administration  If fiscal stimulus gets passed in the various forms being thrown around  the tightening cycle may be just beginning  We will know soon enough 
In the meantime  Mr  Trump is entertaining the press and public by taking a victory lap and proceeding with picking his cabinet  The choice for Treasury Secretary  Mr  Mnuchin helped Bill Ackman to the tune of nearly half a billion bucks  Mr  Mnuchin has proclaimed a different policy with respect to the large GSE s  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  He has said he wants to take them out of the hands of the government and reduce the public s risk  The situation highlights one of the issues investors have to grapple with when owning stocks  In many cases  the largest gains of a position will only come five or ten years after buying the stock  Ackman has been involved with these for a few years now  but you have to have plenty of patience if you are an owner of stocks 
One of the interesting areas of the market is arbitrage  A unique situation involving Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA  and the various classes of its stock has made it a target for the arb participants  The specifics involve the different voting classes of each of the Under Armour group and the discrepancy in market value  Usually  the strategy is to short the overvalued entity  and go long the undervalued one  The classes of the stocks should have similar market values  but those with voting rights should have a premium to something without the votes  They don t always trade this way in the market  which is why there are opportunities  I know  you will send me a check in a few weeks  right 
Super investor Mario Gabelli is in the news for creating his own new ETF s  One is based on the Liberty family of stocks  the other is broader based  He did this as a way to be more tax efficient because an ETF redeems shares of individual companies without selling the entire ETF to the public  uses a broker for the individual holding   It is a way to defer taxes  especially when a company you own gets bought  In this case  Mr  Gabelli has clients who owned Precision Cast Parts at 8 bucks a share  It was acquired by Berkshire for well over 200  thus the concern about a large capital gain  Nice problem to have  eh  Tomorrow  Italy votes on their voting referendum proposed by the Prime Minister  If the vote goes no  expect there to be plenty of action in Europe  especially with their largest banks  Finally  last week I mentioned some items to think about in preparing for 2017  I forgot to mention the various insurance coverages to check on  Typically  health  care  life  and an umbrella policy are the areas to cover and be comfortable with  As the heading quote mentioned  winter is coming and it is time to get ready  Y H   C Investments  Yale Bock  and the family of Yale Bock own positions in securities mentioned in the blog post  Investing in stocks can lead to the complete loss of your capital  As always  on any company mentioned here  past performance is not a guarantee of future returns  Investing involves risk of losses on invested capital  One should research any investment and make sure it is suitable with your objectives  risk tolerance  risk profile liquidity considerations  tax situation  and anything else pertinent to your financial situation  Also  the CFA credential in no way implies investment returns will be superior for any charter holder ",2016-12-04,Yale Bock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market’s-pause-as-opec-deal-lifts-oil-200168003,200168003
189519,411035,UAA,Here s Why Sneaker Stocks  UA  NKE  ADDYY  Are Gaining Today,opinion,"Shares of athletic apparel behemoth Nike   NYSE NKE   gained more than 3 2  in morning trading Monday after a notable analyst upgrade  its industry competitors  Under Armour   NYSE UA   and Adidas   OTC ADDYY    were also up thanks to a newly inked sponsorship deal and the continuation of positive momentum 
From Worst to Best 
Heading into the week  Nike was the worst performing component of the Dow  but apparently that hasn t scared away everyone  The sneaker giant received an upgrade from HSBC to  buy  from  hold  on Monday  and the ratings firm also bumped its price target up to  60 per share from  50 
 The company epitomizes  in our view  the  captain of industry  status in a growth sector  and even though we accept that alternative brands may be gaining share at times  we feel the company is still poised for superior growth and returns long term   said HSBC in a note 
Under Armour Goes Yard
We can assume that one of the  alternative brands  that HSBC mentioned is Under Armour  an athletic apparel maker whose sneaker profile has skyrocketed thanks to its endorsement of two time NBA MVP Steph Curry 
Under Armour s brand was further legitimized on Monday as the company announced a 10 year deal to be the official on field uniform provider of the MLB  The sponsorship doesn t start until the 2020 season  but its importance for Under Armour can t be understated  this is the first professional sports league deal for the Baltimore based company 
Shifting Momentum for Adidas 
For Adidas  Monday s trading activity seems to be coming from the overall strong start to the week for stocks  as well as a continuation of its recent momentum  The German athletic giant has struggled since its lackluster Q3 earnings report  but shares of started to turn things around over the last few days of trading 
Overall  the stock has lost about 3  over the past four weeks  but shares are up over 3 75  in the past week 
Bottom Line
Today is a day to celebrate for the world s largest sneaker companies  Under Armour has inked a monumental deal that will help cement the legacy of its brand  while Nike and Adidas are showing signs of turning things around after some long term and short term difficulties  With the holiday quarter in full swing  things could get interesting in this sphere soon

Consumer Discretionary   Textiles  Apparel   Luxury Goods   Reports October 25  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 26 cents on  1 47 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  10 million on the top
 s portfolio of star studded athletes  along with international growth and a foray into fitness technology are expected to drive top line growth
A recent deal with the MLB will outfit its players with Under Armour produced uniforms
Under Armour is scheduled to announce its third quarter earnings today  before the market opens  The shoemaker is still believed to be the biggest threat to Nike s  NYSE NKE  dominance in the U S   despite a few down quarters  Its portfolio of star studded athletes  along with international growth and a foray into fitness technology are expected to drive top line growth  Margins  on the other hand  should be compressed from increased discounting and higher operating expenses  Analysts have grown more optimistic lately with current estimates now pointing to a bounceback quarter 
The Estimize community is calling for earnings per share of 26 cents on  1 47 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  10 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier that represents a 13  increase on the bottom line and 21  on the top  Shares are currently down 6  this year  but historically have jumped immediately through the print  However  if the slowdown on the top line continues it would be hard to imagine the stock making any kind of gains 

This year hasn t been as easy for Under Armour as it was in the past  Earnings and revenue have taken a step back for a number of reasons with the Sports Authority bankruptcy being the most recent blow  Prior to the second quarter  Under Armour reported there would be a significant hit from dissolved partnership  It turns out that the company s other revenue streams more than offset these estimated losses
Under Armour has remained focused on building its brand through strategic partnerships  key endorsements  expanding its DTC business  and its most recent investments into wearable technology  Just last week  Under Armour announced a deal with the MLB to outfit its teams with uniforms starting in 2020  Any major sporting license is a huge win for Under Armour  let alone one with America s pastime game  Meanwhile  the company continues to expand its catalogue of endorsements which includes  Stephen Curry  Tom Brady and Dwayne  the Rock  Johnson 
But no one category has grown faster than international sales  Last quarter the segment jumped 68   helping to push total revenue over the  1 billion mark for a fourth consecutive quarter  Under Armour spent some time in China this summer to help promote the game of basketball and its star athlete Stephen Curry  As they become more of a household name overseas  expect to see top line growth accelerate 
There still remains several near term headwinds that could impact tomorrow s report  It s becoming increasingly accepted that the athletic apparel sector should start to edge down over the next several quarters  The space is becoming increasingly saturated which has forced more frequent discounting  thereby compressing margins  The top names like Nike  NYSE NKE   Under Armour and even Lululemon no longer have pricing power over the consumers  explaining the poor bottom line growth ",2016-10-25,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-end-near-for-under-armour-200160449,200160449
189549,411065,UAA,Why Is Under Armour  UA  Stock Down Over 12  Today ,opinion,"On Tuesday  Under Armour   NYSE UA   saw its stock drop about 12  to  32 07 per share as of 11 58 AM CT  This shocking news comes after a positive Q3 earnings report for the sports apparel giant  UA reported earnings of  1 47B  or  0 29 per share  which exceeds analysts expected earnings of  1 45B  or  0 25 per share  for this quarter 
While Under Armour s Q3 earnings might have shown positive gains in sales  there were a few red flags that concerned investors  sending its stock plummeting 
The most troubling news for investors is the drop in gross margin and slow anticipated growth in future revenue  UA experienced a 1 3  drop in its gross margin  falling to 47 5   compared to 48 8  reported last year  In addition  the company reported an anticipated revenue increase of 20  for 2017 and 2018  While this is a positive expectation  it would be the lowest revenue increase for UA since 2009 
Back in March 2016  UA s biggest retail partner  Sports Authority  filed for bankruptcy  This resulted in the closing of all stores nationwide by the end of summer  This news has made its mark on UA  shown by its decline in anticipated future revenue 
UA CEO Kevin Plank showed frustration during a conference call  putting some of the blame on the Sports Authority bankruptcy for its immense drop in stock price  However  he is still confident that there will be a turnaround  saying that   Our demand is still there  This doesn t mean the demand for the Under Armour brand has disappeared  but it certainly hasn t reappeared dollar for dollar in our distribution  
The hope for Under Armour s success is heavily based on the marketability and sales of their endorsed athletes  Some notable names include Stephen Curry  Tom Brady  Cam Newton  and many more  The reigning NBA MVP Stephen Curry is set to drop his signature  Curry 3  shoe  which is anticipated to generate large sales  Plank said   We ve always known the size of the prize in footwear is massive   acknowledging the importance of shoe sales in order to keep up with rivals Nike    NYSE NKE    and Adidas    OTC ADDYY

189551,411067,UAA,Investing In Fitness Stocks,opinion,"It seems hard to believe now  but going to the gym was once a fairly niche activity  These days  more people are working out than ever before  The number of gyms in the U S  has risen from 30 000 in 2010 to 36 000 in 2015 
It s not just health clubs and gyms that in the U S  are fueling the growth of the fitness industry  People all over the world are making a concentrated effort to get healthier  That s helped the global industry grow from  71 billion in revenues in 2010 to  81 billion in revenues in 2015 
The good news is you don t need to open a gym or become a personal trainer to get a piece of the growing fitness craze  There are a number of diverse  publicly traded investment options out there for investors 
Planet Fitness Inc  NYSE PLNT 
One of the growing trends in fitness is the rise of boutique   and expensive   studios or classes like CrossFit and SoulCycle  On the opposite end of the fitness spectrum is Planet Fitness  This ubiquitous and inexpensive gym markets itself to casual fitness goers who don t want to spend much money 
The business model has been working well  with more than 1 000 franchised gyms in the U S 
There s no doubt Planet Fitness is fulfilling a need  The value stalled after its IPO in 2015  but 2016 has proven to be especially lucrative  Shares are up almost 25 percent on the year  The rise in share value can be attributed to better than expected per gym revenues and an increased revenue forecast for the rest of the year 
Fitbit  NYSE FIT 
Fitbits are everywhere  as people have taken a strong liking to tracking their fitness progress on a watch like device  The bad thing is that Fitbit like devices are also everywhere 
Fitbit went public in 2015 and has since lost 56 percent of its first day value  That s a bitter pill for investors to swallow  Sales aren t as high as hoped  which is part of the reason for the steep decline  On top of that  the competition in the wearable technology field is becoming increasingly crowded  While Fitbit makes some great products  it s hard to say whether it will regain its footing 
Vitamin Shoppe  NYSE VSI 
The fitness industry has shown strong growth  The same thing can be said about the related nutritional supplements industry  The  32 billion industry value is expected to double by 2021  with health minded people fueling the industry s growth 
Vitamin Shoppe  and its chief competitor GNC Holdings  NYSE GNC   are the two biggest players in this field  Both have had a rough 2016 with double digit declines  but Vitamin Shoppe is proving more resilient despite being smaller in size  The declining sales are something to worry about  but the underlying financials are strong 
Under Armour  NYSE UA 
Before fitness become as widespread as it is now  fitness fashion was popular  Brands like Nike  NYSE NKE  have had lucrative histories by appealing to both fitness aficionados and casual people who just like the clothing  Under Armour works in a similar way  but the brand has grown faster than anyone could have reasonably expected  In the past six years  the company has had 20 percent or higher annual growth 
Unfortunately for long term investors  Under Armor became a victim of its own hype and cratered in value earlier this year  Now could be a good time to take a look at Under Armour  as the price is much more reasonable than it was earlier in 2016 
Fitness as a Fad 
Industries showing fast growth should always be treated with extra scrutiny  Fads  after all  are not worth investing in for the long term  However  the fitness industry has been around for decades and is just now maturing  Fitness in all shapes and forms has caught on in a big way  which means the industry will likely continue to grow  That s music to any investor s ears

189561,411077,UAA,5 Things To Watch When Nike Reports Earnings On Tuesday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Nike  NYSE NKE   the international manufacturer of athletic footwear  apparel  equipment and accessories  reports fiscal Q1  17 on Tuesday  September 27  after the market close 

1  Earnings and Revenue
Analysts are projecting an EPS of  0 56 for Nike this quarter  along with  8 87 billion in revenue  Last year  Nike s Q1 was incredible from an EPS standpoint  coming in at  0 69 a stratospheric 25  growth in profitability  No such growth surprise is expected this year  Regarding revenue  Nike is projected to continue healthy growth with a 5  rise above last year s Q1 

2  Core Segments Still Growing
Nike s two primary corporate segments are Sportswear and Running  Sportswear is Nike s biggest segment  bringing in  7 5 billion dollars  or 27 5  of Nike s annual wholesale revenue  which makes it essential for the continued overall growth of the company  Fortunately for Nike  this segment had the strongest growth during fiscal 2016  which ended last quarter  Sportswear came in at 22  growth on a currency neutral basis  or 14  growth when factoring in foreign exchange headwinds 
Nike s other major segment  Running  accounts for  5 billion of its wholesale revenue  or 18  of annual revenue  Because a lot of the growth in the Running division came from the Eurozone  China and Japan  the foreign exchange effect took a greater toll here  diminishing moreof Nike s top line growth in dollars  For Running  growth was just 3  when factoring foreign exchange costs  The better news is that on a currency neutral basis  this segment grew by 10  over the last year  Double digit growth in the company s biggest and most important segments  Yes please 

3  Men vs  Women
In the past few years  growth hungry investors have been particularly keen on the female demographic  Makes sense  since women represent 50  of the population more or less  meaning this group of consumers is way too big to ignore  Growth here is fueled by active women buying more sport related clothing and equipment from Nike  across all product segments  Fortunately for Nike  just when sales growth among men started to slow  their women s line began to take off 
Since 2013  growth in its women s line has been regularly outpacing its men s offering  Better still  annual growth during the past four years has been above 10  YoY  coming in at 17  on a currency neutral basis 

4  Direct to Consumer Sales
Nike has two ways of selling equipment to the general public either wholesale to retailers  or direct sales to consumers  Wholesale to retailers is pretty straightforward  These sales are generated via middlemen in the form of a traditional retail network of stores  such as Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS  or Macy s  NYSE M  for instance 
The appeal of direct sales to consumers is obvious  It allows Nike to cut out the middlemen  eliminate wholesale discounts and improve margins on products sold  Which is why NKE launched a brand new app in August  in hopes of cashing in on direct to customers sales while riding the mobile shopping trend  The revenue split between wholesale and direct to  consumers was 80 20 two years ago  It s now 75 25  with the growth at the wholesale end  Margins have increased by 140 basis points in the past two years  reflecting the rise of direct sales to consumers 

5  Greater China
Alongside Nike s other opportunities  described above  it s appropriate to finish with the Chinese market  China s consumers are known for their love of premium brands  That puts the world famous Nike brand squarely in the sights of modern China s burgeoning middle class  which by some estimates is at least   This is nothing short of a gold mine for companies like Nike  which has been growing at an amazing of 24  and 29  annually in the People s Republic  over the past two years respectively  Naturally  Nike management is well aware that 20   growth won t last forever  but the expectation is for double digit growth into the foreseeable future 
Conclusion
From this vantage point  Nike s prospects are stellar  It has all the hallmarks of a classic growth company  Management has proven it s capable of seizing opportunities early on  and the brand name is recognized and coveted worldwide  Nike is currently trading at around  55 a share  after hitting a high of  68 in late 2015 
Its P E ratio is just under 25  which isn t cheap  but isn t expensive either  considering the many likely avenues of growth available  and the fact that the average P E of the entire stock market has been trending upward during the past few years 
Nike is a strong business  one that s now cheaper than peers such as Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA  or lululemon  NASDAQ LULU   The 2016 slump  which began at the close of 2015  means the stock is 20  off its all time high as of this writing 
We see this as an excellent buying opportunity for anyone looking to add a successful  well run company to their portfolio  But grab it while you can  We wouldn t be at all surprised to see it regain its previous highs sooner rather than later ",2016-09-27,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-thing-to-watch-when-nike-reports-on-tuesday-200155454,200155454

Consumer Discretionary   Textiles  Apparel   Luxury Goods   Reports September 27  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 57 cents on  8 86 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
Nike is seeing pressure on future orders and margins in recent quarters  two of the company s key metrics
Nike is still leaps and bounds above the competition but the gap is slowly narrowing with Adidas  DE ADSGN   Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA  and lululemon athletica inc  NASDAQ LULU  gaining steam in recent quarters
Headlining this slow week of earnings is multinational athletic apparel and footwear brand  Nike  Nike had been one of the best large cap growth stories of the past 5 years but that is starting to change  Increasing competition and an volatile retail space are spelling hard times for Nike this quarter  Earnings expectations are the lowest they ve been in over 2 years  resulting in a downturn in the stock  Shares are down 8  in the past month and about 13  year to date 
Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 57 cents  down 14  from a year earlier  That estimate has declined 15  since Nike s most recent report in June  Revenue for the period is estimated up 5  to  8 86 billion  marking a slight slowdown from previous quarters  Historically the stock increases 2  following an earnings report but based on how it has been trending  that doesn t seem likely tomorrow 

Typically  the two most important metrics Nike reports are future orders and margins  Future orders make up a large chunk of Nike s revenue in a given quarter  It represents a commitment to retailers that orders placed 5 6 months in advance will be delivered during a set time period at a fixed price  like a future s contract  Nike has been hammered in this department despite continually delivering double digit gains  That bar has been set so high that it s unlikely they will be able to meet expectations 
Meanwhile  margins are a representation of Nike s pricing power over the competition  Nike shoes were once a status symbol for which consumers were willing to shell out top dollar  That is no longer the case and Nike must resort to discounting to move its product  which has undermined margin expansion in recent quarters 
Along those lines  increasing competition has been one of the company s biggest threats  Nike is still leaps and bounds ahead of Adidas  Under Armour and Lululemon  but the gap is closing  Adidas  strong pipeline combined with Under Armour seizing Stephen Curry s growing popularity is infringing on Nike s dominance  Lululemon has also played a role in Nike s considerable slowdown  Lululemon is perhaps Nike s biggest competitor in terms of athleisure sales 
Fortunately  this summer s sporting calendar featured the Euro soccer tournament and Olympics  These 2 events don t occur annually so their presence this year could provide an additional boost ",2016-09-27,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-nike-expecting-a-blowout-earnings-report-tomorrow-200155662,200155662
189573,411089,UAA,Done With Nike  NKE   3 Apparel Stocks With More Room To Run,opinion,"With summer sporting events like the Rio Olympics and the European soccer championship behind us  it s time again to gauge the winners and losers among top brands that stood out  With leading names like Nike Inc    NYSE NKE    Adidas AG  DE ADSGN    OTC ADDYY   and Under Armour Inc    NYSE UA   flashing everywhere during these events  it may be difficult to point out the real winner One will obviously take a peek into each of these companies  earnings performance in the last reported quarter to evaluate the player that should stand at the top  That said  the first company to show up is Nike  which released its first quarter fiscal 2017 results after the closing bell yesterday The leading athletic apparel retailer posted heartening results with both revenues and earnings beating estimates and improving year over year  in the fiscal first quarter  However  this was not enough to woo investors    shares of Nike closed down 2 6  in after hours trading yesterday following the earnings release NIKE INC B Price

   What Went Wrong Negative investor reaction after the earnings release was primarily due to a slowdown in future orders  which came in lower than expected  Worldwide future orders as of Aug 31  2016  grew 7  on a currency neutral basis  The key reason for the lag in future orders was attributed to the rise of competition from Under Armour and Adidas which have been eating into Nike s market share in key categories like basketball and casual footwear Another perspective from market analysts reveals that the slowdown in Nike s future orders is also due the waning popularity of  athleisure  wear  But now  with a shift in consumer tastes and preferences to more fashionable assortments  this trend seems to be on the wane Further  an 11  rise in inventory as of the end of the fiscal first quarter indicates that the company s merchandise could be behind the company s contracting gross margins  In the reported quarter  Nike s gross margin fell 200 basis points  bps  to 45 5   While the company attributed the decline to several factors including a higher off price sales mix and the exiting of its golf equipment business  we believe a rise in inventory levels was also one of the reasons Additionally  the company expects the aforementioned factors to continue hurting gross margin in the second half of fiscal 2017  anticipating a flat gross margin rate in the second half of the fiscal year  Gross margin for the second quarter is projected to fall nearly 125 bps  Consequently  the company now expects gross margin for fiscal 2017 to contract compared with its previous forecast of a 30 50 bps expansion Thus  we do not recommend this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock for your portfolio  at least for the time being  Instead  we have picked three apparel stocks for investors on the basis of a favorable Zacks Rank  sound Zacks Consensus Estimate revisions and sturdy fundamentals Our PicksInvestors can check out Francesca s Holdings Corp    NASDAQ FRAN    the operator of a chain of retail boutiques  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company has amassed year over year return of about 29 3  and surged 49 7  in the past three months

   Deckers Outdoor Corp    NYSE DECK    a consumer goods company that designs  markets  and distributes footwear  apparel  and accessories for casual lifestyle use and high performance activities  can be a solid bet for investors  The stock has surged roughly 30 1  year to date and added 11 7  in the last three months

189574,411090,UAA,NIKE  NKE  Tops Q1 Earnings  Soft Future Orders Hurt Stock ,opinion,Keeping its positive earnings surprise trend alive for the seventeenth straight quarter  NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   posted solid first quarter fiscal 2017 results  which also saw a top line beat after three consecutive misses  Moreover  results improved year over year  largely driven by a robust summer that saw events like the Rio Olympics and European soccer championship However  the results were not enough to please investors  whose negative sentiment was clearly visible from the 2 6  slip in NIKE s shares in the after market trading session  attributable to sluggish future orders   a significant measure of demand for the company s products  Additionally  NIKE s inventory position depicted a slowdown in its merchandise sales  posing concerns This athletic apparel  footwear and accessories retailer s first quarter earnings per share of 73 cents jumped nearly 9  year over year  while substantially beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents  Earnings were fueled by strong sales  reduced average share count  robust global momentum  operating overhead leverage and reduced tax rate  somewhat offset by a drop in gross margin and a hike in demand creation costs NIKE INC B Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    RevenuesThanks to a sporty summer that led to a spectacular international performance  revenues of this swoosh brand owner advanced 8  to  9 061 million in the reported quarter and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 833 million  Further  sales grew 10  on a currency neutral basis Revenues of the company s NIKE Brand surged 10  on a currency neutral basis to  8 459 million  The segment gained from a double digit increase in Western Europe  Greater China  Central   Eastern Europe  Emerging Markets and Japan  which in turn was backed by solid growth across Sportswear  Running and the Jordan Brand Moreover  the NIKE brand s Direct to Consumer   DTC   revenues improved 22  in the quarter  mainly on the back of 49  online sales growth and a 10  rise in new store increases Additionally  revenues at the company s Converse brand rose 4  to  574 million on a currency neutral basis  fueled by North American growth that was partly negated by weakness noted in Europe and Asia Pacific Future OrdersNIKE s global future orders for the NIKE Brand  slated for delivery from Sep 2016 through Jan 2017  went up 5  year over year to  12 3 billion  On a currency neutral basis  future orders rose 7   However  as reported by sources  the outlook for future orders lagged analysts  estimates and also slowed down from last year  particularly in the North American region Per these sources  stiff competition from rivals like Under Armour  Inc    NYSE UA   and Adidas  DE ADSGN  AG   OTC ADDYY   continues to be a pressing concern for NIKE  which is losing its market share to these sporting bigwigs  This has dented demand for NIKE s basketball shoes and causal footwear  Apart from this  a shift in consumers  tastes and preferences toward more fashionable assortments is also playing foul for NIKE  whose  athleisure  popularity seems to be losing ground Costs   MarginsGross profit improved about 3  to  4 123 million  while the gross margin shriveled 200 basis points  bps  to 45 5   The decline in gross margin was attributable to an adverse impact from exiting Golf equipment operations  foreign currency headwinds  unfavorable off price mix and shift of some expenses to cost of goods sold from operating overheads  This was somewhat compensated by higher average selling prices Selling and administrative expense escalated 12  to  2 897 million  on account of higher operating overhead costs stemming from growth in the DTC business and increased investments in infrastructure and digital capabilities  as well as rising costs for digital demand creation  brand events and sports marketing Balance Sheet   Shareholder Friendly MovesNIKE ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of  4 787 million  long term debt  excluding current maturities  of  1 993 million  and shareholders  equity of  12 165 million  Inventories as of Aug 31  2016  grew nearly 11  to  4 896 million During the first quarter  NIKE bought back 19 million shares for  1 1 billion under its  12 billion program that was approved in Nov 2015 and extends for a four year term  As of quarter end  the company s total repurchases under this program amounted to 39 million shares for roughly  2 2 billion Looking ForwardThough NIKE is facing various hurdles  its quarterly performance reflects its focus on adopting innovations to keep up with customer demand  While management expects foreign exchange headwinds to prevail in the future  it also remains confident of its growth drivers including efficient supply chain  enhanced connection between the digital and physical experiences  constant innovations and strategic investments   all of which are likely to boost long term shareholder value Based on its own evaluation and suggestions from shareholders  management intends to alter the future order reporting sequencing  Notably  the company will no longer provide a future order update as a stand alone metric  with its earnings release  It will instead discuss it as part of its broader outlook in its conference call  and also provide the details in its quarterly filings with the SEC Considering all factors  management reiterated its fiscal 2017 revenue projections  and expects the same to grow at a high single digit rate  while on a currency neutral basis   it anticipates revenues to increase in a high single digit to low double digit range However  the company now expects gross margin for fiscal 2017 to contract  against its previous forecast of expansion in a range of 30 50 bps  SG A expenses for fiscal 2017 are now anticipated to grow in the mid to high single digits range  compared with a high single digit rate projected earlier For the second quarter of fiscal 2017  the company expects revenues to grow in the mid single digit range or little below its reported future order growth rate  Gross margin is projected to fall by nearly 125 bps in the quarter  mainly due to the same factors that hurt gross margin in the reported quarter  In fact  some of the negative factors will continue to prevail in the latter half of the fiscal  where management envisions gross margin rate to be flat  Further  SG A expenses for the second quarter are estimated to grow at a low to mid single digit rate Zacks RankNIKE

In late May  Under Armour cut its full year sales guidance amid Sports Authority s bankruptcy
Stephen Curry has carried the Under Armour brand this year despite his new shoe receiving some backlash
What are you expecting for  
Under Armour was once believed to be Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  s biggest threat in the footwear space but after cutting its sales outlook in late May that is no longer the case  Analysts reacted negatively to the news and subsequently cut price targets and per share estimates for the upcoming quarter  Macroeconomic challenges and weaker consumer spending have been the two biggest drivers of these cuts 
This broader pullback hasn t only affected Under Armour but many of its peers including lululemon athletica inc  NASDAQ LULU  and Nike  NYSE NKE   Expectations for the upcoming quarter are relatively muted given the growing problems moving forward 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 3 cents per share on  1 billion in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 22  decline in earnings with sales expected to jump by 29   Per share estimates have dropped nearly 50  since Under Armour s last report  reflecting analyst s waning confidence following recent revelations 
A few months ago  Under Armour issued a statement that the Sports Authority s bankruptcy would severely impact fiscal 2016 revenue  Sports Authority s decision to liquidate rather than restructure caused Under Armour to shift its full year guidance down  75 million to  4 93 billion 
According to management  Sports Authority accounted for  120 million in revenue  some of which it was able to write down given the bankruptcy  Analysts downgrades have come in bunches following the news with many of them citing weakness in the women s segment and broader economic challenges 
Fortunately  Under Armour s growing list of endorsed athletes is helping them stay relevant through these tough times  Stephen Curry is not only the darling of the NBA but also someone CEO Kevin Plank adores  In UA s most recent earnings call  Mr  Plank referenced Curry nearly 15 times when pointing to the success of footwear sales 
The first quarter saw total revenue up 30   thanks to a 64  jump in footwear sales and resounding 350  increase in basketball sales  The Curry Twos  released a little over 5 weeks ago  have reportedly sold out despite the backlash for its unappealing design  Under Armour also represents other premier athletes including Tom Brady  Jordan Spieth and Dwayne  The Rock  Johnson 
Besides a huge jump in basketball shoes  golf sales and wearable technology have been key growth markets  Under Armour recently released its first connected fitness system  the UA healthbox  in hopes of becoming a leader in this growing space  However  recent price cuts would leave you to believe the healthbox is having limited success  Do you think UA can beat estimates ",2016-07-26,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-end-near-for-under-armour-200144072,200144072

189624,411140,UAA,Hanesbrands Or Under Armour  Which One Should You Bet On ,opinion,"The U S  market is on a roller coaster ride with recent events spiking up volatility  Speculation surrounding the rate hike by the Fed and volatile gasoline prices triggered by  critical  gas supply are now accompanied by the fear of Brexit 
Consumer Discretionary Sector  Safe Haven
In spite of the challenges  the consumer discretionary sector fared well in the first quarter 2016 earnings season  Buoyed by a strong manufacturing sector  consumer discretionary reported modest growth in the first quarter  A dip in gas prices  an improving job scenario and increasing consumer confidence did the trick for these stocks 
Within the consumer discretionary sector  the athleisure category has been gaining steam lately  mainly because of the rising popularity of casual clothing 
Let s look at the two stocks offering athleisure apparels and accessories   Hanesbrands Inc    NYSE HBI   and peer Under Armour  Inc    NYSE UA     and find out which stock looks solid right now in the wake of volatile market scenario 
Hanesbrands  Start to FY16  
Hanesbrands has been posting decent results over the past few quarters on the back of strategic acquisitions and the success of the Innovate to Elevate strategy  Strong sales in most of its segments  especially Activewear and International  help the company boost its top line 
During the recently concluded first quarter  earnings of  0 26 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18 18   Earnings also improved 18  year over year on the success of the Innovate to Elevate strategy  Higher sales in Innerwear and Activewear categories and contributions from the Knights Apparel business led to sales growth of 1  year over year 
How s 2016 Going for Under Armour  
Although Under Armour reported positive surprise in both top line and bottom line during the recently reported first quarter fiscal 2016  the recent increase in inventory and debt is a serious concern for the company  In the last reported quarter  the company s inventory growth stood at 44   which was much higher than the company s revenue growth of 30   Notably  this for the third consecutive quarter in which inventory growth surpassed top line growth 
The company s debt increased significantly in the previous quarter  The company recorded debt of  935 million in the first quarter of 2016 as against  677 million in the prior year quarter  Further  Under Armour projected an increase in interest expenses to approximately  35 million in 2016 on account of higher debt levels  This is likely to weigh on the company s bottom line 
Fiscal 2016 Outlook
Hanesbrands  for 2016 based on expectations of increased synergies from pending acquisitions and debt refinancing  The company now expects adjusted earnings for fiscal 2016 in the range of  1 89 to  1 95  up from the previous guidance of  1 85 to  1 91  The company has also raised its sales guidance to  6 15 billion to  6 25 billion from the previous  5 8 billion to  5 9 billion 
On the other hand  Under Armour was forced to trim its 2016 outlook after one of its major customers  The Sports Authority  moved progressed with the liquidation of its stores  The company now expects net revenues of nearly  4 925 billion for 2016 as against the previous estimate of net revenue of about  5 billion  Nonetheless  this represents an increase of 24  over the 2015 level  Operating income is expected to be in the range of  440 million to  445 million  down from the previous estimate of  503 million to  507 million 
What Do the Numbers Say 
While Hanesbrands carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Under Armour carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
However  in terms of share price  both the companies have reported decline  While Under Armour reported a share price decline of 6 49   Hanesbrands  reported a decline of 10 5  year to date    Even with regard to long term growth  Under Armour seems to enjoy a lead with estimated growth rate pegged at 24 10   This is way ahead of the industry growth rate of 15 20  and Hanesbrands  long term growth rate of 17 3  
However  Under Armour is presently overvalued as is evident from its unfavorable P E ratio of 64 42 compared with the textile apparel industry s 17 33    On the other hand  Hanesbrands is relatively undervalued as its P E ratio of 13 80 is favorable compared to the industry average 
Bottom Line 
Without doubt  Hanesbrands is a better choice than Under Armour as the former enjoys strong growth potential along with compelling fundamentals  impressive Zacks metrics and solid earnings data  which will help investors beat the volatility and increase returns ",2016-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hanesbrands-or-under-armour:-which-one-should-you-bet-on-200137914,200137914

Headlining this week of earnings is multinational athletic and footwear manufacturer Nike  The Nike swoosh is an iconic part of American history contributing to the company s long streak of growth and success  However  expectations this quarter are rather muted compared to past performance  This likely has to do with the weaker spending environment and rising competition from Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA  and Adidas  DE ADSGN   Future performance will certainly be hurt by the Brexit vote given Nike s international presence

Despite its size and reach Nike continues to astound investors with robust growth  The past 7 quarters have featured double digit bottom line growth and mid single digit top line growth  Nike s primary focus in the past few years has been expanding its direct to consumer business  This has been the highest margin margin sector with the most impactful product cost per unit 
The sporting event s calendar has worked favorably in 2016  Besides the annual events sports fans also get the Euros and Olympics this summer  Merchandise sales from these events and continued growth in China and emerging markets should offset some of the negative effects of Britain leaving the Union 
Nike will undertake heavy advertising investments to ensure they are featured at at the upcoming sporting events  This will likely weigh on the company s bottom line and with foreign currency trending downwards  margins might see more trouble  Under Armour also has less exposure to the pound and the U K  and may gain some market share on Nike if Britain falls into recession  Do you think NKE can beat estimates ",2016-06-28,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-will-brexit-impact-nike’s-earnings-200138550,200138550
189626,411142,UAA,Nike  NKE  Bounces Back After Yesterday s Mixed Q4 Results,opinion,"Athletic apparel leader Nike Inc    NYSE NKE     The results in the report were mixed  as too were reactions from investors    NKE was able to somewhat bounce back on Wednesday though  as the stock was up over 3  
Many are considering Nike s results to be mixed  though it has been such a strong performer that many expect near perfection from the company  Nike was able to increase its streak of beating on earnings estimates to 16 consecutive quarters  posting EPS of  0 49  2 08  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 48  Revenue figures came in lower than what was estimated though  as the company posted a figure of  8 24 billion  compared to the estimate of  8 26 billion  which marked the third consecutive quarter Nike did so 
Despite the revenue miss  Nike did post strong growth figures in several of its segments  On a currency neutral basis  sales under its NIKE brand grew 8   its direct to consumer  DTC  revenues grew 23   and its Converse brand saw an increase of 18   Nike Global Future orders scheduled for delivery between June  16 and November  16 grew 8   or 11  on a currency neutral basis 
Despite its continuing growth  Nike does have several negatives that it is  and will continue to face moving forward  Foreign currency headwinds will likely continue to be a drag on the company  as its international sales continue to become a bigger part of its revenue stream  and events like the Brexit affect the strength of the U S  dollar  Another issue that continues to grow for Nike is strict competition from the like of Adidas   OTC ADDYY   and Under Armour   NYSE UA    who continue to successfully grow 
 NIKE INC B Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Bottom Line
 
Nike is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   and the company s stock price is down around 12  year to date  Though Nike continues to grow  the company is beginning to face more hurdles than in past years  and the large amounts of growth it has seen may begin to slow  As its fiscal 2017 begins  Nike will need to continue to stay ahead of its competition that continually inching closer to the long time king of the industry ",2016-06-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-(nke)-bounces-back-after-yesterday's-mixed-q4-results-200139121,200139121
189627,411143,UAA,IPO Market Outlook For Second Half Of 2016,opinion,"We ve officially hit July  By now  most of us have forgotten our New Year s resolutions to exercise more  and instead we spend our time inside of our air conditioned homes eating basically whatever we want to  Well  at least that what s what I have been doing 
However  I m here today to introduce a new concept  the second half of the year resolution  It s a simple concept  We take this time to reinvigorate ourselves and have a great second half of 2016 
I was inspired to think of this idea after taking a look at the performance of IPOs in the first half of the year  So far we ve seen just over 40 IPOs priced in the United States  and although total global IPO activity in 2Q16 nearly doubled that of 1Q16  it was still down 56  year over year 
I m going to cut the IPO market some slack here  Just like I told myself I was going to go outside and run more this year  I m sure the global markets would have really hoped for solid IPO activity in 2016  But things happen  It gets hot outside  I get lazy  and sometimes there s global economic and political uncertainty for the better part of six months 
To start the year  the sluggish Chinese economy put a drain on trading throughout the world  and it was quickly followed by confusion about the timetable for U S  interest rate hikes  Tack on the chaos that was the Brexit  and it makes sense that the IPO market would be slumping this year 
Now that we re at this point  we ll look back at exactly what has happened in the IPO market this year  and more importantly  we ll see what lies ahead for the rest of 2016 
First Half Trends 
Renaissance Capital  a manager of IPO tracking ETFS  recently published a  that detailed trends and recapped global IPO activity so far this year  This report  along with other market data  paints an interesting picture of IPOs in 2016 
As per usual  the highest returns on IPOs this year have been from the highly manipulated Chinese A share market where the government intentionally undervalues companies in order to post higher returns 
Excluding these companies  the healthcare and technology industries had the highest returns  coming in at 37  and 31   respectively  in the second quarter  Even though the Brexit wiped out some gains right at the end of Q2  IPO returns were still up nearly 8  on the quarter 
Overall  returns have been reasonable this year  The real issue that has been apparent is actual IPO activity  As I mentioned earlier  just about 40 IPOs have been priced in the U S  this year  which is down 50  from last year  In 1Q16  total IPO activity was worth just  9 6 billion  down from  36 1 billion from 1Q15  Activity picked back up again in 2Q16  but the pace is still well behind that of 2015 
Another trend this year has been seen in the types of companies going public  So far  the IPO market has seen spin offs of larger companies and privatizations of state owned entities  especially in Europe  dominate the landscape 
Outlook for 2H16
Heading into the second half of the year  the main obstacle in the way of an active IPO market will be the continued   In short  companies tend to want to go public only in the surest of market environments  and the Brexit provides basically the opposite of that  especially in Europe 
Nevertheless  IPO activity should continue to pick up  at least marginally  especially in the United States  Some companies might be reassured by the recent success of Twilio   NYSE TWLO    which quickly jumped from its IPO price of  15 per share to over  30 per share  Twilio was the first tech  unicorn  to IPO in 2016 
As of right now  we do know that at least one other company in the broad technology sphere is set to debut  LINE Corp   a Japanese messaging app maker  will debut via a dual listing in Tokyo and New York on July 14  LINE is expected to raise over  1 billion during its IPO  and you can check out our guide on  before its first day of trading next week 
Other than LINE  the big money IPOs for the remainder of the year still have some uncertainty around them  The upcoming Postal Savings Bank of China  PSBC  offering will most likely continue the trend of manipulated Chinese stocks leading the IPO pack  but other than that it s unclear exactly what we ll see 
Hotel Lotte  the South Korean hotel chain owned by the Lotte Group  was planning for a  5 billion IPO in South Korea  which would be the largest in that country s history  but it was recently delayed while its parent company is investigated in a bribery scandal 
Spotify has been rumored to be preparing for an IPO this year that could be worth up to  1 3 billion  The music streaming service recently raised  1 billion in financing with the promise that its debtors will receive a discount on shares of the company at its IPO  Other than that news  however  we don t know much about Spotify s potential offering 
Earlier this year  it was reported that Jose Cuervo was preparing to raise up to  1 billion during an IPO in the third quarter of 2016  but no further details have emerged yet  Blue Apron  a maker of prepackaged meals  recently hired a former Under Armour   NYSE UA   executive in an alleged effort to work on its IPO plans 
If these big names do go through with their IPO plans  it will mean a much more interesting second half of the year in the global IPO market  Twilio recently showed the world that IPOs in 2016 can be a big success  and now LINE is up next  IPO activity can hardly get slower than it has been so far this year  and it looks like things are finally starting to get busy again ",2016-07-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ipo-market-outlook-for-second-half-of-2016-200140308,200140308
189644,411160,UAA,What s Ahead For Nike And Under Armour ,opinion,"On the heels of Game 1 of the NBA Finals  you might be thinking both Nike  NYSE NKE  and Under Armour  NYSE UA  are in for a payday  regardless of the outcome of the series  The finals feature the faces of Nike and Under Armour in Lebron James and Stephen Curry  respectively  Both players have helped lift sales for their respective companies in the past few years 
However  news from both Nike and Under Armour this week indicated that their high profile athletes won t be enough to save sales this quarter  Earlier this week  Under Armour released a sales warning thanks to the Sports Authority s bankruptcy  This note largely confused investors but was enough to send the stock down nearly 5  Wednesday  Nike  on the other hand  was downgraded Wednesday by Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  to a neutral rating  Together  this reflects a high probability that both Nike and Under Armour fall short on earnings this quarter 

Nike has traditionally been a stalwart in the footwear and athletic apparel industry  With nearly a  100 billion valuation  the company has put up double digit gains quarter after quarter  The swoosh was relatively unopposed  particularly in the domestic market    until recently  that is  Under Armour s emergence has changed the landscape in the industry  Under Armour currently has the NBA s most popular player  Stephen Curry  endorsing its portfolio  What s more important is the price point  The Curry 2 is currently retailing for  130 while any premier Nike basketball shoe can go for more than  200 
Internationally  Adidas  DE ADSGN  still poses a threat to Nike  With the Euros and Olympics on deck this summer  sales for Nike should benefit  but could fall short of initial expectations given Adidas s resurgence  Meanwhile  Nike must also confront an apparel slow down  This quarter  core apparel sales have slowed 1  due to a shift to online shopping  weak consumer spending and excess inventory  Nike currently enforces that its third party retailers don t discount its products over 20   which has resulted in an over accumulation of inventory 

Earnings this quarter are already looking gloomy for Nike  The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 50 cents on  8 3 billion in revenue  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 4  increase on the bottom and 7  on the top  This is a significant drop off from past quarter  which delivered double digit gains  Estimates are also dropping rapidly and should continue to fall in the run up to its fourth quarter earnings 
Under Armour  on the other hand  seems to be falling from investor s good graces  After bursting onto the scene 5 years ago  the company has lately been stuck in mediocrity  Earlier this week  it issued a statement that the Sports Authority s bankruptcy would severely impact fiscal 2016 revenue  Sports Authority s decision to liquidate rather than restructure caused Under Armour to shift its full year guidance down  75 million to  4 92 billion  According to management  Sports Authority accounted for  120 million in revenue  some of which it was able to write down given the bankruptcy  Shares are down nearly 5  since the news broke with potential to fall even further 

It s no secret that earnings will be lower for Q2 and for the rest of fiscal 2016  The Estimize consensus is calling for earning per share of 4 cents on  1 billion in revenue  right in line with Wall Street  Earnings per share estimates have been cut by 33  in the last month and should continue to drop further given the recent revelations  Under Armour is still projecting double digit growth on the top and bottom line but significantly slower than previous quarters 
The footwear and athletic apparel industry  which has been one of the hottest  is hitting its first major obstacle  Both Nike and Under Armour suffered major setbacks this week that will impact earnings for the remainder of the year

189647,411163,UAA,Why Is Nike  NKE  Stock Down Today ,opinion,"On Thursday  shares of popular athletic retailer Nike Inc    NYSE NKE   are declining  down over 2  in afternoon trading due to a couple of reasons 
The company recently named Craig Zanon Vice President and general manager of its global basketball division in wake of the unexpected exit of Michael Jackson  Zanon was most recently overseeing Nike s global training business  but had previously run the basketball unit for seven years 
Nike said Zanon will continue to perform duties for the training business 
Jackson left the position after just two years  and his  resignation follows underwhelming holiday season signature shoe releases in North America   said Stifel analyst Jim Duffy in a note to clients on Wednesday 
Nike is also trading near its lowest level of the year  which could be in direct correlation to Jackson s departure  However  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  analyst Christian Buss and his team  remain long term bulls  on the company  reports  
Despite their bullish stance  the analysts believe that  in the near term the company is facing understandable momentum headwinds in North America as the company is likely to see sales deceleration from moderating category growth  competitors Under Armour   NYSE UA   and Adidas   OTC ADDYY   gaining footwear momentum for the first time in several years  and pricing challenges developing with pinnacle basketball product  ",2016-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-nike-(nke)-stock-down-today-200136459,200136459
189648,411164,UAA,Fight Club  Nike Vs  Under Armour,opinion,"The National Basketball Association  NBA  Finals was more than a battle between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors 
It was also a battle between Nike Inc   NYSE NKE  and Under Armour Inc   NYSE UA  

In a series that will go down in basketball lore  the game s two biggest stars went head to head for their teams and their brands 
Representing Nike  covered in tattoos  a receding hairline  and a body fat free frame    Lebron James  And in the other corner  representing Under Armour  with a pretty boy goatee and mouthguard dangling from his lips   Stephen Curry 
Nike practically invented the tactic of sponsoring athletes  However  they created another first with Lebron  they gave him a lifetime contract  No matter who Nike sponsors from now on  Lebron will be the lead man  And Nike knows he s worth it  during 2014  Nike s signature Lebron shoes generated  340 million in revenue 
Vested Interests
As an underdog  Under Armour had to use a different tactic to steal athletes away from Nike    they gave the athletes equity  This means that the athletes become part owners of the company  Many industries do this  but with the exception of Michael Jordan  this was unparalleled in sports apparel  Stephen Curry is just one of many prominent athletes in Under Armour s catalogue intrigued by the equity sharing program  Such a program motivates athletes to do more than just wear the brand  they truly represent the brand  After all  the better the brand does  the more the athletes make  Curry s shoe line is predicted by Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  to generate  160 million in revenue this year alone 
James and Curry also parallel their brands through their star statuses  James is an established star  dominating the league for over a decade  He offers tremendous returns for the Cavs  Nike provides substantial returns today  paying a dividend in each of the past 10 years and buying back shares in 7 of them 

The diversity to be the best player at any position makes Lebron unmatched  potentially in the history of the NBA  Nike s marketing and branding is largely unmatched in the apparel world  The Nike Swoosh is one of the most powerful logos in the world  creating an untouchable competitive advantage  This leads to pricing power  Lebron s shoes sell for upwards of  200  and fantastic margins  Gross Margin above 40  every year for the past decade  
LeBran
Always the floor general  Lebron sees opportunities and manages the game like few have before him  Whatever obstacles may get in the way  his teams persevere  The management at Nike has made the right decisions time and time again  Longtime co owner and chairman Phil Knight has maneuvered Nike through multiple child labour issues and kept them moving forward  increasing Free Cash Flow and Return on Equity every year for the past 5 
Lebron has perched himself at the top  and is imposing his will  Nike has become an apparel behemoth  and is one of the best value companies globally 
Stephen
Just as Lebron and Nike so perfectly align  so too do Curry and Under Armour  Curry was unheralded his whole life  fighting naysayers but ultimately exploding onto the scene  His ability to score from anywhere on the court is unlike anything the NBA has ever seen  Under Armour started out in a basement  with barely any interest from athletes  But after founder Kevin Plank created moisture wicking shirts  Under Armour became a household name 
After five seasons in the NBA  Curry truly emerged as a top talent  winning two straight Most Valuable Player  MVP  awards  His sharpshooting and unlimited range made him unguardable and revered by fans  Almost two decades after the first compression shirt  Under Armour has became a serious player in the sports apparel industry  Innovative endorsement deals have led to the company obtaining sponsorship with MVPs in all 4 major American sports  football Cam Newton  baseball Bryce Harper  hockey Carey Price  basketball Stephen Curry   This catalogue of players has led to Under Armour averaging nearly a 15  Return on Equity over the past 5 years 

The Road Ahead
Looking forward  Curry s best years are still to come  After years of trying to convince others he belongs with the NBA s elite  he has finally convinced himself too  From the shimmeys to the look away shots  Steph is radiating swagger  His best is yet to come as he pushes the boundaries of what to expect from a star  Long hidden in Nike and Reebok s shadow  Under Armour has grabbed some spotlight due to aggressive  innovative deals  It agreed to the largest ever apparel deal with a collegiate sports team  a 10 year deal with Notre Dame  Then this past May it one upped itself  agreeing to a 15 year deal with UCLA  These deals epitomize Under Armour s strategy of consistently reinvesting profits and its status as a growth company  Under Armour boasts Retained Earnings Growth averaging over 30  annually the past 9 years 
Curry is a generational talent only just finding himself  The game is his for the taking  Under Armour is finally developing and recognizing its strengths  It is a growth company with massive potential 
Curry and Lebron will continue to duke it out for the foreseeable future  With different styles  attitudes  and backgrounds  their opposite natures make them polarizing

What are you expecting for  
What was once thought to be Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  s biggest threat  Under Armour is beginning to fall from investor s good graces  The footwear and apparel company is scheduled to report first quarter earnings tomorrow with expectations generally low for the first time in a while  Earlier this month  Morgan Stanley issued a somber note suggesting Under Armour would miss its quarterly sales target  At the same time UA sponsored golfer  Jordan Spieth  had a historic collapse at the Masters  all of which put the stock in a tail spin  If earnings flop just a few weeks later  the stock might be in even more trouble
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 03 on revenue of  1 06  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  13 million  Since Morgan Stanley s downbeat note  per share estimates have been cut by 44   Still estimates forecast favorable comparisons with EPS predict to rise 11  on a 30  increase in sales  The stock typically exhibits strong upward mobility around earnings season  On average  shares climbed 2  in the month prior  reaching as high as 3  30 days following earnings  Apart of Jordan Spieth and the Morgan Stanley note  Under Armour made headlines when it completed its stock split  The split awarded Class A shareholders a stock dividend of the newly issued Class C shares  Simply  the move was designed to keep the current CEO  Kevin Plank  in firm control of the company  After the split  Plank now owns 15 9  of the company

189671,411187,UAA,NBA Finals Reignites Nike Under Armour Rivalry ,opinion,"For the second year in a row  Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers will take on Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals  While this year s Finals rematch promises to dazzle basketball fans on the court  it also represents a monumental faceoff in the sports apparel industry 
Curry vs  Lebron isn t just a basketball matchup  it s also the face of Under Armour   NYSE UA   squaring off against the highest paid active Nike   NYSE NKE   athlete 
James has been Nike s golden boy since he signed with the shoe company after being drafted straight out of high school  In December  he signed a lifetime contract with Nike  and although both parties left the details undisclosed  many estimate the deal was worth anywhere from  500 million to  1 billion 
Of course  Nike s basketball division was well established long before Lebron James came along  Despite his immense popularity  Lebron s shoe sales are just a fraction of what Michael Jordan and his Nike owned Air Jordan line bring in 
On the other hand  Curry has been the driving force behind Under Armour s growing basketball brand  In the first quarter  the company s revenues rose by 30  year over year  causing CEO Kevin Plank to joke that his sales rose by the same number that Curry wears on his jersey  also read    
The Numbers
Unlike the Cavaliers  who are looking to avenge their loss to the Warriors last year  it is Nike that has had the upper hand over Under Armour  With the dominance of the Jordan brand  which accounts for about 75  of all basketball shoe sales  Nike is well ahead of Under Armour and Adidas   OTC ADDYY   
When we look at the specific Curry and Lebron shoe lines  however  things become a whole lot closer  In fact  according to projections made by   Curry s signature line is expected to do  160 million in sales in 2016  This could outpace Lebron s signature line  which is expected to bring in about  150 million 
At the end of the day  sales of signature shoes will always be dwarfed by signature shoes  and both athletes serve to attract customers to their brands in any way possible 
Does Performance Matter  
Simply put  the result of the NBA Finals will mean much more to Under Armour than it will to Nike  While Lebron is their star  Nike s roster is incredibly deep and includes Kevin Durant  Cristiano Ronaldo  Kobe Bryant  Roger Federer  and Russell Westbrook  In fact  Nike was close to having its three biggest basketball players in the Finals before Westbrook and Durant s Thunder team blew their 3 1 series lead against the Warriors 
Don t get me wrong  Under Armour has boosted its roster with other superstar athletes like Jordan Spieth  Tom Brady  and Cam Newton  However  there is no doubt that Curry is the face of the company  and his continued success will only boost the Under Armour brand  After winning his second straight MVP award and leading his team to an NBA record 73 9 regular season  Curry is on the brink of a historic season 
Bottom Line
Basketball fans  make sure to enjoy yourselves over the next couple of weeks  Hopefully this NBA finals will be one to remember  While you re watching  take some mental notes  Which player rises above the other  Which player are people talking about more  Which player just feels  bigger  than the other 
If Curry can cap off the season with another title  it s clear that he will be the answer to all of those questions  That s very good news for Under Armour  No one is saying they ll pass Nike anytime soon  but they have to start somewhere  For Lebron and Nike  this series is about maintaining their position as the best for just awhile longer ",2016-06-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nba-finals-reignites-nike-under-armour-rivalry-200133743,200133743

Currency Fluctuation Rates
Foot Locker does a great deal of business outside of the United States  They have high exposure to some of the largest international markets as roughly 30  of 2014 total sales came from abroad  However  since the strength of the US dollar has been sustained  overseas stores are losing out when those sales are repatriated back to the dollar  Last quarter  currency conversions attributed to a loss of  100 million in profits  As a result  it s very possible prices will have to be increased to balance out the numbers and the 3rd quarter will reflect some losses 
Holiday Releases
Basketball shoes often account for a large portion of Foot Locker sales  as the company holds most of the major brand names  However  disappointing results from Dick s Sporting Goods  N DKS  on Tuesday don t bode well  The company hopes that the yearly special releases of  Jordan s    LeBron s  and even one of Adidas s most highly touted releases of all time  the new Derek Rose sneaker  will bolster same store sales into the holiday quarter  Though there have been reports of a decline in basketball shoe interest  Foot Locker is more than proficient in several of the other lines it carries  mainly running and casual 
The Foot Locker brand also appeals to youth via its Kid Foot Locker stores  The yearly  Week of Greatness   kicking off on November 21st and hosted by Kids Foot Locker nationwide  will feature some of the most anticipated footwear and apparel releases of the period  By snagging Golden State Warriors  star Stephen Curry for a 30 second promotional spot  kids will get to see the latest and greatest gear from Under Armour  N UA  and other brands that will be available in stores  Children have a large influence on parents and can drive some sales growth during the holiday season ",2015-11-20,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sneakers-galore!-what-to-watch-for-when-this-apparel-store-reports-earni-271968,271968

Inventory And Sales
Last quarter  Lululemon reported that inventory was up 55  year over year  The company claims that operating expenses  namely additional transport costs  significantly skyrocketed due to the problems at the West Coast ports  Because of late deliveries  the company has had to discount its clothing and accessories significantly to make up for any incurred losses 
However  sales for the quarter are expected to increase by about 15  year over year  as a combination of new store openings  same store sales and online sales are driving growth  Comps are expected to rise 9   definitely a positive figure for investors to consider 
Clothing Issues And Competition
In 2013  Lululemon s popular women s yoga pants were recalled because the fabric was see through  to the chagrin of customers  Recalls led the company to lose over  65 million in sales  Earlier in 2015  women s tops with drawstrings were causing facial injuries  The elastic cords on certain jackets and hoodies had the tendency to get caught on other objects  and snap back  potentially causing injury to the face or eyes of the wearer  The company had to recall approximately 300 000 units  Continued hiccups in clothing design could cause LULU s loyal customers  investors  and analysts to lose faith in the company 
In addition  Lululemon faces tough competition from giants like Nike  N NKE  and Under Armour  N UA   Both retailers sell their yoga pants for  45 and  60 a pair  respectively  while LULU sells theirs for  99 a pair  Yes  the company has a very loyal fan base that wears nothing but Lululemon yoga pants  but  99 a pair is expensive when significantly cheaper options exist  And  if another clothing disaster is in the future of this company  it s very likely that Nike and Under Armour will snatch up Lululemon s market share ",2015-12-08,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-this-yoga-inspired-retailer-rebound-from-previous-hiccups-375004,375004

189710,411226,UAA,Time Your Buys Like A Pro,opinion,"For traditional buy and hold investors  market timing probably doesn t mean much 
But here s the thing  It should  Believe it or not  many smart people are investing the wrong way every single day 
These investors see a stock on the rise and chase shares when everyone else is buying   and that means they re often buying too high  And then  when the market sells off  they dump shares along with everyone else   often at too low a price 
Professional traders know this and mint fortunes off the herd 
But by using one simple indicator  you can time your entries alongside the elite traders 
A Band Aid for Your Portfolio
Once you ve identified a quality stock  the first step is to buy shares at the lowest price you can  You see  stocks never go up or down in a straight line 
When a stock trends upward  it ascends the chart in waves  Shares rally under momentum and fall on profit taking 
In order to buy the dips and sell the rallies  I use one of my favorite technical indicators  Bollinger Bands 
Developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s  Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a stock s moving average  The bands  values are based on standard deviations from the moving average 
You can select any moving average and deviation  but traders typically use the 20 day moving average  DMA  and set the Bollinger Bands  at two standard deviations above and below the DMA 
I love Bollinger Bands because they combine several technical tools into an easy to use trend indicator  And because the bands utilize standard deviations  they adjust automatically for rapid changes in volatility 
Once the bands are set  price action bounces between the upper and lower band as momentum swings  The idea is to buy shares as they  tag  the lower band and sell as they tag the upper band  Let s look at an applied example 
Here s a one year chart of Under Armour Inc   N UA   one of 2015 s hottest stocks 

Over the last year  shares have outperformed the S P 500 by more than 60  
As you can see  price action is contained between the Bollinger Bands  And by timing your entry on a dip to the lower band  you can increase your profits by several percentage points 
On the chart  you ll notice three distinct buy signals  December 2014 January 2015  May June 2015  and August 2015  After executing a buy  you can sell on the upper band tag or hold until you ve hit your profit target 
Now  on a pricier large cap stock  a few percentage points in profit might not mean much  But if you re an options trader or short term trader  those points can be the difference between small gains and big money  And the bands become even more valuable when trading volatile small cap and mid cap stocks 
Bottom line  Don t chase red hot stocks at recent highs  Use Bollinger Bands to time the dips and get more bang for your buck

The expected drop in earnings this quarter is one reason why Fortinet s stock price may have gotten far ahead of its earnings price horizon  This quarter Estimize contributors expect earnings per share to fall to 7 cents from 11 cents last year  At the same time revenue is projected to climb from  167 million to  208 million according to the crowd at Estimize

Under Armour  NYSE UA   Nike s rival  reported on April 20 I m hard pressed to see any impact on Nike s chart  Under Armour has just moved lower  but Nike just keeps moving sideways  tightening around 100 

What do you do with a stock like this  One answer is nothing  Just watch for it to show you whether it wants to move up or down and then put on a position  If you own the stock already  then you can add a collar to protect against a move lower  Or  if you re savvy  you look to the options market 
The consolidation in the chart tells a story  but there is more to it  The Bollinger Bands  are very tight  How tight  They have not been so taught in over 4 and a half years  And that s often a signal that a big move is about to happen 
Of course the question is  which way will it go 
This is where the options market comes in  The weekly 100 Strike Straddle expiring in 3 days can be sold for  1 40  That suggests that market makers believe the price will stay between 98 60 and 101 40 by Friday  If you sold that Straddle  then you could use the proceeds to by a longer dated June 12 Expiry 100 Straddle  That one would cost about  4 15  but by selling the weekly Straddle  your cost is only  2 75 
To be profitable  the price by the June expiration needs to move by  2 75 more than it moves by this Friday  So if it closes at 100 50 Friday  then it would need to close over 103 25 by June  But if you capped your gain in June by selling the 95 105 Strangle for  1 00  your total cost is only  1 75  which lowers the required additional move in June by  1 to  1 75 
So  do you think the price of Nike will stay close to 100 this week and move out of these tight Bollinger Bands by June 12 ",2015-05-05,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-is-going-nowhere-250730,250730

Revenue growth is going to accelerate this quarter

Although Under Armour didn t live up to investors  expectations last quarter when it missed the Estimize earnings consensus by a penny per share  the market reacted favorably to a much better than expected revenue number  In July Under Armour reported sales of  609 65 million  beating the Wall Street consensus by 6 5  and topping Estimize by 2 4   Thursday analysts on Estimize are optimistic again  looking for sales growth of  214 million  30   compared to last year  A pace of 30  sales growth would be a slight drop sequentially  but an acceleration from the 26  increase registered in the same quarter of last year 

Under Armour is focusing its marketing efforts on unsaturated niches

In Under Armour s infancy the company ran an adrenaline fueled sweat soaked marketing campaign  The ads were pretty cool  but it was clear which demographic they focused on  The  We Must Protect This House  campaign captured the intensity of professional sports  Ads featured a ripped football player yelling  We must protect this house   as if he were a Spartan about to fight to his death in the Battle of Thermopylae 
Under Armour is now smartly changing gears targeting supplementary audiences  Earlier this year they produced an inspiring campaign with ballerina    Their latest blockbuster signing  Victoria s Secret super model   does a great job of carrying on the  I WILL WHAT I WANT  campaign focused on women  Her international celebrity also speaks volumes to Under Armour s global ambitions  Under Armour is doing a great job looking ahead and trying to expand rather than squandering promotional dollars on tapped out markets with decreasing marginal returns 

The athletic wear market is booming

It s rare that a company with between  600 million to  1 billion in sales each quarter can grow revenue by at least 30  in 4 consecutive quarters  but that s exactly what contributing analysts on Estimize expect Under Armour to do  Even companies with much larger volume are exploding right now  Just look at the earnings Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  posted in its most recent quarter below 

There is still a humungous market for Under Armour to grow into on international sales and perhaps some opportunity to wrestle market share away from Nike  Nike is doing 8x more sales than Under Armour and even it is continuing to grow by double digits on the top and bottom line respectively  27  and 15  last quarter   If the global athletic wear tailwinds persist  Under Armour is going to be a hot stock for years to come 
There s not much more to say  Under Armour has outperformed the Wall Street profit forecast in 7 of the past 8 quarters  In 5 of those periods contributing analysts on Estimize nailed the number  and they underestimated earnings only twice  The lone quarter where Under Armour failed to live up to the Estimize community s expectations was in the report from July  where revenues crushed expectations  This quarter you can expect more great results from Under Armour  Analysts on Estimize are expecting gigantic growth from the thriving athletic wear company and a beat relative to the Wall Street consensus of 2 cents in EPS and  10 million in sales ",2014-10-23,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-under-armour-is-growing-at-an-olympic-pace-229986,229986
189755,411271,UAA,Are Golf And Hunting Crippling Dick s Sporting Goods ,opinion,"The athletic apparel industry is exploding right now  but Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS  stock   17  year to date  isn t going through the roof like Nike s  NYSE NKE    23  ytd  and Under Armour s  NYSE UA    61  ytd  are  Athletic clothing and equipment sales are booming  but trouble in Dick s golf and hunting units are holding the retailer back 

The graph above shows the percent change in same store sales at Dick s Sporting Goods locations and Golf Galaxy shops  which the company also owns  Over the past year same store sales at Dick s have been improving by an average of 4 0  each quarter while revenue at Golf Galaxy has dropped an average of 9 5  

Even though golf and hunting have been under enormous pressure  total revenue at Dick s has been doing just fine  Throughout the previous 4 quarters total revenue has been up between 8  and 10  compared to the same quarter of one year prior 

Dick s improvement on the top line is being driven by new store openings and an expanding online presence  Like many other retailers Dick s is seeing more of its business shift from stores to e commerce   In the third quarter of the year online sales made up 7 3  of Dick s total revenue  up from 6 5  in 2013 
This quarter the company also added 24 new Dick s locations  1 Golf Galaxy  and 7 Field   Stream stores  which also helped increase total revenue without damaging same store comps too much  Between adding new stores and shifting the business in the favor of online retail  Dick s 9  total revenue gain has generated lower relative profits 
Tuesday Dick s reported earnings of 41 cents per share and revenue of  1 527 billion missing the i consensus on the top and bottom line by a small margin 
With the third quarter behind it Dick s will now gear up for the holiday period  Golf and hunting are continuing to drag down profits  but encouragingly same store sales are still positive and the company is continuing its planned expansion  
Going into the holiday quarter Dick s expects to see more pressure on margins due to promotional pricing and the higher costs associated with e commerce  As far as golf goes CEO Edward Stack said that Golf Galaxy is still profitable and the company is not exiting the golf business or abandoning its specialty retail chain 
For now the plan is to stay the course with golf  But if golf and hunting continue to weigh Dick s down  the plan could be subject to change ",2014-11-20,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-golf-and-hunting-crippling-dick’s-sporting-goods-233108,233108
189756,411272,UAA,Despite Periodic Corrections  Stocks Continue To Rise,opinion,"The Current State Of The Market

These are the facts about the current state of the market  These are not opinions nor am I trying to imply what the next move is  the information below should give you an idea of what to maybe expect 

 The S P 500 is down 4 96  from its all time high which it reached on 12 5 2014  the average correction since 2009 is 6 7  lasting on average 16 9 days  The average correction this year is 5 3  lasting 16 days  we are at 4 96  



 The VIX is now higher than the future months  since 2010 the returns after this happening have been mostly positive and promising



 The VIX is now 39  above its 10 day moving average and up 76  this month  up 99  from the 12 5 close with the S P 500 down only 4 96  



 The average VIX spike since 2013 from the  12 level has been roughly 64  we are at 76  now 







 Telechart s McClellan oscillator closed under  200  dead cat bounces start from these levels 







 The stocks that were holding up well finally got hit yesterday  Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Michael Kors  NYSE KORS  Under Armour  NYSE UA   and Zillow  NASDAQ Z  to name a few  What got hit first  the oil names  they were the ones that closed up yesterday  FIFO  first in first out   oil names are probably only good for a dead cat bounce  



 The Russell 2000 and the Microcaps are holding up better than the Dow and S P 500 since we peaked on 12 5  many view that as a positive  some might say that the smaller names have less overseas exposure  perhaps Russia  so they are holding up better 







A proprietary indicator from Pradeep Bonde has spiked to a level that has led to bounces 







 Even with yesterday s reversal we had more stocks up from the open than down

189775,411291,UAA,Under Armour Inc Is Poised For A Great Report,opinion,"Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday  April 24th  Under Armour is a high performance athletic wear manufacturer  The company s stock has been on fire lately but like many other growth stocks it has sold off over 13  since mid March  This quarter Wall Street is expecting Under Armour to report flat earnings compared to FQ1 of last year and a 26 5  gain in year over year revenue  In March competitor Nike blew earnings estimates out of the water and investors are expecting a great report from Under Armour too 


The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Under Armour to report 4c EPS and  597 11M revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 28 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 7c EPS and  608 25M in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Under Armour to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue by a considerable margin 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Under Armour s EPS everytime and has been more accurate in predicting revenue 5 times  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a large than usual differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 5c to 9c EPS and from  588 34M to  644 00M in revenues  This quarter we re seeing an average sized distribution of EPS estimates on Under Armour and a wider than usual distribution of revenue estimates 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS forecast fell from 6c to 4c while the Estimize consensus crept up from 6c to 7c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus was revised up from  580 75M to  597 11M while the Estimize consensus gradually rose from  592 81M to  608 25M  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is sana5000 who projects 5c EPS and  599 11M in revenue  sana5000 is ranked 57th overall among 4 200 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years sana5000 has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 57  and 44  of the time respectively throughout 169 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case sana5000 is expecting Under Armour to beat the Wall Street consensus on EPS and revenue but fail to live up to the Estimize com community s expectations 
Despite the sell off and earnings multiple trimming that Under Armour has suffered through lately  in early April Sterne Agee upgraded UA on the merits of its strong recent performance and potential for continued expansion in footwear and international markets  The Estimize community is looking for another good quarter of growth from Under Armour and expects year over year gains of 3c per share in earnings and 29  in revenue on Thursday

189795,411311,UAA,What I Would And Would Not Teach College Students About Finance,opinion,Most of Friday I spent as judge at the Global Investment Research Challenge for Washington  DC and Baltimore  I really like working with students  They are so earnest  and they work so hard Last year  the company was Under Armour  which was tough because it was a growth company  Very difficult to value  This year  the company was Marriott  which I think is even harder to value because of its asset light strategy  Further  they have bought back so much stock that not only is the company s tangible book value negative  but the unadjusted book value is negative too But for what it is worth  the students this year had similar views about the target company  and the range of target prices was small versus what I saw with Under Armour But when I listen to the students  I sometimes cringe  because I ve studied statistics to a far higher degree  Now  when I judge  I don t take my views into account  because I know I am in the minority  and the students don t know that they are getting bad methods for analysis  Let them listen to their professors  who don t have a clue as to how the economy really works  and express what they have learned But if I had control over what Finance students were taught  I would do the following 1  I would reduce the math content for finance students and increase the qualitative understanding of markets  No more MPT 2  I would increase the level of understanding on how to relate with people  because that makes a big difference in negotiating trades 3  I would want them to work in a simple business  like a hot dog cart  or mowing lawns  so that they could begin to get an idea of how tough it is to earn a profit  My best boss in my life grew up watching his parents  delicatessen  and it shaped his view of how to make a profit  I didn t have that as a kid  but I did have two parents who pointed out to me that life wasn t easy  The profits of my Dad s business were by no means certain  and evaporated in the early 80s  My Mom reinvested much of my Dad s earnings into her stock portfolio  far exceeding what most investors achieve  but with periods that would make you wonder  I partly paid for some of my college education by encouraging my Mom to buy a company that she previously sold that several years later went private for a handsome price 4  I would revise the concept of the cost of capital to make it credit centric  All the efforts to calculate the cost of equity capital from equity market correlations are bogus  They don t make any economic sense  In most cases  the cost of equity should not exceed the yield on an average CCC bond 5  I would tell them that changes in inflation and real GDP don t have as large of an impact on corporate profits as is commonly thought  both positively and negatively  I would tell them to focus on the stock  and drop the complex model  Few in the investment business work off a complex model  and if you need one  you can buy Value Line  which I like  which tries to use a single macroeconomic model for 1700 popular stocks   and I get the model for FREE  because my county library subscribes to the WHOLE ENCHILADA  and I can ride on their back  Morningstar too   I m generous with my insights  but I rarely pay for services  because I know that they can be obtained cheaply  most of the time PositivelyI would teach students to think on a higher level  Not this causes that  but this influences that  and a lot of other effects occur as a result  This is similar to Howard Marks  concept of  second level thinking  By the way  I would do the same thing for the SOA and CFA syllabuses  Modern Portfolio Theory is garbage  and needs to be abandoned  We understood the markets better prior to MPT I would teach students that markets are not neutral  and that there are people out there trying to deceive you  I ve had more than my share of charlatans that I have had to oppose In place of randomness  and statistics that imply randomness  I would teach about margin of safety  and tell them   Do your hard work  Analyze likely profitability  Analyze free cash flow  Analyze the likelihood that you are correct  make sure the price at which you are buying includes a significant margin of safety  I would tell them to analyze free cash flow  Today  with the company Marriott  that was the only thing that mattered  One team hit the nail on the head  The rest did not  The team that hit the nail on the head is going to Toronto to compete in the North American competition  Should they win  they go to the final round  I know not where Anyway  that is a start  As with Buffett  who always thinks of what is the best way to earn and compound earnings  it is far better to analyze successful businesses than to analyze what academics think about business  After all  what  academic has created a successful business  Few  if any ,2013-02-23,David

189812,411328,UAA,At the Local Investment Research Challenge,opinion,Yesterday I was a judge  one of five  for the Washington Baltimore Investment Research Challenge  Five teams from local colleges participated to analyze a prominent local company  Under Armour   My kids love the stuff  I hate to pay the price  I have to say that I admire all of the young men and women who presented to us   It takes a lot of guts to present to people 30 years older then you  The experience differential is considerable One practical difference is that the students apply many methods from Modern Portfolio Theory that are roundly ignored by most investment managers  Few investment managers apply Discounted Cash Flows  DCF   because it is too flexible  with too many parameters that are hard to calculate  Some apply reverse DCF  attempting to estimate the rate of return of companies at their current price  same problems exist  though the comparability of results is simpler My advice to future contestants would be to spend more time on qualitative issues and less on quantitative  Regarding quantitative issues  I would encourage abandoning DCF in favor of simpler valuation methodologies Also  I would discourage using regression unless you really understand what it means   It s easy to teach people to use advanced statistical methods  but tough to teach them the limitations of where the methods get abused  or don t work   As I have often said  I rarely see advanced statistics used properly by Wall Street  and yesterday was no exception But all that said  there are a lot of bright people entering the talent pool for investing  for investment firms in a given region  going to an event like this could be a good recruiting tool PS   make sure you understand the liability structure in full  also ,2012-03-04,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/at-the-local-investment-research-challenge-115792,115792
