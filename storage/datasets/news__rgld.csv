11475,232990,RGLD,Metals  This Is NOT Bearish,opinion,"Originally published on Tues Nov 5 for our ElliottWaveTrader members   Oftentimes  you need to have patience when it comes to the metals   You see  while they move very quickly when they do move  the rest of the time they simply consolidate until they are ready for their next big move 
We have been waiting to see if the market is going to provide us that deeper pullback we wanted to see  and today seems to have triggered that potential   But  not all charts are showing the same degree of weakness 
First  I want to highlight the GDXJ   At this point in time  I am starting to lean to the potential that we saw a leading diagonal off the mid October low  with this pullback being a wave ii   Alternatively  I will consider the yellow count  but I am just not seeing the follow through for that potential at this time   Ultimately  the next time we rally over what I have now counted as wave i  I think that will be a very bullish trigger   But  please take note of the very overlapping decline in the GDX since the highs  and compare that to the very impulsive rally on the left side of the chart  This is ordinarily a very bullish set up 
Second  while I am not going into the specifics of the various individual miners we have been tracking on the weekend  they have finally provided us with the last leg down we had wanted to see for a more appropriate retracement   While Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  has dropped a bit lower than I had initially expected  it is still quite corrective in structure   So  while there still may be a bit more weakness seen in the coming week in the complex  this is still quite a corrective looking pullback  and likely setting us up for the next major rally phase 
Silver is a bit of an issue to me right now   I have no indications that it has a 5 wave structure off the early October low   And  while this pullback can be a 4th wave in a bigger wave  1  of a leading diagonal  I cannot say that I am terribly comfortable with that count   The more likely count seems to suggest a bigger c wave as presented now in green   And  as long as we remain below the 18 region  I am going to maintain that as my primary expectation   But  again  that simply suggests we will be completing this a b c structure in larger degree  and it will likely set us up for the next major rally phase   But  if the market finds a bottom sooner rather than later  then I will expect it to provide us with a 5th wave to wave  1   as outlined in yellow 
SPDR  Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  seems to be the clearest micro structure I am tracking at this time   As I noted last week  the market and price of gold are setting up for a potential deeper pullback  and today s drop has certainly increased that potential   As it stands now  the most likely count seems to be today s bottom counting as wave iii of 3  with the consolidation being wave iv of 3  
But  I also have to note that it is VERY rare for wave iii of 3 to only strike the 1 00 extension of waves 1 and 2   While that is a standard target within our Fibonacci Pinball structure  it is rare that we see it as the target for iii of 3 within the metals complex  which normally sees strong extensions  
Yet  it really seems to be the best count I can see at this time  so I am maintaining it as my primary for as long as we remain below 141   Should we see an impulsive rally through 141  then I will consider something more immediately bullish  as presented by the blue count 
Lastly  as far as the GDX  NYSE GDX   to be honest  it can count similarly to the GDXJ  or it can make a lower low in its wave ii   Since the rally off the last lows is overlapping  it is hard to rely upon a leading diagonal   And  since we are so close to that last low  I can easily see a bit more weakness providing a deeper drop towards our target for wave ii 





Now  if you have not figured out that this is an opportunity for those that are looking to add to their positions in the metals complex  then allow me to state so quite clearly   You see the support boxes on our charts  and a deeper pullback should be viewed by investors as a buying opportunity  and placing your stops below the support boxes   However  as I said many times before  I do not see the opportunity to get  aggressive  on the long side  options leverage  until we either see a better 1 2 structure off a bottom  or a break out over last week s highs

11486,233001,RGLD,Mining Prospects,opinion,"Before looking at some individual mining prospects  a word about GDX  NYSE GDX   Consider that NEM and GOLD comprise 21 8  of GDX  These two companies both purchased rival companies is 2019  In January  GOLD acquired Randgold  LON RRS   a  6 5b deal  and in April  NEM purchased its top rival  NEM  for  10b 

If invested in GDX  keep tabs on exploration costs and production of NEM and GOLD to monitor their strength  It is an increasing challenge for them to find new gold to mine economically at the scale and pace their size demands 

If you insist on an ETF to trade the gold miners  then consider GDXJ instead of GDX  as mid tier and junior gold mining stocks may outperform the large miners 

For mining prospects beyond GDX and GDXJ  one can make their own basket of royalty and mining production companies that will likely outperform  The smaller miner shave lower market caps and smaller capital inflows 

Royalty streaming companies help fund exploration and production projects  in exchange for a royalty on future production  They are specialized financiers  sans the hard work of operating a mine  Royalty and streaming stocks have substantially lower costs and greater margins  are well diversified with less exposure to risk  and some pay a dividend 

Wheaton Precious Metals  SIX SLW  is the largest precious metal streaming company in the world  Franco Nevada Corporation  TSX FNV  and RGLD are two other large players  Franco Nevada has streams from GOLD  NEM  AEM  SSRM   NEM  AUY  HL  SBGL  CDE  PAAS  KGC  KL  and many more

11495,233010,RGLD,3 Stocks With Momentum Anomaly To Boost Portfolio Returns,opinion,The market is focused  and rightfully so  on global trade developments amid the continuing tariff war between the world s two largest economies  Last Friday  President Trump announced that the first phase of a deal with China had been agreed upon  The partial settlement  which includes agriculture  currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections  is considered to be the first step to end the 15 month old tussle The United States will delay its planned tariff hike on  250 billion of Chinese imports  supposed to take effect on Oct 15  Meanwhile  additional 15  of tariffs on all Chinese goods could still start on Dec 15 unless the second phase is settled upon  Undoubtedly  the development is a positive sign to the markets  in the sense that escalation is temporarily halted For long term investors  reacting emotionally to volatile trends can be more damaging to a portfolio s performance than the downturn itself  given the prevailing circumstances  By adhering to a well thought out investment plan  investors may be better off during periods of short term uncertainty  When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  This is known as momentum investing At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction  There s a whole list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence  hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early  Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such mistakes Momentum strategy works because investors initially tend to underreact to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions So  basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future  Momentum investing is  thus  based on that gap in time which exists before the mean reversion occurs i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across market stages  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to be implemented as detecting these trends well ahead of time is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers when there is a short term pullback in price  and rake in handsome gains Screening ParametersPercentage Change in Price  52 Weeks    Top  50  This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks  This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year Percentage Change in Price  1 Week    Bottom  10  From the above 50 stocks  we then choose those that are

or bad  stocks sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Momentum  of B or better  While ensuring solid momentum features  a momentum score of A or B knocks out a lot of the screening process  as it takes into account several factors including volume change and relative performance  Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Buy   handily outperform other stocks Current Price greater than  5  The prices of the stocks should not be too low Market Capitalization   Top  3000  We have chosen stocks that are

rightfully so  on global trade developments amid the continuing tariff war between the world s two largest economies  Last Friday  President Trump announced that the first phase of a deal with China had been agreed upon  The partial settlement  which includes agriculture  currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections  is considered to be the first step to end the 15 month old tussle The United States will delay its planned tariff hike on  250 billion of Chinese imports  supposed to take effect on Oct 15  Meanwhile  additional 15  of tariffs on all Chinese goods could still start on Dec 15 unless the second phase is settled upon  Undoubtedly  the development is a positive sign to the markets  in the sense that escalation is temporarily halted For long term investors  reacting emotionally to volatile trends can be more damaging to a portfolio s performance than the downturn itself  given the prevailing circumstances  By adhering to a well thought out investment plan  investors may be better off during periods of short term uncertainty  When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  This is known as momentum investing At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction  There s a whole list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence  hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early  Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such mistakes Momentum strategy works because investors initially tend to underreact to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions So  basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future  Momentum investing is  thus  based on that gap in time which exists before the mean reversion occurs i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across market stages  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to be implemented as detecting these trends well ahead of time is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers when there is a short term pullback in price  and rake in handsome gains For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers

11505,233020,RGLD,Signs Still Point To Lower Levels In Precious Metals,opinion,"Originally published on Sat  Oct  12 for our ElliottWaveTrader members   While we have been tracking the metals market for the next rally set up  we have seen some signs that the market may attempt to begin that rally sooner rather than later   However  I have to be honest in noting that I am seeing more signs that lower levels for gold may still be struck before we are ready for that rally  
So  as I have been saying for the last few weeks  I am going to still treat the market as likely needing more of a corrective downside structure before we begin the next rally phase until the market is able to prove otherwise  
I ll begine with the chart that probably provides me the clearest perspective of further weakness in the coming weeks   I have referred to this chart several times in the past due to the textbook pattern is has been providing to us  as well as an illustration of the type of move I expect in the heart of a 3rd wave in some of the other mining stocks we are tracking   The chart I speak of is Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   
While the move in wave  3  on this chart is what I expect to see in the Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners  NYSE GDXJ  next  I have to note that the RGLD chart rather clearly pointis to a c wave lower in this current pullback before we are ready to embark on the next major rally phase   It s quite compelling in its simplicity and standard structure 
When I review all the other charts  they all line up reasonably well within this perspective of a needing more corrective downside   While a bounce can still take hold before this happens  I think the preponderance of the evidence suggests that lower levels can still be seen in the complex before what I am counting as a 2nd wave pullback completes  
The one standout to me right now is that the gold price per ounce  via SPDR  Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   may actually have already completed its pullback for what I am counting as a wave iv in that chart 
Yet  as I have said many times before  if the market can stage a strong impulsive rally over the coming week or two  followed by a corrective 2nd wave pullback  with a rally back over the high struck in the initial rally  then I will clearly abandon expectations of further corrective action  and immediately turn uber bullish  But  until such time  I am still going to maintain expectations of lower levels to be seen before this current pullback consolidation completes ",2019-10-17,Avi Gilburt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/signs-still-point-to-lower-levels-in-precious-metals-200474316,200474316

from Friday s Analyst Blog Gold Price Rebounds on Global Growth Concerns  5 Top PicksGold prices are set to record the first weekly gain  reversing the downtrend of the past one month  On Sep 19  spot gold was up 0 3  at  1 503 20 per ounce and U S  gold futures were also up 0 3  at  1 510 9 per ounce Behind the UptickA second rate cut by the Fed just a day before and a weaker U S  dollar are the primary reasons for gold s uptick  The lower the interest rates  the lesser will be the opportunity cost of holding the non yielding bullion  making gold attractive for investors holding other currencies Gold price climbed to more than 1 500 per ounce for the first time in August since April 2013 on concerns related to the prolonged U S  China trade war and a global economic slowdown  Buying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil Notably  at the end of 2018  around  8 trillion was invested in bonds with negative returns  However  this figure has increased substantially to  16 trillion so far in 2019  This clearly indicates worldwide slowdown fears among market participants Trimmed Projections for Global Economic GrowthOn Sep 19  the Organization of Economic Co Operation and Development  OECD   an intergovernmental economic group  projected that the world economy will grow just 2 9  in 2019  the lowest forecast since 2009  The OECD forecast 4  global growth in 2019 just 18 months ago The International Monetary Fund  IMF  reduced its growth forecasts for the global economy for 2019 and 2020  It predicts growth of 3 2  in 2019  down from its April forecast of 3 3   The world economy is expected to witness growth of 3 5  in 2020  lower than its previous projection of 3 6  Moreover  the World Bank also squeezed its global growth forecast for 2019 to 2 6  from the previously forecast 2 7  growth   All three economic organizations have cited the tariff war between the United States and China as the primary reason for global slowdown given its adverse effect on exports and manufacturing  Additionally  geopolitical problems stemming from Brexit and Middle East have intensified fears of a global downturn U S  China Trade Conflict ContinuesOn Sep 19  Michael Pillsbury  a key White House adviser said the Trump administration is set to increase tariff pressure on China if a trade deal is not agreed upon soon as Washington has so far imposed only  low level tariffs  on China The hard statement came at a time when the two sides are going to meet this week in order set stage for a high level meeting to reach at least an interim trade deal  Further escalation of tariff will be disastrous for a struggling Chinese economy as well as for the U S  economy

11513,233028,RGLD,Middle East Tensions Lift Oil Prices  Here s How To Gain,opinion,Oil prices are currently trending higher owing to rising Middle East tensions and an attack on Saudi oil facility that led to a disruption in the global supply of crude  The coordinated drone strikes on key Saudi oil facilities have removed nearly 5  of global supplies  an attack that the United States blamed Iran for U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the attack was a  state on state act of war  by Iran  but the United States is still committed to find a diplomatic solution with Iran  U S  Secretary of Defense Mark Esper added that the United States will send troops to Saudi Arabia but that would be  defensive in nature   U S  treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said that  the United States will continue its maximum pressure campaign against Iran s repressive regime  which attempts to achieve its revolutionary agenda through regional aggression while squandering the country s oil proceeds  Needless to say  the coordinated drone strikes affected the world s largest oil procession plant  In fact  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that almost 5 7 million barrels a day of crude oil and gas have been affected Meanwhile  a positive trade deal between the United States and China would support crude since the trade dispute has impeded global economic expansion  Things are  in fact  looking up at the trade front  While U S  Trade Representative s office did say that trade talks with China were  productive  over the weekend  China s Commerce Ministry added that the talks were  constructive  Concerns about economic recession were also weighing on crude prices for quite some time  But  higher factory output and strong consumer spending data have eased worries about an impending recession The Federal Reserve recently said that industrial production  a measure of factory  mining and utility output  increased at a seasonally adjusted rate

their share prices as oil prices scale upward  Energy shares have been one of the poorest performers so far this year  however  now this continuous uptick in oil prices will surely lure investors back In fact  the recent rise in oil prices will improve margins of oilfield service contractors  Per Rystad Energy  the oilfield service industry was badly affected during the oil price collapse in 2014 and 2015  But now  as oil prices have continued to scale up  almost 60  the top 50 oilfield service contractors have said that their margins have improved  Oilfield service contractors have collectively registered an EBITDA margin of 15 2 in the first half of 2019  compared with 14 6  in the year ago period As crude oil prices move north  prices of essential goods and commodities also increase  And value of gold rises when inflation picks up  After all  it acts as a hedge against inflation  In fact  theoretically  more than 60  of the time  gold and crude oil have a direct

gold was up 0 3  at  1 503 20 per ounce and U S  gold futures were also up 0 3  at  1 510 9 per ounce Behind the UptickA second rate cut by the Fed just a day before and a weaker U S  dollar are the

sales fell 11 2  compared to a decrease of just 3 9  in the prior year s quarter  The decline was driven by a fall in store sales which was partially offset by an increase in e commerce sales Store traffic fell at a double digit rate even as e commerce rose 22  as customers shifted more of their buying online The company said it would be spending more on promotion to lower inventory and would increase marketing spend to drive traffic  highlight new products and target new customers Lowered Earnings Guidance AgainWith the challenging retail conditions  and the big miss in the quarter  it s not surprising that it lowered its full year earnings guidance for the second time since March It now expects earnings to be in the range of a loss of  1 25 to a loss of  1 50  That is down significantly from its prior earnings range in June 2019 which was a range of flat to  0 15 Not surprisingly  the analysts are cutting earnings estimates as well The Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to a loss of  1 44 from a loss of  0 44 since the earnings report That s actually an earnings decline of 484  as it made  0 38 last year Shares Down Big in 2019Given its continuing slide in sales and earnings misses  it s not surprising that the shares have taken it on the chin  They re down 84  year to date And there s no dividend to give shareholders something for their patience while the company enacts its turnaround strategy Bottom LineDespite being able to slash its debt by  150 million as a result of the sale  Vista s firearm divestiture turnaround plan will prove tough for the company  especially now that Walmart  NYSE WMT  is banning the sale of all handgun ammunition and certain long gun rounds Will GameStop Be Able to Reinvent Itself GameStop shares have been sliding after the video game retailer reported disappointing Q2 earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday  GME is trading down about 1 4  on Thursday  but plunged almost 10  Wednesday  Year to date  the stock has plummeted over 64  The company s weak Q2 performance follows its decision to eliminate its quarterly dividend payments back in Q1  GameStop is in the middle of a reinvention  choosing to prioritize its balance sheet in order to avoid a J C  Penney  type mishap  GameStop is looking to revitalize itself from the ground up  but this most recent quarter didn t show much promise about a comeback  What can the company do to bring back the glory days How GameStop Can Revive Its BusinessGameStop needs to make some major changes if it wants to survive the onslaught of the digital marketplace  and the impact it has had on traditional brick and mortar shops  The company s sales have steadily declined due to gamers turning to digital storefronts for their games  Microsoft s Xbox Game Pass and Sony s PS Now also must be addressed by GameStop  The former gaming hub must adapt its old fashioned stores to what the modern gaming consumer wants to see in shops  the company could consider outfitting its shops for esports enthusiasts  monetizing its collectible items  and revamping its loyalty program in a way that caters to digital purchases Over the past few years  esports has taken the world by storm  it s especially popular with people between the ages of 18 34  In 2019  it was estimated that the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers and revenue would increase to over  1 billion  One way GameStop could easily attract more competitive gamers  as well as increase store traffic  is to expand their presence in esports Successfully bringing in esports enthusiasts would  in turn  bring up their follower counts  which are central to the growth and promotion of esports  GameStop could potentially hold amateur to semi pro tournaments for eager players looking to test their gaming skills  The excitement of playing for some type of prize and bragging rights should be enough to entice participation The company should also look to capitalize on the only growing segment of its business  its collectible items  For example  Minecraft is the best selling video game of all time  and is extremely popular with kids between 6 13 years old  GameStop  which offers collectible items from the game like torches  pick axes  and the coveted diamond sword has benefited from the demand Young kids and older consumers alike enjoy collectible video game items  and GameStop should focus on capitalizing on this demand  Focusing on offering unique collectible items that would appeal to young and older consumers could help increase store traffic as well  GameStop stores look the same as they did 15 years ago  and restructuring its stores to better appeal to what gets modern consumers in the door will be key going forward GameStop has lost a large amount of its consumers to digital storefronts  not just because of the convenience of buying games from home  but because these store fronts offer enticing subscription based memberships that offer free games and discounts on various other games  Reconfiguring its existing royalty program to better cater to digital transactions rather than physical game purchases would be a big first step in gaining back those customers The company is also known for carrying classic video games  and a rewards program that offers backward compatible games would bring in many nostalgic players  GameStop could also involve their collectible merchandise in their rewards program  which would be sure to kickstart its program Bottom Line GameStop is the latest retailer falling victim to the expanding digital market  and right now  is at risk if it doesn t find a way to reinvent itself  The company was once a hub for gaming and seems to be desperately hanging on to its old self  A complete transformation focusing on esports and collectibles could be the answer for the company to keep its traditional brick and mortar shops up and running The modern consumer likes to be in an interactive environment while shopping  and restructuring its stores into an interactive and stimulating experience for its consumers could help drive store traffic  Ecommerce will likely prove to be the most difficult transition to make but will be pivotal to the company s survival and success Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775

11549,233064,RGLD,Gold Glitters On US China Trade War Jitters  6 Top Picks,opinion,Gold price continues its dream run as more than a year long trade dispute and tariff war between the United States and China is deteriorating by the day  Despite the fact that talks and discussions to reach a solution haven t stopped  the ground reality is that the two largest trading nations are falling deep in crisis No Ray of Hope on Trade War FrontOn Aug 23  China announced that it will impose 5  to 10  tariff on another  75 billion of U S  goods in two tranches  on Sep 1 and Dec 15  Additionally  a 25  tariff on U S  auto products and auto parts will be imposed effective Dec 15 In retaliation  President Donald Trump decided to raise tariff to 30  from the existing 25  on  250 billion Chinese goods  Moreover  he also raised the tariff from 10  to 15   which is to be levied on an additional  300 billion of Chinese exports effective Sep 1  Consequently  tariff on  550 billion Chinese goods will cover total U S  imports from China per annum Furthermore  Trump tweeted by issuing an order to U S  companies to look for an alternative to China for their operations including returning home  President Trump also hinted that prolonging U S  China trade conflict can lead to the imposition of national emergency  though not immediately Following these negative developments  Wall Street plunged on Aug 23  Three major stock indexes    the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite    plummeted 2 4   2 6  and 3   respectively  So far in August  these indexes have lost 4 6   4 5  and 5 2   respectively  owing to global economic slowdown and fear of a U S  recession due to a lingering trade spat Gold Continues Dream RunOn Aug 23  gold futures for December Delivery surged 1 9  to  1 537 60 per ounce  This marked the highest gold price since April 2013  Spot gold price also soared 1 9  to 1 525 51 an ounce  Year to date  return to gold has jumped 18 9   surpassing the market s benchmark S P 500 Index s gain of a 13 6    Gold price climbed to more than 1 500 per ounce for the first time in August since April 2013 on concerns of U S  and global recession as well as anticipation of market participants for further rate cuts  The lower the interest rates  the lesser will be the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold attractive for investors holding other currencies Three Future Drivers of Gold PriceBuying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil First  on Aug 23  Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered a speech from an annual central banking symposium in Jackson Hole  WY  where he once gain reiterated that the central bank will do whatever necessary to  expand an 11 year long U S  business expansion  It clearly gives hints of a likely second rate cut at the Fed s next FOMC meeting scheduled in Sep 17 18  As per CME FedWatch  respondents currently assigned a 100  probability for a second rate cut in September after a quarter basis point cut in July Second  yields on 2 year and 10 year U S  Treasury Notes inverted on Aug 23 at 1 528  and 1 523   respectively  Inversion of the main treasury yield curve happened for the first time on Aug 14  since Dec 2005  After that the 2 10 Treasury bond yield inversion happened three more times within the next 10 days  Several economists consider this bond market situation as a clear signal of an impending recession Third  on Aug 23  the ICE  NYSE ICE  U S Dollar Index  which measures the price of U S  currency against six major global currencies  fell 0 5  to 97 72  U S  dollar slid on fears of global economic slowdown stemming from trade dispute  Expectation of low interest rate made U S  dollar less attractive to investors  thereby making gold more demanding Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in gold stocks with strong growth potential  We have narrowed down

between the United States and China is deteriorating by the day  Despite the fact that talks and discussions to reach a solution haven t stopped  the ground reality is that the two largest trading nations are falling deep in crisis No Ray of Hope on Trade War FrontOn Aug 23  China announced that it will impose 5  to 10  tariff on another  75 billion of U S  goods in two tranches  on Sep 1 and Dec 15  Additionally  a 25  tariff on U S  auto products and auto parts will be imposed effective Dec 15 In retaliation  President Donald Trump decided to raise tariff to 30  from the existing 25  on  250 billion Chinese goods  Moreover  he also raised the tariff from 10  to 15   which is to be levied on an additional  300 billion of Chinese exports effective Sep 1  Consequently  tariff on  550 billion Chinese goods will cover total U S  imports from China per annum Furthermore  Trump tweeted by issuing an order to U S  companies to look for an alternative to China for their operations

recession as well as anticipation of market participants for further rate cuts  The lower the interest rates  the lesser will be the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold attractive for investors holding other currencies Three Future Drivers of Gold PriceBuying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil First  on Aug 23  Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered a speech from an annual central banking symposium in Jackson Hole  WY  where he once gain reiterated that the central bank will do whatever necessary to  expand an 11 year long U S  business expansion  It clearly gives hints of a likely second rate cut at the Fed s next FOMC meeting scheduled in Sep 17 18  As per CME FedWatch  respondents currently assigned a 100  probability for a second rate cut in September after a quarter basis point cut in July Second  yields on 2 year and 10 year U S  Treasury Notes inverted

Index  which measures the price of U S  currency against six major global currencies  fell 0 5  to 97 72  U S  dollar slid on fears of global economic slowdown stemming from trade dispute  Expectation

11553,233068,RGLD,4 Stocks With Momentum Anomaly To Buy Right Away,opinion,Of late  the increased market volatility  primarily due to the long running trade tussle between the world s two largest economies  has resulted in renewed panic for many investors While it may be difficult to remain calm during a steep market decline  it s important to remember that volatility is part of investing  For long term investors  reacting emotionally to volatile trends can be more damaging to portfolio performance than the downturn itself  By adhering to a well thought out investment plan  investors may be better off during periods of short term uncertainty When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  This is known as momentum investing At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction There s a whole list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early  And momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such mistakes Momentum strategy works because investors initially tend to underreact to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future  Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across market stages

11559,233074,RGLD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Atlantic Power  American Water  KB  Kinross Gold And Royal Gold,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  July 22  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Atlantic Power Corp    TSX AT    American Water Works Company  Inc    NYSE AWK    KB Home   NYSE KBH    Kinross Gold Corp    NYSE KGC   and Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog Fresh Hopes of a Fed Rate Cut Boost These 5 StocksFed officials are now going all out to drop hints of more aggressive policy easing  New York Fed President John Williams  NYSE WMB  is the latest to say that a rate cut will be a wise strategy at the first signs of an economic downturn  Meanwhile  the U S  economy is at the brink of a slowdown  which definitely calls for rate cuts Needless to say  rate sensitive stocks tend to rise in an environment when rates are declining as it eventually leads to cheaper borrowing costs  Thus  investing in real estate and utility players seems like a wise move  Gold is another lucrative investment option as its prices rise on hopes of more policy easing Dovish Fed CommentsWilliams recently said that since the federal funds rate is near zero  the most effective strategy for the Fed is to trim rates at the slightest sign of economic distress  Williams said in a speech at a research conference in New York that  when you have only so much stimulus at your disposal  it pays to act quickly to lower rates at the first sign of economic trouble  Market pundits expect Williams to endorse half point rate cut at the Fed s next policy meeting on Jul 30 31  Traders in the fed funds futures market now see more than a 50  chance of a rate cut in July  up from 34  a day ago By the way  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dropped enough hints regarding a potential rate cut later this month  and this is primarily because of two major issues  First  as Powell categorically puts it  trade related matters remain unresolved  and second  concerns about global economic growth continue to weigh on the U S  economy Powell s statement to the House lawmakers comes at a time when President Trump is relentlessly building pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates to bolster the U S  economy  In fact  Trump recently tweeted that he wants to appoint Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller for the Federal Reserve board  Both of them are known to have supported lower interest rates  They believe that lower interest rates and a loose monetary policy will help the economy expand in the near term While Shelton openly said that the federal funds rate should be around zero  Waller has completely rejected the Phillips Curve argument that as jobless rate declines  wages should improve leading to higher inflation  necessitating rise in rates Rate Sensitive Stocks to Make MerryWith the Fed widely expected to not hike rates in the near future  shares of rate sensitive utilities and real estate will certainly climb  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Thus  low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits However  higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Rate hikes are also a dampener to real estate activities  After all  higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for projects  which will significantly affect companies  predominantly involved in the construction business Gold Prices to RiseThanks to the dovish expectations  gold prices are expected to rise  This is because lower interest rates tend to make bonds and other fixed income investments less attractive Money will flow out of bonds and money market funds as they can t provide higher yields  and in turn may flow into gold  It s worth pointing out though that the yellow metal offers no yield at all Top 5 WinnersWe have  thus  selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid sectors that are poised to gain from decelerated hikes in the near term  These stocks flaunt a

initially  said that it captured the British flagged vessel after it collided with a fishing boat  However  it is widely anticipated that such a move follows the British forces  capture of an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar  alleged to have been transporting oil to Syria Meanwhile  Jeremy Hunt  British foreign secretary  has confirmed that the U K  government is looking to release the vessels  Iranian news agencies  however  confirmed that the Liberian flagged tanker was later released Such seizures add to tensions between Iran and the West  especially after the U S  Navy brought down an Iranian drone that had come close to one of its ships  Trump s national security adviser  John Bolton had said that the Iranian drone was shot down as it  posed a threat to the ship and its

11562,233077,RGLD,Oil Prices Rise Ahead Of Likely Fed Rate Cut  5 Top Picks,opinion,Oil prices have been weighed down of late by the two pronged effect of clear signs of a supply glut and the trade war apprehensions that is denting demand for oil and other commodities  However  oil prices ended in the green in the last four trading sessions on optimism that the Fed will cut rates for the first time since the financial crisis this week  In fact  in the last trading session the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude went up 1 2  to  56 87 a barrel  And when it comes to Brent crude  the global oil benchmark rose 0 4  to settle at  63 71 a barrel No doubt  a rate cut will propel economic expansionary activities and fuel demand for oil in the United States  which is the world s biggest oil consumer  Fed officials are expected to begin their two day meeting on Jul 30  and are widely expected to proceed with an interest rate cut by a quarter point In fact  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dropped enough hints regarding a potential rate cut this month  and this is primarily because of two major issues  First  as Powell categorically puts it  trade related matters remain unresolved  and second  concerns about global economic growth continue to weigh on corporate earnings Powell s statement to the House lawmakers comes at a time when President Trump is relentlessly building pressure

at an annualized rate of 4 3  in the second quarter  adjusted for inflation  and outpaced expectations  In fact  consumer outlay in the said quarter registered the fastest growth rate since fourth quarter 2017 and also the fifth fastest since first quarter 2006 How to Play Oil s Northward Journey It s quite obvious  from bigwig oil producers to rig operators to pipeline owners to refiners  all

the year ago quarter s  83 5 million  driven by increased stream sales from Mount Milligan  Andacollo  Wassa and Rainy River mines  Nonetheless  this upside was partly offset by lower gold and silver sales from the Pueblo Viejo mine  Further  royalty revenues declined to  25 4 million from the prior year quarter s  32 7 million  due to a revenue fall in the Pe asquito mine  Nevertheless  reduced royalty revenues were partly muted by an increase in revenues from the Cortez royalty interests Royal Gold  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Operational HighlightsRoyal Gold s volume of 88 400

Further  the revenue figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  424 9 million  This downside resulted from a drop in stream revenues  and lower average gold  silver and copper prices Financial PositionNet cash provided by operating activities was  253 million in fiscal 2019 compared with  329 million in fiscal 2018  The company ended the fiscal year with  119 million cash in hand  up from

11573,233088,RGLD,SAH  DLPH  PINS  TWTR  FB  BTG And RGLD Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 8  2019    Sonic Automotive   NYSE SAH   as the Bull of the Day  Delphi Technologies   NYSE DLPH   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Pinterest   NYSE PINS    Twitter   NYSE TWTR    Facebook   NASDAQ FB    B2Gold   NYSE BTG   and Royal Gold   NASDAQ RGLD   Here is a synopsis of all seven stocks  One of the largest auto retailers in the U S   Sonic Automotive is a company with dealership franchises that sell new and used cars  the sale of replacement parts  vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services  and arrangement of extended warranty contracts Q1 Earnings Cement Growth PromiseEarnings of 62 cents per share and revenues of  2 6 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate But the biggest surprise of the quarter came from its EchoPark pre owned vehicle retail chain  Even though it only accounts for about 10  of Sonic s total sales  the company expects EchoPark to bring in over  1 billion in revenue this year  it generated revenue of  249 6 million in Q1  increasing 90  year over year EchoPark also became profitable in Q1  bringing in profits of  0 2 million before taxes  As we expand our footprint into other areas across the country  we believe EchoPark will exceed the overall volumes and profitability of our franchised dealerships   said CEO David Smith Sonic doesn t provide guidance  but analysts expect the company s top line to grow 70  this year and bottom line to increase 15  SAH is SoaringShares of Sonic soared this year  jumping more than 100  compared to the S P 500 s return of roughly 15  Earnings estimates have since been rising  and the stock is now a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  For the current fiscal year  four analysts have revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate risen 18 cents from  2 07 to  2 25  2020 looks pretty strong too  with earnings and revenue expected to show positive year over year growth SAH currently trades at 11 8X its forward full year earnings estimates  a discount compared to the broader Retail Wholesale Market  If Sonic can continue to capitalize and expand on EchoPark  investors can likely expect to see further upside to shares Thanks to EchoPark s soaring sales  the future is looking promising for Sonic Automotive  If you re an investor searching for a broader retail sector stock to add to your portfolio  make sure to keep SAH on your shortlist  Delphi Technologies develops  designs and manufactures powertrain technologies for original equipment manufacturers  The company s operating segment consists of Powertrain Systems and Products   Service Solutions  it supplies a full suite of aftermarket products  including engine control modules  pumps  injectors  fuel modules  exhaust gas recirculation valves  brakes  steering and suspension Q2 Earnings Weaker Than ExpectedEarnings of 58 cents per share lagged behind our consensus estimate  while revenues of  1 2 billion also came just short of analyst expectations  revenues fell 9  year over year Adjusted revenue reflects a decrease of 7  in 7  in Powertrain Systems and an increase of 3  in Aftermarket Delphi also noted that its North America and Asia markets were down 10   but were partially offset by growth of 3  in South America and consistent revenue in Europe Estimates Keep FallingAnalysts have since turned bearish on Delphi Technologies  with seven cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  Earnings are expected to decline about 34  for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 28 cents during that same time period from  3 17 to  2 89 per share This sentiment has stretched into 2020  While earnings could see positive growth  our consensus estimate has dropped 37 cents in the past two months DLPH is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Shares of the automotive supplier have gained only 9  since January compared to the S P 500 s gain of about 15  Bottom LineLike other auto suppliers  Delphi have been under pressure after President Trump announced plans to impose additional 10  tariffs on  300 billion worth of Chinese goods last week It s also been struggling a bit since the 2017 split with its self driving business  since then  its lost 70  of its value CEO Richard Dauch has been focusing on streamlining Delphi s operations and improving the company s profitability  but macroeconomic headwinds

11581,233096,RGLD,Rising Rate Cut Hopes A Boon For These 5 Stocks,opinion,Wall Street recently cheered the more accommodative monetary policies for the days ahead  After all  the recent Fed nominees are open to interest rate cuts  And the U S  economy is at the brink of a slowdown phase  which definitely calls for rate cuts Needless to say  rate sensitive stocks tend to rise in an environment when rates are declining as it eventually leads to cheaper borrowing costs  Thus  investing in real estate and utility players seems like a judicious move  Gold is another lucrative investment option as its prices push higher on hopes of more policy easing Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller to be Fed GovernorsPresident Trump recently tweeted that he wants to appoint Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller for the Federal Reserve Board  Both of them are known to have supported lower interest rates  They believe that lower interest rates and a loose monetary policy will help the economy expand in the near term Judy Shelton had openly said that the federal funds rate should be around zero  while Waller has completely rejected the Phillips Curve argument that as jobless rate declines  wages should improve leading to higher inflation  necessitating rise in rates The Fed s dot plot from the June meeting  by the by  has shown that there is a clear divide among Fed officials when it comes to holding rates steady or slashing rates  But  with Shelton and Waller leaning to the dovish side  we can certainly expect a rate cut pretty soon Trump is also in favour of rate cuts  And why not  With G 7 countries keeping rates at around zero  the Fed is making U S  products less competitive globally by keeping the funds rate between 2 25  and 2 5  Slowing U S  Economy Supports Lower RatesFed is  further  widely expected to lower rates as the U S  economy isn t in good shape  A measure of private job additions fell short of expectations  while reports on the service sector and trade are also discouraging U S  private sector saw 102 000 job additions in June  below the 140 000 expected by analysts  per ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report  Additionally  the Institute for Supply Management s nonmanufacturing index fell to 55 1  in June from 56 9  in May  below expectations of 55 9   U S  factory orders  in the meanwhile  dropped 0 7  in May  in line with expectations Rate Sensitive Stocks to Make MerryWith the Fed widely expected to not hike rates in the near future  shares of rate sensitive utilities and real estate will certainly climb  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Thus  low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits However  higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Rate hikes are also a dampener to real estate activities  After all  higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for projects  which will significantly affect companies predominantly involved in the construction business Gold Prices to RiseThanks to the dovish expectations  gold prices are expected to rise  This is because lower interest rates generally tend to make bonds and other fixed income investments less attractive Money will flow out of bonds and money market funds as they can t provide higher yields  and in turn may flow into gold  It s worth pointing out though that the yellow metal offers no yield

11583,233098,RGLD,Royal Gold  Mosaic  Tesla  Ford And PACCAR Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   July 8  2019    Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   as the Bull of the Day  The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA    Ford   NYSE F   and PACCAR   NASDAQ PCAR   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Royal Gold  Inc  is a way to capitalize on the rising gold and silver prices without actually owning mining stocks  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to see double digit sales growth in Fiscal 2020 Royal Gold is not a miner  It is a precious metals stream and royalty company which owns interests  as of Mar 31  2019  on 191 properties on five continents  That includes interests on 43 producing mines and 17 development stage projects What s a metals stream From Royal Gold  Precious metal streams are purchase agreements with mine operators that provide  in exchange for a lump sum advance payment  the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine  at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement  What s a royalty From Royal Gold  A royalty is the right to receive a percentage of the metal produced from a mineral property  Existing royalties can be acquired outright from either a mineral resource company or a private party  new royalties can be created by providing capital to an operator or explorer in exchange for a royalty  Missed Estimates in the Third QuarterOn May 2  Royal Gold reported fiscal third quarter 2019 results and missed on the Zacks Consensus by 3 cents  Earnings were  0 42 versus the Zacks Consensus of  0 45 The average price of gold of  1 304 per gold ounce  actually decreased 1 9  year over year while revenue fell 5 3  to  109 8 million The company paid dividends of  17 4 million  an increase of 6 1  The current dividend is yielding 1  However  gold has hit a 6 year high in the fiscal fourth quarter  which is bullish Analysts Raise EstimatesAnalysts are liking what they see with rising gold prices as 1 estimate was raised for fiscal 2019 in the last week  even though the company is about to report its fourth quarter results That has pushed up the 2019 Zacks Consensus Estimate to  1 55 from  1 52 It s looking even stronger for fiscal 2020 though  2 estimates have been revised higher in the last 7 days pushing the Zacks Consensus up to  2 08 from  2 04  That s an earnings increase of 34 5  At the end of the third quarter  the company had  216 million in cash and  1 2 billion in available liquidity Shares Hit New 52 Week HighsGold is back And so is interest in investing in it Shares of Royal Gold are up 21 5  year to date and recently hit a new 52 week high The P E has spiked to 49 but you re not buying it for that  You re in to get the dividend and to get aboard the gold rally For investors looking for a way to play the return of gold  Royal Gold is one to keep on your short list  The Mosaic Companygot hit hard by the extreme weather conditions in North America and rising costs in the first quarter  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is now expected to see a double digit earnings decline in 2019 Mosaic makes concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients  It is a single source provider of phosphate and potash fertilizers and feed ingredients for the global agriculture industry How Bad Was the Spring On May 5  Mosaic reported its first quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents  Earnings were  0 25 versus the consensus of  0 21 It was the fourth earnings surprise in a row But investors were concerned with the outlook  given that by May  the record rainfall  and flooding  was impacting the spring planting and application season in the Midwest In the quarter  Mosaic said that higher costs impacted all of its businesses  including costs associated with impacts of weather in North America and regulatory changes in Brazil  Earnings were negatively impacts by  0 13 per share In early May the company said that it was assuming a normal North  American spring application season despite the slow start  But the late start to the spring had impacted potash operating rates into the second quarter Lowered EPS GuidanceGiven the higher costs  regulatory changes in Brazil  an increase in Canadian resource taxes and delayed recovery in phosphate margins  the company cut full year guidance to a range of  1 50 to  2 00 That s a really wide range  It indicates that there may continue to be a large amount of uncertainty Not surprisingly  the analysts responded by cutting estimates  6 estimates were cut for 2019 within the last 2 months  pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to  1 72 from  2 17 That s an earnings decline of 19  as the company made  2 12 in 2018 The analysts didn t stop there  however  They also cut 2020 estimates as well  That pushed the 2020 Zacks Consensus Estimate down to  2 39 from  2 56 Shares Sink in 2019Unlike most stocks which have rebounded off 2018 lows  Mosaic has done the opposite on fears about the planting season Shares are down 15 2  year to date They now trade with a forward P E of just 14 3  which is cheaper than the S P 500  which trades around 18x Mosaic is also shareholder friendly  with a dividend yielding 0 8  Do Tesla s  TSLA  Record Deliveries Make it a Buy Tesla said it delivered 95 200 cars in the quarter  Since there were around 10 600 cars in transit at the beginning and more than 7 400 in transit at the end  it won t be providing these numbers going forward   actual deliveries were likely closer to 92 000  still above the Factset estimate of 91 000 for the June quarter Its second quarter production of 87 048 was also better than the 77 100 produced in the first quarter as well as the fourth quarter 2018 production of 86 555 vehicles The Model 3 remains the primary driver of sales  constituting 83 3  of production and 81 5  of deliveries this quarter The thing is that despite the strong numbers  deliveries through the first half of the year are around 158 200  The guidance of 380 000 to 400 000 for the year implies that deliveries through the first half should have been somewhere around 195 000 at the midpoint  It s significant that Tesla hasn t reiterated its 2019 guidance  despite posting strong numbers this quarter What management has said however that the streamlining of its global logistics framework is positively impacting numbers  which is a good thing  given the growing demand from international markets  Moreover  the resultant positive impact on cost and working capital will also help profitability  and therefore  the cash position Tesla also said that orders exceeded deliveries in the last quarter  which means that not all of the improvement is coming from pent up demand  as some feared Given the upbeat management commentary  one does wonder though whether this growth will be sustainable going forward  In this context  executive turnover is the biggest concern  Whether Tesla comes out on top of all its challenges  whether it is able to maintain this level of momentum despite the high level departures remains an open question  But going by the numbers  including the fact that it grew backlog  it s probably okay to give it the benefit of the doubt Also keep in mind that the stock is heavily shorted  and if the positive news flow continues  especially following the earnings results  short sellers will be moving to close out their positions  So some upward movement in the share price would be inevitable Safer bets in the sector however are Ford and PACCAR  You can also see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank

11585,233100,RGLD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Approach Resources  Berry Petroleum  Panhandle Oil And Gas  Royal Gold And Kinross Gold,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   July 3  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Approach Resources  Inc    NASDAQ AREX    Berry Petroleum Corp    NASDAQ BRY    Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc    NYSE PHX    Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   and Kinross Gold Corp    NYSE KGC   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  OPEC Extends Output Cut to Boost Oil Prices  Winners   LosersOPEC and its members have officially decided to extend production cut to shore up oil prices  The extension came at a time when U S  production continues to rise and demand worries persist  Nonetheless  here s a rundown on the OPEC production cuts  big winners and losers  Oil Prices ClimbOil prices continue to edge up after OPEC and its allies agreed to extend supply cut by nine months  In electronic trading  West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 18 cents at  59 27 a barrel  after hitting its highest level in over five weeks on Jul 1 U S  crude settled at  59 09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  up 62 cents  or 1 1  in the last trading session  Dow Jones Market Data added that the front month contract prices posted an eye popping 9 3  gain in June Brent crude futures  by the way  were trading up 34 cents  or 0 5   at  65 40 a barrel  The International benchmark increased 32 cents  or 0 5   to settle at  65 06 a barrel on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe on Jun 1 OPEC Extends Production CutThe production cut is till next March  a move particularly designed to put a check on oil prices falling on growing output  The United States  incidentally not a member of OPEC  continues to ramp up oil production at a fast clip  Needless to say  the boom in the Permian Basin has pushed the United States to the top spot as an oil producer Participating non OPEC members also need to approve the agreement  And Russia  by far the most significant non OPEC member  has given enough hints that it is willing to co operate with the production cut During the Group of 20 leaders  summit in Japan  Russian President Vladimir Putin said that both Russia and Saudi Arabia have decided to extend the oil production reduction deal  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih too confirmed that major alliances have  enthusiastically came together  to support the charter It s worth pointing out that the alliance between Russia and OPEC does have a major hold in determining the world s crude oil production  OPEC  individually  may control less than 50  of the world s crude oil production but the coalition does exceed half of global oil production Growing U S  Crude Production   Not the Only ConcernThe demand outlook for global oil is bleak  which is also a reason for the OPEC production cut  The International Energy Agency confirmed that  a warm winter in Japan  a slowdown in the petrochemicals industry in Europe  and tepid gasoline and diesel demand in the United States  are all affecting world oil demand Analysts also believe that changes in modes of transportation  especially  rise of electric vehicles and government s initiatives to reduce ill effects on climate can easily dent demand for oil Energy Shares GainAs demand for oil continues to scale  the energy sector is positioned to boost your portfolio  Most importantly  companies that are involved in hydraulic fracturing are poised to gain significantly  This is because a drop in oil price hurts their cost structure  killing the motive to pump  Thus

11586,233101,RGLD,Fed s Powell Reaffirms A Rate Cut  Winners   Losers,opinion,Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently said that economic outlook hasn t improved in recent times  Trade uncertainties and concerns about global growth remain causes of concern  which in turn can persuade the central bank to lower rates as soon as possible  Nonetheless  here s a rundown of the big winners and losers as if and when the rate cut happens  Powell Locked in on a Rate CutPowell has dropped enough hints regarding a potential rate cut later this month  and this is primarily be down to two major issues  Firstly as Powell categorically puts it trade related matters still remain unresolved  and secondly  concerns about global economic growth continue to weigh on the U S  economy Powell s statement to the House lawmakers comes at a time when President Trump is relentlessly pressurizing the Fed to cut interest rates to bolster the U S  economy  Some may say that the Fed is submitting to the pressure tactics of the President but Powell reaffirmed that the Fed is an independent body and won t be swayed by Trump Nonetheless  Powell  the President s choice to run the most powerful central bank in the world  is facing significant pressure to help the U S  economy grow at a steady clip  Needless to say that Trump s tariff strategy is already affecting economic growth Nonetheless  a slew of other factors apart from growth apprehensions is also posing a threat to the U S  economy  Notable among them are muted inflation and a looming debt ceiling crisis that the Congress is yet to resolve Majority of policymakers too have agreed that the  economy had appeared to have lost some momentum  in recent weeks and that a rate cut is much needed in the near term as it could  cushion the effects of possible future adverse shocks to the economy  Rate Sensitive Stocks to GainWith the Fed widely expected to not hike rates in the near future  shares of rate sensitive utilities and real estate will certainly climb  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Consequently  low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits However  higher interest rates and an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Rate hikes are also a dampener to real estate activities  After all  higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for projects  which will significantly affect companies predominantly involved in the construction business Given the buoyancy among rate sensitive stocks  investors can bet on power generating company Atlantic Power Corporation   TSX AT   and The Howard Hughes Corporation   NYSE HHC    a developer of commercial  residential and hospitality properties Atlantic Power  currently  has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has jumped more than 100  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 50  compared with the  industry s projected rally of 2 3  Recently  Howard Hughes has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has climbed more than 100  in the past 90 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 198 5  against the  industry s expected decline of 1 9  Gold Prices to RiseThanks to the dovish expectations  gold prices are expected to rise  In fact  gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange are already rising on hopes for rate cuts  This is because lower interest rates generally tend to make bonds and other fixed income investments less attractive Money will flow out of bonds and money market funds as they can t provide higher yields  and in turn may flow into gold  It s worth pointing out though that the yellow metal offers no yield at all With gold prices set to gain  investing in Kinross Gold Corporation   NYSE KGC   and Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   seems prudent at the moment  Kinross Gold currently has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has climbed 15 4  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 50  compared with the  industry s projected rally of 12  Meanwhile  Royal Gold flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has moved 1 3  up in the past 60 days  The company  which is part of the Mining   Gold industry  is expected to record earnings growth of 23 3  and 117 4  in the current and next quarters  respectively Financials  Not So LuckyA more dovish Fed  however  doesn t bode well for financials  But  why  Lower interest rates will dent bank profits as they decrease the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities Insurers  by the way  derive their investment income from investing premiums  which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds  Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to rise in interest rates  This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income  expanding their profit margins  which certainly is not possible in a low interest rate scenario Similarly  a decrease in interest rates generally concurs during periods of economic weakness and low consumer confidence  which doesn t bode well for brokerage firms and asset managers either Technology   Home Improvement Stand to LoseOther than the broader financial sector  technology firms stand to lose from a rate hike  Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting weak day by day and that could easily affect the bottom lines of smartphone makers like Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   Decline in rates may also compel would be home buyers to search for new houses and not look for improving their existing ones  Consequently  home improvement majors Lowe s Cos    NYSE LOW   and Home Depot   NYSE

11595,233110,RGLD,Fresh Hopes Of A Fed Rate Cut Boost These 5 Stocks,opinion,Fed officials are now going all out to drop hints of more aggressive policy easing  New York Fed President John Williams  NYSE WMB  is the latest to say that a rate cut will be a wise strategy at the first signs of an economic downturn  Meanwhile  the U S  economy is at the brink of a slowdown  which definitely calls for rate cuts Needless to say  rate sensitive stocks tend to rise in an environment when rates are declining as it eventually leads to cheaper borrowing costs  Thus  investing in real estate and utility players seems like a wise move  Gold is another lucrative investment option as its prices rise on hopes of more policy easing Dovish Fed CommentsWilliams recently said that since the federal funds rate is near zero  the most effective strategy for the Fed is to trim rates at the slightest sign of economic distress  Williams said in a speech at a research conference in New York that  when you have only so much stimulus at your disposal  it pays to act quickly to lower rates at the first sign of economic trouble  Market pundits expect Williams to endorse half point rate cut at the Fed s next policy meeting on Jul 30 31  Traders in the fed funds futures market now see more than a 50  chance of a rate cut in July  up from 34  a day ago By the way  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dropped enough hints regarding a potential rate cut later this month  and this is primarily because of two major issues  First  as Powell categorically puts it  trade related matters remain unresolved  and second  concerns about global economic growth continue to weigh on the U S  economy Powell s statement to the House lawmakers comes at a time when President Trump is relentlessly building pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates to bolster the U S  economy  In fact  Trump recently tweeted that he wants to appoint Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller for the Federal Reserve board  Both of them are known to have supported lower interest rates  They believe that lower interest rates and a loose monetary policy will help the economy expand in the near term While Shelton openly said that the federal funds rate should be around zero  Waller has completely rejected the Phillips Curve argument that as jobless rate declines  wages should improve leading to higher inflation  necessitating rise in rates Rate Sensitive Stocks to Make MerryWith the Fed widely expected to not hike rates in the near future  shares of rate sensitive utilities and real estate will certainly climb  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Thus  low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits However  higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Rate hikes are also a dampener to real estate activities  After all  higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for projects  which will significantly affect companies  predominantly involved in the construction business Gold Prices to RiseThanks to the dovish expectations  gold prices are expected to rise  This is because lower interest rates tend to make bonds and other fixed income investments less attractive Money will flow out of bonds and money market funds as they can t provide higher yields  and in turn may flow into gold  It s worth pointing out though that the yellow metal offers no yield at all Top 5 WinnersWe have  thus  selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid sectors that are poised to gain from decelerated hikes in the near term  These stocks flaunt a

11602,233117,RGLD,OPEC Extends Output Cut To Boost Oil Prices  Winners   Losers,opinion,OPEC and its members have officially decided to extend production cut to shore up oil prices  The extension came at a time when U S  production continues to rise and demand worries persist  Nonetheless  here s a rundown on the OPEC production cuts  big winners and losers  Oil Prices ClimbOil prices continue to edge up after OPEC and its allies agreed to extend supply cut by nine months  In electronic trading  West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 18 cents at  59 27 a barrel  after hitting its highest level in over five weeks on Jul 1 U S  crude settled at  59 09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  up 62 cents  or 1 1  in the last trading session  Dow Jones Market Data added that the front month contract prices posted an eye popping 9 3  gain in June Brent crude futures  by the way  were trading up 34 cents  or 0 5   at  65 40 a barrel  The International benchmark increased 32 cents  or 0 5   to settle at  65 06 a barrel on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe on Jun 1 OPEC Extends Production CutThe production cut is till next March  a move particularly designed to put a check on oil prices falling on growing output  The United States  incidentally not a member of OPEC  continues to ramp up oil production at a fast clip  Needless to say  the boom in the Permian Basin has pushed the United States to the top spot as an oil producer Participating non OPEC members also need to approve the agreement  And Russia  by far the most significant non OPEC member  has given enough hints that it is willing to co operate with the production cut During the Group of 20 leaders  summit in Japan  Russian President Vladimir Putin said that both Russia and Saudi Arabia have decided to extend the oil production reduction deal  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih too confirmed that major alliances have  enthusiastically came together  to support the charter It s worth pointing out that the alliance between Russia and OPEC does have a major hold in determining the world s crude oil production  OPEC  individually  may control less than 50  of the world s crude oil production but the coalition does exceed half of global oil production Growing U S  Crude Production   Not the Only ConcernThe demand outlook for global oil is bleak  which is also a reason for the OPEC production cut  The International Energy Agency confirmed that  a warm winter in Japan  a slowdown in the petrochemicals industry in Europe  and tepid gasoline and diesel demand in the United States  are all affecting world oil demand Analysts also believe that changes in modes of transportation  especially  rise of electric vehicles and government s initiatives to reduce ill effects on climate can easily dent demand for oil Energy Shares GainAs demand for oil continues to scale  the energy sector is positioned to boost your portfolio  Most importantly  companies that are involved in hydraulic fracturing are poised to gain significantly  This is because a drop in oil price hurts their cost structure  killing the motive to pump  Thus  zeroing down on oil stocks poised to stand out as top investments for this year seems judicious Approach Resources  Inc    NASDAQ AREX   focuses on the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of unconventional oil reserves in the United States  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has moved 32  up in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23 1  compared with the  industry s projected decline of 9 4  Berry Petroleum Corporation   NASDAQ BRY   engages in the development and production of conventional oil reserves located in the western United States  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has risen 6 1  in the past 90 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23 8  compared with the Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry s projected decline of 9 4  Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc    NYSE PHX   acquires  develops  and manages oil and natural gas properties in the United States  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has climbed 81  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 138 2  compared with the Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry s estimated decline of 9 4   You can see  Gold Edges UpGold prices are certainly expected to move north on higher oil prices  This is because as crude oil prices rise  prices of essential goods and commodities follow suit  And value of gold rises when inflation picks up  After all  it acts as a hedge against inflation  In fact  theoretically  more than 60  of the time gold and crude oil have a direct relationship  Given this bullishness  one should consider gold mining companies Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   acquires and manages precious metal streams  royalties  and related interests  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has moved 0 7  up in the past 60 days  The company  which is part of the industry  is expected to record earnings growth of 23 4  in the current quarter Kinross Gold Corporation   NYSE KGC   engages in the acquisition  exploration  and development of gold properties in the United States  The stock

compared with the Mining   Gold industry s projected rally of 15 8  Aviation  Refiners to Take a HitAviation stocks traditionally have an inverse relationship with oil price  So  it isn t surprising that shares of aviation firms will decline after a sharp rise in crude oil prices  After all  fuel costs are major part of the operating costs of aviation firms  thus rise in oil prices will hit profit margins Refineries also stand to lose from higher crude oil prices as crude is their raw material  So  refineries  net cash flow declines when crude oil prices pick up This Could Be the Fastest

Here s The Play
At this time  I m looking to enter GDX on the long side  but I m waiting for a pullback or a consolidation pattern to form before jumping in  Often after a breakout an equity will need to digest some of the recent gains  Let s see if we can get that pattern over the next week or so  I will be keeping GDX on my radar  Some other gold mining stocks that look strong on the charts include Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   Kirkland Lake Gold  TSX KL   Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM  and Royal Gold  Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   ",2019-06-12,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-miners-are-breaking-out-and-they-have-higher-to-go-200430961,200430961
11609,233124,RGLD,Our 500th Gold Update  Extremes Are The Norm,opinion,"Not to dwell upon today marking our 500th consecutive Saturday penning of this missive  such milestone is merely a function of the world s accepted mathematical practice of functioning in  base 10    Were we instead oriented to the octal system of  base 8   this would already be the 764th edition  or via the duodecimal dynamic of  base 12   just the 358th edition  
Still  with dedicated consistency in having missed nary a Saturday  we are now fortunate to write No  500 for our dedicated readers to whom we are eternally thankful  a blessing as we put  pen to paper  this morning from the wee Mediterranean fishing village of Monaco 
Gold s consistency however when it comes to price throughout our missives has been hardly that  499 Saturdays ago in writing from San Francisco on 14 November 2009  the price of Gold was 1119  Its extremes since then have been 72  higher at 1923 as well as 7  lower at 1045  With Gold having settled out this past week at 1345  price  net net  is up but a mere 20  across that nearly ten year spectrum 
By comparison  the US money supply as measured by M2 is  73  and the National Debt is on pace to have doubled by next year from  12 trillion in 2009 to  24 trillion  The S P 500 across the same span is  164   its sputtering earnings performance throughout having seen our  live  price earnings ratio expand from then 20x to now 31x   And to return to the business school  normalcy  wherein even 20x might be considered  extreme  would mean a 1000 point haircut    some 32     for the S P  
Fairly scary stuff that  were to folks to actually to take notice of such present extremes  A charter reader of The Gold Update wrote to us this past week   It is truly amazing that the investing individual institutions ignore all the warning signs from the 2000 tech crash  2008 mortgage loan scandals and the current debt to infinity debacle   and included a quote attributable to Einstein   Two things are infinite  the universe and human stupidity  
Were wild haired Al around today  he might add a third thing  market extremes  or so it seems  As above noted  there s been the endless levitation of stock prices whilst earnings lack supportive growth  There s the stagnant price of Gold despite the forever growing 3Ds of dollar Debasement  Debt and Derivatives  There s the money known as Silver that has fallen from the rails in maintaining upside stride with Gold s meager rallies  the Gold Silver ratio today at a  you gotta be kidding me  exospheric 90 6x  Extremes are the norm  which Funkin  Wagnalls might consider as a descriptor for  perpetual understatement  
Indeed try this spectrum of extremes  the United States  327 million population spread over 9 8 million square kilometres  reels en route toward  24 trillion in debt and an eight month budget deficit that just exceeded  3 trillion for the first time ever  At the opposite end we ve Monaco  39 000 population spread over 2 2 square kilometres    that s 544 acres  which rocks with a fully funded surplus such that were the Principality s progress to ever  albeit improbably  grind to a halt  the government and its services could carry on for five years  on a global basis  that s an impressive exemplary extreme     which here is simply taken as the norm 
 Course the unwinding of markets  extremes as history repetitively demonstrates is the inevitable regression to respective means  And for Gold that means price catching up to dollar Debasement  which by today s Gold Scoreboard would be 2890  an advance from here of  115    and a price uncannily near today s overblown S P level of 2887   Put most bluntly  to regress to their respective means means a halving of the stock market and a doubling of Gold 
 But isn t stock ownership much broader than it used to be  mmb      Congrats on 500 by the way    
Well thank you  Squire  and as well for your valued support throughout  The percentage of US families with either direct or indirect holdings of stock has been fairly stable  round 50  throughout these past 10 years  But  studies say   tis the top ten percent fat cats that own some 84  of it all  And upon the throes of means regression kicking in  watch for the stock price inflation from fat cats morph into stock price deflation in fat splats 
As for the ability for Gold s price to double  it so did  from 270 to 541  during 2001 to 2006  to then double again  from 541 to 1085  in half the time during 2009 to 2009  Then in half that time it nearly again doubled  from 1085 to 1900  come 2011  Said  barbarous relic  can and shall again adroitly move  so be there  or be bare 
Not so barely inching higher has been Gold since the commencement of the weekly parabolic Long trend just three weeks ago as we below see  yesterday recording the year s high to date of 1362 before knee jerk selling off  as if  twere all planned  to 1345  Remember the 1360s  double top  of the past two years  Remember  too  the title of last week s missive  Gold Gains Pace  Shall it Fail at the Same Place   Well  Yogi  here we are at d j  vu all over again  And all with Base Camp 1377 temptingly waiting in the balance  barring the range bounders shoving price back down yet again   Tis quite the moment of pricing truth for Gold right now 

How about the truth revealed by the Economic Barometer  To be sure  May s Industrial Production whirled  round from negative to positive  whilst the month s Retail Sales grew at a robust  0 5  for the second consecutive month   We re in the money  we re in the money    But then there s the ugliness  including the noted record increase to the Trade Deficit  Export Price deflation  sliding results in the University of Michigan s June Sentiment Survey and burgeoning Business Inventories  Then in their behind the curve wisdom we ve the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta cutting their Q2 Gross Domestic Product annual growth pace to just  1 4    less than half Q1 s 3 1  pace   Do you really wanna stay invested in that extreme S P 500 red line  which as proven time and again ultimately regresses to the level of the blue line  Take a look 

Let s next turn to our two panel Gold graphic of the daily bars for the past three months to date on the left and 10 day Market Profile on the right  And upon those baby blue dots not breaking below their 0  axis some three weeks ago  price then at 1284  as would otherwise be the norm  Gold today at 1345 is 4 8  higher  Indeed as another great friend of The Gold Update wrote to us just last evening  the charts of Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and royalty roller coaster Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  across the same stretch show their prices as  12 6  and  10 3  respectively  the lovely leverage of equities at work there   Yet ugly when undoing   As for the Profile   twould be nervous Nellie time should price break below 1330 without swift upside recoil  the notion of the 1360s  double top  extending to that of a triple 

Then we ve the like graphic for Sister Silver  her performance over the past three weeks a comparatively subdued  2 1  in spite of her own  Baby Blues   below left  accelerating to the upside  Meanwhile per her Profile  below right    tis all about holding above 14 75 

Let s thus wrap No  500 with the Gold Stack  Note the bulleted bits as they highlight price s recent run into the resistive 1360s  above which for the ad nauseath time lies Base Camp 1377  it being the real threshold toward materially higher levels  Beyond Gold s vast undervaluation today  the other cited extremes are the norm     until their regressive storm  So hang onto your Gold  Here s the stack followed by a closing note to you

11610,233125,RGLD,Will Gold Stocks Jump Amid Gold Price Boom ,opinion,"Gold regained its shine this month after a dismal year  It has risen about 11  since May 30  after dropping steeply at this time last year  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   commodities strategist Susan Bates recently said that gold is the firm s number one commodities pick 
Gold is generally seen as a safe haven investment in times of economic and monetary uncertainty  Gold makes the most sense to invest in when the dollar weakens  as it holds true value more steadily than unbacked paper currency  It also generally rises in times of geopolitical turmoil  as there is a higher risk to economic instability 
Many commodities experts have spoken about the high likelihood that the price of gold increases in the coming weeks due to both of the factors just mentioned  The DXY  which is the dollar index against foreign currencies  has fallen 1 85  over the last month  This has caused investors to put more money in gold in anticipation of its rise 
Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have also helped gold climb  Two oil tankers were attacked earlier this month in the Gulf of Oman  Later a U S  military drone was shot down in international airspace near Iran  This week President Trump authorized an attack by U S  Cyber Command to cripple Iranian military command and control systems 
If these two issues continue or worsen in the near future  it is likely that gold will continue to rise  Some analysts are predicting the price to rise from  1430 15 to over  1 500 per ounce 
A great way to capitalize on this trend without getting into commodities trading is to buy stocks in companies that manufacture or handle gold  Below are three great companies that may rise in the coming weeks along with the price of gold 
1  AngloGold Ashanti   NYSE AU  
AngloGold Ashanti is a South African gold mining company with operations in nine countries  It is currently the third largest gold producer in the world  producing 7 million ounces of gold  AU is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  with Style Scores of  A  for Value and Momentum and  B  for Growth  It also has a terrific projected 19 44  EPS growth over the next 3 5 years due to reinvestment in new high yield mine sites 
The year over year earnings growth for 2019 is estimated at 90 57   a huge number for a 15 year old company  AU also has a market beta of  1 1  meaning that it on average moves inversely to the market  If you think that this bull market may end soon and are looking to protect your portfolio  AU may be a great choice 
2  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd    NYSE AEM  
Agnico Eagle Mines Limited is a Canadian based gold producer with operations  exploration  and development in Canada  Finland  and Mexico  Last year  AEM produced 1 63 million ounces and plans to expand to 1 75 million ounces in 2019  Analysts have upgraded earnings per share estimates for this year in the last 90 days from 0 45 to 0 51  a trend that shows positive movement for the company 
In the past  AEM has performed worse than the gold mining industry on average  However  it has performed 80  better than the industry in the past 12 months 
3  Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD  
Royal Gold  Inc  acquires and manages precious metals royalty and stream interests  with a primary focus on gold  The company contracts with mine operators to be able to purchase a portion of the metal that the mine produces at a fixed price  in exchange for an upfront payment  This means that the company is insulated from the costs and risks of mine operation  It also means that the company is highly exposed to gold market fluctuations  Which  if the gold market rises as speculated  will be extremely good for RGLD s business 
RGLD has a P E ratio that is higher than the industry ratio  However  this is likely due to RGLD s stability of earnings  It is not subject to the extreme riskiness of discovering and exploring new gold mines  Investors are willing to pay more for this stock s earnings  as the earnings have a lower risk of taking a dive

increase in Indicated Mineral Resources at the Fekola Mine following a successful infill drilling program in 2019 Infill Drilling Boosts Fekola s ProspectsLast year  B2Gold completed more than 25 000 metres of infill drilling at the Fekola mine  in a bid to convert the existing Inferred Mineral Resource category to the Indicated Mineral Resource category  Consequently  as of Dec 31  2019  B2Gold increased the indicated category to 2 675 000 ounces of gold  while the inferred category went up to 541 000 ounces  These estimates are compared with the 4 383 000 ounces of gold production in the indicated resource category and 507 000 ounces in the inferred category  reported as per sensitivity case in the June 2015 Fekola Optimized Feasibility Study  Year over year  the updated Indicated Mineral Resource estimate has increased by 1 290 000 ounces of gold The Fekola Indicated Mineral Resource estimate will provide the basis for an updated design pit and the new Fekola Probable Mineral

a total of 6 052 000 ounces of gold constrained within a  1 500 per ounce gold pit shell above a cut off grade of 0 5 g t gold The Fekola mine in Mali produced its first million ounces of gold last December  following 2 5 years of production  The mine has produced 1 006 000 ounces of gold since it commenced operations in 2017 2020 Exploration Plans at Fekola   AnacondaIn 2020  exploration at Fekola will be focused on extending the deposit to the north and south  and near the surface area while also testing for additional mineralized zones in the east and west of the Fekola deposit In 2019  Anaconda mine completed the exploration of more than 45 000 metres of drilling  This was mainly focused on increasing saprolite resources at the Adder and Mamba zones  and further testing the sulphide mineralization in the Mamba zone  With the recent drilling extension  Mamba zone has the potential to become a substantial new gold deposit for B2Gold near the Fekola Mine Further  the current year exploration will focus on expanding the saprolite resources within the Anaconda Area  including the Adder and Mamba Zones  The exploration budget for both Fekola deposit and the Anaconda is around  18 million for this year Fekola Expansion Project Shines BrightThe expansion project at the Fekola mine is likely to enhance the mine s processing throughput to 7 5 million tonnes per annum  Mtpa  from the base rate of 6 Mtpa  This expansion will likely conclude by third quarter 2020  Also  the mine is projected to produce between 590 000 and 620 000 ounces of gold this year  B2Gold plans to invest  50 million over a period of approximately 18 months for the expansion of the mine  which will allow the company to produce around 5 million ounces of gold over the new mine life of 12

11636,233151,RGLD,Brazil Changes Rules Of Game   Open Up BIG Opportunity,opinion,"Brazil has been one of the hardest hit countries since the natural resources boom ended  This resulted in Brazil falling into a very deep recession and foreign direct investment dropping by more than 75  from its peak  But the rules of the game changed in June  setting the stage to dramatically change investor outlook in its mining sector for a number of years ahead  This is after little changes in Brazil s mining sector going back to 1967 
But before putting money to work in Brazil  most investors and speculators can think about a number of issues the country has faced since the commodities boom ended  For instance 
 Foreign Direct Investment is down by more than 50  since the peak in 2011  Mining Disaster in 2015 Mining Bankruptcy  Luna Gold Currency Heavily Depreciated  Increased Political Challenges over the past few years
These are all the hallmarks of wanting to shy away as an investor  In the short term  we see these as only temporary  and more issues may continue to unfold because Brazil is primarily a natural resources country  Just like Canada  and Australia that are heavily influenced by the prices of oil  iron ore  and other natural resources  Brazil is no different  with iron ore  crude oil  soybeans  sugar and gold accounting for almost 30  of the country s exports in 2016  Source  MIT

What Happened  The BIGGEST Change in Brazil s Mining Sector in 50 Years
Brazil updated its mining code that has changed little since 1967  that will positively impact investors looking to invest in the sector 
  allow for mining titles to be used as guarantees for financing  aimed at stimulating investment in the sector and to allow miners to continue exploring for minerals while production license applications are pending   the Mines and Energy Ministry said  Reuters 
Legal classifications for mining resources  which still use terms from a 1967 mining code  will come into line with global standards  and filings for permits will be more focused on economic feasibility  the two sources said   Reuters 
President Temer signed the decrees on Tuesday  saying the economy needed a competitive  innovative and sustainable mining industry   The mining code has been modernised and reflects the best international practices  as well as improving legal certainty   he said in a translated tweet   which helps to attract more investments and jobs for our country   Mining Journal What Does the New Rule Changes Open Up For Investors The decree would open up roughly 20 000 exploration areas where permit applications have stalled or been abandoned  one source said  Those blocks  which account for about a tenth of areas in Brazil with permits pending  would be subject to new auctions   Reuters 
 Brazil is opening up its markets and there are many opportunities   Andre Clark  head of Siemens in Brazil   DW com 
Why Do the Policy Change 
 The objective of the measure is to attract new investments  generating wealth for the country and employment and income for society  always based on the precepts of sustainability   the Brazil ministry said in a statement 
 With this  decree   we will ensure our attractiveness to foreign capital   the second source said   There will be the legal security necessary for people to invest in Brazil   Reuters 
The Timing of The Policy Change
If we take into account a rotation from equities to commodities  then this is a huge positive policy change at the start of the commodities cycle  Brazil has the potential in the coming natural resource boom to be a big winner again for investors because it is setting policies in place to help the country grow again and attract investment  There are plenty of different commodities for investors to invest in Brazil  These new mining policies have a high probability of improving investor sentiment of Brazil  Government policies can pull or push away investment  and these new changes will pull in investment into Brazil  particularly as the commodity cycle unfolds  In turn  new job opportunities will open up in Brazil s mining sector 

Bloomberg Interview with Mark Mobius   July 11  2018
Host   Do we know enough who the winners might be in your view   Mobius   In our view  in terms of the emerging markets  some of the most interesting now because of their tremendous decline in the currencies and markets  would be Brazil   Host   Do you think we bottomed across emerging markets  just generally speaking from a sentiment play   Mobius   I can t say they bottomed  Emerging markets as you know are down about 20 something percent in general  Some markets are down more than that  I expect probably another 10   As you know about a year ago  I said probably a 30  decline correction  I think we will still achieve that  But now of course  now is the time to begin looking and locating those companies in emerging markets  The opportunities are going to get better  The currencies look very cheap as you know  The markets are down in many cases substantially  Places like Brazil  Argentina  these are really bombed out markets   Host   Bombed out presents the opportunity of being greedy when others are fearful   Mobius   That s always been the case  The problem of course is putting money to work when markets are down substantially  One of the reasons of course  is that investors hold back  And therefore  we don t have the cash to put money to in these markets  People are learning  there are a lot of investors that are willing to go into these bombed out markets  
Wealthy Group and Strategic Investors that Added to Their Investments in Brazil in 2018  In recent months there has been an increased activity of successful mining investors deploying capital into Brazil while gold price remains down  These are investors with a proven track record of creating wealth with a longer term focus than just 3 6 months  1  Ross Beatty via Equinox2  Sprott and Lundin family in joint investment via Americano Mining3  Mitsui investing in Vale  Asked whether Mitsui could buy all of the shareholders  stake if it were offered as a parcel  Takebe said   I wouldn t rule out possibility  but it s unlikely that we would buy all the shares on sale   Source  Reuters4  Anglo American  LON AAL   Anglo has confirmed to Reuters it had obtained permits covering almost 1 9 million hectares to explore in the Mato Grosso and Para states but said it was too soon to make claims about the project s viability   Brazil s national mining agency director general Victor Bicca told the wire service it could be a  mega deposit  with similar mineral content to Chile  Source  Mining Journal5  Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  investment to obtain royalty of Amarillo Gold  V AGC   Source  Amarillo Gold
There are a number of companies already invested in Brazil  and this new rule could entice them to further invest in the country with these new rule changes  They ll be able to utilize their first mover advantage versus everyone else  Already registered companies  established teams  relationships  etc

Brazil is the  1 producer in niobium  2nd largest producer of iron ore and manganese  as part of the almost 80 mineral commodities that Brazil produces  The big winners will be on gold and copper investment because there is more certainty with customers  and investors are more familiar with these commodities  Electric vehicles will create a new source of demand for copper  that no one truly knows the demand side 


Policy changes can dramatically positively or negatively impact investor sentiment  We think in Brazil s case  these new mining updates positively improve investor sentiment over the coming years ahead  Will the currency and other issues probably come up in the meantime as the natural resources boom has yet to take hold  We think there s a high probability chance  Smart money is already deploying capital in the country  and those investors that are willing to take a multi year view on Brazil  mining in Brazil has the potential to eclipse what it did in the last cycle because of these new policy changes  Copper and gold projects will be some of the big winners  particularly as electric vehicle demand grows  Being greedy when others are fearful  puts Brazil near the top to consider for natural resource investors and investors looking for deep value opportunities

11637,233152,RGLD,Which Companies Generate More Revenue Per Employee Than Every S P 500 Stock ,opinion,"There are many who focus on the mining sector being poor places to invest because miners have a history of poorly allocating capital  But there is a segment within the mining sector  particularly the gold sector that many investors miss  is the royalty   streaming model  They are asset light businesses  with teams under 40  They are some of the most scalable businesses in the world  This business model creates more revenue per employee and market cap per employee than any other group in the S P 500  The Three Gold Kings  Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   Wheaton Precious Metals  NYSE WPM  and Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD    are the largest royalty and streaming companies in mining 
THE THREE GOLD KING vs  S P 500 COMPANIES  REVENUE EMPLOYEE 21 out of the top 50 companies from the S P 500 that generated the most revenue per employee came from the energy sector  The oil companies saw a resurgence in 2017 because of a recovery in the oil price  accelerating their revenue growth  along with their increased oil production  But  when you compare the top S P 500 companies on a revenue per employee basis  the top company  Valero Energy  NYSE VLO   generated less than 50  of the smallest of the three companies generated  Royal Gold  Valero Energy generated almost 60  less than the  1 spot  Wheaton Precious Metals  This is in 2017 when gold and oil produced the similar returns 
THE THREE GOLD KING vs  S P 500 COMPANIES  MARKET CAP EMPLOYEE 
Here is where it gets very interesting when you look at the market capitalization per employee  how do the companies stack up  At the beginning of August 2018  based on the fiscal year 2017 staffing  Toronto based  Franco Nevada is on a completely different league on a market capitalization per employee at more than  400 million in market capitalization value per employee  This almost 2X more than its nearest competitors  Wheaton Precious Metals and Royal Gold   and more than 11X more than EOG  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   the world s largest company  it s per employee value was less than  8 3 million in market cap value per employee in 2017  or 97  less than each employee was to Franco Nevada 
THREE GOLD KINGS vs  BANKERS ON WALL STREET
For the bankers out there  this will interest you  The Three Gold Kings once again in 2017  generated 25X more revenue per employee than the key wall street investment banks  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS    When you compare the Three Kings to diversified bank J P  Morgan Chase   Co   Royal Gold generates almost 50X as much revenue per employee  and Wheaton Precious Metals generates more than 55X more  As of August  on a market capitalization basis  Franco Nevada had 175X higher value  on a market capitalization per employee basis than Goldman Sachs  and 277X more than Morgan Stanley  
THREE GOLD KINGS vs FAANGs
Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  is the main FAANG winner on a revenue per employee basis   2 1 million   this is still well below that of Wheaton Precious Metals which generated  22 2 million in revenue per employee  more than 10X more  Apple was again ahead of Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  on the same metric in 2017  from 2016  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is the laggard because of the number of employees it needs to hire to build out its distribution network  Google and Facebook switched on a revenue per employee position from 2016  While nowhere as extreme as the investment banks  Franco Nevada had  425 million in market cap  per employee  more than 50X M that of Apple  8 3 million  This is AFTER Apple became a trillion dollar company  
DEPRESSED GOLD PRICE IS GOOD FOR THE THREE GOLD KINGS
Depressed gold prices are ideal for the royalty and streaming model because both producers and explorers get starved for capital because investors are focused on other sectors  Now is no different  with gold prices down and a marijuana boom pulling in all the capital in Canada  and tech sector pulling in investor capital in the United States  This allows the royalty and streaming companies to be the bankers of last resort and get better terms than they would normally be able to get when the sector is doing well  Good luck to the banker trying to pitch a potential mine development in Africa  where a royalty and streaming company can step in and take on the risk  Their deal flow tends to be inversely related to the commodity price 
SECTOR ROTATION IS COMING 
The gold sector is incredibly unloved and unwanted  whereas the tech companies continue to be in favor  Over the next 2 3 years  we would expect the gap to widen on the two metrics  between the Three Gold Kings and the FAANG s because of rotation out of tech and into materials  Market capitalization per employee will accelerate for the Three Gold Kings as capital flows increase to them because they tend to be in most of the gold ETFs  have liquidity  pay dividends  have reduced exposure to any one particular mine  and have a proven track record of creating shareholder wealth  On the revenue side  the Three Gold Kings are growing the attributable gold ounces  each year over the next few years  that will further push them ahead of the FAANG s  The Three Gold Kings are doing this without having to add any new employees 
Okay  okay  but you say  show me the share price 
Royal Gold and Franco Nevada outperformed both gold and the S P 500  by a wide margin  Wheaton Precious Metals outperformed silver but didn t outperform the S P 500  because of its heavier weighting to silver  In last place  was the GDX  NYSE GDX  ETF  gold miners ETF   It highlights the mining sector is more of a stock pickers environment  By outsourcing to the ETF  shouldn t necessarily expect outperformance  Gold has been down  and the royalty and streaming model has held up well 
Why the Royalty and Streaming Model works for the Three Gold Kings 

Wall Street and Bay Street  Canada  bankers flee the mining sector when the commodities sector is plummeting because risk and compliance assume the sector is riskier when the price is down  Which is completely illogical and irrational  This allows the Three Gold Kings to deploy capital when capital markets and traditional bank lending seizes up  Allowing them to get preferential terms because they are the banker of last resort  This is even more important when the larger miners need capital because there are fewer options to go for capital needs  particularly during challenging times  The royalty and streaming companies know the miners need capital because banks and investors have fleed 
 Production  growth tends to continue to grow year in and year out because as each new royalty and or stream comes online  it adds to the existing streams and royalty 
Optionality
Optionality to the commodity price when the commodity price increases for that the royalty or stream is tied to  The change in the gold price will flow right down to the bottom line  WITHOUT having to deploy more capital 
Optionality to the resource  Many generalist investors completely miss this area because many times the mine can operate for many years  if not decades well after the initial mine plan because the deposit continues to grow  This allows the royalty companies to continue collecting from the mine without having to deploy any more capital

11638,233153,RGLD,Royal Gold Bets On New Mines  Buyouts  Low Gold Prices Hurt,opinion,On Dec 13  we issued an updated research report on Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD    Royal Gold expects to benefit from the ramping up of new mines  Also  its focus on acquisitions and strong balance sheet bode well  However  lower gold prices are a concern  Lower Prices   Water Supply Drag Q1 Earnings Royal Gold s adjusted earnings per share of 23 cents in first quarter fiscal 2019 declined 48  year over year  Soft sales  lower metal prices  higher legal expenses and the adoption of new accounting guidance for equity securities led to the decline in the reported quarter s earnings  Revenues were also impacted by reduced sales at Mount Milligan  This was mainly caused by the temporary shutdown of the mill processing facility in early calendar 2018  resulting from lack of sufficient water sources  Centerra   the operator of Mount Milligan mine   stated that it has received the approval for the use of short term water sources through Nov 15  2018   For the medium term  Centerra has submitted an application to authorities to allow water draw from a number of other sources at rates that are protective of the environment until 2021  Discussions are ongoing  and Centerra believes that access to these sources may be granted as early as January 2019  However  these applications have not yet been granted and as the flow from the approved  short term  water  sources  declines  during  the  calendar  fourth  quarter  and  the  remainder  of  the  winter  season  Centerra expects to reduce Mount Milligan throughput to properly manage its water balance until the water flow increases in the spring of 2019  Further  the currently approved sources will provide limited amount of water in the near term  and there is no guarantee for the sufficiency and availability of additional water sources  adding to concerns  Consequently  Centerra is trying to reach a long term water solution  Tepid Guidance for Q2 The company expects sales and deliveries for fiscal second quarter 2019 to be impacted by the timing of metal shipments  Mount Milligan did not ship any concentrates in July due to rail transportation issues  and the August shipments are not anticipated to reach final settlement until the March quarter  Further  Pueblo Viejo s provisional payment schedule recently changed  leading to lower deliveries in the fiscal 2019 first quarter  This is likely to increase the correspondingly lower sales in the current quarter  Consequently  sales for fiscal second quarter 2019 will be in line with that in fiscal first quarter 2018  with a modest reduction in inventory at quarter end  Settlement of Voisey s Bay Dispute a Growth Driver Royal Gold has settled its long standing litigation with VALE S A   NYSE VALE   on their world class Voisey s Bay mine in Newfoundland and Labrador  The company recognized  4 9 million in total for royalty payments in fiscal first quarter 2019  Reportedly  Vale will be investing  1 7 billion to develop the underground resources that will extend the mine life from 2023 to 2034  The resolution of the dispute gives Royal Gold the exposure to a world class operating asset that ensures its shareholders a steady stream of royalty revenues  The company expects Voisey s Bay to again feature among its top 10 revenue generators  Peak Gold Project Holds Promise Royal Gold announced that the Peak Gold joint venture  in which its subsidiary Royal Alaska holds a 40  interest  has completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment   PEA   on the Peak Gold Project located near Tok  Alaska  The PEA presents a robust open pit mining operation and enticing economics at base case gold and silver prices   Growth Drivers Ahead There are other several catalysts for the company coming up  which include the beginning of production at Cortez Crossroads  early deployment of the Pe asquito Pyrite Leach Project and production improvements at Rainy River  It will be aided further by progress at the pilot pre oxidation plant at Pueblo Viejo  and a preliminary economic assessment at the Peak Gold joint venture  However  lower gold prices

11639,233154,RGLD,Trump s Inflationary Tariffs Could Supercharge Gold  PM Stocks,opinion,"Ready for inflation 
Just days after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reassured markets that a trade war between the U S  and China was  on hold   the Trump administration announced that it would be moving forward with plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on as much as  50 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U S  Beijing has already suggested that it will retaliate in kind 
The White House also reinstated tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from Canada  Mexico and the European Union  EU  after allowing earlier exemptions to expire  Again  there s a big chance the U S  will see some sort of tit for tat response 
Steel prices are already up 45 percent from a year ago  The annual change in the price of a new vehicle in the U S  has been dropping steadily since last summer  according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data  but with the cost of materials set to rise dramatically  we could see a price reversal sooner rather than later 
Next up  the U S  government could slap steep tariffs on imported automobiles and possibly even ban German luxury vehicles outright  according to a report by German business news magazine WirtschaftsWoche 
These decisions  if fully implemented  will have a multitude of implications on the U S  and world economies  What I can say with full confidence  though  is that prices will rise for producers and consumers alike which is good for gold but a headwind for continued economic growth 
You Can t Suck and Blow at the Same Time
Let me explain  I ve often said that middle class taxpayers elected Trump president by and large to take on entrenched bureaucrats  cut the red tape and streamline regulations  People are fed up 
A study last year by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  found that government workers not only earn more on average than private sector workers with similar educational backgrounds  they re also guaranteed health  retirement and other benefits  Trump responded to these concerns by signing an executive order that eased the firing of federal workers 
He s kept his word in other ways  Since being in office  he s already eliminated five federal rules on average for every new rule created  according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute  CEI   He s weakened Obamacare and Dodd Frank  not to mention slashed corporate taxes 
In 2017  the number of pages in the Federal Register  the official list of administrative regulations  dropped to 61 950 from 97 069 the previous year  This is especially good news for productivity  Research firm Cornerstone Macro found that Americans were more productive when there were fewer rules  less productive when there were more rules 

These are all positive developments that should help boost the economy  The problem is that they could be undermined by tariffs  which are essentially regulations  We believe government policy is a precursor to change  and history suggests that rising tariffs and regulations hurt the economy 
Consider automobiles  U S  automakers are the second largest consumer of steel following construction  In March  the Wall Street Journal estimated that the tariffs could add at least  300 to each new vehicle sold in the U S  And speaking to Bloomberg last week  a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will make cars more expensive   These tariffs will result in an increase in the price of domestically produced steel threatening the industry s global competitiveness and raising vehicle costs for our customers   Gloria Bergquist said 
Higher Inflation Has Historically Meant Higher Gold Prices
The good news in all this is that higher inflation has historically been supportive of the price of gold  In the years when inflation was 3 percent or higher  annual gold returns were 15 percent on average  according to the World Gold Council  WGC  
When gold hit its all time high of  1 900 an ounce in August 2011  consumer prices were up nearly 4 percent from the same time the previous year  The 2 year Treasury yield  meanwhile  averaged only 0 21 percent  meaning the T note was delivering a negative real yield and investors were paying the U S  government to hang on to their money  This created a favorable climate for gold  as investors sought a safe haven asset that would at least beat inflation 
CIBC  Major Gold Firms to Generate Strong Free Cash Flow and ROIC
Finally  I want to draw attention to an exciting research report released last week by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  CIBC   I m a huge admirer of the work CIBC does  especially that of Cosmos Chiu  director of precious metals equity research  Chiu and his team write that the  future looks brighter  for gold equities on improved free cash flow and return on invested capital  ROIC  
Both factors are among our favorites  I recently shared with you a chart that shows that  over the past 30 years  ROIC outperformed other factors  link  above  by as much as one and half times  With gold trading near  1 300 an ounce  producers are currently posting positive margins  according to CIBC  As a result  every stock in the bank s large cap universe  with the exception of Kinross  NYSE KGC   is expected to generate positive free cash flow through 2019 
Royalty Streaming Companies Deliver the Profits
The bank has even better news for royalty and streaming companies  particularly Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  and Wheaton Precious Metals  NYSE WPM   For one  the three big royalty names delivered combined shareholder returns of 6 2 percent between 2013 and 2017  outperforming both senior producers and physical gold 
Now  CIBC forecasts the royalty group will generate strong ROICs   steadily inching higher over the next decade  to average between the 5 percent and 8 percent mark from 2018   2023   ROIC measures how well a company can turn its invested capital into profits

Royal Gold  Inc   RGLD 
RGLD broke out of its pattern  The falling wedge broke a couple days ago  and on Tuesday the flag broke  It popped 1 86  or 2 24   on 84 89  on 423 719 shares traded  All it needs to do is get this one over 863 4  and the targets are 91  98  103  and so on

11650,233165,RGLD,Top 3 Gold Mining Stocks To Buy In 2020,opinion,Demand for safe haven investment options such as gold is soft at present  owing to a strong U S  economy and its significant progress on the trade front  However  the situation could change soon  as possible issues emerge on multiple fronts  threatening to distort investors  optimism on stability in the U S  equity market In such a scenario  investors could take a closer look at traditional safe haven assets such as gold mining stocks Gold Could Climb Higher in 2020  Here s WhyFirst  the broader S P 500 Index gained 28 9  in 2019  marking its second best one year performance since 1997  Not only did equities hit record highs  but also investors defeated concerns over U S  China trade war and fears of a global economic slowdown  Now  this definitely makes 2019 a banner year  but doesn t speak kindly of 2020 According to research firm Bespoke Investment Group  since 1928  the S P 500 has been able to return 6 6   on average  in the year following a rally of 20  or more Second  2020 being an election year  political uncertainty would be the backdrop against which stocks must try to thrive  Volatility in the stock market could be prominent because of political risks In fact  the Trump administration is already planning to start a partisan row over Medicaid this year  as reports emerge of officials trying to shortly introduce a means for states to block Medicaid grant  Per the Wall Street Journal  guidance could be released this month  which would access the Trump administration s capacity to permit states the flexibility to make drastic changes to Medicaid In addition  rise in government borrowing is a major concern  In the quarter ending December  the government incurred a deficit of  357

2019 was instrumental in boosting the technology sector  which in turn pushed the broader index higher  In particular  Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   86 2  rally last year boosted the S P 500 s overall gains

11655,233170,RGLD,What Happened To The Dow  S P 500 And Gold During The 2002 Tariffs ,opinion,"At the beginning of March  US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum  This was after imposing tariffs on solar panels and washing machines back in January of this year  The last time there were tariffs imposed on steel imports was in 2002  What was the impact back in 2002 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500  The Dot com bubble had already burst  Was gold used as a safe haven asset during this time  How did gold stocks respond during the turmoil  considering they were already unloved and unwanted 
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE DURING THE 2002 STEEL TARIFFS   Between the last time steel tariffs were signed in March 2002 and the time they were revoked in December 2003  the Dow Jones went one direction after the signing  The index fell by more than 25   The US dollar went down as well  The tariffs were one of the final catalysts after the Dot com bubble  in sending the market further down  By the end of the tariffs  the Dow finished lower  No better off at the end of the day  Gold instead went in the opposite direction because of its safe haven status  This was before the days of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies  Gold also benefited from the decline of the US dollar and the tariffs  as it skyrocketed higher throughout the time the steel tariffs were in place  It ended over 35  higher during this period 


THE S P 500 AND THE 2002 STEEL TARIFFS   The S P 500 didn t fare much better than the Dow after the signing of the tariffs  in fact  its performance was even worse  The index went down by more than 30  once the tariffs were signed  By the time the tariffs had been lifted  the damage had been done  and the S P 500 finished almost 10  lower  Not to be outdone  the tech sector took it the hardest  as the NASDAQ Composite fell by almost 40   Surprisingly  the NASDAQ was the outperformer by the end of it  finishing in positive territory  The damage to the markets took about eight months to fully materialize  from the time of the signing  bottoming out in October 2002  for all three major US indices  Could the recent announcement of multiple tariffs be setting the stage for lower markets  Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubeLine Capital has stated the markets will finish lower for 2018  Will these new steel tariffs be the catalyst 

 HOW DID THE GOLD BUGS INDEX RESPOND    With gold up by more than 30  during the time the tariffs were imposed  and US equity markets ending with modest gains and losses  Would gold equities respond to higher gold prices  Did gold equities get pulled down with the broader market  When looking at the NYSE ARCA Gold BUGS Index  a basket of gold miners  The HUI initially accelerated higher by almost 75   But it did experience headwinds  as the broader market went through the bottoming process in October 2002  By the end of September 2002  the HUI was up by just under 50   Not bad  while the rest of the market was down by more than 20   By the time the steel tariffs had been lifted  the Gold BUGS Index had appreciated by more than 200  

HOW DID THE INDIVIDUAL GOLD STOCKS RESPOND 
Not all the stocks were able to match the performance of the Gold BUGS Index  The major gold miners  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   underperformed the index  Barrick Gold generated returns of approximately 30  before dividends  while Newmont Mining generated returns of just under the 110   In comparison to the Gold Bugs Index which was over 200  
The up and coming gold producer at the time  Goldcorp  NYSE GG  and the royalty company Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   were able to outperform the majors of Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining  Goldcorp posted a return of about 140   while Royal Gold generated a return of almost 230   Will the smaller high growth gold stocks take the lead in 2018 over the majors  if the tariffs remain and history repeats itself  One would put the odds in favor of that occurring because of their embedded high production growth rates  starting at a smaller base  These smaller companies would assumingly exceed the growth rates of the majors  that have a challenge maintaining their current production levels  The law of large numbers becomes difficult for the larger producers  hindering their production growth  We could see further M A in the gold sector if gold prices remain  and CEOs feel the pressure to act  pushing the junior prices higher in the process 
TARIFFS 2 0
After the signing of the steel tariffs to be imposed  gold is now up over  25 or almost 2   while the S P 500 and the Dow  have fallen by more than 5   At one point  they were all down by more than 7   So far  the current round of tariffs seems to be rhyming with the past  Will  it has been over the past four years  The fall in the markets is happening at a much faster rate than during the 2002 tariffs  which is catching a lot of investors off guard  particularly after a strong start to 2018  Bitcoin has since fallen by more than half  with gold returning as its historical safe haven asset as it was put aside  as being replaced by Bitcoin  It seems that as much as things change not much has really changed for now    WILL THE FED CHANGE HISTORY 
The last time there were steel tariffs  interest rates were falling  Now  the scenario is flipped  The outlier could be what happens if the Fed continues to raise rates  as it has stated it plans to do  Will rising rates act as a counterbalance and bring more dollars back into the US  adding to the benefits of the tax cuts  Will this drive equity markets higher and put pressure on the bond market    Although it is still early in this round of steel tariffs  history appears to be acting the same way it did during the last steel tariffs  A lower Dow  S P 500  and NASDAQ  and higher gold  But interest rates were falling  The Fed s willingness to continue to raise interest rates appears to be one of the outliers from the 2002 tariffs  We will see how these tariffs unfold  and how countries respond  which we expect they will  Volatility only looks set to continue either way   Paul Farrugia  BCom  Paul is the President   CEO of First Macro Capital  He helps his readers identify mining stocks that you can hold for the long term ",2018-03-27,Paul Farrugia,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-happened-to-the-dow--gold-during-the-2002-tariffs-200301248,200301248

reasons to be optimistic about gold s performance  entering 2018  He noted  U S interest rates may be rising but a lot is priced into the curve already and the direction of the dollar remains uncertain  Meanwhile  the long bull market in equities raises serious questions about prospects for stock prices  A number of new mines are projected to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2017  which might support mine production till 2018  Noteworthy mines include The Natalka project in Russia  Canada s Rainy River project and Hound  in Burkino Faso On the demand side  major markets  India

laundering legislation   AML   around jewelry retail transactions  we expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST  Also  pent up demand and removal from the scope of PMLA legislation as well as festive buying are anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country  Even though the impact of uneven monsoon rainfall distribution on rural population remains a concern  measures taken by the government to deal with the scenario might be a savior It is believed that the government measures like mandatory hallmarking next year  will be a positive move for the industry  could impact the trade in 2018  Given the insatiable appetite for gold and the rising wealth of Indian consumers  demand is projected to remain strong in the long run Notably  in the third quarter of 2017  China

11662,233177,RGLD,Can Barrick Gold Make A Comeback In 2018 After A Tepid 2017 ,opinion,"The year 2017 has not been a smooth ride for Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX     the biggest producer of gold on the planet  The mining giant has seen its shares skid roughly 10  year to date  underperforming the  s gain of around 6  in the same time frame The under performance  in part  is due to the disputes surrounding Acacia Mining  the largest gold producer in Tanzania in which Barrick holds a 64  stake  that have sparked concerns among investors  Tanzania Troubles Weigh On BarrickThe government of Tanzania imposed a gold and copper concentrate export ban in March 2017 after accusing Acacia of understating its metal shipments  The government also hit Acacia with a massive  190 billion bill in July for allegedly unpaid taxes  interests and fines Export ban on concentrates hurt operations of Acacia in Tanzania  Barrick s share of production from Acacia fell roughly 7  year over year to 122 000 ounces in the third quarter  The company s overall gold production also went down around 10  in the quarter Barrick also narrowed its production outlook for 2017 to 5 3 5 5 million ounces from previous view of 5 3 5 6 million ounces  The export ban has some negative bearings on Barrick s 2017 production  The affected Acacia operations account for roughly 6  of Barrick s production guidance for 2017  In total  Acacia accounts for around 10  of Barrick s overall production The impact of Tanzania s concentrate export ban on Acacia and lower production also weighed on Barrick s bottom line in the third quarter  The company swung to a loss in the quarter  dragged down by a hefty tax provision of  172 million related to the proposed framework for Acacia  Its adjusted earnings also fell short of expectations  Barrick s shares cratered around 8  a day after the earnings release  reflecting the earnings miss  downbeat production guidance and investors  concerns surrounding Acacia   Barrick and the government of Tanzania  in October  established a framework for a new partnership between Acacia Mining and the Tanzanian government  Per the framework  economic benefits generated by Acacia s operations will be shared with Tanzania on a 50 50 basis  moving forward  The Tanzanian government s share of benefits would be delivered in the form of royalties  taxes and a 16  free carry interest in Acacia s operations in Tanzania The government of Tanzania and Barrick also agreed to create a working group  which will focus on the resolution of outstanding tax claims relating to Acacia  Acacia will pay  300 million to the government of Tanzania to resolve outstanding tax claims  with payment terms to be settled by the working group All proposals are subject to review and approval by Acacia shareholders and the Independent Committee of Acacia s board of directors  Barrick aims to finalize the proposal in first half 2018 While the proposed framework is a progress towards ending the long running dispute  it remains uncertain if an export ban that has hurt Acacia s Tanzanian operations will be lifted and whether Barrick will have to make further payments  on account of allegedly unpaid taxes  to the east African nation Will 2018 Bring Better Tidings While troubles associated with Acacia and decreasing production profile weighed on Barrick s stock this year  the company is expected to gain from its operational and cost improvement initiatives  de leveraging actions and efforts to maximize cash flows in 2018 Barrick remains the world s most efficient gold miner  Its all in sustaining cost  AISC  is among the lowest in the gold mining industry  While the company s AISC increased in the third quarter  it was still lower than its major peers  It also sees lower costs in the fourth quarter  Barrick remains committed to manage its costs  through reduction in cost of sustaining capital as well as developing and internal operational costs   which should aid to its results in 2018 Barrick also remains actively focused on de leveraging its balance sheet  The company cut its total debt by roughly  1 billion in the third quarter using cash flows and proceeds from the sale of a 50  interest in Veladero mine Argentina to Shandong Gold Mining Co  It reduced total debt by roughly  1 5 billion year to date  and exceeded the initial target to reduce debt by  1 45 billion for 2017 Barrick looks to reduce its total debt by  2 9 billion to  5 billion by the end of 2018 using cash flows from operations  The company s aggressive debt reduction action should further lower its interest expenses in 2018  Improving balance sheet is also expected to allow the company to look for acquisition opportunities for growth next year Moreover  Barrick has a strong liquidity position  with cash and cash equivalents of around  2 billion at the end of the third quarter  and also generates healthy cash flows  which positions it well to take advantage of attractive development and exploration opportunities  It generated operating cash flows of nearly  1 5 billion during the first three quarters of 2017 The company also generated free cash flow of  225 million in the third quarter  marking the tenth straight quarter of positive free cash flow  This testifies Barrick s focus on boosting free cash flow through capital discipline  improved operational efficiency and productivity  and stronger cost management Barrick also continues to make high return investments in its businesses leveraging cash flows and should benefit from major exploration programs  The company maintains a significant focus on Nevada for growth opportunities  A significant portion of its exploration budget has been allocated to the Americas Positive outlook for gold will also act as a tailwind  Gold has managed to rack up a roughly 9  gain so far this year  despite the prospects of the U S  Federal Reserve hiking interest rates looming large and favorable equity markets Particularly  the yellow metal s prices were buoyed by its safe haven appeal this year owing to geopolitical tensions  Further  frequent terrorist attacks in UK and escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea fueled the price rise this year  In fact  the precious metal broke the threshold limit of  1 300 an ounce this year triggered by the United States North Korea imbroglio Spot gold headed for the biggest gain in three weeks after the Fed hiked interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its December policy meeting  This was because the market had already factored in the possibility of a rate hike given the upbeat economic data  Gold prices trended upward interpreting the Fed s statement as dovish considering that it is planning only three rate hikes in 2018 and not four Per the World Gold Council  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold s performance  entering 2018  A number of new mines are projected to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2017  which might support mine production till 2018 On the demand side  major markets  India and China will continue to be growth drivers  Further  the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence  Demand from central banks is also expected to remain strong  As such  a favorable outlook for gold augurs well for Barrick Barrick is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus

11663,233178,RGLD,Gold Kick Starts 2018 On A High  4 Growth Gold Stocks To Buy,opinion,"Gold prices hit a three month high on the last trading day of 2017  drawing curtains on its best yearly performance since 2010  Notably  spot gold was up more than 12  last year  The bullish momentum has continued in 2018 so far with gold currently trending above the psychological level of  1 300 an ounce  The rally has been fueled by a weaker dollar and renewed safe haven buying prompted by heightened geopolitical tensions Weaker Dollar Aids Gold s CauseGold is sensitive to dollar fluctuations  The dollar slumped almost 10  in 2017  marking its worst performance since 2003  Even though the dollar had started 2017 on a high  riding on hopes that President Trump would implement pro growth and pro inflation measures  However  concerns about Trump s ability to push through those policies started to weigh on the greenback soon 
Further  it lost steam as growth picked up outside the United States  with other countries  central banks moving toward tighter monetary policy  consequently narrowing the gap between the Federal Reserve and others  Moreover  tensions over North Korea and persistently low U S  inflation led to the decline Dollar started 2018 on a weak footing with the dollar index hitting a three month low  This was in tandem with a drop in US Treasury bond yields  which suggest markets are cooling expectations for higher interest rates in the United States in 2018 
While the Fed has stated that it will raise interest rates three times in 2018  the market is skeptical and anticipates raise less than three times  Furthermore  a matter of concern is that the leadership at the Federal Reserve is due to be replaced in 2018 and markets are unsure regarding the policies of the new team Continued Geopolitical Uncertainty is Fueling PricesLast year  despite favorable equity markets  the yellow metal s prices were fueled by its safe haven appeal owing to geopolitical tensions globally  Frequent terrorist attacks in UK and escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea propelled gold prices  In fact  the precious metal broke the threshold limit of  1 300 an ounce in 2017 triggered by the United States North Korea imbroglio  With Kim Jong un s threat of  nuclear button  ready at his desk in his New Year s speech  we believe this situation will continue to stoke safe haven buying for gold Another recent development that helped prop up gold prices is a series of protests in Iran  demanding an overthrow of the ruling government Rising Oil Prices to Support GoldRise in oil prices put upward pressure on inflation  This in turn enhances the appeal of gold as it acts as an inflation hedge  Last year  oil prices delivered a significant recovery  Posting its second annual gain in a row  the commodity closed 2017 up more than 12   The U S  oil benchmark ended the year at  60 42 per barrel  marking its highest closing since June 2015  The major catalyst was the Energy Department s inventory release  which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher than expected weekly draw Moreover  a supply disruption in the North Sea  which is expected to trigger further reductions in global oil inventories  and the demonstrations in Iran are aiding the oil market  This is bullish for precious metals like gold Gold Industry Performance  PositioningThe Gold Mining  has advanced 8 6  compared with the S P 500 s growth of 11 6  in the past six months  Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures   the gold mining industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 7 46  much lower than the S P 500 s EV EBITDA multiple of 11 86 The industry s lower than market positioning calls for some more improvement in the near term The Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks  The way to look at the complete list of industries is we put our industries  all 265 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  In the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1  Click here to know more  Within the Zacks Industry classification  the gold mining industry is grouped under the  sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   The gold mining industry currently occupies a space in the top half of the Zacks classified industries with a Rank of  57 What Awaits in 2018 Per the World Gold Council CEO Aram Shishmanian  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold s performance in 2018  He noted  U S interest rates may be rising but a lot is priced into the curve already and the direction of the dollar remains uncertain  Meanwhile  the long bull market in equities raises serious questions about prospects for stock prices  With chances of dollar depreciating further as investors remain skeptical whether U S  tax cuts will stimulate economic growth or not  the yellow metal stands to gain from the scenario A number of new mines entered production in fourth quarter 2017  which might support mine production till 2018  Noteworthy mines include The Natalka project in Russia  Canada s Rainy River project and Hound  in Burkino Faso On the demand side  major markets  India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers  Last year  the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax   GST   and anti money laundering legislation   AML   around jewelry retail transactions  We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST 
Pent up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country  Moreover  government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018  will be a positive move for the industry  In China  retail demand remains high around the Chinese New Year Further  the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence  Elsewhere  Germany s economy is expected to maintain momentum and unemployment is anticipated to continue declining  providing support for the world s third largest bar and coin market

11671,233186,RGLD,Income Up  Strong Operations And A Rebirth  ,opinion,"   NASDAQ GAIN 10 29  7 6   had a stellar quarter  with net income  unrealized gains  and book value all up  nonaccrual loans down  Net investment income is well above the current dividend  despite an increase in October  in the latest quarter  unusually  177  above the payout  though much of this is due to one loan that came off nonaccrual  with  1 4 million of prior interest recovery 
The company now has  12 million of undistributed income and net realized gains  about  0 38 per share  This will be used to fund the semiannual extra distributions  Debt instruments  accounting for 73  of the portfolio  funds the regular monthly dividend  while gains are intended to fund the extra distributions 
Gladstone also made several investments this past quarter  though these are always lumpy  One   31 million in debt and equity  went to a new company   8 4 million went to additional investments in existing portfolio companies  Even after this  the company has plenty of capacity on its credit facility and said it was not looking to increase that  With interest rates rising  Gladstone s 97  of outstanding loans being at variable rates  is a positive 
Higher distributions ahead   Even without another regular dividend increase  and assuming bonus distributions equal to those of last year the company has the undistributed gains and realized gains for that the prospective yield runs to 8 76   It could likely be higher  Gladstone is a solid hold for us  and a buy  preferably on a pullback  if you do not own

11672,233187,RGLD,Should You Be Investing In Gold ,opinion,"Wall Street is jittery right now as Trump really looks like he wants to launch a trade war  and the gold bugs come out when things look jittery  Gold is a stable source of value  they say  People have used it for thousands of years  It is a good investment when the inevitable bear market hits 
It is true that gold generally performs better during a bear market  and a bear market appears far more likely now than it did at the beginning of the year  But even then  investing directly in gold is not a good idea  There are ways to take advantage of an increased interest in gold that are safer and will earn more over the long run 
The Problem with Gold
From a certain perspective  the very idea of  investing  in gold is bizarre  When you invest in a company  you give them money to get a cash flow which will increase your wealth in the long run  A rudimentary example is that 500 years ago  you might invest in a merchant ship in the hopes of it returning and giving you a share of its silks and spices  Today  you would get a dividend from any company you invest in 
But if you buy a bar of gold today  you have that same bar of gold five year from now  That bar of gold might be worth less or more depending on the circumstances  but you are hoping that others will pay more for that bar instead of receiving something more than when you started  That is why gold is just as much speculation as it is an investment 
Because gold is speculative  it is far more volatile  As a very basic example  look at a chart showing the price of gold over the past year  which is currently at around  1 325  Now compare that chart to the stock chart of any other major company  whether Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  or McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  or Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   You should notice that gold s value bounces up and down far more 
The risks in speculating gold only further increase if you decide to invest in physical bullion or gold coins as opposed to going for   You have to spend extra to insure and store any physical items which cuts into potential profits  and the profits for selling gold are taxed more heavily than a capital gains tax  Buying physical gold also attracts scammers who try to sell you some super rare coin whose value will definitely go up and make you rich  Buying bullion is risky  but you should never buy gold or silver coins 
Where to Invest
Everything listed above should make it clear that investing in gold  especially buying gold bullion directly  is not a good idea  Instead of joining a gold rush  investors should instead invest in the man selling shovels   or to be more specific  the company mining gold 
Companies like Alamos Gold Inc  TO AGI  are unquestionably a better investment as they represent a real productive investment which will continue to mine more gold over time  But even a mining company carries problems  as mining is an expensive and time consuming process which carries significant risk 
Mining companies frequently have to work with streamers  which are companies which finance mining operations in exchange for a share of the mines  Streaming companies can invest in a wide range of mines  which grants them more diversification compared to mining companies which only work on a few mines  Major streaming companies include Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV  or Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   and these companies are generally better investments than buying gold directly  Other options include investing in gold futures or a gold ETF 
Note that all of this assumes that the price of gold goes up in the near future  and there is no guarantee that will be the case despite the current jitters in the market  Gold should have risen significantly compared to January 1 as the Federal Reserve indicated that it was going to raise interest rates and was more concerned about inflation  But the value has stayed roughly the same 
There are reasons to think that the gold price will enter a bull market in the near future  Rising commodity prices  fueled by increased consumption in China  is a good sign as gold does have some industrial uses  The recent Italian election results  as well as the upcoming annual Indian Gudi Padwa which see Indians buy gold in mass  could start to push gold up as markets turn jittery  That would fuel investor interest in gold  which would further unnerve the markets  and be the beginnings of a bull market 
But that is only one possible scenario  and gold over the long term is a volatile and risky investment even under the current circumstances  There are better ways to take advantage of an upcoming bear market or keeping your money safe  and investing in gold miners or streamers remains a better investment compared to buying gold directly ",2018-03-09,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-be-investing-in-gold-200296804,200296804
11676,233191,RGLD,I m Bullish On Gold Royalty Plays And Bitcoin,opinion,"Some of you reading this might already be familiar with the  Parable of the Talents   but it s worth a brief retelling 
The story  which appears in the gospels of Matthew and Mark  involves a master who entrusts three servants with some of his  talents   or gold coins  while he s away on business  Two of the servants take a risk by putting the money to work and end up doubling their master s wealth  The third servant  however  buries his share to  keep it safe  and so doesn t generate any returns   Indeed it likely loses value because of inflation  
When the master returns  he s so pleased at how the first two servants grew his wealth that he puts them in charge of  many things  and invites them to share in his own success 
The third servant  though  he calls  wicked and lazy  and says he might as well have deposited the money in a bank while he was away at least then he would have received a little interest  The servant is punished by having his share of the talents given to the two who faithfully grew their master s money  leaving him with nothing 
The lesson here should be plainly obvious  and we can express it in a number of different ways  There can be no reward without risk  You must spend money to make money  You reap what you sow  This should resonate with investors  entrepreneurs and any true believer in the power of capitalism 
Jesus  parable applies not just to individuals but to corporations as well  Companies must grow to keep up with the rising cost of labor and materials and to stay competitive  To do that  they must put their money to work just as the two servants do 
And just as the two servants were invited to share in their master s success  corporate growth has a multiplier effect for the company s employees and their families  shareholders  the local economy  strategic partners  companies up and down the supply chain and much more 
Bonanza For Precious Metal Royalty Companies As Exploration Budgets Decline
I think the business model that best illustrates the meaning of the  Parable of the Talents  is the one practiced by gold and precious metal royalty companies  As much as I write and talk about royalty companies  I still encounter investors who aren t aware of how significant a role they play in the mining space 
As a refresher  these firms help finance explorers and producers  operations by buying royalties or rights to a stream  Because miners have had to slash exploration budgets since the decline in metal prices  the kind of financing royalty companies provide has only grown in demand as evidenced by the mostly positive earnings reports last week 
Chief among them is Franco Nevada  TO FNV   which had a very strong third quarter  reporting earnings of  55 3 million  or  0 30 a share  up 3 4 percent from the same three month period last year  The Toronto based company  having also recently diversified into the oil royalties space  closed its purchase of an oil royalty for C 92 5 million  bringing the number of its oil and gas assets up to 82  Including precious metals and other minerals  the total number of assets Franco Nevada had in its diverse portfolio as of the end of the quarter stood at 341 
Here s the multiplier effect  Not only do the miners benefit from the deals  allowing them to continue exploration and other operations  but shareholders are also rewarded handsomely  Since the company went public nearly 10 years ago  it s raised its dividend each year and its share price has outperformed both gold and relevant gold equity benchmarks  After its earnings announcement last Monday  Franco Nevada stock closed up more than 6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE   its best one day performance in nearly a year and a half  Shares hit a fresh all time high last week 

Other royalty companies  reports were just as impressive and show the rewards of putting your  talents  to work  Sandstorm Gold  NYSE SAND   reporting higher operating cash flow of  11 9 million  has acquired as many as 10 separate royalties since the end of September on properties in Peru  Botswana and South Africa that collectively cover more than 2 4 million acres 
Osisko Gold Royalties bought a  1 1 billion portfolio of 74 precious mineral royalties  including a 9 6 percent diamond stream  The company reported record quarterly gold equivalent ounces  GEOs  of 16 664  up 65 percent from the same quarter last year  and record quarterly revenues from royalties and streams of  26 1 million  up 48 percent 
Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  also had a strong quarter  reporting operating cash flow of  72 million  an increase of 30 percent from last year  and returned as much as  16 million to shareholders in dividends 
Wheaton Precious Metals  NYSE WPM   the world s largest precious metal streaming company  showed a sizeable decline in profits in the third quarter  but it continued to generate strong cash flow and looks poised to meet its end of year production guidance 
Although some investors might not realize how important these companies are to the industry  many other investors are opting to place their bets on royalty names  seeing them as having ample exposure to precious metals without some of the risks associated with producers  In its review of the third quarter  the World Gold Council  WGC  reported that global gold demand fell to an eight year low as investment in gold ETFs slowed to 18 9 metric tons  down from 144 3 metric tons in last year s September quarter  This could be a consequence of the media s continued negative coverage of gold  despite its competitive performance against the S P 500 Index  Whatever the cause  in this environment  there was no lack of love for royalty names  as you can see in the chart above 
A Changing Financial Landscape
We were one of Wheaton Precious Metals  seed investors in 2004  when it was then known as Silver Wheaton  Because Franco Nevada wouldn t be spun off from Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  for another three years  Wheaton had first mover advantage  It was something new  something different  This  coupled with what I recognized as a superior business model  gave me the conviction to allocate capital into the fledgling company  a move that turned out to be highly profitable 
Today I have the same conviction in blockchain technology and digital currencies  As of the end of October  the initial coin offering  ICO  market had raised  3 billion so far this year  That s more than seven times the amount generated in crowdfunding in all of the previous years before 2017  And Bloomberg just reported that Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  searches for  buy bitcoin  recently surpassed searches for  buy gold  

With bitcoin s market cap having grown past that of Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   cryptocurrencies can no longer be written off as a curiosity  Major financial institutions have become bullish  having filed approximately 2 700 patents in blockchain technology 
Abigail Johnson  the youthful chairman of Fidelity  was quoted as saying   Blockchain technology isn t just a more efficient way to settle securities  it will fundamentally change market structures  and maybe even the architecture of the internet itself   Johnson allegedly has a crypto mining computer rig in her office  and Fidelity accountholders are now able to see their bitcoin holdings on the brokerage firm s online platform  USAA  the massive financial firm used by millions of U S  military personnel and their families worldwide  provides a similar service 

This all comes as Coinbase  a leading digital currency broker  saw a record number of people opening new accounts on its platform recently  doubling the number of accounts from the beginning of the year  In one 24 hour period  100 000 new accounts were opened 
Millennials Driving Interest In Blockchain And Cryptocurrencies
A lot of this growth in demand is thanks to millennials  the largest U S  generation  Forget the stereotype of the  entitled  millennial in the workplace and the misconception that they re all wasting their money on  10 avocado toast  Consulting firm Deloitte estimates that by 2020  millennials will make up 50 percent of the workforce and control between  19 trillion and  24 trillion  Many are savvy investors and were found to be more likely to be aware of their brokerage account fees than older generations  according to Charles Schwab s  NYSE SCHW  Modern Wealth index 
In some ways  millennials are reshaping our living habits  Many of them choose to rent instead of own to stay mobile  They re more likely to get their news from Twitter than from TV  Online dating apps have helped foster today s hookup culture  but while young people now might have more sex partners than before  they re having less sex overall than their parents or grandparents might have had at their age 
It s little surprise  then  that millennials are among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of blockchain technology  bitcoin and digital currencies in general none of which existed even 10 years ago  A poll conducted by Blockchain Capital found that large percentages of millennials would prefer  1 000 in bitcoin to  1 000 in other assets  More than a quarter said they would prefer bitcoin to stocks  while nearly a third preferred it to bonds 

What I find especially encouraging is that only 4 percent of those who took the poll owned or had owned bitcoins  I say encouraging because this suggests there s quite a lot of upside potential for bitcoin ownership  which in turn could raise prices further  As I shared with you recently  Metcalfe s law states that the bigger the network of users  the greater that network s value becomes  Consider Facebook  NASDAQ FB   The social media giant has more than 2 billion active users  That s 2 billion pairs of eyes Facebook is able to charge top dollar for advertisers to reach  helping it deliver record profits in the third quarter 
We could see the same thing happen across the blockchain and cryptocurrency network as more and more businesses and people embrace this new form of exchange 
Ploughing Capital Into Blockchain
It should be clear by now that something is changing in financial markets  and this is what inspired me to make a strategic investment in a company with first mover advantage in the cryptocurrency space  just as we did with Silver Wheaton years ago  As the  Parable of the Talents  teaches us  no reward can come to you without some risk taking  Doing nothing is not an option

11679,233194,RGLD,Gold Miners Enmeshed In 2017 Whipsaw,opinion,"Ever since 2012 s failure of the  QE 3 rally  in the precious metals it has not been fruitful to micro manage the gold sector  because that failure jump started a savage bear market that would need time to work out the excesses both in the sector s investor base and in its mining businesses  which had become bloated and inefficient  That s what bear markets do  they clean out the landscape to make it inhabitable for new investors one day 
Here is a weekly chart showing the bear s kickoff  HUI s 55 week EMA then became the ball and chain that kept its fate sealed  red arrows  until January of 2016 

In anticipating the next bull phase  we use several different charts  daily  weekly  monthly  and macro indicators 
Daily charts have not yet triggered the all clear  the  and the weekly chart below shows HUI still underneath the EMA 55  Ever since the correction that began in the summer of 2016 however  the index has been in a whipsaw battle with this key moving average  Traders probably love this  but those trying to confirm a new bull trend  not to mention a bear resumption  have been frustrated  Adding more weight to the EMA 55 s resistance is the fact that this area is also a neckline to a bearish pattern  as highlighted  
The bulls do have a hit of the 62  Fib retrace in December of 2016 going for them  although as long as HUI remains below the EMA 55  198 73  a possibility of a test of the December 2016 low  or possibly even lower  remains in play  What would break the whipsaw s grip  A break to the upside and a clearing of the April and February highs 

Based on other work we are doing  May s monthly close was an important boost for the bullish case  ref  the above linked post for the monthly chart   But a monthly chart is tricky  what matters is the monthly close  so understand that June could include a whole lot of whipsaw and still end up constructive  The technicals are what they are and on the index  they are not yet bullish and indeed  lean bearish below the EMA 55 
But the sector as a whole is diverged by some relative quality companies  large and small  Larger royalties and miners like Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   Randgold Resources  NASDAQ GOLD  and smaller ones like Wesdome  TO WDO   Kirkland Lake  TO KL  and Sabina  TO SBB  seem to be making an early bullish call on the sector 
But first the technical struggle with HUI s weekly EMA 55  among a range of other technical parameters  and the fundamental struggle with the Macrocosm  with gold vs  commodities generally looking constructive  but important items like the stock market s persistent strength and the still okay economy remaining important holdouts to the bull case  
Of course the 1999 2001 time frame  which we are using as a  comp  to the current situation  featured a booming economy  until it no longer boomed  and a booming stock market  until it blew out  NASDAQ  and finally rolled over  Dow and S P 500  
So be patient gold bugs  Tune out the perma pom pom promoters and do good  diligent work and things may well set up just fine and one day  much better than fine  Meanwhile  with literally a world of bulling stock markets  bearish commodities and a bond market that is soon to set up an opposite contrarian situation to the one  in December  I plan to make sure we re continually on the job sorting things out rationally  as we have been doing for years  over the various cycles ",2017-06-06,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-miners-in-2017-whipsaw-200193337,200193337

11681,233196,RGLD,Is This Gold Silver Royalty Company Poised To Rally ,opinion,"Peter Epstein of Epstein Research explains why he believes the pieces are falling into place for this royalty and streaming company 
I ve written two articles         about an emerging precious metals Royalty Streaming  R S  company in the past two months  I figured that would have been enough until August  especially after the  flash crash  that sent silver briefly to US  15 21 oz  on July 7th  So why am I revisiting Metalla Royalty   Streaming Ltd  SNX MTA  again so soon  First  I was reminded by several readers that an important catalyst for the company is its listing on the TSX Venture Exchange  within two months  I hereby restate that event as not just an important catalyst  but a near term catalyst 
While some might not think of two months as near term  it is for those smart enough to buy shares BEFORE the up listing  The average daily trading volume after the Coeur Mining deal was announced through the end of June has been  120 000 shares  It would not take a hell of a lot of buying to return the share price to the  0 60 s  at  0 52 on July 10th  
Second  valuation as measured by a cash flow multiple is cheap compared to precious metal R S peers  However  several peers are giants like Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   Wheaton Precious Metals Corp  NYSE WPM  and Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   prompting some to question the wisdom in using majors as comps  Point taken  Metalla Royalty is not directly comparable to the largest players  but as it grows through acquisitions like the  with Coeur Mining Inc  NYSE CDE   it will become attractive to a larger universe of investors  including a range of U S  and Canadian investment funds  The TSX V listing is expected soon after the closing of the Coeur transaction 
Third  initiation of a quarterly cash dividend  which I thought was next year s business  could potentially be announced in the 4th quarter  I m guessing it would start out small  with room to grow  Even a half penny quarterly dividend   2 0 cents yr   would be a 3 85  yield  and only a 26  payout ratio  assuming 71 M shares outstanding and C 5 6 M in annual run rate cash flow  

Fourth  since May 31st  a large short Interest has developed in Metalla  from a modest 47 500 shares to 1 090 000 shares on 6 30 17  Yet the share price in June was actually up from  0 51 to  0 53  There was modest insider buying and no insider selling in the month and modest insider buying continues in July  I believe a perfect storm could be brewing for summer s end  when the Coeur transaction closes and the TSX V listing is secured  If a dividend is announced  that too could lead to buying and would add to the holding cost of being short the shares  I think there will be strong buying interest once MTA is on the TSX V  because I m told there are a number of institutional accounts on the sidelines waiting for the up listing 
Fifth  management expects to announce at least one  and possibly two  additional acquisitions by year end  This could potentially boost annual CF from about C 5 6 M to C 8 M   a tremendous start for an up and coming R S company 
Metalla Royalty   Streaming holds great promise as an emerging R S company  2018 could be a breakout year for the company in terms of cash flow growth  asset diversification  leveraging the portfolio platform and name recognition  The Coeur Mining transaction is already opening doors  it has put Metalla on the map 
As exciting as the story is  readers are reminded that this is a high risk  small cap company  Closing the Coeur transaction and obtaining the TSX V listing are risk factors worth watching this summer  Metalla s low EV CF ratio  about 6 7 1  is an indicator of a cheap valuation  but there s no guarantee that the ratio will soon converge with that of peer companies like AuRico Metals Inc  TO AMI  and Maverix Metals Inc  V MMX  with EV CF ratios of  12 14 1   The company s short operating history as a R S company might give some investors pause  but therein lies the opportunity as well  to pick up shares before investors catch on that Metalla is the real deal 

I believe that over the next several quarters  Metalla s absolute and relative valuation to industry peers will improve  It won t happen overnight  but it needn t take year s  either  That s assuming management continues to execute well 
Everything is falling into place  i  gold   silver prices are fairly weak  enabling the company to strike more favorable deals in the near to intermediate term  locking in leverage to longer term uptick in prices ii  Metalla has millions of dollars in loss carry forwards from the previous shell company that will help shield it from cash taxes  iii  management has a full pipeline of transactions for review  iv  upon close of Coeur transaction  the company is already meaningfully de risked  will be robustly cash flow positive  
That means that in coming years cash flow growth could be much  much higher than peers  with operating margins the same or better  How long will Metalla Royalty s EV CF ratio remain at 1 2 to 1 4 that of peers  Its P NAV ratio well under 1 0 to 1 vs   1 5   3 0  to 1 among industry players 
Who knows if or when these valuation gaps might close  but for those with the stomach for high risk  it might be wise to begin investing in this opportunity sooner rather than later

11683,233198,RGLD,A Time For Caution  Though Gold Stocks Look Like Good Buys,opinion,"While fund manager Adrian Day believes investors should tread cautiously in the market right now  he is upbeat on some gold stocks 
Given our caution on the broad stock market  resulting from relatively high prices across the board  we have relatively few  buy  recommendations  Most of our buys are concentrated on the gold stocks  and even there  many of our limits are below current prices  I do not think one needs to be aggressive in the current environment 
Of course  so much depends on your personal circumstances all the  financial planning  circumstances such as age  future financial obligations and so forth as well as what your current portfolio looks like 
If  for example  you do not own very much in the gold space  I should certainly step up to the plate now  start with two major gold royalty companies  Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE  61 27  and Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX  65 51   top buys on our current list  Both are solid buys now  particularly if you do not already own them  We could see both at lower prices in coming weeks  given the sharp runs they have both experienced over the past three weeks  Franco from  54 77 and Royal from  61 37  Prices half way between recent lows and the current price would be a fair target  i e    58 81 for Franco and  63 40 for Royal  
American Capital  Yamana and Sunridge Redux  The acquisition of American Capital Ltd  by another of our recommendations  Ares Capital Corporation  NASDAQ ARCC   has now been completed  Shareholders received  10 13 cash plus 0 483 of a share of Ares  Most definitely  hold your Ares shares 
To add insult to injury  investors had a Canadian tax withholding taken on the receipt of the Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  purchase rights recently distributed  The rights were over 20 cents when distributed the value on which the tax was based even though  because of the convoluted procedure required for U S  shareholders  they could not be sold at that time  By the time one large custodian finally had the rights free trading in accounts  the price had fallen to far less than the minimum commission the custodian charges  Through a combination of a cavalier company with an ill judged plan  a rapacious tax authority  and an incompetent custodian  many shareholders end up with a loss on the distribution of these rights 
Sunridge Gold Corp  added a touch of icing to its liquidation after its assets were acquired in a friendly takeover  with the distribution of a second tranche  of CA 0 03 per share  A third and final distribution will be made once a lawsuit is settled  expected by the middle of the year  It is estimated to be around another 3 cents  though could be higher or lower depending on any expenses

11686,233201,RGLD,Gold Shoots To 1 Year High On North Korea Nuke Test,opinion,Gold prices soared to its highest in almost a year on North Korea s claims of successfully testing its most powerful nuclear bomb ever  This threatening move rattled markets  driving investors away from stocks to safe haven assets such as gold  Gold peaked to  1 339 47 an ounce  at par with levels last witnessed in Sep 2016  Gold has exhibited a bullish run so far this year  gaining 16   riding on the back of a weaker dollar and escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea  With North Korea s aggressive stance aiding the yellow metal break the threshold limit of  1 300 an ounce this year  On Sep 3  North Korea successfully conducted its sixth nuclear test  of an advanced hydrogen bomb  It is claimed to be small and light enough to be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile  The test triggered a 6 3 magnitude tremor indicating that the size of the nuclear test was more powerful than the atomic weapons used by the United States during World War II  North Korea had made such claims in the past but had not attained this feat previously  The United States retaliated with a threat of a  massive  military response if it or its allies were put at risk  This test comes on the heels of North Korea firing a missile on Aug 29 that passed over Hokkaido  the second largest island of Japan before landing in the sea  Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stated that it was an unprecedented  serious and grave threat to Japan  U S  President Donald Trump responded by saying  all options on table  when it comes to dealing with Pyongyang  Over the last few years  North Korea has been striving toward becoming a legitimate nuclear power  The relationship between the United States and North Korea has soured significantly  If North Korea has indeed successfully tested a hydrogen bomb that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile  then the threat to the United States and its allies increases dramatically  Mounting fears regarding what next   negotiation or war   works in favor of gold which is considered a good store of value during political turmoil  Further  ongoing uncertainty over the economic agenda of President Trump and mounting speculation on whether the Fed will deliver a third rate hike this year has fueled the price rise  Gold prices rallied recently on tepid job data  The Labor Department stated nonfarm payrolls increased by 156 000 in August  much below the economists  forecast of an increase of 180 000  Also  inflation has remained stubbornly low  This has led investors and analysts to expect the Fed to become more accommodative with monetary policy  Consequently year to date  the gold has outperformed the S P 500  The industry has gained 17 9  in contrast with the S P 500 s increase of 10 7  Valuation looks attractive for industry going by the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  multiple  a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries  The industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 7 7 lower than the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 11 0  The industry s lower than market positioning calls for some more upside moving ahead  Gold miners have also experienced a surge this year in sync with gold prices and outdid the industry and S P 500 as well  To name a few  IAMGOLD Corporation   TO IAG    Seabridge Gold Inc    NYSE SA    Gold Fields Limited   NYSE GFI   Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   and Kinross Gold Corporation   NYSE KGC

another rate hike will keep the interest alive in gold this year  For investors keen on this industry  Golden Star Resources Ltd    NYSE GSS   can be a solid addition to one s portfolio  backed by a

11688,233203,RGLD,BioTelemetry  Royal Gold  Microsoft And Amazon Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 6  2017    BioTelemetry  Nasdaq    NASDAQ BEAT       as the Bull of the Day  Royal Gold  Nasdaq    NASDAQ RGLD       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft Corp   Nasdaq    NASDAQ MSFT       and Amazon  Nasdaq    NASDAQ AMZN       Here is a synopsis of all four stocks                                      BioTelemetry  Nasdaq       is a  1 billion provider of cardiac monitoring equipment and services with an emphasis on mobile and wireless capabilities The company is focused on advancing mobile and wireless health services by providing leading technology and services that help healthcare providers monitor and diagnose patients and clinical research subjects in a more efficient  accurate  and cost effective manner The stock has been a Zacks  1 Rank Strong Buy several times this year due to steadily rising sales and EPS growth estimates After the company s second quarter report in early August where they beat the consensus and raised guidance  Wall Street analysts raised this year s profit projection 19  from  0 88 to  1 05  representing 24  annual growth And next year s EPS target climbed 18  from  1 24 to  1 46  for a whopping 39  growth trajectory The profit outlooks are driven primarily by strong sales growth of 37  this year and nearly 36  projected for next year How Does BEAT Make Money Speaking of top line growth  those sales totals for this year and next are  286 million and  388 million  respectively The company s primary source of revenue is not in devices  but in the service fees charged for wireless and remote healthcare monitoring  Currently  BioTelemetry estimates that the market for its services is between  1 5 and  2 billion  Royal Gold  Nasdaq      is a  5 6 billion gold miner that has rallied 38  this year while its chosen metal has notched a 10  gain  as measured by the SPDR Gold ETF  NYSE GLD  But the stock has fallen to a Zacks  5 Rank Strong Sell this month based on declining earnings estimates In the past 60 days  the current fiscal year  which just began in July  saw analysts drop their EPS profit projections from  1 61 to  1 45 Now that might not seem so bad on the surface  but it spells  6   growth  for the year Okay  even that might not bother you as a gold mining investor But it always pays to consider two major elements of the gold trade that I have been pointing out for the past 10 years 1  Gold is NOT the inflation hedge that investors thought it was decades ago  In a world where fiat currencies and central bank hegemony have proven they can stabilize and foster the global economy  gold has become nearly irrelevant as a hedge This is not a theory  The behavior of thousands of institutional investors controlling trillions in wealth has validated that they believe and act on the fungibility of central bank monetary policy and liquidity management  bonds and rates  And I m not talking about speculators acting on  money printing bubbles  The US economy is part of a global ecosystem of  bonds and rates  liquidity And    when it comes to the currencies we use for global econ measuring sticks  it s all relative 2  Which brings me to the other major element that most wanna be global macro analysts miss  Currencies ONLY move in relation to each other The logical conclusion  If you believe that an inflation threat will significantly drive the US dollar DOWN  then you would clearly benefit by shifting assets to the other major economies currencies like Europe and Asia But you have to ask yourself    Do you really believe that the US economy and stock market are going to  hell in hand basket  If your answer is  No   then why would you be so eager  or crazy  to focus your attention on hedging your  dollar inflation risk  by buying gold While some investors spend all their time listening to gold bugs like Peter Schiff or Jim Rickards  the rest of us are TROUNCING their returns in the stock market where earnings growth can absolutely clobber any gold currency hedge you might construct    no matter what the USD does If you doubt what I m saying  just look at multi year chart of gold vs the US dollar What you ll see is the ebb and flow of gold  as it gains value on dollar weakness and then swings back to weakness on dollar strength And you might notice that year to date in 2017  while gold is up 10   the US dollar may have just bottomed in September at  10  If there s any trend of interest rates heading higher  the US dollar is sure to follow And that means gold is headed lower If I m wrong  your best course would be to buy the euro currency  You could make a lot more on some insane inflation burst like we saw in 2007 when oil went to  150 and the euro to  1 60 But don t buy gold or gold stocks  You will do much better in equites  or a simple  It s All Relative Cooker Says  currency hedge The Barbarous RelicI could be wrong  And I should reveal my bias in all this macro monetary analysis   I believe  as John Maynard Keynes taught us nearly a century ago  there is no place for the yellow metal in the global monetary system where central banks have proven FIAT RULES and IT S ALL RELATIVE Disclosure  I maintain net short positions in gold derivatives  including futures  options  ETFs and selected equities Additional content Here s Why Microsoft Was Up ThursdayOn Thursday  shares of tech giant Microsoft Corp   Nasdaq       were gaining in afternoon trading  up over 1 7  to  76 01 by 2 00 PM EST after the company was upgraded earlier the day Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis upgraded Microsoft stock to  Buy  from  Hold   as well as raised his price target to  86 from  76 per share  Our analysis suggests that investors have underestimated the virtuous cycles that Microsoft has created by assembling four compelling growth drivers in   1  office productivity   2  gaming   3  marketing  and  4  Azure s platform as a service   Davis said   Our model teardown suggests that these drivers set the firm up for a sustained period of accelerating growth  In particular  Davis points out Microsoft s gaming division  noting that the company  which makes the popular Xbox gaming system  could potentially become a big player in the e sports industry  This industry is known for its huge video game tournaments  and already brings in thousands of participants and viewers    Microsoft is set to release the latest version of Xbox  called the Xbox One X  in November  just in time for the holidays Davis also highlights the financial benefits Microsoft is seeing from moving its customers from continuous license versions of

11705,233220,RGLD,Forget The Gold Slump  These Gold Stocks Are Good Buys,opinion,"Gold prices fell 0 6  yesterday to  1 337 22 on the release of minutes from the U S  Fed s July meeting  which showed Fed officials expected an interest rate hike soon but were still awaiting more data  Given that chances of a rate hike later this year have increased  this has dealt a blow to safe haven assets such as gold Earlier on Tuesday  New York Fed President William Dudley had said the Federal Reserve could  in all probability  raise interest in September  Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart also pitched in with his opinion by saying that the U S  economy was probably strong enough to withstand at least one rate hike this year  even with two being a possibility As per the minutes  while the members were generally upbeat about the U S  economy and labor market  several opine any slowdown in jobs would work against a near term hike  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 21 92 points  0 12   to 18573 94 while the S P 500 gained 4 07 points  0 19   to 2182 22  The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 55 points or 0 03  to 5228 66  All three indexes are currently near records as ultra low rates and central banks  quantitative easing of policies have suppressed returns on bonds  making stocks look attractive in comparison Earlier this month  an encouraging July job report raised chances of a Fed rate hike in September  led to a drop in gold prices  Notwithstanding the recent slides  gold has surged 26  so far this year  The chances of an upside for gold remains  since a variety of risks continues to hover on the horizon  Britain s historic decision to leave the EU is working in favor of gold  Further  the path for U S  rate hikes is still unclear Gold prices are generally helped by retail demand in countries like India and China  with the wedding and festival seasons occurring in the second half of the year  India will be a major driver with pent up demand having intensified due to the shutdown of jewelry stores earlier in the year  A good monsoon also bodes well for gold Another factor that will eventually be a tailwind for gold is the supply of the precious metal having already attained peak levels as per reports  Global production of gold is likely to decline by 3  in 2016  thus ending a 7 year stint of rising output  Lower mined outputs forming the gold supply could help prices move north MINING GOLD Industry Price Index

11706,233221,RGLD,5 Low Beta Stocks To Endure A Volatile Market,opinion,There is no hard and fast rule that you must always invest in risky stocks for above market returns  Yes  risky securities always perform better than the market during a bull run  But when the market starts following the bearish path  investors will get much lower returns  Hence  it s best to build a strategy on low risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks which are less prone to market movements What Really Beta Means Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  In this article  we are considering the S P 500 as the market If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market  So the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1  In the same way  the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1 For example  if the market offers a return of 20   a stock with beta of 3 will return 60   which is overwhelming  Similarly  when the market slips 20  the stock will sink 60   which is devastating Screening Criteria We have taken beta between 0 and 0 6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market  But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy  We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero  This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening Coty Inc    NYSE COTY   is involved in operations like manufacturing  marketing and distributing beauty products all over the world  For the last four quarters  the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 50 03   Moreover  over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 saw an increase of almost 4    The Advisory Board Company   NASDAQ ABCO   is the prime provider of best practices research and analysis mainly to the health care sector  In the last four quarters  the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 160 61   On top of that  for 2016  the company s earnings are projected to grow almost 26  year over year Pan American Silver Corp    NASDAQ PAAS   is mainly involved in operations like exploration  development and refining of silver mines  The company reported an average positive earnings surprise of 54 04  over the prior four quarters  For 2016  the company s earnings are projected to grow 163 2  year over year Royal Gold Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   is involved in acquiring and managing precious metals royalties  For fiscal 2017  the company s year over year earnings growth is projected at 78 57   Moreover  over a period

integrated circuits  Over the last four quarters  the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 49 62   For fiscal 2017  the company s year over year earnings growth is projected at 45 2

11707,233222,RGLD,Check Out These 4 Olympian Gold Royalty Companies,opinion,"In a note last week  UBS echoed its earlier assessment that gold has indeed  as I shared with you last month  The precious metal had a spectacular first half of the year  with total global demand reaching 2 335 tonnes  the  according to the World Gold Council  WGC  
Despite this  gold is still under owned  accounting for only 3 percent of total ETF assets under management  UBS writes  The group adds there is room for new or returning market participants who might have cleared out their gold positions during the recent bear market 
Driving the bull run  according to the group  are  a prolonged period of depressed real yields  and  elevated macro uncertainty   These are themes I ve returned to many times in the past six months  with global government bond yields continuing to drop below zero and economic and geopolitical unrest advancing following  and ahead of the U S  presidential election this November 
Confidence in monetary policy and appetite for government debt continues to erode  According to Zero Hedge  foreign central banks dumped a record  335 billion in U S  Treasuries during the last year  
The top seller in June was China  which cleared  28 billion in Treasuries off its balance sheet  Over the same period  the world s second largest economy added to its official gold reserves 500 000 ounces in June alone in an effort to diversify its holdings 

Investors should take heed of the fact that even central banks have become net buyers of gold  It s always been my recommendation to maintain a 10 percent weighting in your portfolio 5 percent in gold bullion  another 5 percent in gold stocks 
A Superior Way to Gain Exposure to Gold One of the best ways to play gold  I believe  is royalty and streaming companies  As a reminder  these companies serve as specialized financiers to explorers and producers  In return for upfront financing  they can receive one of two different types of payments 
In one way  they can receive a royalty  or percentage  on whatever future sales the debtor company makes during the life of the mine 
In another way  they can buy a stream of precious metals at a low  fixed price  Discounts on gold  for instance  could be as much as 75 percent  This has typically been the preferred method for paying back the royalty company 
Some of our favorite names in this space include Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD  and Sandstorm Gold Ltd N  NYSE SAND   all of which have outperformed underlying gold for the 12 month period  Click the hyperlinks to read my special reports on Franco Nevada and Silver Wheaton 
Better Allocators of Capital Royalty and streaming companies show great opportunity on the upside but avoid many of the risks and operating expenses that explorers and producers must deal with 
Interestingly  they all employ a small group of technically skilled mining geologists  engineers  metallurgists and financial mining executives to analyze and monitor their investments 
Because they re not responsible for buying mining machinery and building  operating and maintaining mines  they have a much lower total cash cost per ounce of gold than miners do   In this context  cash cost refers to operational expenses that are paid using cash  rather than credit  
Their overhead is kept at a minimum  and they have some of the highest sales per employee in the world  As you can see below  their debt per share is much lower than senior miners Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold the Army to royalty companies  more agile and tactical Navy SEALs  Last year  Barrick cut  3 1 billion in debt last year and is on track to pay down an additional  2 billion this year 

Their margins have typically been much larger than traditional explorers and producers  allowing them to remain profitable even during gold bear markets 
Take Sandstorm  one of the younger royalty companies  Its second quarter cash cost per ounce of gold was a mere  261  giving it operating margins of  994 per ounce 
Compare this to Barrick  the world s largest gold producer  Barrick reported cash costs of  578 per ounce  nearly double that of Sandstorm and Barrick has some of the lowest costs compared to other miners  according to Motley Fool 
Investors like royalty companies because they re a skilled team of former miners and mining executives who generate substantially greater gross margins and have materially fewer employees  with less general and administrative expense  
Further  they offer spectacular optionality  They often buy an asset with a payload over 10 years  However  these deposits often extend for 30 years  so they have potential for a much bigger payback  If the mining company expands production  it s free additional cash flow  and if they make a large discovery near the producing mine  the royalties have free upside growth 
For further reading  one of the strongest overviews of royalty companies is Streetwise Reports   Precious Metal Royalties  The New Landscape  
A New Entrant Just as there still might be ample scope for gold investors to participate in the market  one CEO is betting there s still room for another entrant into the precious metals royalty company space  Long time precious metals commentator David Morgan recently helped found Lemuria Royalties  which reported in June that it had acquired its first silver royalty from a Peruvian mine operated by a subsidiary of Fortuna Silver Mines 
In January of this year  Morgan summed up his reasoning for establishing a new royalty company   We favor the streaming and royalty companies a great deal because the risk is very low relative to  let s say  an exploration company or even a producing company  
This is precisely why we continue to find the royalty business model very attractive

11708,233223,RGLD,3 Large Miners That Are Still Inexpensive,opinion,"Money manager Adrian Day profiles three large miners in his portfolio that have had success solving problems yet are still inexpensive 
Goldcorp Inc    TO G   NYSE GG  has had a tough year  After reporting a year end loss of  4 1 billion due to writing off and down various projects a supposed clearing of the decks for the new CEO David Garofalo the recent results were not so positive  Production was down year on year  due to shortfalls and problems at its two largest mines  Pe asquito and Cerro Negro 
There are some positives  however   l onore  which had had some early production setbacks  improved performance  And the pipeline remains strong  with numerous studies expected over the next 12 months 
Goldcorp recently acquired Kaminak and its high grade Coffee project  The company is forecasting flat production for the next three years  so the hurdle it has set itself is not so high  and we are likely to see the company focus on its existing projects rather than new acquisitions 
Hold off on new buys   Costs have been cut  including major cuts at the head office  With  360 million in cash  and  2 8 billion in debt  a priority is to de lever  another reason not to expect new acquisitions 
Overall  despite some recent mine problems  Goldcorp has good assets in good countries  It trades at a 4  premium to its peers on an NAV basis  though is inexpensive on other metrics  If it can get all its main operations to run smoothly for a few quarters  we could see Goldcorp recover nicely  Goldcorp is a buy at this level  the best buy among the major miners 
Problem solved  buy ahead  Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  TO RGL  has finally resolved its major problem and erstwhile drag on its stock  Centerra Gold Inc    TO CG   OTC CADGF  has acquired troubled Thompson Creek  including the Mt  Milligan mine  a stream on which represents about 30  of RGLD s reserves  RGLD has agreed to restructure the stream  decreasing the gold and increasing exposure to the copper  the economics are essentially unchanged 
RGLD wants to reduce its reliance on Mt  Milligan  so we may see a major new stream  or royalty   Even if the economics are not overly attractive  the market would respond well  as it has with other companies buying major  long life if low return streams   particularly since it would diversify RGLD s asset base and revenue sources 
Despite the strong recovery a triple this year RGLD is still trading at a 20  discount to its royalty peers  We are holding  and would look for opportunities to buy on price weakness 
Back from the brink 
Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE FCX  continues to make strides towards repairing its balance sheet  by cutting costs  reducing capex for its oil unit  with ongoing equity sales  and asset sales  Most recently it announced agreement to sell its interest in the giant Tenke Fungurume in the DRC for  2 65 billion 
With about  19 billion in debt  the company has a target of  10 billion  After one more equity raise and the completion of pending asset sales  if copper stays where it is  CEO Richard Adkerson says there is no need for more copper sales  Recent losses have been due to special items and carrying costs of its oil   gas assets  operational performance has generally been strong 
If the company sells an interest in its Indonesia operations or its oil   gas unit  this would be  a strategic decision rather than a financial imperative   said CEO Adkerson  The fact that he brought this up suggests  to me  that such moves are under consideration  We think the market would respond well to either of these possibilities 
More major sales ahead 
It was the acquisition of two oil companies that brought Freeport to the situation where it is today  As for Grasberg  it is a fabulous  long life mine  but operating conditions in Indonesia are worsening Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  recently exited the country and is not alone and there is major capex ahead  Freeport has obtained a short term license allowing it to export ore  More importantly  it is currently operating without a long term contract 
Freeport is reluctant to keep making heavy capital expenditures without a contract  though stopping the capital spend would have major ramifications  A long term solution would be to bring in a major partner  Rio   who would assume much of the capital spend saving Freeport s balance sheet while Freeport kept a smaller part of the operation  This won t happen  however  before a new agreement with the country is in place

11710,233225,RGLD,Stock Exchange  How Much Risk Is Right ,opinion,"Technical experts are a rich source of new stock ideas  Our trading models each specialize in a different time frame and level of risk  Before their weekly poker game  they spend a few minutes trading ideas  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange   I am the only human and the only one using fundamental analysis  This week we welcome Athena  whose wisdom helps her to know both when to hold  em and when to fold  em 
The group had a consensus on energy last week  but now has sharp divisions 
This Week s Ideas
Both trading and investing offer many ways to profit  Differing approaches  all sound in themselves  often lead to disparate conclusions  Technical versus fundamental  trader versus investor  short term versus long term   all make a difference  Disciples of each become passionate  The Stock Exchange demonstrates that all might be winners in their own time frame 
Our experts are sharply divided this week  Some favor taking on risk  while our newest member  Athena  advocates a utility stock  Here are this week s top picks 
Felix
While I never boast about my careful and precise method  I hope everyone saw that my  of gold  and especially Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   is off to a great start  I am a long term investor  and it is not too late for others to join me in gold  I see similar potential in mining  the sector I am featuring this week  I like many individual stocks in this group  including one that is owned by some famous activist investor  You can get the long term picture by looking at the SPDR S P Metals   Mining ETF  NYSE XME  

 Jeff  Why do you like basic materials and gold  Do you think that the Fed and Chair Yellen are leading us into another round of hyperinflation 
 Felix  Excuse me  What is the Fed and who is this Yellen person  My investment success does not require me to waste time reading news 
 Jeff  Sorry  I forgot about that 
Oscar
Understanding sports is the key to my pick this week  The best NFL running backs are the ones who can wear down a defensive line  Carry after carry  they bust their way for short gains until they work up the momentum for a big run  In Biotech  NASDAQ IBB   I see a sector lined up in the backfield ready to break the plane for a touchdown  Check this chart of the past year 

Occasionally stalled  but with explosive potential   biotech looks like a player ready to hop off the bench and play the second half  You can see similar potential in individual Biotech stocks  like Ultragenyx  NASDAQ RARE  

All I can say  If I had to stake my fantasy team on that moving average trending back up  it would be a no brainer 
 Felix  Too aggressive and too speculative 
 Jeff  Biotech stocks require a different perspective  A projected earnings multiple is not helpful  since many are  story stocks   We may not know which will come through  but the sector will be the source of the most important drug developments  Long term investors can put a little away  but they should not expect regular gains on their quarterly statements  I think we will see a nice gain after the election 
Holmes 
CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  has a very good chart  I reject all but 2  of the stocks in the universe I follow  I require plenty of data before reaching a conclusion  CVS rallied for four straight years barely touching it s 200 day MA reaching an all time high 113  It has been backing and filling for last year  I see a possible double bottom  This is a nice risk reward scenario with a tight stop just below 89  These are the kind of setups one sees from careful sleuthing 

 Jeff  Double bottoms seem to be in the eye of the beholder  The stock has pulled back and it is now almost down to fair value  I agree that It is worth watching 
Athena
Some things are so obvious  You guys should pay attention to what is working  We have a nice stock with an uptrend and strong recent price action in Southern Company  NYSE SO   I know a good chart when I see one 

 Jeff  If you absolutely must own a utility  this is not a bad choice  I do not like companies with a multiple of over 18 and an earnings growth rate below 3  
 Athena  Who cares  Pay attention to what is working  If the market ever starts to reflect your thinking  I will sell and move on 
Questions
Last week s comments were all about current picks  Feel free to range more widely  If you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector  even those we did not mention  just ask  Put questions in the comments and address them to a specific expert if you wish  Each has a special expertise  Who is your favorite 
Cast of Characters
Felix is fussy  precise  and very cautious  He looks for what is working  but it also must have upside potential  He is an investor who thinks long term  Felix will not usually announce new picks  but he will answer questions  saying what he thinks about specific stocks 
Oscar is naturally optimistic and a bit excitable  He definitely likes to go with winners  and focuses on a one month time frame  He trades either sector ETFs  or a basket of stocks  equally weighted  that reflect a sector  Oscar will mention a favorite sector each week  and will also answer questions about sectors 
Holmes is a trader  but a cautious one  Holmes emphasizes asset protection through profit taking  stops  and trailing stops  He is careful in selecting new positions  and generally looks at an intermediate time frame  There is no set holding period  but two or three months is not unusual  Holmes will tell us one stock recommended that week  For those who sign up for his email list  no charge  privacy respected  holmes at newarc dot com  he will report exits with a one day delay 
Athena trades more frequently than the others  but still limits risk  Her inspiration helps to find good ideas  Her excellent quant skills find attractive risk reward opportunities  Her wisdom leads her to exit trades that are not working  Athena will provide a new idea each week 
Jeff usually has some comments about stock or market fundamentals  Unlike the other witty participants  he sounds like an old prof 
An Important Note to Readers  All of the characters  except me   are models  carefully engineered and tested by one of the leading developers of the last thirty years  They are highly modified momentum models  with different time frames and features 
I humanize them because it makes it easier to understand the characteristics in their design  I always remind readers that my posts are informational  not investment advice  but that is especially true here   While we are trading based upon all three models  we are always watching and can act quickly when necessary  The models are not suitable for all investors  If you like the approach  reach out to us and I will see if you qualify for one of the programs

11711,233226,RGLD,The Case For Natural Resource Equities,opinion,"Last week I attended the Denver Gold Forum along with three other U S  Global Investors representatives  including our resident precious metals expert Ralph Aldis  I was happy to see sentiment for gold way up compared to last year s convention  as was turnout  I was also pleased to see Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW  and Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD  in attendance  all of which I ve written extensively about 
One of the most interesting presentations was held by Northern Star Resources  AX NST  the third biggest listed gold producer in Australia  a dividend payer and a longtime holding of ours  I ve always appreciated Northern Star s insistence on being a business first  a mining company second  This shareholder friendly mantra is reflected in its stellar performance 
Compared to other companies in the NYSE ARCA Gold Miners Index  GDM   Northern Star is a sector leader in a number of factors  including five year cash flow return on invested capital  Whereas the sector average is negative 1 6 percent over this period  Northern Star s is a whopping 27 percent  the most of any other mining company in the GDM 
This has helped it return an amazing 800 percent over the last five years as of September 23  Compare that to the GDM Index  which returned negative 56 percent over the same period 
Australian gold miners as a whole trade at an impressive discount to North American producers  5 7 times earnings versus 8 3 times earnings  according to Perth based Doray Minerals 
Screening for high cash flow returns on invested capital  as you can see  helps give us a competitive advantage and uncovers hidden gems such as Northern Star and others 
Resource Equities Offer Attractive Diversification Benefits
A recent whitepaper published by investment strategist firm GMO makes a very convincing case for natural resource equities  I urge you to check out the  when you have the time  but there are a few salient points I want to share with here 
In the opinion of Lucas White and Jeremy Grantham  the paper s authors   prices of many commodities will rise in the decades to come due to growing demand and the finite supply of cheap resources   presenting an attractive investment opportunity  Over the long term  resource stocks have traded at a discount and outperformed their underlining metals and energy by a wide margin 
According to White and Grantham  a portfolio composed of 50 percent energy and metals  50 percent all other equities  had a standard deviation that s 35 percent lower than the S P 500 Index  What s more  the returns of such a portfolio outperformed those of the S P 500  resulting in a risk adjusted return that s 50 percent higher than that of the broader market 
Resource equities have also historically shown a low to negative correlation to the broader market  which might appeal to bears  The reason  When metals and energy have risen in price  it s been a drag on the economy  The reverse has also been true  Low prices have been a boon to the economy 
The thing is  general equities currently do not give investors enough exposure to natural resources  The weight of energy and metals in the S P 500 has been halved in the last few years as oil and other materials have declined  Considering the diversification benefits  investors should consider a greater allocation to the sector 
Timing Is Key
There s mounting evidence that now might be an opportune time to get back into resource stocks  Following the sharpest decline in crude oil prices in at least a century  as well as a six year bear market in metals  the global environment could be ripe for a commodity rebound  From its January trough  the Bloomberg Commodity Index has rallied 17 percent  suggesting commodities might be seeking a path to a bull market 
During the down cycle  many companies managed to bring costs lower  upgrade their asset portfolios and repair their balance sheets  As a result  many of them are now free cash flow positive and are in a much better position to deliver on the bottom line when commodity prices increase 
I ve often written about the imbalance between monetary and fiscal policies  My expectation is that unprecedented  expansionary global monetary policy will be followed by fiscal expansion  Consider this  Total assets of major central banks including those in the U S   European Union  Japan and China have skyrocketed to  17 6 trillion dollars as of August 2016  up from  6 3 trillion in 2008 
This expansion is expected to result in significant inflation gains over the next decade  an environment in which natural resource stocks have historically outperformed the broader market 
Infrastructure Spending About to Increase 
China largely drove the global infrastructure build out over the past decade as rapid economic growth and rising incomes increased the demand for  advanced  and  quality of life  infrastructure  This resulted in a breathtaking commodities bull market 
Now  other advanced countries  the U S  especially  are readying to sustain the next cycle to repair aging and uncompetitive infrastructure 
As you can see  most major economies dramatically cut infrastructure spending after the financial crisis  indicating it might be time to put some of that  17 6 trillion to good use 

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  CBPP   the U S  is presently facing a  of  1 7 trillion on roads  bridges and transit alone to say nothing of electricity  schools  airports and other needs  Meanwhile  state and local infrastructure spending is at a 30 year low 
If this financing can t be raised  says the American Society of Civil Engineers  ASCE   each American household could lose an estimated   Inefficient roadways and congested airports lead to longer travel times  and goods become more expensive to produce and transport 
Let s look just at national bridges  After an assessment of bridges last year  the American Road   Transportation Builders Association  ARTBA  found that 58 495  or 10 percent of all bridges in the U S   are  To bring all bridges up to satisfactory levels  the U S  would currently  more than  106 billion  which is six times what was spent nationwide on such projects in 2010 
Fortunately  both U S  presidential candidates have pledged to boost infrastructure spending one of the few things they share with one another  Hillary Clinton says she will spend  275 billion over a five year period  while Donald Trump says he ll spend  double  that 
Trump s central campaign promise  as you know  is to build a  big  beautiful  powerful wall  along the U S  Mexico border  which analysts at investment firm Bernstein estimate could cost anywhere between   requiring 7 million cubic meters of concrete and 2 4 million tonnes of cement  among other materials 
As I like to say  government policy is a precursor to change  I ll be listening closely for further details on Trump and Clinton s infrastructure plans as the election nears 
Don t Count China Out
In the past year  a lot of ink has been devoted to China s slowdown after its phenomenal spending boom over the last decade  but there are signs that spending is perking up a tailwind for resources  According to the Wall Street Journal  Chinese economic activity rebounded in August  driven by  and rising property taxes 
 In the first seven months of 2016   the WSJ writes   China invested 962 8 billion yuan   144 1 billion  in roads and waterways  an 8 2 percent increase from the previous year  
The Asian giant still accounts for a large percentage of global trade in important resources such as iron ore  aluminum  copper and coal  This is why we closely monitor the country s purchasing manager s index  PMI   which  according to our own research  has been a reliable indicator of commodity price performance three and six months out

11712,233227,RGLD,Royal Gold  RGLD  Shares March Higher  Can It Continue ,opinion,Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   has been on the move lately as the stock has risen by 20 7  in the past four weeks  and it is currently trading well above its 20 Day SMA  This is a pretty solid move higher  but the question that has to be on investors  minds right now is  can this trend continue While there can be no telling for sure  it is certainly encouraging that earnings estimates have risen in the past few weeks on the company  suggesting that sentiment on RGLD is moving in the right direction  In fact  the stock currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   suggesting that the recent run could certainly continue for this in focus company ,2016-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/royal-gold-(rgld)-shares-march-higher,-can-it-continue-200142792",200142792
11722,233237,RGLD,ABX Vs  NEM  Which Gold Mining Stock Is Best Right Now  ,opinion,"After a sluggish 2015  gold has regained a lot of momentum this year due to several key factors that have caused uncertainty in the global markets  The yellow metal has surged roughly 25  in 2016  and as a result  gold mining stocks are also surging 
Recently  gold has been the biggest beneficiary of the Federal Reserve s decision to keep interest rates steady throughout June  as well as the United Kingdom s decision to withdraw from the European Union  As the price of gold hit a two year high last week  gold miners also made big gains and investors are starting to look at these stocks as solid options in today s market 
With that said  smart investors should take their time and do their due diligence before investing in the gold mining industry  Not every miner is the same and it s important to look at all the key metrics to determine which stock is your best bet right now 
 Also Read   
It s also important to remember that gold miners come in all shapes and sizes  While mid cap companies like B2Gold   NYSE BTG    Royal Gold   NASDAQ RGLD    and Yamana Gold   NYSE AUY   each hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the bigger giants of the industry continue to see high trading volumes and interest from investors 
Out of these giants  Barrick Gold   NYSE ABX   and Newmont Mining   NYSE NEM    two of the largest gold mining companies in the world  continue to be among the most recognizable names in the sector  With all eyes on gold right now  it s time to put these two stocks head to head 
The Matchup 
 It s a pretty close contest between these two massive gold mining companies  Take a look at this chart for a quick glimpse at some of the most important metrics 
   
As you can see  both of these stocks have had a solid amount of momentum this year  but their futures remain a bit uncertain  Both companies hold a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   meaning that their earnings outlook isn t entirely favorable 
With that said  Barrick Gold seems to have the edge  especially with its earnings data  Barrick has seen positive earnings estimate revision activity lately  while Newmont has seen one negative revision  Also  with a positive Earnings ESP of 14 29   Barrick appears to be in the better position to post an earnings beat in its next report  whereas Newmont s negative Earnings ESP makes a positive surprise less likely 
Barrick has also proven to be a bit more consistent over the past year  beating our earnings expectations in each of the trailing four quarters by an average of 26 91   For Newmont  that figure is just 3 88  and includes one earnings miss of 71 43  
Bottom Line
Barrick edges out Newmont because it has proven to be slightly more consistent and its estimate revision activity implies that analysts feel at least a little more bullish on the company right now  Either way  both stocks have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and fall behind several better ranked stocks in a loaded industry right now 
On top of the stocks mentioned earlier  Sandstorm Gold   NYSE SAND    Franco Nevada Corp    TO FNV    Golden Start   NYSE GSS    and New Gold   TO NGD   also rank better than both Barrick and Newmont 
Finally  it is important to remember that on a day to day basis  gold mining stocks will trade with a heavy dependence on the price of gold  The markets seem to have recovered from the Brexit already  but if the Fed remains dovish throughout the year  gold could continue to climb ",2016-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abx-vs.-nem:-which-gold-mining-stock-is-best-right-now-200141167,200141167
11741,233256,RGLD,Countdown On Barrick Decision With NuLegacy Gold ,opinion,"Gold is testing July support and multi year lows  however  there are unique junior gold mining equities which continue to stand out 
NuLegacy Gold  TO NUG V or OTC NULGF  has been hitting some impressive high grade gold on the Cortez Trend in Nevada this past year  Nevada is one of the most profitable and lowest cost jurisdictions especially Barrick s  N ABX  mines on the Cortez Trend  which I was blessed to visit last year 

With the depressed price of gold  there are very few economic places to mine gold like Nevada  The Cortez Trend is where Barrick produces its most profitable gold and its also where they are making their biggest discovery at Goldrush  which is adjacent to NuLegacy s Iceberg Deposit  In addition to massive discovery at Goldrush  one of their little JV partners NuLegacy Gold is finding high grade gold right next to Goldrush  This could be Barrick s next big gold discovery 
It is my belief Barrick needs to immediately sell off non core assets in outside riskier jurisdictions and build new high grade and low cost discoveries focused on Nevada  NuLegacy could be Barrick s next takeout target 
NuLegacy has discovered a potential Carlin Type deposit with a NI 43 101 compliant exploration target of 90 110 million tonnes of 0 9 to 1 0  grams of gold per tonne and completed its 70  earn in with Barrick  who has three major gold deposits on trend with Goldrush adjacent to this discovery 

NuLegacy management led former National Gold to a buy out for a premium by Alamos Gold  N AGI   I believe executives Albert Matter and James Anderson can capitalize on this deal now with NuLegacy and either joint venture or merge with a major producer as they are experience negotiators  I would like to see Barrick do it but it could be a whole bunch of other companies such as Agnico  Yamana  N AUY   Alamos or Eldorado  N EGO  
The window for Barrick to elect to earn back in is closing and we should hear a decision in the coming weeks  If they elect to earn in  they will have to spend  15 million USD on the property over the next 5 years to earn 70  or they can elect to remain a minority 30  partner  Both options are win win for NuLegacy  as they can either sell the 30  to a royalty company such as Royal Gold  O RGLD   Franco Nevada  N FNV  or Sandstorm  N SAND  or sell the 70  to a larger intermediate producer such as Yamana  Agnico  N AEM  or Alamos who want to establish a presence in the Cortez Trend 
I believe NuLegacy Gold  NUG V  could see a major transaction over the coming weeks  which could provide shareholders with potential gains

11744,233259,RGLD,Gold 1400 In 2015  We Do The Math,opinion,"We ll save the mathematical rationale of gold reaching 1400 in 2015 until this article s d nouement  as there first are more timely items to consider  Quel drame  Just stay with us 
I am blessed to have a bevy of just slightly more seasoned gold aficionado confidants who  on occasion in their sincere  older brother  manner  remind me that the more one ages  the faster time passes  To be sure  the modernized world has immersed us into so extreme a geometrically growing rate of technological bilge   one by product being cultural decay   that nary do we have a non electronic moment to ourselves anymore  such lack of self reflection only furthering the apparent unrelenting acceleration of time   I recall mentioning to a friend the importance of living one day at a time  yet upon one s crossing the threshold of age 60  such focus shifts to one hour at a time   But be it by aging or high tech engaging   tis what  tis  and with the scent of last Christmas  tree seemingly still lingering in the parlour  the first five trading months of 2015 are amazingly already in the books  Thus as we cross into June  here are the BEGOS Market standings through May 

Big Oil s big lead   12 1   is twice that of second place Sister Silver   6 5      yet surely she must be too high given that King Gold is but a mere  0 6     which in turn also seems too high given that the euro is  9 2    the dollar index being  7 0      but then again gold ought not be down given the Swiss franc s being  5 7    such being the blame for Switzerland s economy have shrunk in Q1 by the most in six years   The point is  traditional correlations within the BEGOS Markets have given way to a rather  subdued chaotic  caution  You and I see it  those complacently splashing about in the motherly womb of the stock market s serenity don t see it  nor do they care 
Meanwhile  what are they seeing over at the Federal Reserve Bank  Our own San Francisco Fed Head John Williams said this past Tuesday that a U S  interest rate increase is likely before year s end  given expectations for economic growth above trend  Then chiming in on Thursday  the St  Louis Fed s James Bullard queried as to why the bank s policy isn t getting back to normal if the economy is so doing  furthering the need to  hedge our bets against any kind of asset price bubble forming   As if they ve not already formed  Perhaps James ought fly out to the Left Coast and go house hunting with Fed colleague John here in San Francisco  To quote Trulia   The median sales price for homes in San Francisco CA for Feb 15 to May 15 was  1 107 500   Talk about a bubble  And now we learned yesterday  Friday  that Q1 Gross Domestic Product growth was just reversed to  0 7  
 And the Fed Head herself has mentioned the stock market bubble  mmb    
Oh heaven forbid they spoil that party  Squire  Besides as shown above  the S P 500 is only  2 7  so far this year   albeit  tis tripled over the last six   Yet today s market mood is reminiscent of that back in 2000 when a FinMedia piece noted there were people who didn t realize that prices could actually go down as well as up  The Chinese  of course  know better  this past Thursday alone  the Shanghai market fell better than 6   Has that ever happened StateSide since the turn of the millennium  given the institution of price limits   and as some would add  the institution of the Plunge Protection Team  aka  PPT    Not really  Oh  there were seven such days during the Black Swan Event of 2008  but that shan t recur  No  Even if those series of plunges did put price earnings ratios back into proper range  In fact  there s been but one other  6  S P day since 2000   twas on 08 August 2011   within one month of gold s then reaching its All Time High on 06 September 2011 of 1923   but it doesn t really count as stocks then fully recouped that loss within a mere week  And thus at then end of the day  life is financially good in here  Murka   by short memory   tis always so been  And yet here s the Economic Barometer 

Specific to gold s year so far  its  Flight at 1200  is essentially intact  as is our  Sense that the Selling has Stopped    putting at risk our little  friend s  job as we ll later see in this missive s final graphic and plausible posit of 1400 this year   Gold settled out the week yesterday at 1190 in marking the 102nd trading day of the year  better than one half of which  55  have been daily settles within the 30 point range of 1180 to 1210  Here are gold s year over year weekly bars  their linear regression trend  dashed line  in decline  but the current parabolic trend  rising blue dots  in LongSide ascent despite the rightmost two weeks of price pullback 

Again  it being month s end   tis time we also go year over year with gold and several of its more popular brethren   recall we ve revised the grouping to make it more relevant to the gold equities crowd out there   And as you can see below  gold itself is bisecting the bunch  with Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  biased to the upside  whilst the Gold Bugs Index   HUI   and Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  not as midas to the downside 

Now  let s zoom in on the last three months with the daily bars for both gold  on the left  and silver  on the right   We d pointed out last week that silver s  Baby Blues     the dots that define each bar s 21 day linear regression consistency stance    had already begun rolling over  so have they now as well for gold  although yesterday s price resiliency   thank you poor Q1 GDP   may have just stemmed such weakness  Cease the pullback here and the 1200s are near 

And in discerning the trading track for  near   here we ve both metals  respective 10 day Market Profiles  For gold  left   clearly  tis the 1189 area we wish to see hold  more contract volume having traded at that price that at any other level in the past two trading weeks  Similarly  the same can be said for silver  right   her price platform of popularity being the current 16 70 level  Hold both markets here and by their current  expected daily trading ranges   14 points for gold and 0 40 for silver   the 1200s and 17s ought come back into play respectively 

Finally to our closing graphic  the updated stance of gold s broad based structure  now noting the concern of our aforementioned  friend   For the some two years now  recovery highs have been lowering  but more recent bottoms instead have been holding  Fairly classic consolidation continues  Moreover  with respect to gold 1400 this year  here s a number you ve likely not heard  using the same formulae to produce our  expected daily trading range  for gold  when applying it to years  the  expected yearly trading range  for 2015 is 274 points  Thus  if the year s current low of 1142 holds through these seven remaining months  the  expected  high for the year within this calculative vacuum is 1142   274   1416   You read it here foist  

We ll wrap it here with these three quick reflections 
1  International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde was initially misquoted this past week in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to which she d purported said that Greece s exiting the  uro is a  potential   The newspaper has since printed a correction  Nonetheless  one has to think that  based on payments to the IMF being due on a monthly schedule  going through such Grecian Grief month after month has to be unsustainable  in turn leading to Gold Relief 
2  Our beloved France has thus far been through a terrible year such as to hold us back from the occasional friendly pokes  Still  we took notice this past week of the French utility giant EDF  PARIS EDF  s looking to reduce its employees  annual vacation allotment of 10 weeks  inducing the workers to consider knocking time off back to seven weeks by a one time payout of some  14 000  To the extent that this shall violate the mandatory 35 hour work week limit  we re not sure  nor do we have the time to ferret it all out given that so many of us here StateSide surely put in 35 hours of work every 24 hours  Just pay us in gold 
3  And thank goodness there s the just completed study by Cambridge University and Rand Europe to figure this out  lack of sleep lowers productivity  Who knew   And whose money paid for the brilliant and in depth efforts in coming to this conclusion   The good news in the study s results was that neither drinking alcohol nor smoking seems to make any difference in productivity  We ll drink to that   Barman  A pint of your best golden brew  please  ",2015-05-31,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-1400-in-2015-we-do-the-math-253479,253479
11745,233260,RGLD,Gold  Our Mid Year Downdate,opinion,"Are we having fun yet  There is quite a bit of fun here StateSide today as we celebrate our having completed 239 years of Independence   to the chagrin of those amongst our nation s riffraff who try to wrest it away from us   However for Gold  rather than having had fun   tis been an ever so excruciating run  or lack thereof  thus far in 2015  let alone over the last few years 
Given all that we ve herein detailed week in and week out  whether  tis been on currency debasings  catastrophic debt loads  countries  dilemmas both fiscally and politically  if not geo politically    just to name a few of the positives out there for Gold    the Precious Metals  inability of late to materially go anywhere  let alone aggressively higher  borders on being bizarre  indeed unscriptably so   Tis beyond baffling  to wit our analogizing a week ago that Gold is covered beneath a nailed to the ground tarpaulin  Price has become sufficiently compressed such that  tis if some giant entity has wrapped its mammoth arms around the entirety of the Gold trade and is saying  Nope  you can t touch it  so get outta here and go play  Pretend Wealth  with your worthless paper   In a world evermore whacked  Gold these days ought be well jacked  rather than covertly cracked 
And cracked this past week was Gold s parabolic Long trend  Here at mid year with 26 trading weeks in the books   this from the  You Gotta Be Kiddin  Me Dept     Gold has been in a weekly parabolic Long trend for 13 of them  and as well in a weekly parabolic Short trend for the other 13 of them  but hardly does it  feel  equally so  non  Further  because the chart of Gold s weekly bars spans a full 52 weeks  one year     and as we now see with a fresh new rightmost red dot heralding the beginning of another parabolic Short trend    clearly the periodicity of the red dots across the chart is greater than that of the blue dots  And through it all  the tilt of the dashed line  linear regression trend  is down 

That stated  should the number of red dots in this fresh parabolic Short trend turn out to total less than the number of blue dots  seven  in the now ended Long trend   twould be the first such occurrence since the nine week Long run during 2011 from 10 July through 16 September  during which span Gold rose as much as 379 points   24 5   in reaching its All Time High of 1923 on 06 September of that year  The stats in the above graphic show the new level to flip Gold s weekly parabolic trend back to Long is 1232  a number which will decline by the week until  tis eclipsed by price  We re that to occur at say  1200  and Gold then embark on a parabolic Long trend to exceed the number of weeks of the current Short trend for the first time since 2011    and do so in similar percentage gain style    we d have price nearing the 1500s  Perhaps just a little Fourth of July fireworks folderol there  but by our reasoning  an inevitable pricing area to be had en route to the indubitable 2000  A lot to take in  all that  but  tis better to be forward looking than dwell upon that which has passed 
Now with respect to this year s balance for 13 weeks of both Long and Short parabolic readings  as noted they don t  feel  equally so  for Gold indeed is marginally lower   1 3   year to date as we next see here in the 2015 BEGOS Markets Standings   

   and yet the two leading markets are the Swiss franc and the Bond  into which dough naturally flows during times of monetary and economic disruption   Flash  Gold used to similarly benefit   And you can stuff the so called  Dollar Strength  defense  the Dollar Index  96 290  just completed its 16th week  since that beginning 16 March  of its own parabolic Short trend following the level having peaked at 100 785 on 13 March  Our bet is that you ve not seen that parabolically put from the FinMedia 

 But that s nuts  mmb  I mean that gold isn t moving up with the dollar going down    
Ah  Squire   tis just a subtle reminder that Gold plays no currency favourites  And with Greece in the balance these next few days  should the  uro go  uh oh   Gold could well  indeed ought well  get the bid  should break out all hell 
 But mmb  then they ll say that rising interest rates will mean that gold won t go up    
Squire  forget not the three year stint from 2004 2006 when the Fed Funds Rate rose from 1  to 5  whilst Gold rose right alongside from 402 to 638   59    Listen not to that which they say  rather watch that which actually unfolds  We attest  you digest 
That said  now at the mid year frontier  let s next look back a full year at Gold s daily closes vis   vis its smooth pearly valuation line which regresses the yellow metal s price movement to those of the primary BEGOS Markets  Bond   Euro   Gold   Oil   S P   And as you can below see  the price compression has become so inhibitive since April   the mild downside bias notwithstanding   that Gold has lost any and all of its accustomed alacrity  notably in the oscillator  price less value  at the foot of the graphic  Gold is all but flat lining 

Moreover for the Gold Bull  one might say we ve depression borne of compression as the  expected daily trading range   EDTR  chart we ve been presenting in recent missives has its daily magnitude of movement down to a wee 12 6 points 

Further expression of price compression is below evidenced in the two panel chart  where on the left we ve Gold s daily bars for the last three months along with the baby blue dots that depict the consistency of the 21 day linear regression trend  Note how the  Baby Blues  have themselves flat lined right on their 0  horizontal axis  Trendless  And on the right we ve Gold s 10 day Market Profile showing only tepid support at 1164  the overhead trading resistors being 1173  1177  1183 and 1200 

One more concession to price compression  given  tis month s end  is in our year over year view of the percentage tracks of Gold versus several of its equities brethren  namely the Gold Bugs Index   HUI    Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM    LAGOS NEM    Goldcorp   BA GG   and Royal Gold   NASDAQ RGLD    And as you can see  Gold appears all but flat in comparison to the elasticity of the equities 

Now to the ongoing  indeed seemingly endless  ugly bit  Gold s pricing structure per our definitions since the All Time High  the fourth anniversary of which is merely two months away  Four years of angst without warrant for thanks 

We ll wrap up our mid year edition here on this celebratory day with a peek at the Economic Barometer  especially given the dose of data it received late in this holiday shortened week  The rightmost dip you see was produced by the decline in June s Non Farm Payrolls from the May period  which of its own accord was revised lower  and the overall consensus for June having been missed  The same occurred for May s Factory Orders  they were lower than those for April  which in turn also were revised lower  and again the May consensus was missed  A small dip in toto perhaps  but on one of the Federal Reserve Bank s most watched data metric  jobs ",2015-07-05,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold---our-mid-year-downdate-257213,257213
11746,233261,RGLD,Gold Is Just A Metal,opinion,"Good gracious how perceptions have changed as churned by the tide of our culture s continuing devolution  The following is straight from the  Just When You Thought You d Heard It All Dept  
This past week  upon my sauntering through the club bar to pour a caf  ahead of doing some honest work  a spritely young professional with whom I am acquainted queried   How s gold   I replied   Well   tis been struggling a bit  but considering  twill trade in excess of  2 000   tis a heckova buy down here at  1 100   The response   Really   My cheerfully confident answer   Absolutely   Then came the pregnant question   But isn t gold just a metal  
Prone to being excessively wordy at times  rarely am I known to be speechless  But that one stunned me  Is this to where we ve come  Gold is  just a metal   With all respect due the person  that question is quintessentially exemplary of the socially dumbed down assumptions about gold that have seemingly pervaded even the highest levels of fiduciary responsibility  making them quite honestly appear  stuck on stoopid   To be sure  money managers must be on the right side of trends  Gold s having clearly been down since 2011  whilst the S P 500 has better than tripled since 2009  But were I running clients  portfolios stuffed chock full of stocks  given our  live  calculation of the S P 500 s price earnings ratio is now at 35 2x  I doubt I could face the mirror in the morning  let alone the day   and when it all goes wrong  hardly the clientele   But counter the low S P earnings with the seven fold increase in Fed Faux Dough since the early 1980s  and rationally  gold right now ought have its price swapped with the level of the S P  1095 2104  Fortunately  or otherwise   from the  For The Sake Of Sanity Dept    reversion to the mean shall supervene  And then  luv   twill be all about the overshoot 
Meanwhile back at the bar  as the whiff of vapours from the caf  restored my senses  I smiled and put forth to my acquaintance   Gold is money  as it has been for 5 000 years   and excused myself toward moving on with all due dispatch 
Hardly being further dispatched downward this past week was gold  which on a points basis put in its third narrowest trading range since late August of last year  the rightmost of the weekly bars below quite stubby given the week s FedSpeak  or rather NonSpeak   an unsurprising GDP reading for Q2  all within a bit of summer malaise  Still  stretching to put a positive bow on the week   twas just the third of the last ten to sport a higher low 

  Stretch  is an understatement  mmb    
Sadly  Squire  what s really been stretched are the year over year percentage tracks notably of the ARCA Gold BUGS and Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   And thus it being month end  here are said tracks along with those for Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD  and gold itself  the latter clearly off the least of the bunch at  15  

Indeed  a  15  year over year run for gold is one thing  a  15  month over month run for the Shanghai Composite Index is quite another  And the International Monetary Fund has a reserve currency bid from China to formally    as of this autumn    include the yuan 
From Yuan to Yawn as we next turn to the Economic Barometer  with which the hesitancy from the FOMC would seem to agree   

   to later whirl right back  round to QE  Those who are prudent say that s what we ll see  in turn righting gold on an upside spree  But given our gold structure s  pot pourri   its aroma at large remains fairly  stenchie  

All right   tis enough negativity as regards gold for this week s missive   let alone that for a lifetime   Now let s move on to something that portends some positivity for the precious metals  Below in the two panel chart for gold  we ve on the left the last three months of daily bars  look at the recent price consolidation therein  essentially spanning the last two weeks  note  too  that the  Baby Blues  are just now barely beginning to bend up  meaning that the consistency of the 21 day linear regression downtrend is beginning to wane  Then on the right in the Market Profile  with gold s settling Friday at 1095  white bar    twas also at the most commonly traded price of the last two weeks  Oh we ve had time and again ad nausea suggestions that  the selling has stopped  and the final one ought be the best buying opportunity for gold in the lives of many a doubting soul out there   would be that this is it   

And here next is the same data set for Sister Silver  And looky there  her  Baby Blues   left  are even more clearly curling higher  plus she settled yesterday to the nearest 10  at 14 80  which is above the mid point of her Market Profile  right  

In sum  the precious metals per these last two graphics are in at least a near term technical setup to regain some modicum of ground  And given there are 17 data inputs in the new week hitting the aforeshown Econ Baro  weakness therein may provide some catalytic  umph   Goodness knows gold needs it 
We ll wrap it with this  on 01 August it was Swiss National Day   and descending upon us here at the Residence were five  family  members just in from the Swiss Canton of Bern  via Las Vegas  their thus likely becoming frozen stiff given our icy summertime San Francisco fog   But our festivities do come with a bit of a damper  given the Bern based Schweizerische Nationalbank having just reported a significant CHF 50 billion first half loss for 2015  largely stemming from removing their Swiss franc s soft peg to the euro  That said  the SNB s ace up its sleeve is its gold reserves  Of the world s 251 nations  Switzerland by area may only rank 135th  but by the World Gold Council s July 2015 rankings  the wee alpine nation s central bank ranks 8th globally in gold holdings  1 040 tonnes   A gold recovery to 2000  comprehensively would mitigate that loss  Don t go tellin  the SNB that  gold is just a metal  ",2015-08-03,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-is-just-a-metal-260242,260242
11747,233262,RGLD,If It s Time To Buy Japanese Stocks  Why Not The Yen ,opinion,"Some trades are obviously simple on the surface  if we think the S P 500 is going up  we buy the S P 500  Yes  there are questions to be answered  how much  How do we know we are wrong  Where are we getting out if we re right  These are important questions  but the essence of the trade is simple buy the thing we think is going up  Sometimes  though  even the question of what to buy  or sell  what is the appropriate instrument for the trade can be complicated 
A client and friend of mine sent me a note yesterday morning asking about a trade I put on in Japanese stocks  I suggested buying the Nikkei 225 futures  which are not the most liquid market in the world  sometimes  on a breakout  and that US based investors might want to consider ETF alternatives  His question was  well  rather than paraphrasing  here s his question 

the chart  of the Nikkei average  looks a lot like the USDJPY chart  i e  strength in Japan seems to be caused by weakness in JPY  Wouldn t it be less complex to simply use USDJPY  Conceptually the same question arises for set ups in mining  via Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   or oil stocks etc 

Now  I have to basically agree with everything he says there  with the exception of one nitpicking  but critical point   The chart of the Nikkei  below  does  in fact  look a lot like the USDJPY  Here  though  is my point of contention  it s not quite right to think that strength in Japan is  caused by  weakness in the yen 
One of the best pieces of advice is to be very careful of the phrase  caused by  whenever you are thinking about markets  Do not assume causative links  and check any assumptions carefully  A lot of money has been lost by traders  and made by writers  who oversimplify and assume causative connections that might not be real 

A good setup for a long trade on the weekly chart via Dow Jones Total Market Japan Index in USD
This is not just an academic point  it goes straight to the heart of what we re trying to do with this trade  I want long exposure to the global equity market that appears to be best set to break out  I want to buy the relative strength leader  ideally before everyone else sees that it s the leader  That s what I m trying to accomplish with this trade  and the most direct way is simply to buy that index  Simple really is better 
People tend to over complicate  particularly in portfolio management  and this can result in complicated trades that don t do what we expect  For instance  the trader thinking he is  getting gold  by buying something like the Market Vectors Gold Miners Fund  ARCA GDX  is getting a mix of gold and stock exposure  he might be disappointed to see GDX go down if gold goes up but stocks go down  These types of complicated trades also carry risks we don t understand 
I ll write more on this topic of  factor exposure  in portfolio construction and long term investing  but let me leave you with one last thought about the Japan trade  When we compare global stock indexes  we need to do so with them priced in a common base currency  Because I m in the US  I look at all stock indexes priced in USD   Otherwise  we re looking at a combination of currency and stock factors every time we look at a market   When we execute the trade  we can make a choice to accept the currency risk or hedge it  but we must be aware of the issues and risks involved 
This trade provides a good example of the idea of simplicity and the dangers of over complicating  No one would deny that currencies have an impact on stock prices  though we could debate about what  exactly  that impact is   but this is a simple trade  We want long exposure to Japanese stocks with an appropriate risk point  In most cases  we are better off if we don t get sidetracked by charts that look similar or other potential influences simply execute the trade in the simplest  most direct way possible ",2015-08-11,Adam Grimes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/time-to-buy-japanese-stocks-why-not-the-yen-261178,261178
11748,233263,RGLD,Gold Gettin  Rocked  N Rolled,opinion,"Gold lost 2  points for the week  Boring  Hardly  And thereto  we give a most deserved tip of the cap to Captain Endicott  who a week ago advised us to return to our seats and buckle up as turbulence aboard Gold s flight was imminent  He was right  Gold went rockin   n  rollin   n gettin  bounced about but good  racking up its widest weekly trading range  46 points  since that ending 06 March  60 points    Twas also one of Gold s wildest recent weekly rides  for with reference to that prior wherein  nobody really had a clue as to what to do   the past one had  em slave to abruptly changing altitudes in incidents of bolting higher on Tuesday by ten points in five minutes  getting slammed down on Wednesday by seven points in one minute  and on balance threatening the supply of those little white bags in the seat pockets  Here is Gold s flight across the entirety of this past week via 15 minute bars 

How s that meclizine workin  out for ya  And following all the being jostled  n jarred up  n down   tis incredulous that Gold not only is almost exactly where  twas at this time a week ago  but as we go to our updated standings of the BEGOS Markets year to date  the yellow metal is off just a mere    with the first trimester  plus a day  in the books 

And as regards the  Dollar strength  FinMedia crowd out there  we don t hear a wit from them about  Franc strength   the Helvetian currency  now detached from the  uro  in second place only to oil  and stronger year to date   6 7   than is the Dollar Index   5 3     Another slice of emmental please  and this time slap some of that Gold mustard on it  won t you  Merci vielmal  
Indeed cheese  let alone translating Schwizerd tsch  may not be that appealing if one is still queasy from the week s journey  but as we next turn to Gold s weekly bars  oh how close came price to fully eclipsing the red dots  Gold on Tuesday was within two points of flipping the parabolic trend from Short to Long  Admittedly   tis only an arbitrary measure to be sure  but hardly the first time wherein we ve sensed that certain entities    who can come to market with such size as to materially and swiftly move Gold    keep an evil eye on this very chart and say   Well  that s it  we re about to hit those red dots  so Short 10 000 cacs at the market  Then we ll quietly buy  em back piecemeal after the plunge so we don t move price back up    Tis an outrage 

Moreover  with the calendar flipping to a new month  let s also go year over year with Gold and some equities brethren  Note that we ve changed the mix a bit  as suggested by a valued charter reader of The Gold Update  Because the Gold Bugs Index   HUI    Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index  XAU  and the exchange traded fund for the miners  ARCA GDX  almost universally have their percentage changes practically on top of one another  we ve substituted the latter two in the following chart with two popular common stocks  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   Of course  still included is the roller coaster rockin   n rollin  Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   Presently  NEM s the locomotive and GG s the caboose 

Now as for the Federal Reserve Bank s Federal Open Market Committee not ruling out an interest rate increase this year  one wonders if they d already composed their Policy Statement without the benefit of knowing the Q1 Gross Domestic Product malaise  which on Wednesday was released only 5  hours before the Statement was issued 
 Oh c mon  mmb  you know the Commerce Dept  s gotta tip  em off  eh  
No  neither you nor I know that  Squire  But it really doesn t matter  for you ve heard the expression about  symbolism over substance   With respect to the Fed   twould appear we have  credibility over crisis   Either way  remember  the mandate of the Department of Commerce s Bureau of Economic Analysis is to  promote a better understanding of the U S  economy by providing the most timely  relevant  and accurate economic data in an objective and cost effective manner   Which is  in a way  what our Economic Barometer shows us every day of the week   as opposed to once per quarter   The point is  regardless of the FOMC perhaps knowing ahead of time what the poor GDP data was for Q1  its practically no growth state   0 2     one fifth of that which was  expected     and even worse than the UK s anemic  0 3  growth  shouldn t be surprising to anybody  In fact what is surprising is that the number was not negative  To wit 

By the way  if your kid s homework assignment is to find an example of divergence  send  em back to school with the above Econ Baro   And for extra credit  let  em wax eloquent on the adjective  correction less  as described by the S P 500   Next week s stream of incoming Econ Data  which includes the Payrolls report on Friday  is expected to show net improvement  so we ll see if the Baro either gets a grip  else records further slip 
Continuing with the Precious Metals  we bring Silver into the mix in displaying the daily bars for the last three months along with those  Baby Blues  that depict 21 day linear regression trend consistency  Note how Gold on the left has not weathered the recent turbulence as well as has Sister Silver on the right  Gold has made a recent lower low and the blue dots are descending  conversely  Silver has made a recent higher low and her blue dots are ascending  I know it doesn t make a lot of sense to see Gold so suppressed given the spectrum of rationale for it to be much higher than  tis  Indeed analogous to The Rolling Stones bluesy pop piece from  66   Under My Thumb   twould appear as if Gold is smothered under a derri re of vast proportions 

As for the 10 day Market Profiles  they re not overly different in appearance from one week ago  albeit now the yellow metal  left  shows more overhead resistance with which to deal than there is for the white metal  right   Interesting  too  that Gold settled the week at 1177  which you ll recall last week was the last line of near term support    Hang on Goldie  Goldie hang on      

Finally to how it all looks for Gold in the big scheme of things  Here s our structure chart of weekly bars from just prior to Gold s All Time High to date  Still flirtin  and runnin  across those burnin  coals is Gold 

We ll leave you with this from the  Misery Loves Company Dept    nary a week goes by without one very esteemed member of our Sunday Investor s Roundtable repetitively pounding palm upon knee  exclaiming  What s wrong with Gold  Why isn t it up  The currency s terrible  the geo political picture is the worst it s been in years  the economy s no where as good as they say it is  Why isn t Gold up  Why isn t it up where you guys say it outta be   Following such rightfully sensible tirade  the balance of the group all excitedly answer at once with the usual baseless bilge as to why  tisn t  the cacophonous din generally being a good moment to step over to the bar and refresh one s caf

11749,233264,RGLD,Gold Update  Trade Remains Uncannily Narrow,opinion,"The standings bring to mind those of a weak division in professional sports  such as football s NFC South  wherein last season Carolina finished in first place with a losing record   To be sure  sports is serious business  but more so is money  And to see the Swiss franc atop our standings  moreover sporting the only winning record at  2 2   is very telling  especially when followed by both the bond   2 5   and gold   5 1    Those latter two may have losing records  but when the podium is now made up of these three markets  after some six years of bubbly baby boomer excessive ex earnings equities effervescence  it brings to mind the rather daunting differential calculus term  inflection point    For you WestPalmBeachers down there  that is a kinda  end of the road  thing  
 But mmb  you left the dollar out of the standings    
Squire  that is strictly due to the dollar not being a component of the BEGOS Markets set  Yes  year to date topping the standings at  6 2  would be the dollar index  however  it s being a calculated concoction from six other  bow wow  currencies  let alone the dollar itself having been debased sevenfold since 1980  makes any analysis there rather like grasping at air 
Of course  what has the appearance of really falling through air are equities  We say  appearance   for although the S P 500 s down days of late have loomed large  again  tis been but a generically speaking  10  correction  thus far  or more precisely  12  from the all time closing high of 2130 82 on 15 May down to the 1867 61 close of 25 August  Lets use another sports analogy to put that in perspective as follows 
A Formula One racing event is not just the race itself  Each event starts with three sessions of practice  followed by a qualifying session to set the race cars  starting positions  For the S P  that is essentially our view of the last three weeks  a preparatory period for the race itself  for which we expect the start is imminent  and the duration to extend through September if not well into October  For after all   tis the traditional season for market turmoil  and the S P certainly has come through qualifying now positioned on the starting grid to  Slump   Plunge    akin to our other descriptions for a  Valuation Detonation  or  Look Ma No Earnings Crash    We ll herein look at the S P within the guise of our Economic Barometer  but first  lets get to gold vis   vis its weekly bars 
And as we below see  gold this past week was unable to string together a sixth consecutive  higher low   albeit it breached that of the prior period by just 1 2 points  The rightmost parabolic red dot is now down to 1162  40 points above the present price of 1122  So  with gold s  expected weekly trading range  now at 37 points  were a robust up week to ensue  it ought to flip the parabolic trend back to Long 

Yet  having passed though another month  our year over year view of gold s equities buddies remains ghastly  Here we ve the percentage tracks of the yellow metal along with the Gold Bugs Index  HUI   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   Goldcorp  NYSE GG  and Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  

It remains somewhat puzzling that gold isn t broadly moving higher given an inexhaustible number of reasons for it to so do  the overarching media analyst rationale for it not flying higher being the near  certainty  of the Federal Reserve Bank nicking up its Funds rate a notch   for which we remain in the  shan t  camp   Such excuse does however raise this question   how many times must gold be sold because of an anticipated rate hike   Surely  tis in the price a hundredfold  but the timidity remains to get aboard the Gold Train  One might opine that upon the S P falling pell mell  gold surely shall look swell  But recall that even early on during the Black Swan of 2008  all of the BEGOS Markets fell  despite both gold and the bond suffering far less damage than did the other components 
Still for the present  given the ramped up volatility in the S P  the gold trade continues to be uncannily narrow  our referring to it a week ago as being somewhat docile  Here next  we ve updated our one year views of  expected daily trading range   EDTR  for both gold on the left and the S P on the right  Worlds apart they are 

And just in case you re scoring at home  the  lock limit  overnight range for the S P futures remains 5  up or down  The last time  twas triggered  To the downside on 24 October 2008  Today the limit equates to a move of 96 points  Given that in the last two weeks we ve had three full intra day trading ranges of 85 to 136 points  don t think it too unlikely to wake up one morning and find  as they say  that  we re locked limit down in the SnPs   Again   tis the season and this time with sound reason  Which  in turn  leads us to the Econ Baro within which we find the not so complacent S P  red line  

Don t tell that to International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine  En Garde   Lagarde  who sees weaker than expected global economic growth  inclusive of that Stateside as well as in other advanced economies  with the prospects of a U S  interest rate hike being given partial blame  Madame Lagarde has already said that the Fed ought put off a rate rise until next year  given the fragility of economic recovery  Darn those Federal Open Market Committee folks for not perishing such thought of tightening  eh  Especially as our Institute for Supply Management just recorded the lowest factory activity reading in over two years  Elsewhere  Australia had its slowest overall economic growth as well over two years  Also  we re reading that Canada is falling into recession  And further on the factory orders front  Germany s just dropped by an unexpected amount  As for Eurozone unemployment falling to a three year low  one must wonder if they re simply using the modern day U S  ploy of employing two part time persons to do one job  And then there s China  nuff said 
Fortunately  there s also gold  And trading at less than one half the value it ought be by our opening scoreboard display  such upside road extends quite a long way  Again our initial milestones from here are as follows  flip the weekly parabolic trend to Long  as we saw above at 1162   get price above the 300 day moving average of 1209  and curl the average itself upward   and have gold settle a week that clears the 1240 1280 resistance zone   i e  with a low above 1280   By so doing  we can then declare that  the bottom is in  toward next turning to deal with the broad term structure that we see here of gold s weekly bars since its All Time High 

As for the near term  in the following two panel chart we ve on the left gold s daily bars for the past three months with their  Baby Blues  depicting the consistency of 21 day linear regression trend  whilst on the right is the 10 day Market Profile  the labeled price bars being those with the largest amounts of traded contact volume for these past two weeks 

Finally  in the midst of what is a truly horrific crisis of humanity spreading into Europe  not to mention the market mis valuations of which we write  the imbalances thereto pointing toward some serious financial fallout  we d like to wrap it for this week with the following headline which did give us pause to smile   Paris suffers baguette  shortage    As quoted in the FinTimes  one Aude Debout said  I find myself buying more sliced bread from the supermarket   and that s not even really bread   Amen to that  sister  the moral of the story being  if you re heading over to Paris  BYOB  don t be without such warm Golden Dough ",2015-09-06,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-gold-update-264202,264202
11750,233265,RGLD,The Most Interesting Story In Gold,opinion,"Or  Gold Miners  Doom Is Streaming Companies  Boom 
The gold  NYSE RING  and silver  NYSE SLVP  miners are in crisis  as metal prices hover around break even for many and capital dries up for most  Dozens of companies are one or two quarters away from running out of cash and closing down  and their executives are ready to deal 
This is  in short  the part of the cycle when the smart money sets itself up to make a fortune in the next bull market  Chief among this bunch are the streaming companies that finance developing mines in return for a share of future production 
In good times they do all right but find it hard to cut deals on favorable terms because the miners have access to cheap capital from less discerning banks and equity investors  But at the bottom of bear markets   like now   the streaming companies find themselves virtually alone in the industry in having both cash and an interest in putting it to work  Miners who need financing to survive now have nowhere else to turn  and the streaming companies are feasting  Here s a recent Bloomberg profile of the biggest of them 


For Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV    the best time to take on debt is at the bottom of a market  The day may be approaching for the Canadian royalty and streaming company as the commodity rout boosts demand for alternative funding 
 There are so many opportunities out there  we might have to dip into our credit lines   Chief Executive Officer David Harquail said in an interview last week from his Toronto offices   The ideal is you lever yourself up at the very bottom of the bear market and hopefully  if you ve called it right  then you really benefit as the market turns around  
Streaming companies like Franco Nevada  Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   and Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   give miners upfront payments in exchange for the right to buy metals at a discount in the future  Franco Nevada also does royalty agreements  tying portions of production to land titles 
Plunging metal prices  with copper down 24 percent and gold 11 percent in the past year  combined with surging credit costs and volatile stock markets  have made streaming attractive even for majors such as Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   and Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX    giving the business more credibility 
 It s something that s gone from being seen as kind of hokey  to where now every major company and their CFO has to consider it among their financing options   Harquail said 
Unused Credit With no debt  about  610 million in cash  plus  110 million in marketable equities and an unused line of credit worth about  1 billion  the company has plenty of scope for more deals   Without going back to the equity markets  right now  we ve got one and a half billion to play with   Harquail said 
Two types of deals have become more common in recent years  Harquail said  Medium sized producers are turning to royalty and streaming companies for help buying assets from larger miners  Lundin Mining Corporation  TO LUN  purchase of Freeport s Candelaria copper mine  which Franco Nevada helped finance in exchange for a gold and silver stream  is a case in point  he said 
Also  the largest producers are now willing to sell streams on their most prized assets  Harquail said   We re getting the opportunity to bid on some of the best mines in the world  

For an idea of how much things have changed in mining  consider Glencore  LONDON GLEN   With a 2011 market cap of  100 billion  it could have swallowed all the streaming companies without getting indigestion  Then commodities tanked and Glencore s stock crashed   and now it s scrounging for the funds to keep its mines afloat 


 Reuters    Glencore is in talks with Franco Nevada Corp  Silver Wheaton Corp  Royal Gold  and Osisko Gold Ro  TO OR  to sell portions of the future production of three South American copper mines  One source said on Wednesday the talks could expand to include other Glencore mines 

The longer the gold silver bear market grinds on  the more desperate the miners become and the better deals the streaming companies receive  And when prices rebound   as they will  since if they don t the mining industry will collapse and supplies will dry up  the streaming companies will generate massive cash flow 
Here s what this meant for the market values of the biggest streaming companies following the 2008 precious metals bear market 

Will they do this again  No  They should do a lot better because the 2008 precious metals bear market lasted less than a year  which was too little time for the proper amount of panic to take hold  This bear market has been grinding on for three years  and now the miners are out of cash and desperate  which should allow far more ounces to be bought at bargain basement prices   and far more cash to be generated on those ounces when prices start rising ",2015-09-27,John Rubino,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-most-interesting-story-in-gold-266294,266294
11751,233266,RGLD,Gold  The Urgency To Buy,opinion,"Per recent missives  gold   as it did twice more this past week   is putting in a sufficient number of  lift offs  such that we ll stop enumerating them  The point is  gold is banking buying bursts on each broadly visible suggestion of central banks  eventually queuing up for Quantitative Easing  our own StateSide FedHeads   behind the bravado of a looming raise in their Funds rate   we think awkwardly  feeling  QE  albeit clearly not  acknowledging  QE     at least not yet 
What we re  feeling  and  acknowledging  across the recent rippling of the gold trade is a prudent urgency to buy  and to so do with gusto   price then subtly drifting downward after each such instance       and then Bang  the Buy Button is hit yet again   Tis still another sign in determining  how we ll know when the bottom is in   And with gold today at but a lowly 1156  you regular readers know we ve already established that price must work well up through the 1200s before declaring it indeed has reached as low as  twill go  i e  1072 back on 24 July  
That said  the urgency to buy of late continues to be impressive  relative to many a failed attempt which we ve witnessed during these past four years  To be sure  October s upside thus far may not appear to be worth jubilating about  gold s remains down 2 3  for 2015 to date   not that we need remind ourselves  tis also down 40  from its All Time High of 1923 on 06 September 2011  
Yet similar to the chart of gold we presented a week ago that depicted four distinct rocket  lift offs  in price since the middle of last month  let s now take you  Inside the Gold Trade  with the following graphic of the trading track for these first seven days in October  But  rather than chart price by the passage of time  here we ve gold by the passage of contracts traded  Specifically  each bar  or  candle   in this chart represents the trade of 10 000 gold contracts  Look at the beautiful  wavy surges of flow in the trade  countered by only wimpy wanings of ebb   Now yer right in the thick of the trade  baby   By stripping away time  replacing it with volume  therein is revealed the urgency to buy 

 That s a pretty cool way of looking at it mmb  
Well  Squire  volume fuels price   Course  markets hardly move in a one sided straight line  and as we next bring up gold year over year per its weekly bars  the progress from the aforementioned July low is thus far quite respectable  the parabolic trend confirming such by having flipped from Short to Long  blue dots  just three weeks ago  Again  a minimal  atta boy   target to achieve during this trend is 1170  for  twould take Gold above its August high  seventh  starred  bar from the right at 1169   the area from which price last stumbled  Then  oh to attack the purple bounded 1240 1280 resistance zone  wouldn t that be lovely  So near and yet so far  let s first wish upon the 1170 star 

Again as to the Federal Reserve Bank  we ve implied that its Open Market Committee members  deep in the fertile crevices of their individual minds  rate rise or otherwise  must be sensing an ineludible return to QE   short of the  bank  itself being shut down and its  notes  replaced with a hard asset based currency     now there s a thought    As per Dow Jones  musing over the minutes released on Thursday that the  Fed saw increase in downside risks when it held off on September hike   clearly the FOMC  academicians though they may be  ought see the economy as do we   

   and indeed be wary of the S P s spree  Moreover  with respect to the stock market  this next graphic converts  wary  to  scary   Amidst all the happy talk and relief over the S P 500 s having risen 7  in just the last two weeks  we re sorry to have to point out that it so occurred on a foundation of fluff   You website visitors are familiar with this one   Each day for the S P 500 Index we calculate its moneyflow  the summation of every component s change x volume x cap weight  and regress the result into S P points  We then post an image of the difference between the S P and its moneyflow  the latter to which the index generally shall directionally turn   For you West Palm Beachers down there  that is what is termed a  leading indicator    Our 63 trading day  one quarter  view through yesterday s  Friday s  S P settle at 2014 89 generated the following result  The blue line is the difference between the S P itself and its regressed moneyflow level  Now at  200 on the scale  the suggestion is the S P  ought instead be  at 1814 76     and what do we know is oft a harrowing hallmark for the October stock market  Just sayin    

As for Q3 Earnings Season that is just underway  and for which we ll compile bottom line comparisons for some 2000  companies  with only 18 thus far recorded  eight of those  44   did worse than in Q3 a year ago   Probably just statistical noise that  for earnings don t matter anymore anyway in a zero percent interest world where  tis requisite to keep buying equities     right  
Bringing the yellow metal back into the picture  a great friend and day trading colleague remarked to me last week that gold trades inversely to the S P  This is a phenomena that is oft noted amongst traders  however  tis hardly perpetual  For example  broadly  both markets are markedly higher since Nixon nixed the Gold Standard back in  71  But as we ve seen over the years  gold is actually rather finicky to the directional ways of the S P  not to mention those of other commodities and currencies  Certainly we ve shown gold and the S P at times to be in almost perfect negative correlation  but at other times in seemingly unending stints of lovey dovey togetherness  And of late  we ve seen both  Here are the percentage tracks of gold vs  the S P from one month ago to date  Note that we ve trisected the graphic  wherein the outer thirds show the two markets in directional harmony  the center third being somewhat more in opposition  But any way one analytically slices it  at the end of the day  Gold as a rare  hard asset currency really doesn t give a derri re du rat about the  if you will   asset less  S P 

Speaking of percentage tracks  we missed placing in last week s missive our usual month end  year over year view of gold and its equities brethren  Thus  here  tis  now spanning from 09 October 2014 through 09 October 2015   HUI  is the Gold Bugs Index   NEM  is Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    NYSE GG  is Goldcorp  and  NASDAQ RGLD  is Royal Gold  Note the recent hard acceleration in the equities    

Finally  to the nearer term  tradin  nitty gritty in this dual panel graphic featuring gold s  Baby Blues  on the left and the 10 day Market Profile on the right  For the baby blue dots that depict trend consistency  the rule   rather than the exception of which there is one per the trough at right of center   is that they swing from below  80  to above  80   Should that play out on this run  price would almost certainly trade up through the 1170 goal  as we ve previously noted with regard to the weekly parabolic Long trend  And for the profile  one can t carp about there not being any trading support  it doesn t get much better than this    specially if it holds   

In parting for this week  we ll leave you with these three quick hits 
  At the outset  we used the plural possessive in alluding to central banks having to eventually queue up for QE  A brief global spin shows us the Bank of Japan not quite yet expanding stimulus despite slumping exports and oil prices  the Bank of England sees the UK economy as withstanding worldwide slowing  but having  the room  to maintain record low interest rates as inflation goes backward  and certainly the European Central Bank is not ignorant to Germany s factory orders  unexpectedly  having declined during August  as did their industrial production   And Germany s largest financial institution  derivatives laden Deutsche Bank  XETRA DBKGn   just posted a  6 2bn loss for Q3  so much for  goodwill   
  Did anyone notice this  The latest auction for the US Treasury s three month Bills went off at a zero percent yield  That s a first  but more importantly  you know the old saying that  the Fed is always behind the curve   Perhaps the FOMC will indeed vote to move rates afterall  down 
  Lastly  Bill Gross is out to sue the firm which he co founded and ran for decades  PIMCO  to the tune of  at minimum   200 million  Guess that s the urgency which occurs when you try to make up for things on the backend and a Bond market that refuses to die ",2015-10-11,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold---the-urgency-to-buy-267739,267739
11752,233267,RGLD,Gold Rides Rough While The Fed Talks Tough,opinion,"One week ago  we pointed to the then pending Federal Open Market Committee policy statement as a  non event   Essentially  twas  despite the buzz 
And yet  au contraire  we ought be shaking in our boots now  what  No  not because  tis Halloween   which here in San Francisco is essentially a 365 day year event   Rather  because the Federal Reserve Bank s Fickle Finger of Fate is wagglin  at our face in preparing us for an increase of rate  Come December  they say  Is there no other way 
Notwithstanding the huff  n puff  sabre rattlin  statement by the FOMC this past Wednesday  we rest assured that their rate shan t inflate  Here s why  as we cue Rod Stewart s 1971 tune  Every Picture Tells A Story  

 Tis not rocket science folks  when incoming economic data is improving  the above graphic s blue line goes up     and vice versa  And given that the blue line is going down  the stock market loves it    so much so that not only was the S P 500 s brief 12  correction merely a wee nightmare  but the swift recovery sufficient to put the Index atop our BEGOS Market Standings with 10 months of 2015 now in the books 

 Tis further encouraging for the S P that earnings no longer matter   our  live  price earnings ratio for the Index now into as extreme territory as we ve ever seen at 42 1x   for as long as Quantitative Easing remains inevitable  no haven other than stocks is habitable   at least by conventional wisdom  
Not that we re none the wiser  however there is Gold  which in dropping 2  for the week to settle Friday at 1142 presently is some 55  below our debased currency equivalency level of 2541  Recall from a week ago our noting that Gold could see 1144 by its daily parabolic trend having gone from Long to Short  Nonetheless  the weekly parabolic trend remains comfortably to the Long side  resting well above the ascending blue dots as we see here 

Indeed  the pure technician would opine that 1144 was in the cards regardless of any fundamental catalyst  an example being what was said at the Fed  Still  isn t it odd that if the S P is seeing QE  so shouldn t Gold  too  be on an upside spree  But there again that doggoned conventional wisdom rules Gold s roost   Gold can t go up if the stock market  Dollar and interest rates are going up   Wanna bet   Does anyone remember 2005  S P  3   Dollar Index  12   FedFunds from 2 3  to 4 3   Gold  19   
 That d be a great trivia question  mmb  
Oh  tis been hauled out before  Squire  after which one momentarily hears crickets     and then a change of subject 
Subject however to a year over year   let alone four year   brow beating is Gold itself along with its far more volatile equities brethren  to which   by request from a valued core reader   we ve added Global X Silver Miners  N SIL   an exchange traded fund of Silver miners  So from October of a year ago  here s our half dozen  albeit fully submerged  bunch including the Gold Bug s Index  HUI   Newmont Mining  N NEM   Goldcorp  N GG  and Royal Gold  O RGLD   And again of late   tis a rough ride indeed 

To be sure  those Gold equities are not for the feint of heart  but for the fattening of one s asset base  they are a food for a fruitful future  if only they d get off the schneid so we can say  The future is now   But as you can see  when they go  they go 
Problematic as well to Gold s not going up most recently have been the baby blue dots that depict 21 day linear regression trend consistency  For just as we ve noted earlier that Gold s daily parabolics had turned south prior to the FOMC s augury  so too had our  Baby Blues  for the Precious Metals  Here they are for the past three months in this two panel graphic with Gold on the left and Silver on the right 

As for the updated 10 day Market Profiles  we see in this next two panel view that Gold  left  doesn t have that much overhead resistance with which to deal  should price make the rapid run back up to that 1166 resistor  whereas Silver  right  could sooner get stuck in the 15 85 15 90 zone 

Still  as  twas put forth by Bloomy this past week   European shares rose with U S  equity index futures on speculation that central banks around the world will persist with monetary policies and stimulus designed to boost growth   Further  we saw that the United Kingdom s economy eked out just a meager 0 5  Q3 gain as output for both construction and manufacturing fell  the news agency noting it all to be  a sign that Britain may be falling prey to global headwinds   That already having been an underscored concern across the EuroZone  what goes  round the globe comes  round it as well   See Econ Baro  
And as it all ultimately leads to QE  what now need come  round with respect to Gold are some buying sprees  for as we turn to our categorized chart of weekly bars since 2011 s All Time High  1923   just to get above purgatory and back into the basement  sous sol  would be a welcome achievement  At least we ve been knocking on the door   

So into November we go  the last three of which have all been net negative for Gold  2013 s being the weakest with a 5  loss  A repeat of that would put Gold sub 1100 at month s end  Let s not go there  rather  a run to the 1200s would instead shed more light upon  how we ll know when the bottom is in  
Speaking of which  we ll know in a week s time if StateSide job creation  per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  rosy methods  has bottomed  Counting jobs is a tricky business  To wit  we leave you with the following accountings of trying to get it all right per various FinMedia sources with respect to Deutsche Bank    that s the one with the derivative holdings which purportedly exceed Germany s gross domestic product by some 20 times   letting some folks go  This from our  But Who s Counting Dept

11764,233279,RGLD,Market Ready To Crash  Here s How I m Protecting My Positions,opinion,"Near the end of December last year  Sterne Agee s chief market technician Carter Braxton Worth put together this nifty little  Christmas Tree  showing how  the market   well  the US market  anyway  has performed since the year 1825  To do so  he used data from Roger G  Ibbotson and Yale University up until 1895  then used the DJIA until 1927 and  finally switched to the S P 500 from 1928 forward 
His chart shows that the US stock market has produced a January 1 to December 31 gain in 134  71   of those years and failed to produce a calendar year gain in 55  29   of those years  This is pretty close to what I wrote in my book  Bringing Home the Gold  25 years ago when I said the market goes up about 2 3 of the time and down only about 1 3 of the time 
Yet  during all those years  there was always some bad news that frightened ordinary investors away from the market  That s why it doesn t pay to be short the market just because Iran is seeking  with the help of some too eager for a deal  any deal  U S  negotiators  to build a nuclear bomb and delivery system or because the U S  unemployment rate reaches 10  or  indeed  because the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor   That was December 7  1941  You ll notice that the markets rose in the 20 30  range in both 1942 and 1943  
The Christmas Tree is really just a standard distribution chart  and its lessons should be heeded  The first of those is that you never know  when to be short or out of the market based upon the external news scenario  In fact  as I recently wrote   Bull markets climb a wallof worry   If investors weren t nervous they d all buy all the time and pretty soon no one would sell   until  of course  that inevitable momentwhen a small boy tugs at mommy s skirt and says   But the emperor isn t wearing any clothes   after which all hell would break loose 
A second lesson is that you cannot predict the future from the past  though you can see parallels  I can find no instance in this chart wherethere were back to back losses within the same distribution range that were greater than 10    of course  if you were down 9  one year  12  the next and 22  the next  as happened in 2000  2001 and 2002  you could be forgiven for thinking the markets were no place for meremortals   just in time to see a 28  rise in 2003 and up markets for the next four years as well 
The point is  if you remain well diversified among a number of asset classes you will never do as well as today s market darling or sector but you will make considerably more year in and year out  Yet  when we are in a down market  people panic and assume the market must keep going down the next x number of months or years  as well  So they sell  typically at or near the bottom and don t re enter the arena until the news is good and they see that other friends and neighbors are re entering as well 
I am quite willing to let the market tell me when I might want to reallocate assets from equities to bonds  from US markets to overseas markets  from one weakening sector to another  strengthening  sector  But I m never completely out of  the market   We hew to an asset allocation strategy and time the market only insofar as we see our trailing stops  mental or actual  go from a trickle to a waterfall 
Readers who have been with us a few years have seen numerous instances  like right now  where we are moving more into fixed income  markets that are more fairly valued  and the strongest defensive sectors and industries  We ride roller coasters at theme parks  Wedon t ride them in the market 
Is This Market Ready to Crash 
In light of all the above  does my move into safer holdings mean I think the market is ready to crash  I haven t a clue when the market will correct  I only know that this one is getting long in the tooth  that valuations of U S  companies have risen to the point where a correction is  more likely  to occur  and that there are asset classes and geographic regions where that witches brew doesn t yet exist  All things are cyclical 
What I am buying instead of most new U S  holdings will one day be overvalued or under duress  as well  When that time comes  or before  I would like to see greater value in U S  markets so I can begin buying these  typically during the time that most investors have thrown in the towel  What I do know is that the NASDAQ closed above 5000 on March 2nd and promptly retreated  What I do know is that the U S  dollar is making it very difficult for large American companies   the kind that comprise the DJIA and the S P 500   to grow their earnings 
So I am moving offshore  getting more defensive  and buying more anchors in the form of U S  and foreign bonds  If I m being more defensive  why am I buying some U S  high yield bond funds  you may well ask  The answer is that  while I don t see American firms growing their revenues significantly  they have borrowed enough at incredibly low interest rates that their coffers are once again full  They have the money to meet their debt obligations  as bondholders we are less concerned with the income statement than we are with the balancesheet 
If they can pay their debts  I m happy to be a creditor and receive 5 or 6  rather than 1  in a CD  Besides  I am never completely out of the U S  markets  Even if I think that s a good decision  history has shown that it loves to turn on a dime and confuse investors and destroy capital at will  But what I am keeping in the U S  is going into the strongest sectors like consumer discretionary  health care and technology  as well as into two areas I believe will recover as our population gets back to work  energy and U S  real estate 
The consumer discretionary sector includes retail  media  travel and leisure  entertainment and so on  When people believe their job is secure and they will be able to save as well as do fun things again  this sector benefits  Healthcare is obvious  the developed world  where the populace can afford health care either directly  via insurance or a national health scheme  is aging  The bulge of baby boomers is here and they need meds  therapy and surgery almost as much as they need to get off their  um  couches  and exercise  play  and enjoy the taste of real food 
Now let s talk tech We are switching our holdings in this area from the big cap monsters of American technological ingenuity to the smaller up and comers  This leaves me decidedly uncomfortable  which probably means it s a good thing to do right about now  Tough as it is to leave the joys of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Oracle  NYSE ORCL  et al in favor of lesser known firms  these giants have a problem  the U S  dollar  The big tech firms today are getting 70  or so of their revenues from non U S  clients  America got the tech revolution early  the real growth today is in distant locations 
I m hard pressed to imagine significant growth  in the currency with which most Americans invest  anyway  in earnings for the behemoths  I ll still keep some Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   MSFT and others but we will be exchanging our big cap SPDR Select Sector   Technology ETF  NYSE XLK   our 2nd largest position in our Aggressive Growth portfolio  for the PowerShares Small Cap Info Tech ETF  NASDAQ PSCT   It is comprised of the more speculative  but I believe currently better positioned  names like Synaptics  NASDAQ SYNA   Cirrus Logic  NASDAQ CRUS   CACI International  NYSE CACI   Coherent  NASDAQ COHR  and Manhattan Associates Inc  NASDAQ MANH  
In our Growth and Value Portfolio  we already own both the Schwab US REIT ETF  NYSE SCHH  and the IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF  NYSE ROOF  I ve read all the academic studies that say that residential real estate and suburban retail and commercial space are pass  because Millennials all want to live in hip urban neighborhoods and walk or bicycle to work  Well  didn t we all    Of course  when you re single or experimenting with living together you want to be near work  restaurants  bars and cultural attractions  That s where you meet members of the opposite sex  Duuuhh  It isn t as if the younger generations are the first to discover urban living  or sex  for that matter   But once we decide to start a family or tire of the noise and less than dependable garbage pickup  we look to buy our own house  a place where the walls are thick and there is room to play  I disagree with the naysayers  U S  real estate is a great long term holding 
That Brings Us to Energy
If you have patience  ice water in your veins  and or plan to go camping for the next 6 months without Internet or phone  I can t imagine a better sector to be in than energy  As an energy investor of 40 years  I ve seen this all before  Every time the sector cycles back up I ve been glad I bought when I did 
We may be approaching another great buying opportunity here  my advice is to stick with the global Titans this time  as well  I think the proven reserves and balance sheets of every debt ridden sub major big enough to have an impact upon the big firms is currently being scrutinized by burning the midnight oil analysts at each of those majors  Buying oil on the stock market is today cheaper than exploring for it and  to the point of today s surplus  doesn t add to global supply  but does add to the strength of these companies  We own BP  NYSE BP  and have options on Total  NYSE TOT   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  and  via SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   both Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   the two biggest components 
We ll be buying more 
   And Then There is Gold
Most of the time  gold is a dreadful investment  Look at any chart of gold juxtaposed against the S P and you ll see that  But every now and again  when gold is depressed like  say  oil is  and world events and many stock markets afford little value  gold is worth a nibble  We don t buy gold producers  we buy gold royalty firms  And we are already buying Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  and Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW   These are the  financiers  to the precious metals business  They assess a find the explorer has mined and  if it meets their hurdles  the royalty companies lend mine completion funds and take their  interest  in a percent of the gold that is mined 
Why buy  maybe  when you can buy  for certain  ",2015-04-15,Joseph L. Shaefer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/do-not-publish:-where-might-we-go-from-here-248383,248383
11766,233281,RGLD,20 PM Charts For Clues To Bear Market s Ongoing Validity,opinion,"I believe yesterday marked a breakout on the precious metals stock indexes as well as in gold  though they have different reversal patterns  Below is the combo chart we ve been following that has the HUI on top and the SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD  on the bottom 
As you can see  the HUI broke above its double bottom trendline yesterday while GLD broke above its neckline  Both reversal patterns have a price objective back up to the top rails of their 18 month consolidation patterns  I m still viewing this rally off of the November low as a counter trend rally within the bear market  Instead of having just four reversal points it looks like we ll see at least six to complete their respective consolidation patterns  A serious break above the top rail of the 18 month consolidation would then call into question the validity of the bear market 


Below is a weekly chart for the ARCA Gold Miners ETF  GDM  that shows its 18 month blue bearish expanding falling wedge  The double bottom has a price objective up to the 700 area which coincides with the top rail 
Our line in the sand is now the double bottom trendline  Above is bullish and below is bearish  Note the price action at reversal point  4  If you recall  we went short on the breakout of that black dashed horizontal trendline using Direxion Daily Jr Gld Mnrs Bear 3X  NYSE JDST  and Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2X  NYSE DUST   You can see the string of black candles that accompanied that decline  This week is just getting started but we have two white candles in place so far 

Let s now look under the hood to see what is running these indexes  starting with one of the big ones Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   The monthly chart shows where the neckline extension rail may come into play if we get this counter trend rally to the upside 

The weekly chart for Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  shows it trying to break out from a small double bottom  It could backtest the bottom rail of the blue bearish rising wedge again 

Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  is another big cap PM stock that is breaking out above a small double bottom 

It looks like Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold  NYSE FCX  is in the process of backtesting the neckline from an unbalanced H S top 


Endeavour Silver Corp   NYSE EXK  looks like it too is in the process of backtesting its potential multi year neckline 

Agnico Eagle Mines  NYSE AEM  is showing some strength after breaking out from its double bottom and is now breaking above the bottom blue rail of a 6 point expanding bear flag 

ASA Gold and Precious Metals  NYSE ASA  is showing some strength by closing back above the bottom rail of a well defined rectangle 

IAMGold Corporation  NYSE IAG  hit the bottom rail of its blue rectangle but sold off on the initial hit  This is one to keep an eye on 

New Gold  AMEX NGD  is attempting to backtest its multi year neckline 

Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS  is showing a potential small double bottom within the major downtrend channel 

Seabridge Gold  NYSE SA  is still chopping around in a big  one year loose rectangle 

Eldorado Gold  TO ELD  is trading inside the blue triangle which is located just below the big neckline 

Hecla Mining  NYSE HL  is still chopping around below its big H S neckline 


Gold Fields  NYSE GFI  is showing some relative strength by breaking above its double bottom trendline 

Harmony Gold Mining  NYSE HMY  is another South African producer that is looking strong on a relative basis 

Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  is still trading below the bottom rail of the huge rising channel  Maybe it will backtest the bottom black rail again for the 5th time if the PM stock remain buoyant 

Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  is still chopping around inside a rising wedge  creating a possible 5th reversal point 

Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW  is trading back inside the blue triangle which is part of a bigger consolidation pattern in an expanding falling wedge 

I ll keep a close eye on these stocks and others for clues to see how high they may move  Right now it s still a mixed bag with some looking more bullish than others  The top rail of the expanding falling wedge  on the GDM chart above  will tell the tale if or when we get there ",2015-01-13,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/20-pm-charts-for-clues-to-bear-market's-ongoing-validity-238234,238234
11767,233282,RGLD,The Gold Bear Market Has Already Ended   Multiple Times,opinion,"It s hard to pinpoint just exactly where the gold bear market that started in 2011 ended  because it depends who you ask  For instance if you just would have owned more equivalent shares of Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV  for every share of SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD  owned  you would have never even experienced a bear market  according to the ratio between the two 

It s pretty rare to see a gold stock outperform gold during an entire bear market in gold  but Franco Nevada has managed to do that 
For most of the stronger gold stocks  the bear market in gold ended at the end of 2013  Take a look at another gold streamer  Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   and how it rocketed higher against gold starting in 2014 

For all intents and purposes the gold bear market in U S  dollars probably ended at the end of 2013 as well  But 2014 was a consolidation year for gold that kept people confused and scared that the gold bear market was still going strong  Plus the crazy parabolic rally in the U S  dollar at the end of 2014 caused a marginal new low in gold and hammered the weaker gold mining stocks down to super cheap levels compared to gold 
It s taken a long time for this gold bear market to bull market transition to take place  But the process is ongoing as stronger gold stocks and gold priced in foreign currencies lead the transition back into a bull market  which then should be followed by the rest of the sector ",2015-01-29,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-gold-bear-market-has-already-ended...multiple-times-240072,240072
11768,233283,RGLD,Will Greece Jettison The EU ,opinion,"You d be surprised at what Greeks say they ve lost most amid the debt crisis 

It isn t money or jobs  it s the loss of their sovereignty 

Well  last weekend  Greeks sent a loud message to those who ve imposed austerity upon them  They elected a government vowing to end all German dictated austerity measures 

Ahead of the election  I had an opportunity to discuss Greece with emerging Europe expert  Frank Holmes 

Frank is the CEO of U S  Global  and the perfect person to offer investment wisdom during such a turbulent time  Will Greece jettison the EU  Click the video below to listen 
Transcript 

Robert Williams  Hi there   Robert Williams  Founder of Wall Street Daily here  I have with me today Frank Holmes  CEO of U S  Global Investors  I regard Frank as the foremost expert on emerging Europe and resources  particularly gold  So with crisis still brewing in Europe  I couldn t think of a better person to lend us some insight 

Frank  let s jump right in  Please get us up to speed on where we presently stand on Europe  if you would 

Frank Holmes  Bad news is good news because these governments are panicking  and they will do everything to try to stimulate the economy  They re looking at every monetary policy they can  They re still on steroids on excessive regulations  which is a taxation on the system  There s been no fiscal balancing factors  It s just cheaper money  cheaper money  and I think that that s what you have to recognize 

When it comes to Greece  Greece will be just a battle  and it s a battle of words to try to get a culture that is flawed  And all the best  most motivated  entrepreneurial Greeks are over here in America and Canada  And the ones that stayed back  have a socialist mindset  And that process of turning around just takes longer  and I think that it ll   I don t think the Greeks are going to leave  I don t think that ll happen  It ll create some turmoil  Rates will fall lower  and we re going to see this fear of deflation  But the euro is going to decline against the dollar  and we re going to get a big economic surge in six months 

Robert Williams  I sense some optimism there  Frank  So might now be the perfect time to get some portfolio exposure to Europe 

Frank Holmes  Oh  it s the best time  Bad news is good news  And so you can buy   you can go in Germany  and you can buy German stocks  you know  the thing your government is paying 50 base points  and you can turn around and buy stocks paying 3  dividends growing at 5  a year  I mean  these stocks are going to continue   and the other thing that s really interesting that we ve found is that many of these countries  they buy their own stocks  So Switzerland has become one of the largest shareholders  Japan with all that money   monetary inflation  The central bankers realized that real assets are important besides Gold  They ve been buying their biggest market cap stocks so you see their stock markets going to new highs  I think Japan now owns 2  of the stock market  the central bank does 

Robert Williams  Frank  will you share with us which regions and sectors you re most bullish on right now  And tell us a little bit about your strategy sessions at U S  Global and how you generate these forecasts  I mean  do you rank certain countries from strongest to weakest 

Frank Holmes  We do look at countries  We think one of the most oversold countries is Russia  and we ll see how it happens in the winter with Ukraine  but it s one of the cheapest stocks on many factors that you can take a look at  And  you know  mean inversion looks like it s in place there  Last year  the slowdown in China   it s amazing that the A share markets in China went up 50   So this bad news is good news  and the opportunity is   the brain mindset is  where is it and where s the money flowing 

From sectors around the world  we see healthcare as still being a very strong sector in Europe  in America  Asia  Staples   basic staples  we look at the Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT  of the world and food  etc   supermarkets  They seem to be strong all around the world on a relative strength basis  Utilities have had a big  big move because of low interest rates  and also falling energy prices mean that they have profit margin expansion 

So there are opportunities  and going forward for this year  2015  I think in six months from now  we ll start seeing an uptick in emerging markets  The dollar will be coming off  and Europe will find a base somewhere 

Robert Williams  Frank  you mentioned the dollar coming off  What are we to make of the rally we ve been seeing in the dollar  Is it real or artificial 

Frank Holmes  It s real because it s a    laughter  they re all ugly  so it s all relative  And who has the strongest economy right now in the world is America  We import less oil so that makes our trade balance look more attractive  There s many fundamental factors that makes America look so much more attractive than other parts around the world  And so I think  though  anytime we ve had a strong currency exports drop  unemployment goes up  and then the government s panic  so I think the strong dollar will start to fade  And with the price of oil falling   the high income job creation in America was coming out of trains shipping sand down to Texas and the Bakken for fracking and drillers  So we re going to get a contraction in drilling  We re going to get traction in layoffs in high paying job  That will keep interest rates low in America 

The benefits that will happen is that in a year from now  the supply coming from all this fracking will stop because of   what people don t realize is that when you re a fracker  Meet the Frackers  as the funny movie is  as a play on words  But the issue here is that if you re not continuously drilling  your depletion falls  your decline rates  they call them  So let s say you have a discovery of 1 000 barrels a day  Normally  a year later  it s 800  then it s 600  then it s 400  and it stabilizes  When you re a fracker  it goes from 1 000 barrels to 100 in a year  so you continuous have to be hitting those   and then they ll stay there for 10 years at 100 barrels a day  So if you stop that exploration drilling  which we re seeing take place  in a year from now  you ll start seeing the U S  supply of energy declining rapidly  and then it snaps back to  70  And historically  oil bottoms between January and February  so we re in a trough period 

We re also in a rally period through the Chinese New Year  It s a big  big consumption period that s coming up for gold  Historically  gold has a big rally in January  so this is all very positive for us 

Robert Williams  Lastly  Frank  I d like to ask you about gold  I know you believe everyone should have exposure to gold in their portfolios  but what s the best way to do that 

Frank Holmes  We believe that gold should be 5  in bullion  5  in gold stocks  and rebalance each year  and we just think it s prudent  You know  the best performing currency last year in the world was the U S  dollar  What was second  Gold  Hard to believe that   it s really hard for people  I try to tell them that  that money   gold is money  and   but this is just the math  looking at it  And gold stocks are now starting to show that rebound 

My favorites always  of these programs is the royalty companies  Do you know what Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  did last year  Up 22   Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  up 36   Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW  up 1 5  in the past 12 months  They re just a better go to  so we own them  funds  But when you have a mutual fund  you have to have a cluster  You have to have at least 30 stocks in a portfolio  and diversify  So you can t have   you have all these diversification rules to comply with  And   but as an individual name   so there are people benefiting in this type of a market  and my job is to try to inspire curiosity to go find it ",2015-01-31,Robert Williams,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-greece-jettison-the-eu-240330,240330
11769,233284,RGLD,Gold Makes January s Podium  But What Of February s Love ,opinion,"Now don t get discouraged out there  to be sure  mid week following FedSpeak  the precious metals took a bit of a hammering  Gold at one point being off 56 points  down to 1251  from the prior week s high  of 1307   But resplendent in its newfound resilience  Gold zoomed back up yesterday  Friday  to settle out the week with a net loss of just 10 points at 1284 
Blame the sudden pullback on that which you prefer  one prominent FinMedia outlet rousingly running with  Gold Drops Most This Year as Investors Sell After Greek Election   gleefully hand wringing analysts expounding on StateSide economic strength such that the Federal Reserve Bank can t help but raise interest rates this year  which can only be an automatic Gold negative   our having proven such is far from always being the case   or that given its brawn and fortitude  the Dollar has indeed become the new Gold 
But rather than succumb to such piffle  here s a thought from the  Nothing Goes Up In A Straight Line Dept    Gold  and moreover Silver  have been on a terrific run such as to have arrived in an area where one ought expect the trend to become at least a little undone  Technically  Gold s returning into those Whiny 1290s as we described a week ago was sufficiently swift such that price    not for the first time    now appears a bit ahead of itself as we ll see below  such that some ebb within the upside flow would  by markets  nature  be due 
But first  with the month of January now in the books  let s begin straight away with our year to date BEGOS Market Standings  And if you re pro precious metals   tis hard not to be satisfied with this year s overture  despite the past week s wee setback 

Quite the impressive results thus far  non  What a difference a year makes  especially given that axiomatic Wall Street harbinger   As goes January     And to see Sister Silver not just on the podium with Gold and the Swiss Franc  but at the top of the table after all the mudslinging destitution through which she s be dragged is nothing short of sterling   Brava Diva  
Further  being month end   tis the point at which we bring up Gold s year over year percentage performance in concert with those of key precious metals equities as measured by the ARCA Gold BUGS  Philadelphia Gold Silver  Market Vectors Gold Miners  MX GDX   exchange traded fund for miners  and Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   And just as these equity measures die on the downside  so do they fly on the upside  As noted in the above standings  Gold so far in 2015 is  8   but the others  respective increases are  HUI  23   XAU  15   GDX  21   and RGLD  16   Unlike those of us here who cling to the comparatively muted metal futures  you there who trade the equities are the real  playahs  baby   

Now as to our measuring of Gold s being a bit ahead of itself  let s next go to our old tried and true analytical tool  the smooth pearly valuation line   not to be confused with the opening scoreboard s valuation of Gold  which based upon ruination of the currency rightly  indeed some say conservatively  calculates Gold presently as ought being at least 2469   But because the great markets that comprise BEGOS  Bond   Euro   Gold   Oil   S P  are constantly looking at and playing off one another  a comparative valuation of any one component can be derived with respect to the other four  as depicted by the smooth line in the following graphic for Gold  normally presented as either a three months or year over year display  But this time  in order to best emphasize the  being a bit ahead of itself  notion  we ve blown the chart out all the way back from the beginning of 2012 to date  774 trading days   Here s the key analytic  the lower panel of the chart is the oscillator of price less the valuation line  Look at the four red boxes across the oscillator  each one denoting Gold as has having reached 100  points above valuation  This does not infer Gold must drop 100 points from here  for in the main panel as you can see  the smooth line itself is rising up toward price  rather  tis just a reminder that Gold s recovering to far higher levels shall be met with resistors of all sorts en route  which can include getting too far ahead of this version of valuation 

Next let s turn to Gold s weekly bars  their current performance somewhat similar to this time of a year ago  leftmost part of the chart   Very encouraging is the recovery yesterday of price from within the 1280 1240 support zone  bounded by the purple lines   Near term however  we may have to withstanding some hem and haw in and out of that support zone  given Gold s aforementioned  ahead of itself  notion  before seeking higher ground in the 1300s 

Hemming and hawing notwithstanding  here is some seasonally good news for Gold   tis  on balance  loved by February  Oh  they do have their occasional lover s spat as you can see below in the following chart of Gold s performances in February throughout this millennium s first 14 years  only to then regain infatuative admiration   Amore  amore   

But also  observez  observez   for coupled with our earlier observance of Gold s presently being a bit ahead of itself  here next in this two panel graphic we see on the left Gold s  Baby Blues    measuring 21 day linear regression trend consistency   having begun to rollover in that three month view  whilst on the right in Gold s 10 day Market Profile we see the current price of 1284  white bar  essentially now centered in the trading range of these past two weeks 

Notwithstanding a February that becomes beloved  else belaboured  should the year s trend continue as our friend and Gold remain in inverse correlation to the S P  the year s best days for the yellow metal clearly lay ahead as the stock market arrives at a far overdue demise  Here is the month s percentage track of gleaming Gold vs  that to be Sold 

Now whilst all this is going on  our Economic Barometer continues to decline  such that we maintain our stance that the Federal Reserve Bank shan t raise its Fed Funds nor Discount Rates as the year proceeds  barring en route some miraculous upturn in the economy  However  we reserve the right to hedge somewhat against that  no rate rise  opinion  Here s why  we ve noted throughout life that the minority have a tendency to  will out   to be correct and thereby the most successful  Some examples include  only a fractional amount of the populous actually make any  real  money on Wall Street  in the world of derivatives   tis said that just one in six make any dough  amongst managed portfolios  we re told that less 5  maintain exposure to Gold  and yet  tis said  twill be the  last man standing   and as we ll see on Sunday  just one of the National Football League s 32 teams wins the season s Super Bowl  The balance of us in the majority do our best to make a happy slog through life  with success ranging from mediocre to somewhere above average  But here s the point  with the Federal Open Market Committee stewing over the timing of a rate increase   and I found this well put by the FinMedia   the Fed is the only developed nation s central bank considering raising interest rates this year  Therefore  their being in the minority means they may well so raise  Thus  rid thee of thy variable rate debt  lest those monthly payments increase your sweat as the Fed doth threat     All that having been said   tis that below with which they must deal  and so far  it ain t gettin  any prettier 

Moreover   twas rightly said post Fed that  Federal Reserve officials will keep the benchmark interest rate at a record low after their meeting in Washington today amid signs the global economic slowdown is catching up with the U S   No foolin  
In Greece  you ve no doubt seen bond yields soar and bank deposits flee as new Prime Minister Alexis  Tie less  Tsipras attempts to forge a coalition challenge to the austere policies of the European Union  within which the EuroZone itself is falling deeper into deflation  there s even talk now of having to sacrifice Greece to order to save Spain   odd given that the latter just recorded its fastest GDP growth in the past seven years   But  tis what  tis   Course  then there s Russia   which with a tip of the cap to Oil   just had its credit rating downgraded to junk by S P  Indeed given all of this global floundering of economics and politics running amok  we duly give a big  Thumbs Up   to the Netherlands which  for the first time in 16 years  has seen fit to increase its holdings of Gold   Barman  Another round of Heinekens for our Dutch friends here   Worth toasting  that

11770,233285,RGLD,5 Top Gold Stocks For 2015,opinion,"The precious metals market isn t really all about metals  Well  it sort of is but it is not ONLY about metals  Mining stocks are a significant part of the market and one that is very much interesting for gold and silver investors  In this commentary  we try to give you an idea why but we don t stop there  We also discuss the 5 top gold stocks for January 2015 and let you know what might make a solid mining stock investment  in our opinion   Mining stocks is the general name for the stocks of companies extracting metals  The term is pretty self explanatory  companies that qualify to this category mine metals  not only precious metals but also ores like copper  From the perspective of a precious metals investor  the most interesting mining stocks are those linked to gold  silver  platinum and  possibly to a lesser extent  palladium  In these considerations we ll apply the term  mining stocks  in this restricted form  and only to    A precious metals investor might be interested in mining stocks for a variety of reasons  First of all  mining stocks are readily available in the sense that you can buy them very much like you would buy any other kind of stock via your broker account  So  buying them is easy and the commissions on these transactions are not very high  Secondly  it s not only easy to buy mining stocks  it s also relatively easy to sell them  meaning that there usually is a wide range of possible buyers and sellers so you can close out your positions very quickly 
This is what we would call  liquidity   Thirdly  unlike buying physical gold  buying mining stocks doesn t incur specific types of storage costs which might be quite significant  You only pay stock commissions and this means that holding mining stocks is generally cheaper than holding gold in designated vaults or via a custodian  If you re interested in different ways to gain exposure to the precious metals market  you can delve right into our  section  There s a whole article there on    The above are the basic advantages of mining stocks as a trading or investment vehicle but there are also finer points here  Miners might offer leverage but not necessarily in the traditional sense of operating on more debt  The leverage here would be possibility to multiply gold s returns  In simple terms  on average  it is possible that if gold moves 1  up  some miners will move more than 1  up  thereby offering a multiplication effect  In this setting  an investor looking for exposure to the gold market could try to magnify their returns by including selected gold stocks in their portfolio 
The catch here is which stocks to choose  Some will have leverage over 1  they will magnify gold s returns  but also losses   some will have leverage below 1  diminishing returns  but also losses   Moreover  this is not a stable situation  Stocks with most leverage can  lose  it over time and  conversely  stocks with low leverage might  gain  it over time  In other words  if we were to rank gold stocks based on their leverage  they would trade places over time   From that stems the second subtle point  If the leverage of gold miners at any moment is negative  this would mean that a move up in gold could correspond to the stock moving down  While this might not look very attractive at first  think about times when gold plunges  In such periods of negative returns on gold  stocks with negative leverage could actually go up  This would be far from certain  but it seems that some miners can appreciate even in prolonged periods of falling gold prices   Sounds interesting  Leverage is not everything that matters in our approach  and we give more specific examples in just a few paragraphs   In discussing our top gold stocks picks for January 2015  we have to recognize that there is really no such thing as a  top gold stock  just as there is no such thing as the  best car in the world   It all depends on what you need  If you re into off road experience  you might go in for a shiny 4x4 vehicle  But you might be more concerned with pure horsepower  in which case you might end up with a sports car  There are various possibilities here as different things might be of importance to you  In a way  choosing a best gold stock is the same  So we ll explicitly write what our picks are based on   For ranking gold stocks  we re going to use the   an in house tool developed at Sunshine Profits  and subsequently made available for customers  This tool ranks gold stocks based on a number of factors  among them leverage as defined previously 
For all our calculations  we assume that the person interested in gold stocks has low risk tolerance  This means that the person likes their gold stocks to track gold and would be inclined to sell them if they underperformed gold  Before we proceed  we would like to stress that our tools are not providing  investment advice    they are available to help you make decisions on your own  but you will also need to take other factors into account while making investment decisions  tax implications would be one example    The distinction we ll make now is based on how long the position is intended to be held  If the holding period is shorter than 6 months  we ll consider this a short term position  If the time horizon is longer  this will be called a long term position  This might be different than you define the short and the long term but the most important part here is that the short term time frame is more speculative and the long term horizon is more of a fundamental investment   Let s start off with the case when the approach is a short term one  A short look at the Gold Stock Ranking  as of Jan  7  2015  
 

In the first column   Ranking   you see the place in the ranking  We limit our discussion to the 5 top stocks in the ranking but the Gold Stock Ranking itself computes all the values for 19 gold stocks of our choice   The second column   Symbol   is the symbol  ticker  of a given company you will see on stock exchanges   The third column   Valuation   shows you the valuation of the company relative to its  usual  value relative to gold  calculated according to our proprietary methodology   Positive values here mean that the stock might be overvalued relative to gold  By the same token  negative values might suggest that the company is undervalued relative to the yellow metal   The forth column   Exposure   shows you how well the company performs as a proxy for gold  It is based on the R squared  statistical measure  for the gold stock and gold and can be interpreted as how well the price of the gold stock might be explained by the price of gold  100  is the maximum value here  0  the minimum  Generally  values over 50  might be considered as relatively significant   The fifth column   Leverage   should be familiar by now   this is the leverage relative to gold  as explained earlier in this article  In general  the higher the value in this column  the greater the leverage   the more the moves of the price of the gold stock have magnified the moves of the price of gold  A value above 1 means that the stock has  on average  outperformed gold  a value below 1 means that the stock has  on average  underperformed the yellow metal  A negative value shows that the stock has  on average  traded in the opposite direction than gold   Additionally  the interactive version of our  gives you more info   for instance  moving the mouse cursor over the value in the first column will flash a short info on whether the stock might  on balance  be considered a valuable addition to a precious metals portfolio   Moving on to the specific values seen in the table  we see that Randgold  NASDAQ GOLD  leads the pack with exposure at over 90  and leverage above 1 5  These seem like favorable values   the Randgold stock looks like it moves in the same direction as the price of gold and it also offers more bang for the buck than gold does  on average and based on past data  This is supported by the information the Gold Stock Ranking gives you   Including GOLD  ticker for Randgold Resources  in your portfolio appears to be a good idea   The valuation doesn t seem to be too big a concern   Randgold might be almost 6  overvalued according to our methodology but this is not an extreme position   The second spot is taken by Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   with exposure over 80  and leverage slightly over 1  These are generally speaking  values less favorable than what we ve just observed for Randgold Resources  but still relatively favorable ones  The Gold Stock Ranking summarizes the situation by giving you info that  Including RGLD in your portfolio appears to be a good idea  
One concern here is that Royal Gold seems to be overvalued relative to gold  The tool also gives you info that you might consider switching to other stocks close in the ranking but less overvalued  or even undervalued  around price bottoms  This could mean that Randgold could be a better choice during such times   Eldorado Gold  NYSE EGO  comes in third but with values visibly worse than the two previous stocks  Exposure is still above 50  and leverage above 1  but the Gold Stock Ranking distils this data into the suggestion that  Purchasing EGO might be useful for diversification purposes  but it seems that it s not providing much advantage over investing in gold itself   So  Eldorado is not exactly a terrible gold stock by our criteria but not a terrific one either  One positive thing about Eldorado is that it seems undervalued relative to gold   The remaining two stocks have visibly lower exposure and leverage values  which might suggest that they are not particularly interesting for an investor seeking exposure to gold with leverage as we have defined it  In fact  the Gold Stock Ranking suggests that  Purchasing  them  is not advised    Now  let s change the objective a bit and consider gold stocks that the tool suggests for a long term position  as of Jan  7  2015   By that  we mean a position intended to be held for more than 6 months 
 
The top pick turns out to be Kinross Gold  NYSE KGC   with exposure close to 45  and leverage above 3  The exposure itself is perhaps not stellar but the leverage seems higher than was the case for a short term position  The tool suggests   Including KGC in your portfolio might be a good idea   On a less positive note  Kinross Gold does look mildly overvalued relative to gold  This doesn t seem to be extreme  though  If you recall  overvaluation means that it might be favorable to switch to less overvalued gold stocks around price bottoms   The second stock in this rating is Eldorado Gold  EGO  which we have already seen in the short term ranking  Eldorado Gold has similar characteristics to Kinross Gold  NYSE KGC  here  with marginally lower exposure around 45  and slightly lower leverage under 3 but it might be less overvalued  The Gold Stock Ranking suggests   Including EGO in your portfolio might be a good idea   It seems that this might particularly be the case around price bottoms where Eldorado Gold might be considered instead  or together with  Kinross Gold  Please note that it seems  based on the two rankings  short term and long term  that Eldorado might be a better vehicle for a long term position than for a short term one   Compa ia de Minas Buenaventura  NYSE BVN  lands third with lower exposure and leverage values than the two previous stocks  Our ranking suggests   Purchasing BVN might be useful for diversification purposes  but it seems that it s not providing much advantage over investing in gold itself   If you want to further diversify your portfolio  beyond Kinross and Eldorado   Buenaventura might be the stock to look at   The fourth place is occupied by Newmont  NYSE NEM   which has exposure in the range of that seen for the two first stocks but visibly lower leverage and is slightly more overvalued than Eldorado  The tool suggests   Purchasing NEM is not strongly discouraged  but it seems that you might want to choose other stocks or invest in gold itself    The same goes for Royal Gold  RGLD   which has more favorable leverage and is the only undervalued stock in this top 5  albeit only marginally  but also does seem to have less favorable exposure to gold  Also note that Royal Gold seems to be a more favorable vehicle for short term positions  in our short term ranking  than for long term ones   Now  a more general thought  Based on our two rankings  it looks like in the short term the top gold stocks track gold relatively well but offer possibly limited leverage  Also  there are only two stocks suggested by the tool as picks  For the long term  there are only two suggested picks but no stock is discouraged as an investment  This might mean that currently short term positions in gold stocks might track gold but won t offer significant return multiplication  In the longer term  you can possibly expect less consistent tracking of the price of gold but multiplied returns  which might also mean multiplied losses    Please note that the positions of gold stocks and silver stocks in the rankings change   while the changes are not necessarily visible on a day to day basis a week or month can change a lot  In order not to stick with stocks that stop outperforming  we think that rebalancing one s holdings is appropriate 
Based on our research best results were achieved by rebalancing gold stocks every 50 days and by rebalancing silver stocks every 20 days  when using the Golden Stock Ranking and the Silver Stock Ranking  This strategy has greatly outperformed the simple buy and gold approach   Finally  we can t stress the importance of proper portfolio structuring so go and visit our page on the   to learn why including various kinds of assets  not only gold and silver  in a precious metals portfolio might be the preferred way to go ",2015-02-10,GoldTradingExperts.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-top-gold-stocks-for-2015-241456,241456
11771,233286,RGLD,Gold  A New Year  But A Long Road To Recovery,opinion,"One day up  251 days to go  And Gold s first trading day of the year yesterday  Friday  was exemplary of Long positions being initiated even in the face of a surging Dollar Index  which of its own accord leapt out of the 2015 chute to close at a level  91 383  not seen since 2005  Gold did not open the year with a huge up day  closing just seven points higher from 2014 s final 1183 settle  at 1190  But it was the conviction on Gold s BuySide to which we took heart  especially as the S P 500 s fireworks opening comprehensively fizzled out  A telling theme perhaps for the year ahead  out of worthless paper and into substantive wealth  Wouldn t that be lovely  Although one trading day does not a year make  so as to share with you the buying conviction in the Gold trade  the following chart is the full first session of 2015 as charted by volume  each  candle  in the series representing 2 500 Gold contracts traded  Red candles represent net selling and green candles net buying  And look at the buying power across the center of the chart during the 07 00 hour  Pacific Time   price pounding higher with one green candle after another  That s what we call  Big Boy Buyin   right there 

So   tis a welcome start to 2015 for Gold  which was also a podium  top three  finisher as we turn to the final standings of the BEGOS Markets for 2014 

Observe the market at the top of the standings  the 1st place Bond  Its portended ruination has been anything but  And yet  one might pity the poor Bond  for  tis the stock market that gets all the headlines  the S P finishing a close 2nd place  But the Bond was the better buy   12 8   year end yield to maturity 2 749   vs  the S P s  11 5  gain  year end dividend yield 1 957  and  live  p e 29 1x     scary   Finally  contrary to popular opinion  aka   those who mimic others without actually doing the work    to round out our podium finishers in 3rd place was Gold    1 8   which also garnered the vaunted  Who Knew   award for surprisingly not going to zero   0   as would the nattering nabobs of Gold negativism have us believe  That said  I suppose one ought give some deserved due to the Gold Shorts  for had you shorted a Gold contract at the 2014 open of 1204 5 and bought it back at the 2014 close of 1183 2  you d have made  2 130  a 48  gain on  4 400 requisite margin      congratulations  have a banana  If instead you d gone Long one Bond contract  you d have made  15 626  a far more impressive 676  gain on  2 310 requisite margin   To wit  a well known investment bank is currently pushing its Bond products under the slogan   Boring is the new Exciting   Still  all that said  we ll stick with Gold  thank you very much 
And as we next turn to Gold s weekly bars  their track is essentially that for the entirety of 2014  plus yesterday  Per the rightmost blue dots  the Long parabolic trend now has five weeks under its belt and 43 points of wiggle room with which to play  But as mentioned a week ago   as well as in the website s Prescient Commentary   Gold s negatively positioned daily Price Oscillator has a Market Rhythm Target of 1164  such that we re prepared to tolerate some near term retrenchment  ideally to again be met with further buying conviction similar to that which we saw yesterday  and thus keep the Long trend alive 

Again in lending support to the notion that Gold has become thoroughly  sold out   as most recently described a week ago via the dominate up thrust of price s  mega days   and as shown above with this year s opening BuySide conviction  let s revisit our broadest measure  price vis   vis its 300 day moving average  Here we ve the daily tracks of the two for the last 10 years to date  and in viewing them on a logarithmic scale  the downside bent of the average appears to be flattening out 

Returning to the one year time frame  with the passing of another month   tis time to bring up Gold s year over year percentage track and compare it to those of the Gold Bugs Index   HUI    the Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index   XAU    the exchange traded fund for miners   GDX   and the ever rollickin  royalty company Royal Gold   RGLD    One might say the underlying equities entities are gathering strength toward surpassing Gold itself to the upside  their Golden lava beginning to rumble 

Now  as we move on to Gold s daily bars with their  Baby Blues  indicative of 21 day linear regression trend consistency  we ve a special New Year s treat for you  A valued reader recently wrote in expressing a preference for the three month display of the following graphic over the one month display  We generally present those displays interchangeably as to whether we re stressing the overall ebb and flow of the blue dots  or zooming in on  the now   But in this case for kicking off the new year  we ve blown the doors off the graphic to show the full year over year view  Successful trading is 50  borne of getting direction correct and 50  borne of judicious cash management  And as you can see below  trading with the rising or falling direction of the baby blue dots shall generally put one in good stead of trend  prudent account management being in the balance  As many of you know  the three month views of the Baby Blues for all eight of the BEGOS Markets are updated daily at the website  however in celebrating the arrival of 2015  here for your New Year s viewing pleasure  is Gold s entire year over year display 

Next   twould not be apropos to commence the New Year without regard to Gold s pricing structure  So here we go with the defined strata  indicative of the terrific amount of upside work facing Gold  And just to get price back up into  The Floor   Gold would have to record an above average year  the average annual change in price over the last 14 years is  12 293   which would find Gold settling this year at just 1329  Gold s best year of the past 14 was 2007 in which it finished  31 348   to repeat that performance in 2015 would put price by year s end at 1554    still in  The Floor   But we d gladly take it 
for sure

 But mmb  your opening scoreboard says Gold outta be 2460 right now  
And so  twill come to pass  Squire   tis simply  the when  and conservatively approaching  then  with a reasonable analytical assessment  To round out 2015 somewhere within  The Floor  as shown above would be an admirable achievement  As for price moving up and beyond 2000  toward becoming commensurate with currency debasement  2460 is hardly far fetched  for surely as price has fallen by as many as 793 points from Gold s All Time High  1923  in just over three years  so can it return back up with like swiftness  even more acceleratively so   Tis happened before   for example the 755  rise in less than four years from 102 in  76 to 873 in  80  to repeat same from here puts price at 8993  just in case you re scoring at home   Nevertheless  in our taking a collective deep breath  let s turn to the present and the 10 day Market Profiles for both Gold on the left and Silver on the right  their respective trading supporters and resistors as therein labeled 

Thus  with the trading battles of 2015 and Gold s long road to recovery underway  we ll wrap it up here with these two notes 
1  EuroCurrencies  Within the context of the Dollar Index s having closed yesterday at a 10 year high  the  uro in turn has lurched down to a 4 1 2 year low  as the FinMedia put it     on clear indications that the European Central Bank will soon embark on outright money printing     Naturally  neither you nor I are surprised by this  for  tis been inevitable all along  and moreover  twill in due course recur here StateSide as well  But the real eye catcher yesterday was the Swiss Franc returning to parity against the Dollar  How cool is that  You can now embark on that ski vacation to glorious Gstaad and not have to do math as CHF1 now    1  The rub  of course  it that what costs one Dollar here will set you back multiple Francs on your alpine adventure  For example  the tumbling Oil price may have our cost for one gallon of gasoline averaging  2 22  but CHF2 22 will barely buy you a litre s worth en Suisse  the one gallon equivalent there will run you CHF6 81  which of course at parity   6 81   Best to take the train 
2  California  Only our silly little State could come up with this  The powers that be are now requiring new chicken cage standards that allow sufficient space for the hens to move about  stretch their wings  and so forth  What s next for our poultry pals  Driver s licenses  Don t laugh  beginning yesterday  illegals  I m sorry   undocumented immigrants   can officially apply for them  the Department of Motor Vehicles bringing on more than 1 000 additional workers to handle the demand  I tell ya folks  in a State  indeed a world  that has gone certifiably stoopid  I hope you re stackin  plenty of Gold   tis the smart thing to do ",2015-01-05,Mark Mead Baillie,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold:-a-new-year,-but-a-long-road-to-recovery-237340",237340

11773,233288,RGLD,Gold Gets Another Reason To Rise,opinion,"The  Big News  presently making the rounds is the  Big Drop  in StateSide payroll creation for the month of March  the number  126 000  being some 50  below that anticipated by expert economists coast to coast  et alia  More revelation on that in a moment  but first  the  Big News   round here is that in having passed March s end  and now already being a few trading days into April  we ve still a Precious Metals  component of the BEGOS Markets that is leading their 2015 performances  and by quite a margin at that  Hats off once more to Sister Silver  Here are the year to date Standings through the abbreviated trading week ending Thursday  02 April  And comparatively  what a difference a year makes  eh 

In fact  one arguably might restate the S P 500 from being  0 4  to instead being  0 6  given yesterday s  Friday s  sharp post payrolls selloff in the S P futures  the equities markets themselves being closed   come Monday  we ll see how  twill all being resolved  Gold  too  was closed Friday  however in trading via the Rupee earlier today in India s Saturday bullion market  the yellow metal closed higher such as to approximately translate to a Dollar price of 1221  up from Thursday s GLOBEX settle of 1203 
And rightly ought the slowing payrolls  data resolve positively for Gold  for specific to this  unexpected   really   decline in payroll growth  consider the following  if  tis the mandate of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to put out the best number up with which it can come    and given that 126 000 was all that could be mustered    it seems to give justification to the rampant pullback we ve been witnessing in the Economic Barometer since its having peaked almost four months ago on 11 December 

Why even the persistent FinMedia flag waving is suddenly sensing it  one of their headlines this past week noting that  America s economy is starting to see cracks     Moreover  with respect to an  expected  interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve Bank  the clarion cry for the increase s coming in  June   is now morphing into  September   Further  in speaking yesterday on separate occasions with two of our essentially charter readers  both said  Not this year   Yet in spite of it all   twas reported during the week  per the National Association for Business Economics  that a panel of business economists are predicting robust growth for the U S  economy this year  We re not sure of that at which they re looking  but their economic brethren certainly just fell pell mell into the payrolls  pothole  Nice work 
Whilst the stock market on balance has ignored the above Econ Baro s plummeting  Gold  despite its on going flip flipping across the 1200 level   is maintaining a bid  and is showing signs of again trading in inverse correlation to the S P  Here are their respective percentage tracks from one month ago to date   the green S P line not incorporating Friday s plunge  given that Gold was closed and thus could not comparatively react  

Indeed  seeing the StateSide economy s running out of puff  expectations of a mediocre Q1 Earnings Season  and the spectre lurking out there of an interest rate rise  is it just me  or are you too  hearing more whispers of  correction  for the stock market  To be sure  the S P has not closed 10  below any all time high achieved since 04 December 2012  In fact  we would caution your sharing this next graphic with your friendly neighbourhood stockbroker   in the interest of their cardiac health   Here below are the 3 584 daily closes of the S P 500 from millennium to date  when the line is red  the Index is at least 10  below whatever its all time high has been to that date  Scary  non 

As to the past week  Gold again proved to be resilient  albeit first getting hammered right out of the chute on Monday  but then recovering in full through Thursday   again at this Saturday writing  not able to react to Friday s March payrolls  data report after which the S P futures went  1 0    But the poor payrolls  growth is another reason for Gold to rise  And  as mentioned earlier  today s trading via the Rupee is suggesting a pop to 1221  which if confirmed when markets re open in the new week means the parabolic Short trend in the below chart of Gold s year over year weekly bars is becoming short lived  as price would rise toward eclipsing the declining red dots 

Again year over year  here next are the percentage performances of Gold alongside those of its equities groupings  namely the HUI  Gold Bugs Index   the XAU  Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index   ARCA GDX  the exchange traded fund of senior miners  and NASDAQ RGLD  the oft rollickin  royalty company Royal Gold   Across the slate  hardly impressive  indeed rather depressive  performances 

That being said  we re getting some nicer near term perking up in Gold s  Baby Blues   On the left in the following two panel graphic we ve Gold s daily bars for three months to date with the blue dots    which depict 21 day linear regression trend consistency    continuing their ascent  On the right is Gold s 10 day Market Profile  with just some wee resistance at 1205  and support at 1198  1187 and 1172 

For our final graphic  from the  Facing the Facts Dept    since Gold s All Time High of 1923 on 06 September 2011  the below overall Structure Chart remains hum drum glum  But we ve added thereon a few white lines that point toward the high 1200s to mid 1300s as major hurdle area above which to reach  The conditions are ripe to so do   debasement  repatriation  geo jitters  waning economies leading to more monetary stimulus  etc   It does beg the question  which will be the first investment bank to comment upon their  lightening up on equities exposure and shifting at least a bit more portfolio monies into Gold   It shan t take much more than that to turn the tide as the others then pile on 

Now in parting  here are three quick notes 
1  We read this past week that during March  companies struggled in China and on balance across Asia  the notion being a resorting to more stimulus from their respective central banks  Bring it on

11774,233289,RGLD,Ralph Aldis  Gold Mining Success Lies in Proper Capital Allocation,opinion," The proper use of capital allocation is to maximize long term value per share   That s according to Ralph Aldis  USGI s resident gold expert and  since 2001  portfolio manager of our two precious metals funds In a recent  interview with Kevin Michael Grace  Ralph expresses his thoughts on what s moving Gold prices today and also singles out some of his favorite companies in the gold  silver and royalty spaces  More important  however  Ralph argues that for gold mining companies to succeed  they need to practice prudent capital allocation and know the proper value of their assets  Below are some highlights from the interview  Q  The price of gold is flirting with a five year low  Do you attribute this solely to the strength of the U S  dollar  or are there other factors at work  A  There are other factors  Most important is the strength of the equity markets  Looking at a six year window  we have seen  for the third time in the last hundred years  the highest returns for such a period  This happened before in 1929 and 1999  These phenomenal returns have been fueled not by fundamentals but rather by the U S  Federal Reserve  which is trying to jump start the economy  All this has taken people s eyes off gold  but it won t go on forever  Q  How do you see the mining industry adjusting to lower gold prices   A  I look at the income statements from all the mining companies and calculate their breakeven point  Right now  it is about  1 149 per ounce  The forecasted average 2015 gold price remains about  1 200 an ounce  If the gold price continues to fall  companies will adjust  Some projects won t be built  but that is good because those are marginal projects  About 40 CEOs in the mining industry have lost their jobs in the past couple of years  The new generation of mining CEOs is focused more on profit than growth  They know that even if the gold price falls more  the suppliers to them must drop their prices  If the gold price goes  100 per ounce lower  the smart companies will survive  Meanwhile  gold miners now benefit from lower energy prices  while the stronger U S  dollar has been very positive for Canadian and Australian miners  Q  Why do you believe gold stocks can still deliver favorable returns  A  Because of the mindset of some of these new CEOs  One company doing the right things is Klondex Mines Ltd   TO KDX   It was up 29 percent in 2013  while the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDXJ  was down 61 percent  In 2014  Klondex was up 21 percent  while the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF was down 23 percent  Klondex is my favorite junior producer anywhere  Some people might say it has a short life resource statement  but the recent discoveries at Fire Creek are not yet in the resource statement  And the free cash flow it generates will pay for its exploration program at Midas  I expect more discoveries from Klondex and a bigger resource statement  Its very robust ore body will allow it to produce gold at even lower prices  should the market demand that  I talk to its management team  and they understand capital allocation  Q  Could you explain the  and how they pertain to mining  given that mining companies typically have no revenues for years after their founding  A  These five principles are the work of a Credit Suisse writer  Michael Mauboussin  They apply to some companies in the exploration and development phase but obviously more so to producers 
The first principle is  Zero Based Capital Allocation   This means  for instance  that you don t give your exploration department  20 million this year solely because they received  20 million last year  Companies need a strategy to determine the proper amount of capital spending 
The second principle is  Fund Strategies  Not Projects   In other words  capital allocation is not about assessing and approving projects  it is about assessing and approving strategies and then determining the projects that support those strategies  It is a common mistake for explorers to continue to push a project forward particularly if it is its only project even though it lacks the potential for great returns  Rangold Resources  NASDAQ GOLD  is a good example of the proper approach  When it evaluates a project  it s looking for grade sufficiently high that it can produce a good margin at a  1 000 pit shell or even an  800 pit shell  Restricting your return calculation to the pit shell is more conservative  as you are only including those ounces contained within the mine s engineering plan 
Number three is  No Capital Rationing   Typically  miners believe that capital is scarce but free  They believe that profits are free money  or if they re raising equity  they sometimes don t seem to care enough about dilution  Properly speaking  capital is plentiful but expensive  Profits need to be spent in a manner that results in future profitability  And equity financing is only plentiful if you have a good project 
Number four is  Zero Tolerance for Bad Growth   In other words  don t throw good money after bad  Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  fell into that trap with its Pascua Lama project in Argentina  Long before its price tag reached  8 5 billion  the company should have thought hard about whether it would ever generate good returns  Mining companies should always seek to upgrade their portfolios 
Number five is  Know the Value of Assets and Be Ready to Take Action to Create Value   So many people in the mining industry don t know the value of their assets  We value companies based on their resource statements  and we get a very high correlation to where these stocks trade  But we constantly see companies decide to spend  for example   1 8 billion on a project that the market values at only  800 million  It makes no sense to spend that much because similar projects could be acquired for less capital 
Q  What s your favorite gold producer elsewhere in the world  A  I like Mandalay Resources Corporation  TO MND   Its management is very experienced in rescuing assets that have been mismanaged  Mandalay has turned around the Cerro Bayo silver gold mine in Chile and the Costerfield gold antimony mine in Australia  Last year  it bought the Bj rkdal gold mine in Sweden from Elgin Mining  and I think Mandalay will turn that around too  Management owns a lot of stock  Mandalay pays a healthy dividend  5 4 percent  The market has not yet completely woken up yet to this stock  We still think it s easily a 100 percent gain  It s one of our top five holdings  Q  What s your favorite royalty company  A  Osisko Gold Royalties  TO OR  probably has the safest royalties  It has a lot of room to grow but not so much as to draw the attention of Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD  or Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   One of the advantages Osisko Gold Royalties has is that its assets are not dependent on other commodities  Franco Nevada has oil exposure  and maybe oil prices don t go up very soon  Royal Gold has base metal exposure in some of its assets  and if prices of those were to drop tremendously  some of its assets could be shuttered  Osisko doesn t have those worries  Disclosure  Gold  precious metals  and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic  political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme  The prices of gold  precious metals  and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies  We suggest investing no more than 5  to 10  of your portfolio in these sectors  There is no guarantee that the issuers of any securities will declare dividends in the future or that  if declared  will remain at current levels or increase over time  Fund portfolios are actively managed  and holdings may change daily  Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter end  Holdings in the Gold and Precious Metals Fund and World Precious Minerals Fund as a percentage of net assets as of 12 31 2014  Barrick Gold Corp 0 00   Elgin Mining 0 00   Falco Resources Ltd  World Precious Minerals 0 01    Franco Nevada Corp  Gold and Precious Metals Fund 6 97   World Precious Minerals Fund 1 32    Klondex Mines Ltd  Gold and Precious Metals Fund 10 00   World Precious Minerals Fund 9 78    Mandalay Resources Corp  Gold and Precious Metals Fund 3 38   World Precious Minerals Fund 2 28    Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF 0 00   Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM    Gold and Precious Metals Fund 1 05   World Precious Minerals Fund 0 22    Osisko Gold Corp 0 00   Randgold Resources  LONDON RRS  Ltd   Gold and Precious Metals Fund 2 30   World Precious Minerals Fund 1 43    Royal Gold Inc   Gold and Precious Metals Fund 5 99   World Precious Minerals Fund 1 51    Silver Wheaton Corp  Gold and Precious Metals Fund 1 36   World Precious Minerals Fund 0 45    Virginia Mines  Inc   Gold and Precious Metals Fund 1 14   World Precious Minerals Fund 10 35     The S P 500 Stock Index is a widely recognized capitalization weighted index of 500 common stock prices in U S  companies  All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the link s  above  you will be directed to a third party website s   U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by this these website s  and is not responsible for its their content ",2015-04-12,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ralph-aldis:-gold-mining-success-lies-in-proper-capital-allocation-248083,248083

11789,233304,RGLD,Will Gold Shock The Bears ,opinion,"I think we have an interesting setup in gold and silver here  Back in May  after a 2 month decline  gold pulled a fast one on the bears and surged higher producing a fake breakdown  But that surge petered out and gold topped in July  then went on another 2 month decline into September  I would say that the bearishness on gold this time around feels pretty similar to the bearishness into May 
The key difference between these gold declines too has been the dollar  In the previous decline  the US Dollar was muted  just drifting sideways  I think the dollar rally from May though effectively capped the gold rally and caused gold to drift lower after it topped in July 
But now we have an FOMC statement that I believe will be dovish  and given the fact that the dollar has rallied so much  I think commodities in general are in position to rally off of Fed news  They re simply at a sentiment extreme that could be unwound with a bullish impetus 
If you look at GDXJ below you can see some strong accumulation days on volume  3 of them in fact in the last 4 trading sessions  This is also following a 15 million share puke out in early September  Plus Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  ARCA GDXJ  continues to outperform SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD   all year I might add  And GDXJ can quickly get back above the 50 and 200 dma  causing the trend following funds to get back on board the long side 

I d also note that strong gold stocks like Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   Tahoe Resources Inc  NYSE TAHO   Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   and even Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   continue to make higher highs  and higher lows  Finally there were notable surges in junior miners this week including DRDGOLD Limited  NYSE DRD   Tanzanian Royalty Exploration Corp  AMEX TRX   Lake Shore Gold Corp   AMEX LSG   International Tower Hill Mines Ltd  AMEX THM   Allied Nevada Gold Corp  AMEX ANV   Golden Star Resources  AMEX GSS   and Asanko Gold Inc  AMEX AKG   some of them on heavy volume  I could be completely wrong but things could get interesting to the upside tomorrow ",2014-09-17,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-gold-shock-the-bears-226082,226082
11790,233305,RGLD,Stealth Gold Stock Rally,opinion,"Well  the headlines are rightfully bearish for gold  silver and the major precious metals stock indexes  ETFs and senior gold miners   The technical damage is real  Yesterday s burst could be and probably was just short covering    edit  post was mostly written before the end of day flop 
But improbably enough  there is a stealth uptrend going on in certain royalties  miners  developers and explorers   Believe me  if you could hear me talk instead of write you would not hear anything resembling desperation in my tone   That is because I have worked hard during this bear market to manage risk  stay strong and out of the bear s way   So I am not talking any sort of a book here other than my biggest picture view  an economic contraction environment that ultimately benefits the counter cyclical gold sector   which could still be out on the horizon 
Don t take my word for it  here s  definition of an uptrend 
 Describes the price movement of a financial asset when the overall direction is upward  A formal uptrend is when each successive peak and trough is higher than the ones found earlier in the trend  

Graphic   Investopedia
Complicated it s not 
The following charts are what they are  in up trends   and considering that legions of gold bugs have now sworn off the promoters and puked up gold for good  the time is nearing that this sector will again be investment worthy   At the very least  I for one am going to point out positives along with the ample negatives   Just so we keep a level playing field and an unbiased viewpoint 
We reviewed a condition on HUI s weekly chart in an update the other day for instance   It s a lower probability thing  but if it were to manifest it would rip the shorts  heads off   Picture it  they d be running around headless  bumping into each other  falling down  getting up again  until they realize they too are dead from shorting something that everybody already knew was left for dead  except for whoever has been buying these charts since last year

But before one calls the local garbage collection agency for delivery of that scavenger box into which to discard one s Gold  Silver  Copper  Oil  Swiss Francs  Euros  Stocks and Bonds  prudence ought be accorded the potential duration of such aforementioned economic excellence  given  a nation of coast to coast part time jobs  environment roadblocks that can limit energy production let alone the geo political ramifications of one day no longer importing Oil from various emirates et alia  and a Dollar getting its due only on the backs of other flailing fiat facsimiles  Whether it takes a year s time for it all to unravel  or merely that of a week  I certainly would hold onto my Gold   Stock market indices are  of course  another story  in overhearing a FinMedia TV reporter ask an analyst if they d buy on this dip  my own mumbled shot from the hip response was to certainly at least consider so doing should such dip reach  50     but then as you already know  a few of us old fuddy duddies still value stocks the old fashioned way  by earnings  
For the present  Gold s Short trend as described below by the declining parabolic red dots continues to persevere in this year over year view of the weekly bars  In settling out yesterday  Friday  at 1191  Gold made a new low for the year after all   the prior low having been 1203 back on 02 January   with 2013 s low of 1180 but a spittoon s distance away 

But if you re looking for a silver lining in the above graphic  note just over the purple lines that define what has become the 1240 1280 resistance zone  the thin dashed line which is essentially flat across the breadth of the entire chart  That is the linear regression trendline of all the weekly closes  and in observing the deviative distances of price above and below that dashed line  one might opine   tis time to end this annoying decline   and send those deviant Shorts a packin   
Speaking of silver linings  indeed lacking thereof  is Sister Silver  To be beaten down from having been Cinderella as once adorned in her precious metal pinstripes and sent back to the factory to toil away in her industrial metal jacket is one thing  But now  tis worse  for she s since been fired  left to sit today in her tattered togs out in some back alley  as cold as snow and at a four year low  Silver traded down to 16 640 yesterday  her lowest level since 26 March 2010  Here s her parabolic weekly bars structure from a year ago to date 

Fear not  Sister Silver  I want you  just as do many others 
 I love you too Sister Silver  
See there  the gallant chivalry of our very own Squire   no doubt angling for a Princedom upon Sister Silver s return to resplendence  respect and radiance   But for leadership thereto  we look to Gold and assess its year to date price track vis   vis the 300 day moving average  And clearly  the one true monetary asset of Planet Earth since time immemorial is hardly the happy camper these days 

Oh  quit pouting for pity s sake  Our modest calculation for your own  book value  today is already around  2 100 oz   Tis just that you re ridiculously under owned at the moment  What you need is a new publicity agent   me  I guess   not to mention a currency shock or two and you ll become embraced by households from Bangalore to Beverly Hills  Indeed speaking of household names  Lorenzo Bini Smaghi   ex Governing Council member of the European Community Bank   is on record that the central bank s survival is now dependent on the  uro further weakening  or as he succinctly said it  that the ECB  accept that QE is the only answer left   And who is it that  at the end of the day  we ve provably claimed plays no currency favourites   Tis you  King Gold  So buck up 
 Course  the headlines these days are rife with the Dollar s having become the  currency of choice   reaching its highest level in almost two years against the  uro   Tis said that the EuroZone s malaise of stagnation may be around for some time to come as its economy is losing momentum heading into Q4  Meanwhile on the other side of the world  China s key PMI manufacturing measure is barely above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction  Their People s Bank is fresh into its  500 million injection of QE  Our Federal Reserve Bank is all but done with QE  at least until its next such spree  For the Dollar s being the  currency of choice   such tease is not to see the forest for the trees  Having to fork over  1 04 for a lousy Swiss Franc today when they used to be 25  is not what I d call  Dollar strength   But the present state of inclination is certainly negative for  everything else   To wit  here for the last three months we ve the Swiss Franc and Gold  their  80   Baby Blues  levels indicative of the respective 21 day linear regression trends being absolutely down 

 Note to those of you sitting on the Gold bid at zero   0    the above price decline at a pace of 50 points per month ought see you filled in just about two year s time to the day  
Indeed  right on time given seasonality  volatility for most of the BEGOS markets as enumerated in our second paragraph is ramping up  the only exception actually being in the precious metals  Here we next compare the robust movement in the S P to the rather lackluster ranginess of Gold  Below are those markets  expected daily trading ranges   EDTR  from a year ago to date  Note how the S P s range is typically up to where  twas a year ago  but how comparatively subdued the Gold trade is  lot s of  caution  there with respect to Gold  for the Specs can only Short it so far   

Nonetheless  Gold s also being down near term is no more starkly represented than by its 10 day Market Profile along with that for Silver  The white bar near the foot of each profile is yesterday s bottom fishing settle 

Finally  as we ve crossed into the month of October  here we ve the usual year over year view of Gold itself alongside the Gold Bugs Index  HUI   Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index  XAU   the exchange traded fund for the miners  Market Vectors Gold Miners  ARCA GDX    and hardly alongside  the royalty company Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   whose unabashed out performance is in response to attractively structured long term financing arrangements 

As we ve quipped in the past  to trade RGLD gives Gold itself the illusion of being a savings account   which broadly  tis    but  tis its futures leverage that counts  luv  
In closing out this week s missive as characterized by lows and woes  we turn to a LaForge and a Lewis 
With respect to  lows   there s John LaForge   priceless name for a precious metals strategist   who sees Gold  660 oz  on the radar in making a comparison 1  from the price spike during 1980 up into the  800 oz  area before declining by some 65   to 2  Gold s run during 2011 up into the  1 900 oz  area and thus a projected decline of like percentage  We politely disagree with such a similar decline  our not viewing the events as fundamentally comparable   given the gazillions more global faux dough today  
With respect to  woes   the managing director of the upscale UK retailer known as John Lewis says France is  finished  as nation into which one ought invest  further describing Paris  Gare du Nord  from where one commutes back to London  as  the squalor pit of Europe   Andy Street has since apologized from what was quite the anti France tirade    and as much as you know that we  i e  the royal oui  adore France    he wasn t completely off the mark  Still  let us give la R publique its due  as of mid year  per the World Gold Council  France ranks fifth in the world in total holdings of Gold tonnage  outranking the combined holdings of China and India   Allons enfants de la Patrie  indeed  Now if we can get the price of Gold to also allons  we ll have the whole package ",2014-10-07,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fresh-gold-lows-and-silver-woes-228131,228131
11792,233307,RGLD,Gold Miners Tell A Different Story,opinion,"A few weeks ago I noted that Gold stocks were either crazy or right  because they were continuing to hold up despite gold and silver prices coming under pressure   Many gold stocks have taken a lot of damage since then and silver broke through support  but the gold and Silver miners still are holding up much better than you would expect 
I believe this continues to speak for the gold bear market being closer to an end than most people realize   Let s take a look at some charts of mining stocks and see 

Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV  I think is the cleanest example of this   I included the price labels to note the high and low prices for Franco on the chart  Notice that ever since the major gold bottom in the middle of 2013  Franco has traced a pattern of higher highs and higher lows   This is in the face of continued pessimism in gold and gold stocks and with gold testing its lows a few different times  including recently   Franco just continues to buck the trend in gold which I believe is the telltale sign of a gold bottom coming 

Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  has a similar chart to Franco Nevada   It made a low in mid 2013 with low in gold  then a higher low at the end of 2014  Then it has put in higher lows and higher highs in 2014 even with two failed rallies in gold 

Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG  paints a picture that I think is very important to look at   First off Goldcorp traded in a volatile sideways range in 2011 which helped foreshadow the top in gold in 2011 Then Goldcorp started making lower lows in 2012 as gold remained weak   But gold only went sideways in 2012  and notice how Goldcorp continued to underperform gold in 2012 as evidenced by the relative strength chart against gold on the bottom  This was more evidence that the gold bear market was intact in 2012 even as gold tried to break out of its range  Once gold failed in 2012  Goldcorp crashed along with gold during 2013   But notice how Goldcorp made a low at the end of 2013  and has held that low in 2014 even as gold has remained weak  This has caused the relative strength chart against gold to start drifting upward in 2014  which is what you want to see if gold was really making a final bottom here 
So if gold were really headed to new lows to conclude 2014 and into 2015  we would not expect the gold miners to have performed so well this year against gold   Instead they should have continued to amplify gold s losses on the downside  and should be trading at much lower levels relative to gold than they did in 2013   This positive divergence against gold for the gold miners is a bullish sign that you won t hear anything of from the mainstream media 
Silver miners tell a similar story to gold miners   Even with silver making another new low recently  most silver miners have outperformed silver all year and most of them are refusing to make new lows along with silver   Take a look at some silver miners below 

Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  has actually bucked the downtrend in silver since the middle of 2013  You could even say it has held up against silver going all the way back to 2012  Notice on the relative strength chart we see a pattern of higher lows and higher highs since mid 2013  meaning that Silver Wheaton is outperforming silver  This argues for the coming end to the silver bear market 


Pan American Silver Corp   NASDAQ PAAS  and Silver Standard Resources Inc   NASDAQ SSRI  have similar charts  but the main point is that they both have outperformed silver all year in 2014  They both also haven t made a new low even though silver has 
There are gold and silver stocks that have made new lows recently but most of the miners have showed major strength against gold and silver during 2014  This continued strength could be indicating that gold and silver are getting very close to ending their bear markets even as sentiment remains bearish ",2014-10-08,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-miners-tell-a-different-story-228402,228402

But seriously folks  if Gold  as we oft put forth   plays no currency favourites   should it not have soared yesterday  Friday  upon the Bank of Japan s announcing a 60  increase in its annual Bond purchase ceiling  a tripling of their exchange traded funds and real estate investment trust purchases  and a doubling of their equities purchases  That s a lot of purchases  which to be enabled necessitates a yen by the BOJ to create oodles of  en  well beyond the number of noodles in your ramen  Place scapegoat blame on falling deflationary Oil prices  but when your central bank fails to meet its bond buying goal and your government raises its consumption tax  history shows us that this ought end badly for one s economy  given Japan s being largely driven by consumer spending  as is ours StateSide   Note to Federal Reserve Bank  raise interest rates next year and then observe the effect of variable rate debt on the consumer      Yo Mabel  we re gonna hafta cut back on those Saturday night dinners down at Patty s Pork Palace     Pass the Bone Suckin  Sauce  please 
In any event  the BOJ is now poised to ultimately add hundreds of trillions of  en to the global money supply in the face of an essentially fixed global Gold supply   especially given the subdued mining activity these last couple of years   But a bad  en yields to a bodacious Buck  the Dollar Index thus rising yesterday to as high as 87 245  a level not seen since our San Francisco Giants won their first World Series   let alone now their third   back in 2010  Yet Dollar Bulls take heed  your Index is closing in on where it peaked both in March 2009  89 710  and in June 2010  89 100   Moreover  here at 87 055  said Dollar Index is now just a mere 47  below its all time high of 164 720 from February 1985 
 Well that s not very impressive for the Dollar when you put it that way  mmb    
Of course  tis not  Squire  and that s exactly the point  But once again  there s currently that investing impetus which fosters  Dollar strength   when combined with our own Fed s termination of Quantitative Easing   being reported upon as if the latter s demise wasn t already priced into Gold   saw the yellow metal get royally slammed down as much as  3 2  yesterday alone  the intra day low of 1161 being its nethermost level since 29 July 2010  As for the increase in the Dollar Index  we naturally view this in part as a transactional shift from one bow wow currency     into another      and obviously thus remain fully on deck for the fundamental flight from such dog currencies at large into the consummate currency  Gold  And I wouldn t be discouraged a wit from buying more Gold right now  even if cognizant that the negative technicals could well bring us lower still  for presently  Gold is now WAY oversold as we ll herein unfold  But first  to Gold s Weekly Bars and the accelerating negative pull on the parabolic Short trend 

On a percentage basis   twas Gold s worst losing week since that ending 28 June 2013  and on a points basis since that ending 13 September 2013   Lot s of 13s for you superstitious WestPalmBeachers down there   However  let us proceed with three specific examples as to why we see that Gold is now WAY oversold 
Gold Oversold Part Un  The following two panel chart shows us just how downside overcooked Gold got yesterday  The left hand panel is Gold s full 24 hour Friday session   which here in the Pacific time zone runs from 15 00 Thursday through 14 15 Friday   The right hand panel is the same time frame for the S P 500 futures   Spoo    On the Gold panel at left  please observe the horizontal red line  which we  fix  on the chart before the trading session begins  Familiar to those who follow the Market Ranges page at the website  the red line is the  expected low  for Gold s session should it be a down day  talk about  going over the line   Gold exceeded the red line by  2 3   Moreover  the Dollar Index only exceeded its  high if an up day line  by  0 6   Which in turn for the Spoo panel at right is its green horizontal line  the S P topping out essentially at its  expected high  for an up session  Further  see the gold coloured line near the very top of the Gold panel  That s its Market Magnet from which price rarely strays a great distance  contrarily  the S P s Market Magnet was so low coming into Friday  1936    tis not even remotely close to showing on the chart   suggesting  naturally  that the S P is terrifically overbought  

Gold Oversold Part Deux  So  having mentioned the Market Magnets for both Gold and the Spoo  here they are side by side for the last three months to date  In both panels  the smoother line is the Market Magnet   the current reading in the box   and the oscillator in both panels  lower portions represents price less magnet  For these two markets  price is at an extreme distance from magnet 

Gold Oversold Part Trois  Similarly over these three months  here are Gold and the Spoo vis   vis their smooth  pearly valuation lines   the oscillators in this case being price less valuation   The valuation line represents a product s price movements relative to those that comprise the five  primary  BEGOS Markets  Bond   Euro   Gold   Oil   S P  as they all interactively respond to one another  On the left for Gold  its valuation line is actually flattening  the oscillator getting near that  50 extreme  whilst on the right for the S P  its valuation line is curling southward  with the oscillator at an upside extreme  And yes  we remain on  crash watch  for the S P  especially given its recent dip was not even a full  10  

So there s no question that yesterday upon price s getting rip snort bashed upside the head   just short of being served up with a side of fries   that Gold is now WAY oversold  Yet when viewed below on a month over month basis versus the SpooMonster  Gold is just  2  and the S P just  2  as shown  the yellow metal nonetheless in full embarrassing blush  if not oversold rage 

Admittedly  from the  We Were Worried This Might Happen Dept     tis obligatory to again bring up the year over year chart of Gold s daily bars  which are green when the daily Price Oscillator study is positive  and red when negative  And as much as we deplore the notion of going Short Gold  the right most red bar would have had one Short from the get go yesterday  for as you can see in the oscillator at the foot the chart  it confirmed turning negative  red arrow  as of Thursday s close 

At this time just a week ago  Gold was sporting the steepest 21 day linear regression uptrend line of all eight BEGOS markets   the three  secondary  ones not cited earlier being the Swiss Franc  Silver and Copper   Now you might consider a dosage of meclizine ahead of viewing this next moving  literally  chart  Commencing from Friday a week ago when Gold was 1231 through yesterday s close at 1174  here s how this 21 daily bars chart progressed  along with the diagonal trend line and  Baby Blues  representative of trend consistency  it all falling  round our queasy friend down there 

Next to Gold s 10 day Market Profile we go  along with that on the right for Sister Silver  who s had to hock her precious metal pinstripes at the local pawnbroker for a roll of phony feeling El Cheapo quarters in order to eat  The red bars are the two markets  respective Friday rounded settles 

Finally  as the calendar has flipped to November  here we ve the year over year view of Gold alongside its maniacally struggling Precious Metals Equity Buddies  those being the Gold Bugs Index   HUI    Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index     XAU      the exchange traded fund of mining companies   Market Vectors Gold Miners  ARCA GDX    and the always alacritive royalty company Royal Gold   RGLD    And again to quote Sheriff J  W  Pepper from his face to face conversation with a baby Thai elephant in the 1974 Eon Productions film  The Man With The Golden Gun   putting it in perspective for the Gold equities   Man    you is ugly     following which the good sheriff was summarily shunted by the elephant into Bangkok s Chao Phraya River  

So hopefully you ve gleaned why we presently see Gold   albeit not for the first time   as WAY oversold 
Next week s 260th presentation of The Gold Update with be the Fifth Anniversary Edition  Over these five years  we ve written on occasion that our biggest concern toward thwarting Gold s natural rise with rampant foundationless currency creation would be a deflationary depression  characterized by shrinking asset values  Japan is fighting this as is the EuroZone  all the while flooding their respective central banks with assets purchased by magic money  StateSide  we ve so stopped  for the present  and one has to only look at one s checkbook ledger to see that we re inflationarily spending more at the store for the same basket of goods than we did a year before  One might therefore conclude that globally  economies are actually in a confused state of  deinflation   But soon the Dollar tumblers shall again rumble as interest rates backing up stab their ep e into the economy and the rise in our M2 money supply shall be on the move once again  as we envision shall be the price of Gold  To which end we re adding a new opening featuring to The Gold Update starting with next week s landmark edition  And I think you ll like what you see    ",2014-11-04,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-gold-oversold-now-231244,231244
11795,233310,RGLD,A Surging Gold Stock And Some Other Thoughts,opinion,"Richmont Mines Inc   AMEX RIC  is in a textbook  beautfiful Stage 2 breakout   First it broke out of the base on huge volume  then retested the base during the October gold stock washout   It held up extremely well during the washout  which was a sign that it would be a leading stock once that extreme selling ended   And right on cue it broke out again on huge volume   Textbook action the way it retested the Stage 1 base and 30 week moving average again after the breakout before surging higher 

The second chart that greatly interests me is of Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV    FNV has made 4 higher lows now during each of the 4 major buy points in mining stocks over the last year  June 2013  December 2013  June 2014  October 2014    This is incredible action and I ve been saying for a while is an indication the gold bear market is getting late in the tooth   Furthermore I think FNV is now setting up for a monster breakout out of this cup formation that it has created over the past couple years   What s also very noteworthy is how quickly it has recaptured the October panic lows 

Quite a few other gold stocks have already recaptured all of their October panic levels and then some   These include Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   AuRico Gold Inc   NYSE AUQ   Exeter Resource Corporation  AMEX XRA   Nevsun Resources Ltd   AMEX NSU   and Gold Fields Limited  NYSE GFI  
I continue to hear comments that the commodity supercycle is over which is ironic because I didn t hear that kind of sentiment when commodities topped in 2011   Bullishness at the top  bearishness at the bottom  a cycle that will probably never end but will offer incredible opportunities for contrarians ",2014-11-20,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-surging-gold-stock-and-some-other-thoughts-233254,233254
11806,233321,RGLD,Edward Karr  Inflate Your Way To Gold Profits,opinion,"From his vantage in Geneva  Edward Karr  the founder of the investment firm RAMPartners SA  tells The Gold Report why European bankers are destined to inflate their way out of structural crisis and why that is good news for the price of gold  Karr believes gold has bottomed and should explode upward  and he profiles a handful of sleeping lions whose stock should roar back to life with rising precious metals prices 
The Gold Report  Let s talk about the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act  FATCA  of 2010  What is the FATCA regulation 
Edward Karr  In March 2010  Congress passed the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act  The HIRE Act was intended to stimulate domestic jobs in the U S  FATCA was quietly slipped in as a very small part of the HIRE Act  In a nutshell  FATCA makes every overseas bank  financial company  hedge fund  mutual fund  broker  and dealer an enforcement agent of the U S  Internal Revenue Service  Starting July 1  2014  these financial institutions are required to turn over their data on U S  clients  and U S  persons  accounts 
Implementing FATCA is costly because many foreign financial institutions did not have the compliance systems and information technology in place to report on U S  persons  holdings  Banks are being forced to spend tens of millions of dollars to upgrade their systems  And if they do not provide the information to the U S   the penalties are extremely severe  The U S  government can levy a 30  withholding penalty on any business that the institution does in the U S   including trading U S  dollars  equities  bonds and fixed income instruments  Noncompliance effectively locks a firm out of the U S  markets 
TGR  FATCA was set up to stop people from cheating on their taxes  will it have some effect 
EK  FATCA goes after a mosquito with a sledgehammer or in mining terms  uses a D11 bulldozer to move a small pebble  There are 7 6 million  7 6M  U S  citizens living outside the U S  who are caught up in this war on tax evasion  However  an organization called Republicans Overseas is launching a constitutional challenge to FATCA lawyered by Jim Bopp  He is the attorney who took down the McCain Feingold campaign finance law in the Supreme Court  Bopp is confident that FATCA will be overturned 
TGR  Looking forward  then  what is the economic outlook in Europe for gold  commodities and stocks EK  The overall European economic outlook is the same muddle through situation that has dominated the continent for the last couple of years  slow economic growth and possible deflation  After the financial crisis of 2008 2009  the U S  proactively recapitalized the financial system in the U S  The European banks still need to be recapitalized  The European Central Bank  ECB  has done a really good job in defending the euro  but the underlying problem of high debt levels on the banks  balance sheets has not been addressed 
Greece is not really a big problem  but keep a close eye on France  It has a very slow growth rate  high debt levels and is basically an economic train wreck in slow motion  In addition  we are seeing a resurgence of ultranationalism in the polls  Europe desperately needs inflation  Deflation  of course  is a central banker s worst nightmare  The bankers need inflation to avoid deflation  The ECB is going to have to start running the money printing presses around the clock  I just see no other way out of the dilemma  The banks can only inflate their way out of their crushing debt loads  And rising  higher inflation means higher interest rates  which is very positive for the gold markets 
TGR  How will higher interest rates impact the gold markets 
EK  As inflation and interest rates rise  so does the consumer demand for gold  People buy gold as a safe haven and a store of value  I have a positive outlook for gold and gold equities as Europe recapitalizes its banking systems and the prices of precious metals explode upward 
TGR  What about banking systems in other areas of the world EK  China escaped its last financial crisis with a massive government stimulus program  As a result  China is trapped inside one of the biggest credit bubbles in the history of the human race  Some people believe that when the bubble pops there will be a very hard landing  But with the stroke of a pen  the Chinese government can address economic issues much more effectively than a bunch of European bureaucrats sitting around a table 
TGR  Will inflation hit the U S 
EK  Because the U S  banking system is in great relative shape  there will be a resurgence of domestic manufacturing  The U S  has a lot of land and has plenty of capital and technological savvy  It has abundant  cheap energy compared to the rest of the world  As the manufacturing economy takes off  inflation will gradually pick up there  too  which is positive for gold  Today s gold price of  1 319 ounce   1 319 oz  is the new base price  in my opinion  Precious metal stocks are extremely cheap right now  This is a great time to buy 
TGR  Do you have any precious metals stock picks for us today EK  I like the metal royalty companies  such as Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD  and Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   These stocks should be core positions in any portfolio  They are going to continue to do exceedingly well regardless of where the underlying precious metals prices go 
TGR  What are some of the juniors that you like 
EK  My number one pick is Pershing Gold Corpor  OTC PGLC   I have been a Pershing shareholder for a few years  and it has been exciting to watch the company develop  Pershing Gold is headed by CEO Steve Alfers  He is an experienced mining attorney with a great reputation in the U S  He is a very seasoned deal guy and has put several mines into production  Alfers stepped down as COO of Franco Nevada to become the CEO of Pershing Gold  That is a huge statement in and of its own that he would leave a functioning major to run a junior  And Alfers has assembled a phenomenal team at Pershing Gold 
TGR  What are Pershing Gold s assets 
EK  Pershing Gold s major asset is the Relief Canyon project  Relief Canyon has three open pit mines and a state of the art  fully permitted and operational heap leach facility  It is a shovel ready project  fast tracked to go into production by the end of this year 
And Pershing Gold has just announced a new discovery  which is two miles north of its three main pits  That property is very close to the border with Coeur Mining Inc s  NYSE CDE  Rochester mine  Coeur Mining is already a shareholder in Pershing Gold and knows the situation on the ground very well  This discovery is a brand new  high grade mineralization system that could very easily extend up into the Rochester mine Coeur Mining properties  Pershing Gold has already announced some drill results at very good grades 
Pershing Gold has announced a recovery rate of 81 8   Pershing is also forecasting about an 80 000 oz  80 Koz  per year production  Pershing s all in costs should come in at  750 oz 
TGR  Are there other companies operating in the same area 
EK  Pershing Gold has a northern neighbor named Midway Gold Corp   AMEX MDW   Midway Gold s Pan project is similar to Relief Canyon  The Pan project has a projected nine year mine life with 81 Koz year production  The fully loaded cost is  824 oz with a 75  recovery rate 
TGR  How do you compare the two companies 
EK  Midway had 180M shares outstanding  fully diluted  prior to its last bought deal  It recently did a financing of  25M at  0 83 share for an additional 30M shares  In addition  it had to issue 4M shares to Hale Capital Partners L P  to approve that deal  If we add that to the  55M in project financing that Midway arranged at the end of May  there is an enterprise value on Midway Gold right now of  235M  This compares with Pershing Gold s debt free current market cap of approximately  108M  I fully expect Pershing s market cap to trade up in line with Midway s in the future  I really like Midway and the Pan project  but I love Pershing Gold and Relief Canyon  Pershing Gold is one of the most undervalued and exciting Nevada gold exploration and near term production stories on the market today 
TGR  Pershing has 25 000 acres around the Relief Canyon mine  What s the role of the Bureau of Land Management  BLM  in regard to its operation EK  Pershing is moving into fast track permitting right now  It has the permits needed  The company is in constant contact with the BLM  and that process is moving forward at a very fast pace 
TGR  Do you expect to see a significant bump in Pershing Gold s share price in the short term 
EK  The discussions with the BLM to reopen the mine under either the current or the amended plan of operations could be a major catalyst  Seeing more results from the target two miles north of the main three pits could be a big catalyst  Cantor Fitzgerald issued a research report on Pershing Gold at the end of May  It put a  0 55 price target on the stock  When gold moves back up to  1 400 1 500 oz  investors will get tremendous leverage on the Pershing stock 
TGR  What about Mexico  Any juniors there that you like EK  Kootenay Silver Inc  TO KTN  has a 100 million ounce  100 Moz  Measured and Indicated silver resource at its flagship project  Promontorio  The company has a great management team in mining friendly Mexico  A while back  the stock sold off from the  0 80 share range to  0 30  Kootenay is small  with only 63M shares outstanding  If we value it at  1 oz for its proven 100 Moz deposit  we are looking at a potential  100M market cap plus its ongoing blue sky exploration opportunities  At  0 30 share with just 63M shares out  Kootenay is trading at a CA 19M market cap  As the silver market turns and heads higher  cheap companies like Kootenay will be acquired at substantial premiums 
TGR  Does Kootenay have the cash to keep operating in the interim 
EK  It has just announced a  2 5M financing at  0 30 share  That will provide enough cash to keep its exploration program well funded  while Kootenay continues to build out ounces and the market turns up 
TGR  What other gold juniors are sleeping lions EK  I am actively involved with In CoR Holdings Plc  ICR GXG   It is a natural resource holding company with several exciting ventures  including the largest sawmill in the Republic of Georgia  InCoR Holdings is listed on the GXG global exchange  which is a new Danish stock market with operational headquarters in London  The firm has a division called InCoR Technologies that is developing a  starved acid leaching  technology  SALT   This new scientific method applies to the recovery of nickel and other metals from laterite ores  including saprolite ores that are below the current cutoff grade of the conventional smelting process 
Nickel production worldwide is generally divided between primary sulphidic ores and the more weathered laterite ores  The nickel sulphidic ores are being depleted  and the costs of building and operating nickel processing plants for nickel laterites are very high and  in most cases  economically marginal given where we are today with nickel prices  That fact has caused many global development projects to be postponed 
Generally  a nickel laterite ore with a grade in the range of 1 8  nickel or higher is needed to cover costs of production  SALT presents real competitive advantages over the existing technology because its capital costs are a magnitude of order less than the high pressure acid leaching  which is the industry standard right now for the extraction of nickel from laterites  The founder and driving force of SALT is Dr  David Dreisinger  He is a professor at the University of British Columbia and one of the world s leading metallurgists  We feel that SALT is a major company maker 
But a word of caution  InCoR Holdings  as I mentioned  does trade on the GXG global exchange  We helped the company with its public listing  We are shareholders  But the stock is very illiquid at the moment  and it is a real micro cap issue  This is not a stock to chase  It is a stock to put on your radar screen and watch

11807,233322,RGLD,David H  Smith  PGMs Will Lead the Charge Of The Bulls,opinion,"Precious metals investors have endured much hardship during the recent bear market but David H  Smith  senior analyst with David Morgan s The Morgan Report  believes that another secular bull market in precious metals is already underway  In this interview with The Gold Report  Smith says that platinum group metals will lead the resurgence and have a favorable long term risk reward ratio  He outlines some PGM  gold and silver companies that can grab the bull by its horns 
The Gold Report  South African platinum group metals  PGM  miners have been plagued by a 21 week strike  which has cost those companies an estimated  2 billion in lost revenue  Is there an end in sight 
David H  Smith  It s the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end  because this is a systemic issue between the miners and companies  The companies are trying to recoup their costs because they are producing PGMs below the cost of production  whereas the miners are still not getting much money for doing a dangerous job  During that five month strike the mining companies were losing 5 000 10 000 ounces  5 000 10 000 oz  per day of production  It certainly didn t help the supply side of the equation for PGMs 
TGR  Spot platinum prices have witnessed steady support above  1 400 oz since January and roughly  1 450 oz more recently  Would an end to the strike bring with it price weakness 
DHS  Yes  because it s a buy the rumor  sell the fact situation  On the day that the strike was said to have concluded  PGM prices dropped  40 50 oz because that was the expectation  I look at it as a buying opportunity for people who believe the PGM story has upside  Both platinum and palladium are in a deficit situation but platinum is still more than  400 oz from its five year high  whereas palladium penetrated its five year high a few weeks ago  Of the two  palladium has a higher percentage profit potential  in my view  given that it can be substituted for so many of platinum s uses and yet sells for  500 600 oz less 
TGR  You have written on what you call  The Precious Metals Four   As part of that you see platinum and palladium being the frontrunners in the eventual price rebound in precious metals  Tell us more 
DHS  The precious metals four are gold  silver  platinum and palladium  Investors interested in precious metals should focus on all four even if they don t hold all of them because of how they relate to each other and how their chart patterns correlate 
My premise is that platinum and palladium and this has been documented by Sprott Asset Management  Rick Rule and several others are going to be in a long term supply deficit because the primary producers in South Africa and Russia are not going to be able to ramp up production any time soon  whereas catalytic converters  exchange traded funds and individual PGM purchases  physical metal  jewelry  continue to sharply move demand  Meanwhile  gold and silver have been in a three year cyclical bear market until just a few weeks ago when they made a large reversal on high volume in what looks to be the start of the next leg of the secular bull market in precious metals 
TGR  But the PGM market is relatively small  so one new producer can instantly change the market 
DHS  Yes  the PGM market is about 7 million ounces  7 Moz  annually for both platinum and palladium  whereas the gold market is about 80 Moz annually  The PGM market is infinitesimal  yet those metals have a lot of critical uses  It may take a little longer than I would like to reach a certain target  but the bull run in precious metals is underway and I think it s going to last a long time 
TGR  How do investors get in on the run  Is it about being in bullion or equities or both 
DHS  I have worked for more than a decade with David Morgan at The Morgan Report and he suggests buying the physical metal first  Once you re comfortable with your allotment of physical precious metals  then start looking at equities  Shares can offer two or three times the upside potential on a percentage basis to the metal  but some go bankrupt and others underperform  Look at producers and royalty companies first  and if you have some money left over  buy a couple of exploration stocks with the hope of 10 or 20 times gains  knowing that they also represent a potential 100  risk to the funds you commit to a given position 
TGR  What are some names of companies developing PGM projects in South Africa 
DHS  I m a shareholder in Robert Friedland s Ivanhoe Mines Ltd   TO IVN   which is developing a platinum project there  Platreef is a few years from production and may cost  1 2B to develop  but it s a wide vein deposit that s relatively shallow and should lend itself to automated harvesting  When that comes into production it s going to be a game changer for South African PGM production 
TGR  Is that a case of  Freidland s done it again  
DHS  I think so  Friedland has three world class projects Platreef  the Kamoa copper project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC   and the Kipushi copper zinc mine in the DRC  How many people come up with one world class project in their life  Friedland has done it a number of times including in Mongolia with the Oyu Tolgoi copper gold deposit  which is absolutely stunning  He s a legend 
TGR  You mentioned that producers are mining PGMs below the cost of production  How do you sort the good from the not so good 
DHS  It s a matter of philosophy  I would only invest in one PGM company in South Africa and we discussed it  In the Western Hemisphere Stillwater Mining Co   NYSE SWC  is the only major producer about 4  of global production  I currently hold a small long position in that company 
A few projects are years away  One in the Yukon that I have visited twice  but could be four or five years from production  is Wellgreen Platinum Ltd   TO WG   formerly Prophecy Platinum  That s a very interesting project  The stock has dropped 95  from where it was a few years ago  but it could be something that has great potential  There is quite a bit of PGM values in the ground there and that removes some of the risk  This company is part of the suggested holdings in The Morgan Report  as it was a spinoff from Prophecy Coal Corp   TO PCY  for early investors  We still follow the company and provide updates to our members 
TGR  What are your near  and medium term forecasts for platinum and palladium 
DHS  It s really difficult to put a time and price on any commodity  It s more important to look at the risk reward ratio  Over the next two or three years  in my opinion  the risk for having a platinum palladium position is probably about one and the reward is four or five  I like those metrics 
If people are looking for a certain price target in a given timeframe and it doesn t happen  they lose faith and believe that the premise is wrong  The premise might still be accurate  it just may take more time to get there  For example  for some time I believed we would see a breakout in PGM prices  It took longer than I expected  but the premise was valid  The same thing is going to happen with uranium  It s taking longer than most people expect  but when it happens I think it s going to be a very powerful breakout 
TGR  Are there other PGM development plays or are there some producers that are producing PGMs as a byproduct 
DHS  There are some  most notably in South Africa but  frankly  due to country risk I don t follow them   Interestingly  in looking at Russia s massive Norlisk project  the primary metals harvested there are nickel and copper with palladium as a byproduct   My primary interest is the gold and silver market  but I m also interested in PGMs in the sense that their chart patterns will inform us as to how gold and silver will look when they move into a public mania phase 
Some years ago palladium went to  1 090 oz after Ford Motor Co   F NYSE  bought a lot of supply  At one point  as David Morgan has stated publicly at the time he was involved in that futures market the exchange demanded two times the total value of a palladium contract as margin money  a 200  margin call  That s eventually what we could see in all four of the precious metals 
TGR  Does the current precious metals rally have legs 
DHS  Over the last few weeks we have seen  in some cases  a record volume turnaround in the physical metals and the buying of mining shares  which started about a week or two before metals prices turned  We have touched this area twice before over the last year or so and each time it s held  Anything is possible  We could see weakness and surprise announcements that could cause new lows in gold and silver  but I think they ll be short lived  I think the risk reward ratio is very favorable  If you re trying to find zero risk  you re not going to be involved  With great reward there s always great risk  It s how you manage that risk that determines how well you do 
TGR  Another big theme is China s growing influence on the gold market  Tell us about that 
DHS  China always has a long term strategy  China s gold strategy involves several aspects  one of which is thought to be a gold backed yuan  Another is to diversify out of U S  dollars in its trade account balances  if for no other reason than currency diversification  If there s a rift between China and the U S   China doesn t want to have its money hostage in U S  Treasuries  And China is going to keep acquiring gold and silver  most of it under the radar  State owned enterprises have bought some major gold companies  and last week China established a trading office in Vancouver to expand its reach into the mining sector 
There s a Chinese game the Japanese call it Go that s played with black and white stones on a table  The object is to surround your opponent and keep him or her from moving  That s what the Chinese are doing but for them it s not a game 
TGR  Some recent news reports suggest China plans to introduce vending machines so that Chinese people have better access to gold 
DHS  That shows how widespread the idea of gold ownership is  Last year China was the world s largest gold consumer but India will probably retake the top spot this year  People buy gold in Asia for different reasons than you or I  They re not trying to sell it when it goes up  50 oz  They look at it for the accumulation of wealth and for security 
TGR  You also see it as an extension of central bank gold buying 
DHS  Yes  China is still an authoritarian society and if the government said tomorrow that it s illegal to hold gold and that Chinese citizens must turn it in  most Chinese people would  I think this is a kind of Plan B for the central bank  if it is indeed trying to accumulate as much gold as possible and all indications point to that 
TGR  At about this time last year you told investors to set aside some money for what you called  stupid cheap  prices  Are there some equities in the gold space that you consider stupid cheap 
DHS  It s time to look at prices in relation to where you think they ll be in a few years  A few weeks ago  the prices were stupid cheap  Alexco Resource Corp   AMEX AXU  has traded for less than  1 share a couple of times over the last six months  Another good one is Endeavour Silver Corp   EDR TSX  Endeavour Silver Corp   NYSE EXK   which is above  5 share now  but it had dipped below  3  Gran Colombia Gold Corp   TO GCM  has moved out of its sideways base  has moved up sharply  but still probably has not moved up as much as one might expect for its potential 
The idea of setting aside extra money is not only for stupid cheap prices  but also for something that comes out of the blue that is undervalued in relation to everything else  Having the money and courage to take advantage of those opportunities is what I call psychological capital  If you lose that  you can actually lose your ability to trade effectively 
TGR  Gran Colombia has some production and exploration assets in Colombia  What s your view on Colombia 
DHS  I don t think you can eliminate country risk  Colombia is a much better place to do business than it was a few years ago  Investors have to continually look at where they are investing and ask  Am I willing to accept the risk in relation to the reward that I hope to get from holding stocks in that country 
TGR  In the May edition of Silver Investor it was suggested that Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG  is hunting for other production assets after losing its bid to buy Osisko Mining Inc  Detour Gold Corp   TO DGC  was mentioned as a possible target but what else could suit Goldcorp s needs 
DHS  Any target that would have substantial proven resources in a safe jurisdiction  Goldcorp has great cash flow  money in the bank and sufficient credit to set its sights on a larger target  Goldcorp also hasn t made too many large mistakes  which can t be said about some of the other major gold producers 
TGR  Are there other large cap equities near the top of your list 
DHS   Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE AUY  is a tremendous company  Yamana is making major acquisitions in Argentina because management believes  and I agree  that Argentina will be a much more friendly place to do business in a few years  Argentina is one of the most prospective areas in the world to explore for and produce precious metals  I think that when the country starts doing things that make more economic sense  we re going to see renewed interest in companies operating in Argentina  The country needs a new president  which it will probably have sometime in 2015 
TGR  Are there other projects in Argentina that you re following 
DHS   Pan American Silver Corp   NASDAQ PAAS  has the Navidad project in Chubut province  which is probably the world s largest known silver deposit  That operation could potentially get underway within the next few years  The company is currently working on producing silver with smaller amounts of cyanide to comply with stronger environmental regulations  Navidad could really provide a boost to this economically depressed region  made more so by the eruption of a Chilean volcano a few years ago  which coated the region with ash and destroyed a lot of grazing animals 
TGR  What are some other precious metals names 
DHS  One of the most exciting exploration stories in the world  in my opinion  is Pretium Resources Inc   NYSE PVG  in British Columbia  It has incredible grades  These are not long veins  but the grades and intercepts are amazing  It s in a mining friendly jurisdiction where the environmental impact can be controlled  And the management is top flight  When Pretium collapsed last year it didn t bother me much I bought it after it lost half of its value  It has reclaimed all of that and is hitting new intermediate highs 
Another story I like is First Majestic Silver Corp   NYSE AG   a silver name in Mexico that produces a fair amount of gold as well 
I feel that Sandstorm Gold Ltd   ARCA SAND  is going to be a really surprising performer  Other royalty companies like Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  and a few others are bigger and more widely known  but don t forget that Sandstorm s management team put together Silver Wheaton Corp  s  NYSE SLW silver streaming concept  These people know what they re doing  They have suffered a few bumps but they re going to do just fine  I m very comfortable with my position in that company 
TGR  Sandstorm is up about 65  this year  Should investors expect more of the same 
DHS  In this game nothing is a certainty  Sandstorm should hold most of those gains  We re certainly going to see a lot more volatility  We ve seen large gains evaporate in even some of the best companies after several rallies during the last year  Those are disheartening  but I believe this bull run has turned a corner and we re going to start seeing higher highs and higher lows  The greatest risk now  in my considered opinion  is selling too soon and not being able to get back in 
TGR  Do you have any parting thoughts for precious metals investors 
DHS  The last three years have been incredibly difficult  No one  myself included  thought it would take three years to spin out of this  I still believe the potential is so large over the next few years that a modest position in the better precious metals stocks and holding some of the physical metal will result in outsized gains for people who really understand what s driving this market  This is a global bull market  The one in 1979 1980 was largely confined to North America  Asia wasn t even a component  Asia is driving this market and at some point everybody is going to be on that bandwagon  as David Morgan and Doug Casey and a few others have said  Investors willing to accept the volatility with what s going on are going to be very happy they did

11808,233323,RGLD,Chris Mancini s Keys To Successful Gold Stock Picking,opinion,"Chris Mancini  an analyst with the Gabelli Gold Fund  spends his days finding value in gold equities and he thinks he s found a recipe for success  Take a long term outlook  add excellent management  fold in a great project in a quality jurisdiction with low cost minable ounces in the ground et voila  Mancini calls this  optionality   and in this interview with The Gold Report he says that equities with optionality will not only survive the downturn  but also provide excellent leverage to an inevitable upward move in the gold price  Check out some rising names in the Gabelli Gold Fund 
The Gold Report  Cash has flown out of gold funds and into non gold equities during this bear run in gold  What s the current Gabelli Gold Fund pitch to investors 
Chris Mancini  Gold should be a long term allocation to everyone s portfolio  Owning gold is an insurance policy against the malfunctioning of the world s monetary system  The current actions of the world s central banks are unprecedented  Any investor who is unsure of the ultimate outcome of these actions should have a larger percentage of his or her portfolio in gold 
We recommend that investors have a certain portion of that gold allocation in gold stocks  Gold stocks provide income  accretive growth and  optionality   That optionality is gold in the ground at a discount  Right now investors can buy gold in the ground  in some cases  at less than  100 per ounce   100 oz  and if gold goes to  2 000 oz then they could see that optionality manifest itself in a big increase in the price of the stock 
TGR  So it s possible to have security and performance in the same fund 
CM  If you pick the right stocks and have that optionality and gold goes up  the performance of the fund will be really good  By the same token  if gold goes down and you own some of these stocks  the price of the fund will most likely go down  In owning a gold fund like ours investors are getting exposure to gold and leverage to a move in the gold price 
TGR  Gold witnessed modest safe haven and inflation hedge demand in June after U S  Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said that low interest rates are here to stay  Should gold investors expect anything more than a temporary upward trend in gold prices 
CM  That depends on the expectation in the markets of where real interest rates are going  Yellen stated that interest rates would be lower for longer but that was coupled with data that showed that inflation in the United States could be accelerating  That shows that real interest rates might become more negative than they are now  And that means that holding cash is a money losing proposition because cash is losing purchasing power  If interest rates become more negative  that will be positive for gold and it won t be a temporary phenomenon 
TGR  What s your price target for gold through the end of 2014 
CM  We don t have one  Our view is that the price of gold is going to be higher at the end of 2014 than it is now  And it s going to be higher in 2015 than it will be in 2014 and we re positioning the portfolio to take advantage of that 
TGR  What impact have redemptions from gold exchange traded funds  ETFs  had on the gold price 
CM  Last year 900 tons came out of gold ETFs and it was a huge contributing factor to the price of gold declining by 27   Total annual gold demand is roughly 4 200 tons so if the supply from ETFs goes to neutral then the supply demand balance this year should shift in the other direction  This year we ve seen a tiny negative outflow from ETFs  but they ve been pretty flat  Inflows into ETFs would be a big positive for the price of gold 
TGR  How do the inflows and outflows in your fund compare with 2013 
CM  At the beginning of 2014 we had inflows into the fund  and then they flattened out  When we had the big one day pop in the gold price in June when gold went up  44 oz  we actually had outflows from the fund  That might be telling us that we have some people who are playing gold for a quick bounce and aren t looking at gold from a long term perspective 
TGR  A recent Gabelli Gold Fund report suggests that Russia may want to diversify its foreign exchange holdings and could look to gold 
CM  Russia has around  500 billion   500B  of foreign exchange reserves in the form of U S  dollar treasuries and euro denominated bonds  largely German  French and some other smaller European country bonds  If there is further geopolitical unrest in or around Russia and increased rhetoric from countries like the United States  Germany  and France meant to impede Russia from taking action in places like Ukraine  Russia might get the sense that the United States and other countries in NATO might impose financial sanctions on Russia 
If broad financial sanctions are placed on Russia  then there could be a question as to whether Russia would be repaid by the countries that they ve lent money to  In a new Cold War scenario  you would think that Russia would want to diversify out of the bonds of those countries and into something else  What else is there  Gold is an answer  Gold is no one s liability 
TGR  Where is China in the gold demand picture 
CM  Chinese consumers are the largest buyers of gold in the world  That s related to their fear of holding their currency in the bank or holding it in their mattress  There s a significant amount of inflation in China  so real interest rates are negative  It behooves the Chinese to diversify out of cash  which is losing its purchasing power  Holding gold is a way to insure against inflation or some kind of issue with the Chinese banking system 
China has around  3 7 trillion of foreign currency reserves  The People s Bank of China also might want to diversify  If China were to diversify 10  of its foreign currency reserves   370B  that would be a huge amount of gold to buy  or roughly 3 5 years of the world s total mined supply of gold 
TGR  A significantly higher gold price would float all boats  But until that happens  what s your method for picking gold stocks 
CM  We try to own the companies that can survive and even benefit from this downturn and then prosper in the upturn  We look for companies that have good assets  good management and a good valuation  Good assets alone should allow the companies to survive  their management teams should help them prosper  We re looking to buy these companies at reasonable prices 
TGR  Do you visit mines and mining projects 
CM  Yes  I was recently in Quebec s Abitibi region where I visited Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd  s  NYSE AEM  Goldex and LaRonde mines  and a couple of others 
TGR  Will Agnico ever recoup its capital costs at Goldex after the mine s underground instability issues 
CM  Probably not its initial capital costs  Agnico should be able to produce 100 000 ounces  100 Koz  a year for a few years at an all in cost of around  1 000 oz  To get those ounces the company had to spend  80 100 million   80 100M   It will more than recoup that incremental investment  The company has done a good job of making the best of a bad situation 
TGR  Ore from the Goldex mine won t last long  There are a handful of explorers working in the area  Do you think Agnico has eyes for one or two 
CM  We own a very small position in Alexandria Minerals Corp   TO AZX   which just sold the Akasaba property to Agnico for  5M  Agnico is talking about open pit mining Akasaba  with the low grade ore being processed in the Goldex mill  Agnico is in the driver s seat relative to the explorers now because Alexandria needed capital and Agnico had capital to deploy  Agnico got that project at a really good price 
TGR  What else did you visit in the Abitibi 
CM  I also visited AuRico Gold Inc  s  NYSE AUQ   Young Davidson mine  and Primero Mining Corp  s  NYSE PPP  Black Fox  The big thing to take away from the Abitibi is that it is a mining region  There are families there who have been mining for generations 
TGR  What were your impressions of Black Fox 
CM  There s a lot of exploration potential there at depth  That mine was undercapitalized when Brigus Gold owned it  Primero has a lot of underground development work to do to get production up to 1 000 tons per day  1 000 tpd   Once it does  there is potential to go beyond that level  To go beyond 1000 tpd  Primero must first find more gold at depth and then develop underground  The company has the capital and it has committed to explore at depth to try to unlock that potential 
TGR  What stood out at AuRico s Young Davidson 
CM  The ore body is similar to Goldex and is amenable to low cost bulk mining but the grade is a lot better than at Goldex  It s a wide ore body with big stopes  so the company has put the infrastructure in place to allow the deposit to be mined cost effectively  The production shaft has been sunk  development work in the upper mine is mostly complete  AuRico s goal is to go from 2 700 tpd to 4 000 tpd  and then eventually to 8 000 tpd once the lower mine is fully developed 
TGR  Young Davidson produced about 120 Koz last year and AuRico has issued guidance that could be as high as 160 Koz in 2014  Is that realistic 
CM  Yes  that s realistic  The ultimate goal is to get to around 230 Koz year on a sustainable basis  Once AuRico gets there unit costs should decline to below  500 oz from around  700 oz because to get that incremental tonnage it won t have to add as many underground miners  The mine should reach full capacity by the end of 2016 
TGR  What are some other equity positions currently held by your fund 
CM  One that we ve been buying recently is Mandalay Resources Corp   TO MND   That s a company that is taking advantage of the downturn in the gold price  It has two mines that are generating cash flow  One is an epithermal vein system in Chile  the other is an underground mine in Australia  The company has done a good job of adding to the life of both mines through drilling  Mandalay recently bought a project from Silver Standard Resources Inc   NASDAQ SSRI   another epithermal vein system in northern Chile  And a couple of weeks ago Mandalay announced a friendly deal to buy Elgin Mining Inc   TO ELG   which owns the Bj rkdal gold mine in Sweden 
TGR  Was that a good deal 
CM  I think so  This is an undercapitalized mine in Sweden that has a lot of exploration potential  If Mandalay gets the mine up to production capacity and then creates value through the drill bit again  we will look back on that as a good deal 
TGR  What else are you buying 
CM  Another one that we bought recently is Virginia Mines Inc   TO VGQ   Virginia has a royalty on what should be one of the best gold mines in the world Goldcorp Inc  s  NYSE GG   l onore deposit in northern Qu bec  It will become a high grade  bulk tonnage underground mine in a great jurisdiction with a lot of exploration potential on the entire land package  The gold deposit is getting bigger at depth and Goldcorp could find another economic deposit on the property  Virginia s royalty would be attractive to any of the gold mining royalty companies  including Franco Nevada Corp   NYSE FNV  or Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD   Even if Virginia chooses not to sell  the royalty will generate lots of cash flow  Hopefully  the company will pay dividends  too  Then there is the potential that Virginia finds something else that s minable 
TGR  How is Virginia putting its royalty cash to use 
CM  It has the Coulon base metals project that it believes has a very good chance to be feasible  Virginia is trying to define that project more completely and put economics around it so that it could eventually become a mine or perhaps another royalty stream  Virginia is one of the best explorers in northern Qu bec s James Bay region 
TGR  What are some other small cap gold equities that the Gabelli Gold Fund owns 
CM  We own Comstock Mining Inc   AMEX LODE   Comstock is primarily an exploration company  but it did a good job of bringing its Lucerne project into production so that it could weather this downturn relatively well  The company should be cash flow positive from Lucerne while it explores and defines the Dayton deposit in Nevada still one of the most prolific gold and silver bearing regions in the world  We re waiting to understand the economics of the company s total mineral inventory in the region before taking a larger position 
Last year Comstock mined around 20 Koz gold  It should increase to around 40 Kt this year  but the real key is the economics around the millions of ounces that Comstock has found in the district  Can Comstock become a 200 Koz heap leach producer in a great jurisdiction with some underground exploration potential  This is the Comstock Trend in Virginia City  just south of Reno  that was mined in the 1800s  The city of San Francisco was essentially built from the cash that was generated from the Comstock mine 
TGR  Do you have other positions in equities with projects in Nevada 
CM  We own Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  and Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX   A lot of the value of those two companies is in their Nevada operations  I think Newmont and Barrick should merge and then spin off their combined Nevada operations into what would be one of the biggest gold mining companies in the world  Call it Nevada American  It would be huge  The market would love it 
TGR  What are some sub  1 billion market cap names that you are buying 
CM  We ve been buying Midas Gold Corp   TO MAX   Midas has a very good asset and very good management  Golden Meadows is a multimillion ounce deposit in Idaho with an antimony byproduct credit  It should be a long life  low cost operation once built  If and when the gold price does turn around  that s the type of deposit that the major producers will want to own  There s a lot of exploration potential there  too 
TGR  What steps is Midas taking to develop Golden Meadows 
CM  Midas has some cash on its balance sheet and is focusing on optimizing the deposit  it s no longer drilling  It is getting the permitting process started  Once the gold price goes up  the value in the Golden Meadows project should become more and more apparent to the market and the stock should do well 
TGR  Some of your largest positions are in royalty companies  Tell us about those 
CM  Our second biggest position is Franco Nevada  We also have big positions in Royal Gold and Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW   I mentioned Virginia  and we also own Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd   OR TSX   a spinout from the Osisko takeover by Agnico Eagle Mines and Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE AUY   These companies are perfect examples of being able to survive the downturn and benefit from it 
Franco Nevada  for example  purchased a royalty on Midas Gold s Golden Meadows project  Midas needed some cash so Franco Nevada bought a royalty on the property for  15M  Midas survives because it has a very good asset  Franco benefits by getting a royalty on what could ultimately be one of the best gold mines in the world  Franco  Royal Gold and Silver Wheaton are taking advantage of the downturn  And when the gold price turns around  these companies will be generating more and more free cash flow 
TGR  What are some royalties that give Royal Gold and Silver Wheaton leverage to a dramatic rise in the gold price 
CM  Both companies have royalties on Barrick Gold s Pascua Lama gold silver copper project on the border of Chile and Argentina  Royal Gold has a sliding scale royalty that at this gold price would be 5 23  on the gold on the Chilean side of Pascua Lama  whereas Silver Wheaton has a stream on 25  of the silver 
It would cost another  4B for Barrick to build Pascua Lama  even if it gets the environmental permit and green light from the government  but at  1 300 oz gold and  21 oz silver the project is not viable  Once it s built it should produce 800 Koz year gold at zero dollar cash costs  after silver byproduct credits  and should have a 20 year mine life  It s a great project at a higher gold price 
Both companies also have royalties on Pe asquito in Zacatecas  Mexico  Pe asquito is Goldcorp s biggest mine and it is currently mining a higher grade portion of the mine  The mine also has underground potential 
Royal Gold can benefit if Goldcorp brings a copper circuit into production because it gets a portion of revenue from all metals produced  If precious metals prices go up  both companies will immediately start accruing lots of cash flow from those royalties 
TGR  What about some small gold and silver explorers that you either have positions in or that you re following 
CM  We like Eastmain Resources Inc   TO ER   Eau Claire  its primary asset  is just south of Goldcorp s  l onore deposit in the James Bay region  Eau Claire is a high grade deposit that could be mined using open pit methods  The defined resource in the open pit is small  but the company has been conducting exploration drilling for two years and should publish a new resource on that deposit by the end of the summer  Eastmain could define a deposit that has over 1 Moz gold at relatively high grades more than 4 grams per ton  The company hopes it can delineate a deposit that can produce 100 Koz year for 10 years at relatively low cash costs  There is also greenfields potential in Eastmain s land package and the company has had some good high grade intercepts at depth  It s virgin territory in terms of exploration 
TGR  How about a silver play before we let you go 
CM  We own MAG Silver Corp   AMEX MVG  and we have owned it for a while  Its Juanicipio deposit is a great asset in Zacatecas  Mexico  I visited the Fresnillo Plc  LONDON FRES  silver mine and saw the Juanicipio drills spinning up on the ridge from Fresnillo s Saucito mill  The deposit is a very high grade epithermal vein system with further exploration potential 
Fresnillo has been mining in the Zacatecas region for decades  There s almost zero risk with building the Juanicipio mine because Fresnillo is the majority partner  It should generate lots of cash once it is up and running  MAG Silver also has exploration potential in its Cinco de Mayo project in northern Mexico where the goal is to define another economic silver deposit  It s nice to have a good asset and management that has proven that it can add value 
TGR  What s one thing a gold investor should know about the current market 
CM  The best thing to keep in mind is that even though this market is extremely volatile  you re in it for the long term  It was very volatile to the downside last year  so far this year it s been volatile to the upside  Don t lose hope or exit on a quick run up  You re getting insurance at a relatively cheap price by owning gold and gold mining companies 
TGR  Buy and hold still works 
CM  Yes  if you have the stomach for it 
TGR  Thanks  Chris

11809,233324,RGLD,Gold  The Pause That Refreshes,opinion,"Amidst the earliest musings for The Gold Update of a couple of missives back  at which time the yellow metal was in a mild upward tilt whilst still entrapped in the 1280 1240 support zone  I swerved into a loyal and valued reader who remarked that the real story was the miners being en route to surpassing the performance of Gold itself on the upside  This is  of course  the wont for the shares of mining and royalty companies    and as all engaged precious metal equities investors know    sadly  tis the same when on the downside  Live by the volatility  and at minimum  have a near death experience by it   Another gold stocks investor  Nurse Assay      Yes Dr  Lode  the ER is teeming with them  
Then reminding the reader whilst I am not a stocks follower per se   beyond our various S P 500 valuation and ranking categories as displayed at the website   that nevertheless come month s end we ll post the usual year over year track of Gold s percentage performance vs  those of its precious metal equities brethren  thereby vindicating such real story volatility notion  So with but one trading session left in June  let s go for it  the following chart featuring Gold itself  the HUI  ARCA Gold Bugs   the XAU  Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index   Market Vectors Gold Miners  ARCA GDX   the exchange traded fund of miners  and Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   the royalty company Royal Gold  

Quite the changed picture from those posted these many months  as now all of that SpringTime selling from 2013 has moved off of the chart  What is notably striking in the above view is the more volatile amplitude of the equities indices in oscillating  round either side of Gold  as it essentially snakes through the center of them  Then  of course  there s RGLD  oh my word   
And as we displayed at the end of Q1   tis time again to bring up the comparative tracks of Gold year to date through Q2 for both 2013 and 2014   10  surely trumps  30   this year s broad consolidation lending more confidence to the worst as having passed 

Now as for Gold s currently enjoying  the pause that refreshes   it shows stark and rightly justified per the following two panel graphic  On the left in a three month view we ve Gold s settle yesterday  Friday  at 1316  price almost childlike in curling back toward the rising Magnet as if to say   C mon on Mummy I beat you   On the right in a 12 month view is further evidence of price s recent racing away so as to increase Gold s expected daily trading range between low and high to almost 15 points  Summer is heating up 

Here  too  we ve Gold s pause in view  and yet in marked contrast to the chronic complacency of the ever upward  meandering S P  their comparative percentage tracks for the last month as follows 

Next in turning to Gold s weekly bars    and contrary to having penned a week ago that the parabolic trend would flip from Short to Long at 1332    we  missed it by that much  as Gold only reached 1326   again having gotten too far ahead of Mummy   But as shown below  trading through 1327 in the ensuing week ought trip the flip  in turn lending support to the Daily Oscillator s already Long stance  as described a week ago  for Gold s then making the run up to 1384 

As for the state of interest rates  St  Louis  FRB president James Bullard on Thursday put forth the notion of their rising sooner than later  an arguably inflationary Gold positive  To be sure  our CPI certainly has been increasing year to date  the just reported  0 4  increase for May being the largest monthly rise since last June s  0 5   Indeed as we approach the celebration of our StateSide once had Independence   tis reported that prices for hot dogs  fireworks and gasoline are at their highest levels since 2008   the latter alone averaging  3 68 gallon    for which here in San Francisco we d certainly relish  having just filled up for  4 79 gallon  albeit still a bargain given France s  8 gallon   Nonetheless with such digression in mind  conversely here below we ve the yield on the five year Treasury Note since its 5 241  peak during 2007   monthly bars to date   The current level of 1 638  yield for such five year dough hardly makes its T Note worth purchasing  But the three descending lines drawn upon the chart depict the yield s regression trend channels such as to raise an eyebrow in noting that such lowly rate may be poised for an upside breakout per the rightmost area of the graphic as the upper blue line is tested 

But then again  maybe not  the Dollar dropping to its lowest level in five weeks  at least against the  en  given StateSide signs of an  uneven recovery  which we deem a Gold positive  Let s look at both the Dollar and the Economic Barometer 
First here s the Dollar Index with the same charting presentation as used above for the T Note yield   monthly bars from 2007 to date and regression trend channels   Give or take a few points  the Dollar s valuation is right around where  twas back in  07  the overall trend being essentially  choppy flat  with range notably narrowing 

 But how can that be  mmb  Our money supply is up almost 40  since then  
A perfectly logical deduction that  Squire  but allow me to very loosely state   so is everybody else s   Which is why we oft say that Gold plays no currency favourites  Moreover  the total mined Gold supply since 2007 is up just a wee two tenths of one percent   assuming some 165 000 total metric tons on the planet  increasing at a paltry pace of just 50 metric tons per year   Reason enough for Gold to already be hovering about  2 000 oz    depending upon the starting point from where one measures   Still  with respect to the prior interest rate graphic  there is quite the disconnect with the Dollar  such as to opine that either the former rise  else the latter dive  Either way  through these years of quantitative easing both StateSide and  round the world  there s been a heckova lot more accounting units of currency created than physical units of Gold 
Second given that notion of our economy s  uneven recovery   here again is the Econ Baro having just gracefully recovered from stepping into a pothole borne of April May reportings for weakness in Industrial Production  Capacity Utilization  the NAHB Housing Index  Consumer Sentiment and Leading Economic Indicators  albeit those and other surveys have since righted themselves a bit   at least for the present  

Indeed the S P  which continues to climb within the context of such  uneven recovery   is apparently simply expecting interest rates to remain at almost nil levels with  at some point  a return to more  free QE  
We maintain that Gold sees such ultimately debasing realities as well  Others of course do not  as evidenced per certain analysts  quotes by which we breezed during the week  collectively as      the surge in gold can t sustain itself     it was a temporary spike because of a confluence of events     people are leaving gold in search of something better     you ve had a bit of safe haven demand and a bit of inflation hedge demand     the view doesn t change on gold  because this is temporary      Same old negative nabob pap  I d say the following two panel graphic looks quite healthy for Gold going forward 
On the left  the  Baby Blues  have done it  Those blue dots of 21 day linear regression trend consistency having surpassed their  80  level now confirms such trend as up   duh    Last July  upon eclipsing the  80  level  Gold traded higher by 100 additional points within five weeks  Then similarly this past January  upon eclipsing the  80  level  Gold traded higher by 110 additional points in some six weeks  A repeat performance from here thus puts Gold into the 1400s  Go Blues  On the right  FRiday s settle  1316  is spot on the longest bar in Gold s Market Profile  meaning that more Gold contracts have traded at 1316 than at any other price in the last 10 trading days  two weeks   Should the aforementioned parabolic weekly trend indeed flip to Long in the new week and the daily Price Oscillator study s Market Rhythm target of 1384 remain in tact  that large clump of trading in these low 1300s ought be brilliant support toward the run to higher levels and a year s new high above 1392 

In wrapping it up for this week  and again with the spectre of higher interest rates lurking about in the minds of some  one has to wonder what the dear Old Lady of Threadneedle Street must think after having been referred to as an  unreliable boyfriend  by Parliamentary Treasury Committee member Pat McFadden  the target of course being Mark Carney  To summarily paraphrase The Guv   Rates may riser soon than expected     but not really    Tis similar to our StateSide confusion as herein noted via Mr  Bullard s suggestion that rates may rise sooner than later  only to be offset by others pointing to the economy s  uneven recovery   Certain central bank figures may well make for strange bedfellows  but to drag in the Old Lady  indeed question her very gender  is quite deserved of reproach by polite society  wouldn t you say  Ghastly   ",2014-06-30,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold:-the-pause-that-refreshes-217764,217764
11810,233325,RGLD,Gold Mining Stocks Beating Bullion  Good News For All,opinion,For the first time in at least a couple of years  gold mining stock returns are outpacing those of the yellow metal itself  As you can see in the chart below  the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index has returned 22 31 percent year to date  YTD   whereas gold has delivered 7 74 percent  This is good news for both equities and bullion  When miners are doing well  gold tends to follow suit  Indeed  since the beginning of the year  spot gold has seen steady growth following a lackluster 2013  As I noted earlier in the month  it s been one of the best performing commodities of the year so far  a mere nugget s throw behind nickel and palladium  Miners restructuring their business strategy Gold mining  to be sure  is a tough gig  When gold prices are between  1 000 and  1 200 an ounce  miners barely break even in terms of cash flow  Last year was particularly brutal  The metal plunged 28 percent from  1 675 to about  1 200 which was the largest annual drop since 1981  To reduce risk  many companies have cut costs in several ways  Some have decreased capital spending  Others have sold off assets  Others still have placed exploration on standby  Case in point  Comstock Mining Inc  AMEX LODE  Inc   a young mining company which we own in our Gold and Precious Metals Fund  USERX   has managed to shrink operating expenses from  4 4 million this time last year to  3 8 million  mostly by lowering legal and advisory expenses  Other realized annual savings have come from administration and staff reductions  In a recent interview with  U S  Global Investors portfolio manager Ralph Aldis addressed the company s rising success  Comstock started production over a year ago at about 10 000 ounces a year  It doubled that and now it s targeting a 40 000 ounce run rate in H2 14  The company has permits to reach 4 million tons per year so Comstock should be a 100 000 ounce producer by 2016  It s a situation where people are creating value and  Chairman of the Board  John Winfield knows how to make money  Time to wake up to gold diggers  An equity that has performed exceptionally well this year is Klondex Mines Ltd   headquartered in Nevada  Not only does it represent the largest position in both USERX and our World Precious Minerals Fund  UNWPX   but we also own it in our Global Resources Fund  PSPFX   One of the main reasons we re so fond of the stock is that in 2013  when the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index was down 61 percent  Klondex  TO KDX  was up 28 percent  It s currently up 30 percent YTD and is targeting free cash flow  FCF  by the end of the year   This is a great story   Ralph said in the same interview   Most people haven t woken up to it yet   Royalty companies are thriving as well  Other players in the gold space that have flourished in this climate are royalty companies  which provide upfront capital to miners in exchange for a stake in future output  Since royalty companies avoid the costly rigmaroles gold miners must deal with on a regular basis securing permits and building infrastructure  among others they often receive a healthy return on their investments  Two such companies are Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   based in Toronto  and Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   based in Denver  We own both in USERX  UNWPX and PSPFX  as well as our All American Equity Fund  GBTFX  and Holmes Macro Trends Fund  MEGAX   Whereas Franco Nevada has risen 42 percent YTD  Royal Gold has leaped 70 percent  Looking ahead  Gold might have taken a minor hit this week  but autumn is right around the corner  when the gold jewelry industry traditionally replenishes its stock  And with unrest in Ukraine and the Middle East continuing to drive the fear trade  as unfortunate as these events are  gold prices appear buoyant  This bodes well not only for investors in bullion but also mining companies  which will likely proceed with cost cutting initiatives to maintain or expand margins  Disclosure  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  Gold  precious metals  and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic  political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme  The prices of gold  precious metals  and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies  We suggest

11811,233326,RGLD,John Hathaway And Doug Groh  Buy Gold Like It s 1999,opinion,"The overall markets are exuberant  Valuations rise regardless of value created  And gold is conspicuously not at the party  All of this sounds very familiar to John Hathaway and Doug Groh  portfolio managers of the Tocqueville Gold Fund  It is like 1999 all over again  In this interview with The Gold Report  the pair of fund managers shares their top 10 picks for a diversified portfolio that minimizes risk while maximizing the upside they see coming sooner rather than later 
The Gold Report  In a 4th of July investor letter  you wrote that the precious metals complex  both mining shares and bullion  appear to be in the process of completing a major bottom  and you re more comfortable with the proposition that the downside potential has been fully exhausted  What are the signs that it s really turning this time 
John Hathaway  The gold futures chart is showing that we are in the process of a reverse head and shoulders pattern  which is a sign that a bottom has been completed  It means that downward momentum has been exhausted  This bottom will be confirmed when gold trades above  1 400 ounce   1 400 oz   which is a stretch from where we are  At least we can say fairly credibly that it s shaping up to be a bottom  but we may test it over the summer 

TGR  Are statistics on money flows telling you that investors are starting to get interested again 
JH  Yes  If we look at the SPDR Gold Shares Exchange Traded Fund  ARCA GLD   which is one proxy for money flows into the gold space  the outflows that have been predominant over the last couple of years have pretty much run their course  Now  we re starting to see assets build in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF  At Tocqueville  our fund has seen steady inflows all year  in some cases  very substantial inflows  I don t know if what we re seeing is comparable to other managers in the precious metals space  but our experience this year has been positive 

TGR  Headlines about conflicts in the Ukraine  Iraq and Gaza have bumped gold prices visibly lately  Can these events act as long term fundamental supports or do they represent short term volatility that will fade just as quickly as the headlines 
JH  Anything geopolitical always has a knee jerk impact  I would never recommend gold based on today s headlines  yesterday s headlines or speculation about future headlines  Having said that  geopolitical issues away from the headlines influence the demand for gold  Europeans are probably more conscious of gold today than they might have been six months ago  People want to get their wealth in a safe place  That will reinforce demand for gold as time goes by 
TGR  You have compared gold s fundamentals today to the situation in 1999  What were the fundamentals 15 years ago 
JH  Fifteen years ago  we were at the end of a 20 year bear market  so the psychology was very negative  Gold was never mentioned in polite discussions  We re not that different today from where we were then  Considering the drop from a high of  1 900 oz to slightly less than  1 200 oz  that s a pretty big decline in the space of two and a half years  That makes the setup similar to what we experienced in 1999  Back then  the markets were flush with optimism  and I would say that s the case today  I think there are many parallels 
TGR  One unique thing that is happening right now is that the mining share valuations seem to be leading the commodity prices  What s causing that 
JH  It s not an ironclad relationship  but when the shares outperform the metal  which they ve done this year and by a fairly substantial amount  that s generally a favorable setup for a better phase in the gold market  In 2011  the opposite occurred  Gold reached a new high and was in the headlines in every newspaper on the planet  yet the shares were conspicuous by their underperformance  That was a sign that the shares were not confirming the new highs in gold  and we ve seen the result  A lack of confirmation between the shares and the metal prices can sometimes indicate the future direction of the gold price  or vice versa  of the share prices 
TGR  One thing that you and I have talked about before is the impact of quantitative easing  QE  on the dollar and the gold price  QE never did seem to weigh down the dollar  Are investors on the sidelines waiting for the impact of liquidity to buy gold 
JH  I think the rationale for owning gold is as strong as ever  Radical monetary policy probably won t end well and any thinking person should be concerned about it  That s why we believe you need to have some exposure to gold  Markets today are over exuberant  pumped up equity valuations  nonexistent spreads between quality and junk  record issuance of low grade paper  all of these things are typically indicative of an endgame in financial assets  Gold is not at that party  It s conspicuous by its absence  In our view  it s pretty hard to say that anything represents value these days except precious metals  Gold is wealth insurance 
When we started the Tocqueville Gold Fund  TGLDX  in 1998  we all said   If this works  we ll be glad we did and if it doesn t work  everything else we re doing will be successful  rewarding and profitable   As it turned out  gold was a terrific thing to be in from 1998 through 2011  And we believe it will be again 
TGR  The Tocqueville Gold Fund was named by Lipper  the Thomson Reuters fund analytical arm  as the Best Fund in the Precious Metals category for the past five years  What is your investment thesis for this fund 
Doug Groh  The gold fund is an alternative to the monetary policies that we re seeing among central banks around the world  While the gold fund has about a 10  direct exposure to gold bullion  we re also invested in precious metal mining equities  Our goal is to capture the optionality to the gold price as these companies make discoveries  build out production and benefit from price volatility 
TGR  Last year was a challenging year for gold mining companies  How are you adjusting based on those challenges 
DG  We re emphasizing those companies that are well managed with good assets and quality balance sheets  Explorers are not as attractive today as they were a few years ago  Right now  we re focused on companies in the mid cap sector of the gold industry 
TGR  Your quarterly report defines your approach as a growth fund made up of mid cap companies  How does it compare with the investment styles of the other Tocqueville funds 
DG  Portfolio managers at Tocqueville Asset Management employ a contrarian value investment philosophy that generates attractive risk adjusted returns over the long term  In fact  the gold fund was created as an expression of this contrarian thought process when physical gold was significantly out of favor in 1998  Although the Tocqueville Gold Fund is the only precious metals strategy at Tocqueville  we do offer other investment styles for those clients who prefer a more traditional allocation to equities  These offerings include a U S  large cap fund  a mid cap value fund  a small cap value fund  an international value fund  a liquid alternative strategies fund and a mid cap growth fund 
TGR  Just over 10  of the  1 3 billion Tocqueville Gold Fund is invested in physical gold  Are you adjusting that based on some of the trends we have discussed 
DG  That s about what we re comfortable with  We don t really trade around that position  It s a core position for us  We think that as a gold fund  we should have direct gold exposure  While the gold equities can provide more return  they are more volatile  Physical gold has a stabilizing effect so we keep it at about 10  
TGR  Let s talk about some of the best performers in the fund on the equity side 
DG  The fund performed well through June on the back of the market s recognition that gold was oversold in late 2013  The initial hostile bid by Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG  for Osisko Mining Corp  helped our dominant position in Osisko  It was one of the top weighted positions in the portfolio  The company attracted a white knight in Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE AUY   which teamed up with Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   NYSE AEM  to win the day  During that process  the gold price recovered and the market recognized the value in the sector 
Now we are holding Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd   OR TSX   as well as Agnico Eagle  which is one of the only companies that has increased its original guidance for 2014 after reporting year end 2013  and is likely to increase guidance again for 2014 as it integrates the Malartic joint venture  It is enjoying a very good year so far and the market is recognizing that 
One of the other names that has done well in the portfolio has been Detour Gold Corp   TO DGC   The market looks at Detour as a potential takeout  similar to Osisko  It has built a new mine in Canada  The market is recognizing that North American operations are more compelling than other parts of the world and worth a premium 
TGR  What is the role of royalty companies in the portfolio 
DG  Royalty companies such as Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD   Franco Nevada Corp   NYSE FNV  and Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  mitigate risk and maximize discovery upside  These companies  through their royalties  have a direct interest in ore deposits and the revenues or profits from the operations that mine those deposits  often before shareholders of the mining company that operates those mines  The market has embraced the royalty companies because of the limited risk exposure from a capital and diversification perspective  The business model can also allow for greater return potential 
TGR  How do you decide which royalty companies to include 
DG  Our gold team at Tocqueville is research intensive  We cover and follow the entire gold resource and gold mining industry  In that effort we seek to be well informed regarding the quality of gold resource assets around the world and the royalties associated with them 
We recognize that some of the larger royalty companies  like Royal Gold or Franco Nevada  have been very good in the deals they have made to either acquire or establish royalties  Our exposure to these companies was relatively early compared to the general market s interest  because we recognized the inherent value of a royalty before the rest of the broader market 
For instance  the new Osisko Gold Royalties  a spin off from the takeover of Osisko Mining  starts out with its Malartic mine royalty  which provides it with a solid base to build upon  Clearly  the Malartic mine is a very compelling asset as demonstrated by the hostile bid that Goldcorp made and the fact that Agnico Eagle and Yamana stepped up to partner on a takeout of Osisko  The royalty that Osisko now enjoys from that mine is very attractive  Royal Gold also has a royalty on the Malartic mine  which we view as an endorsement of Osisko Gold Royalties as a company  In addition  Royal Gold has other royalties that are performing very well on developing and producing mines in other parts of the world  So it is a well diversified company 
TGR  Is the Osisko takeover a sign of more mergers and acquisitions  M A  coming 
DG  M A of varying sizes has been going on for some time  Many were just not quite as significant in terms of market cap  I think we will see more deals  whether it s actual corporate takeouts  joint ventures or property sales 
The decline in the gold price these last three years has been destructive for mining companies  It has caused them to rethink their business models and their capital spending plans  It s become more difficult for companies to raise capital to move forward  That is why consolidation is underway  That is the nature of the industry  A lot of explorers and developers are good at doing just that  Meanwhile mining companies need to replace the reserves they re producing  They may be good at operating a mine but not quite as agile at doing exploration  making discoveries and developing ore deposits  So we should see more M A 
TGR  When you are considering adding a company to the portfolio  do you place a value on the chances of it being an acquisition target 
DG  Yes  in a form and fashion  Ultimately we are looking at the assets of a company and the merits of those assets to expand and to attract other investors into the company s register  The potential to get bigger is always of interest to us  If something is getting bigger  it will attract capital  whether it s investors or corporate entities 
TGR  Do you want to talk about some of the other performers in your top 10 
DG  Tahoe Resources Inc   NYSE TAHO  initiated silver production this past year in Guatemala  While it was a slow start up initially  it seems to have gotten off the ground and is ready to expand operations  We are quite encouraged by the results  We think it is going to be a stellar performer in the years to come  The market has now begun to recognize that and is giving it a much better valuation 
TGR  Company guidance is for 20 million ounces  20 Moz  of silver per year  Is that realistic 
DG  Yes  and I expect beyond that  It is a high grade deposit with a geometric shape  in terms of its width  that enables bulk style mining methods  and thus relatively low costs per unit of production  Once it gets momentum  we should see some robust output  Tahoe has been a good performer  and we expect it will continue to be a good performer 
TGR  Any others in the Americas 
DG  Primero Mining Corp   NYSE PPP  has been a good performer for us for the last couple of years  It has been successful at managing its mine in Mexico and expanding the operations there  We expect further expansion in the years ahead as this is a great ore deposit 
Plus  Primero s acquisition last year of Brigus Gold Corp  added to its portfolio and gave it diversification  As it establishes itself and mines that ore deposit  we expect the company will find a lot of value opportunities  We anticipate good results from Primero in the year or two ahead 
TGR  How about one more from your top 10 
DG  Eldorado Gold Corp   NYSE EGO  has been a staple in the portfolio for quite a few years  In some regards  it has been considered a growth stock  but with the pullback in the gold price  it has slowed down growth plans  Still  it is well capitalized and  as we expect the gold price to improve  we anticipate that Eldorado will restart some of its initiatives  Right now  it is more of a value stock  But it has a very good portfolio of assets and projects that once the gold price rises to a higher level and warrants development of those projects  it should be very well capitalized to execute on those projects  So we re pretty enthusiastic about its future as well 
TGR  What words of wisdom do you have for investors who may have been in the gold space over the last three years or are just thinking about getting back into it DG  We believe that investors should consider gold and gold exposure as an alternative asset class and as part of an overall portfolio  While there are attractive values in the gold space  investors should think about having broad exposure to the gold sector  whether it s through bullion  mining companies in different stages of development  or producers  Each avenue carries different opportunities and risks  That is why a group of precious metals stocks mixed with an exchange traded fund or a gold mutual fund like the Tocqueville Gold Fund can serve an investor better than having just one name 
Additionally  I would recommend that investors average their investment over time instead of buying all at once  The gold price is volatile and it s very difficult to get the low points  Averaging over time when the price dips can help financially and mentally even out the ups and downs 
Finally  consider gold as a very long term investment  not just a two  or three year investment  We believe it should be a permanent part of an overall portfolio as a non correlated asset  It doesn t really have counterparty risk and it trades to a different type of profile than other financial instruments  That s why we recommend having a portion of a portfolio allocated to gold and gold mining equities

11812,233327,RGLD,Jason Hamlin Says Gold Is Unstoppable  With Stocks Leading the Way,opinion,"Downward manipulation of Gold and Silver is real  declares Jason Hamlin  but the longer it continues  the higher prices will go when the free market reasserts itself  In this interview with The Gold Report  the publisher of the Gold Stock Bull newsletter argues that rising geopolitical anxiety coupled with endless monetary expansion could lead to explosive growth in precious metals and equities  He also lists his favorite royalty streaming companies and gold and silver miners 
The Gold Report  You  The Gold Report in December 2012   I think the official inflation adjusted  gold  high of  2 400 per ounce   2 400 oz  will be taken out within the next 12 months   Why didn t this happen 
Jason Hamlin  One reason is that inflation hasn t risen significantly until lately  That is due to the recent record low velocity of money  Trillions of dollars in new money were created to stimulate the economy and get us out of the financial crisis of 2008 2009  but the banks have held this money in excess reserves  earning interest from the Federal Reserve  As a result  it hasn t been loaned out and hasn t flowed through the economy  I think we are beginning to see this change  and coupled with de dollarization driven by Russia and China  I expect the inflation rate to increase at a quicker pace than most people expect 
The other reason why the price of gold didn t increase was outright manipulation  Before people roll their eyes at seeing this  conspiracy theory  once again  we should point out that Britain s Financial Conduct Authority actually fined Barclays Bank  26 million   26M  in May for manipulating the daily gold fix between 2004 and 2013  In my estimation  this is just the tip of the iceberg  A number of class action lawsuits have recently been filed against the big banks for gold manipulation and one needs only look objectively at the recurring not for profit selling to understand that manipulation is taking place  When you consider the immense power that printing the world reserve currency gives a nation  the motive to continue this system and suppress alternative currencies becomes clear  We could never have the endless wars and continual deficit spending without Nixon delinking the dollar from gold 
TGR  What do you make of the report by the Financial Times that central banks have invested  29 1 trillion in markets  mostly equity markets 
JH  This is another example of  conspiracy theory  becoming  conspiracy fact   It helps explain why there s been such a divergence between equity prices and the true health of the economy  This also supports theories of a plunge protection team working to prop up the market and keep confidence high  The greater the interventions and the farther we drift from free market price discovery  the more extreme the boom and bust cycles will be and the more devastating the impact on everyday investors  This grand experiment ends very badly  in my estimation 
TGR  The financial media pays great attention to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500  but are these really such good indices of the broad health of the U S  economy 
JH  Not at all  You can look at the weak manufacturing numbers  You can look at stagnant wages or at median household net worth  which plunged 36  from 2003 to 2013  You can look at the labor force participation rate  which hasn t recovered at all from 2008  There are so many divergences from the official story of a full recovery and we are now finally starting to see some cracks in the facade 
TGR  We had stock market crashes in 2000 and 2008  Are we due for another 
JH  The warning signs have been flashing for quite some time  but stocks have continued marching higher  Valuations on a price earnings basis have risen to lofty and unwarranted levels  By any number of measures  we are due for a major correction in the stock market  It s just a matter of when  not if  In the meantime  I haven t been shorting the market  I think it s wise to continue to ride the trend higher  We ve been doing that with some technology and agricultural plays because  if the markets are manipulated  this bubble can last much longer than most people would think  But it is important to mind your stops 
TGR  Given how high the Dow and S P 500 numbers have become  what would be the psychological and political effects of another crash 
JH  Devastating  That s why we have so much manipulation behind the scenes  On the political front  it would gravely damage the current administration  On the psychological front  investors would suffer a grave loss of confidence in the market  And  very rapidly  these effects could spin out of control  Some of the financial conditions that led to the last crisis in 2008 2009  such as leveraged indebtedness and derivatives exposure by banks  are far worse today than in 2008 
TGR  Some people willing to admit manipulation of gold and silver prices ultimately conclude   So what   What do you make of that response 
JH  It makes sense in one respect  Essentially  holding down gold prices through manipulation allows investors to accumulate gold at lower prices  Manipulation is similar to holding down a spring  The countervailing force continues to grow stronger as the artificial forces weaken  and when the spring is finally released  it moves with explosive force 
Precious metals manipulation frustrates short term investors and speculators because the price action doesn t match the fundamentals or technicals  If you have a long term investment horizon  however  as we do  you can live with it because it gives you more time to accumulate at lower prices 
TGR  Why haven t events such as the war between Hamas and Israel  the downing of a civilian airliner over Ukraine and the ISIS takeover of much of Syria and Iraq led to a flight to safety in gold 
JH  There is always an initial kneejerk reaction toward liquidity  i e   the US Dollar  However  the world is starting to move away from the dollar as its reserve currency  We see bilateral trade agreements inked by a growing number of nations and a  400 billion natural gas deal just signed by Russia and China that bypasses the dollar  As this  de dollarization  continues  I believe investors will increasingly reject all fiat currencies  and precious metals will reassert themselves as the safe haven asset in times of financial crisis 
TGR  You have decried the demonization of Vladimir Putin by Western leaders  What s your opinion of U S  sanctions against Russia 
JH  They are really foolish  We are needlessly antagonizing nuclear powers not only Russia but China as well  As scary as it sounds  the long term goal is probably to drag Russia into some type of protracted conflict that will weaken its economy and give the U S  an excuse to initiate force against Russia  Putin is seemingly aware of this plan and has avoided the trap  He has provided some support for the rebels in Eastern Ukraine  but Russia s involvement in that region has been quite restrained since the new Ukrainian government came to power 
I believe that these maneuvers by America to isolate Russia economically will eventually backfire 
TGR  Will the European Union  EU  back President Obama s campaign against Russia 
JH  It is my understanding that many EU nations  Germany in particular  do not share America s antagonism against Russia  Yes  sanctions can harm Russia  but the EU is already on a shaky economic footing  and so its members are worried about a boomerang effect  To harm ties with Russia  a huge trading partner  simply to please the U S  for political reasons doesn t seem to make a lot of sense 
TGR  Why do you believe the price of gold could rise to  10 000 oz or higher 
JH  An increase in the supply of fiat money  The faster the money supply increases  the higher the gold price targets can be  As outlandish as it may seem  we must consider as models what happened in Zimbabwe  Argentina and other countries that have suffered currency crises  And what happened was a rapid devaluation of each currency and tremendous price rises in stable assets  such as precious metals 
More important than the gold price in fiat dollars  however  is how gold performs in preserving wealth and increasing purchasing power  On that front  gold has an unblemished success rate throughout history in times of crisis  Gold price targets of  10 000 oz and above reflect the belief that the U S  dollar losing world reserve status could lead to a panicked move out of dollars and dollar denominated assets 
TGR  A gold price of  10 000 oz or even  5 000 oz would be great news for gold holders  obviously  but wouldn t it be terrible news for everyone else  Wouldn t socioeconomic conditions be dreadful 
JH  I tend to agree  Unfortunately  that s the trajectory we re on  So we hope for the best but prepare for the worst  I may not like the economic conditions that would accompany  3 000 oz   5 000 oz or  10 000 oz gold  but I would at least know that my hard work and the wealth it generated would not be stolen by the Fed induced forces of inflation  Gold is basically an insurance policy  but it also has the added benefit of significant capital appreciation over the past decade  People like to criticize gold for not paying a dividend or generating income  but the price has more than tripled in the past decade  even counting the recent correction  By comparison  the Dow Jones is up around 65  in the past 10 years  Which investment would you choose 
I would hope there is still some way to avoid the economic crash that I see coming  On the other hand  however  this crash is in some ways essential  It s needed to clear out the excess and mal investment from the markets and begin again with a system that s more sustainable  I just hope we learn lessons from the past and find ways to avoid the same type of mistakes and crony capitalism that has taken over the current system 
TGR  What s the best way for investors to hold gold and silver 
JH  I recommend holding physical metals in your possession first and foremost  but I believe it s good to diversify geographically  so as to not have all your assets in one place  Physical bullion should be supplemented with investments in mining stocks  This is one of the only remaining sectors where I see value  and quality mining stocks will offer significant leverage to the coming advance in gold and silver prices  So far this year  we are seeing mining stocks generating returns of three to four times that of gold and silver bullion  which is a bullish indicator 
TGR  The gold silver price ratio continues to hover around the recent historical number of 1 65  Do you anticipate this ratio changing and  if so  in which direction 
JH  Supply and demand fundamentals are now more attractive for silver than gold  It s my expectation that the gold silver ratio will fall toward its longer historical number of 1 30  Only under extreme short term crisis conditions might we see gold outperform silver  because gold is viewed more as a monetary and investment metal than silver  where 50  of demand comes from industrial uses 
TGR  Franklin Delano Roosevelt banned private gold ownership in the United States  Could future Western governments move to contain an economic crisis with similar measures 
JH  Anything is possible  but I don t expect it  Gold investors are wise to the possibility of confiscation  and the decentralization of information that has occurred over the Internet over the past 20 years makes it less likely  I doubt that gold investors would simply hand it over en masse now  as they did in 1933 
In addition  I know plenty of investors who buy their precious metals without a paper trail  cash and carry There s no way for the government to know who owns these metals  let alone confiscate them 
TGR  You wrote recently that  gold mining stocks remain severely oversold   Do you expect this to continue 
JH  It continued longer than I had expected  but we re already seeing signs of a bottom process  As I mentioned  mining stocks have outperformed the metals by three to four times in 2014  which is an encouraging trend 
I use the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  HUI  to gold ratio to track this  It fell all the way to 0 16 and has since had a bit of a bounce back  but the upside potential remains absolutely huge  I think that as gold moves back toward previous highs  we re going to see a major revaluation higher for mining stocks  Already  we re seeing hedge funds and big money traditional investors moving into precious metals equities for the first time ever because most other asset classes are so overvalued 

TGR  Which type of mining stock do you like best 
JH  I have a particular affinity for the royalty and streaming sector  Its business model is superior to strictly mining  These companies offer the same upside potential as their mining company partners new discoveries  increased production  etc  but royalty companies have mitigated downside risk because they have fixed costs as per their streaming contracts and aren t exposed to the cost overruns that are commonplace in the mining industry 
TGR  Which streaming company is your favorite 
JH   Sandstorm Gold Ltd   TO SSL   Its market cap is about  800M  and so it has tremendous growth prospects over the next four or five years  I am a big fan of its CEO  Nolan Watson  who was previously CFO of Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW   Although Sandstorm has recently experienced some hiccups  I rate Watson s business acumen very highly and believe the company will bounce back strongly during the next advance in gold 
TGR  What do think of Sandstorm s strategic alliance with Pinecrest Resources Ltd    TSX V  
JH  Sandstorm bought 18  of outstanding Pinecrest shares  As a result  it gets a share of Pinecrest s Enchi gold project  This contains an Inferred resource base of 1 million ounces  1 Moz  gold  is open for expansion in all directions and is located in a mining friendly jurisdiction  Ghana  In addition to buying equity  Sandstorm also gets the right of first refusal on any future streaming deals  which I expect it to pursue aggressively 
In addition  Watson hinted that Sandstorm could for the first time buy entire companies  With the junior sector beaten down and undervalued  having someone like Watson turning companies around could reap huge rewards for Sandstorm and for investors as gold climbs back to  1 800 1 900 oz  Sandstorm has over  100M  zero debt and  100M in an undrawn line of credit  I expect several exciting announcements between now and the end of the year 
TGR  Could you comment on some of the other royalty companies 
JH   Franco Nevada Corp   NYSE FNV  is a more conservative play that I also like  It is better diversified than Sandstorm and has more exposure to platinum and palladium  It s a good stock to have in your portfolio  but investors willing to take on additional risk for greater reward might prefer Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  
TGR  What do you like about Royal 
JH  Sandstorm is up 65  year to date  Royal Gold is up 70   making it one of the few stocks in the precious metals sector outperforming Sandstorm  Royal benefits from the commercial production begun at the Mt  Milligan mine in British Columbia owned by Thompson Creek Metals Co  Inc   TO TCM   one of its streaming partners  During Q1 14 Royal generated income of  20M on revenues of  58M  That s more than triple the income from the same quarter last year despite gold falling around 20   As production continues to ramp up at Mt  Milligan  we should see even greater Royal share appreciation in 2014 
I also like Royal s project pipeline  The company s most recent news is a 6 3  stream on Rubicon Minerals Corp  s  AMEX RBY  Phoenix gold project in Red Lake  Ontario  Royal got this for a  75M investment to finance construction  This is a late stage project  with production expected in mid 2015 and returns for years to come  Royal Gold is a top performer this year  and I expect more of the same to come 
TGR  The Gold Report interviewed Pierre Lassonde  co founder of Franco Nevada  in May  and  that because  the silver space is smaller than the gold space   Silver Wheaton will eventually  run out of runway  and will be forced to compete in the gold space  Do you agree 
JH  I do  And perhaps in additional commodities as well  There is only so much growth Silver Wheaton can achieve strictly in silver  so it makes sense that it branches out into other commodities in search of deals that will be accretive to shareholders 
TGR  What s your favorite non streaming gold company 
JH   Lake Shore Gold Corp   AMEX LSG   I like companies that are high grade and low cost with a strong growth profile  Lake Shore has two mines in commercial production in Ontario  Timmins West and Bell Creek  Expansion of its mill to a capacity of 3 000 tons  3 Kt  per day was completed late last year  Gold production is expected to increase 27  in 2014  and Q2 14 production was a record 53 300 oz  up 70  year to year  Lake Shore is one of the best production growth stories  is located in a mining friendly jurisdiction and has a strong management team  As such  I think it is a potential takeover target for a company like Goldcorp Inc   TO G   so investors could see upside there 
TGR  What s your favorite non streaming silver company 
JH   SilverCrest Mines Inc   TO SVL  in Mexico  This is a high grade epithermal silver producer with low costs  In today s environment  the value of these attributes cannot be stressed enough  The company is in the middle of the expansion plan that is expected to increase production by roughly 50  this year  It has a base case internal rate of return of 88  on its Santa Elena expansion in Sonora  I also like its La Joya property in Durango as a pipeline  it has nearly 200 Moz silver equivalent  Ag eq  
Second quarter production of 412 000 oz Ag eq was down versus a year ago and versus Q1 14  leading to a dip in the share price  This is because Santa Elena began an early transition in Q2 14 from an open pit  heap leach operation to a 3 Kt per day underground and mill operation  I think this provides an excellent opportunity for investors to buy on the dip because Santa Elena has huge potential  and I believe SilverCrest will be one of the top performing silver miners for the next couple of years 
TGR  You mentioned several stocks with huge increases in 2014  Where are we in the cycle  Is the much anticipated bull market finally here 
JH  We re seeing signs that this current advance is different than the breakout attempts that have failed in the past year  Again  I look for mining stocks to outperform the metals  That s usually a sign of strength behind the advance  We ve seen about 3 5 times leverage on the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDX  versus gold itself  I also like to see silver outperforming gold  and we have seen this  by roughly 50  in 2014 
When prices have been beaten down this year  investors have stepped in to buy the dips  so they have rebounded pretty rapidly  I think there are stronger hands holding gold this time around  The current prolonged correction and consolidation over the last two to three years has shaken out a lot of speculators  Those that are left tend to be committed investors that believe in the fundamentals and have long term horizons  Short term price drops don t discourage them and don t lead to panic selling  which would occur with a higher percentage of bandwagon speculators 
All of this is very encouraging  and when you also consider rising geopolitical tensions  the U S  dollar losing ground as world reserve currency and the other fundamental factors we ve mentioned  this tells me that the advance has legs and will likely continue throughout the rest of 2014 and into 2015 
TGR  Presumably  many investors sold in May and went away  What happens in September when they return 
JH  Precious metals are entering their strongest seasonal period of the year  and this is another factor that should lend support in the coming months  As investors return  I expect them to seek value within sectors that haven t reached historically high valuations  I expect a rush into precious metals and precious metals equities  particularly from new investors  And given the relatively small size of the precious metal sector  this could have a huge impact on prices in a relatively short time

11813,233328,RGLD,The Case For Gold  2 000 Today,opinion,"As we put pen to paper in composing this  the 250th consecutive Saturday edition of The Gold Update  my thanks once again to all of you valued readers and to those of you who ve diligently linked to these many missives over the last five years  We haven t always been right  but for our belief in Gold 2000  we wouldn t write   Tis coming  and herein at the conclusion of this week s milestone edition we present our best calculation yet that puts price at  2000 today 
The reality check is that Gold today is not at 2000  rather  tis at  1288 in closing out the week Friday with the ever rising parabolic Long trend still intact  albeit homing in on price such that the yellow metal now has very little downside wiggle room with which to work  for to tap 1270 in the ensuing week would flip such trend to Short  Nonetheless for the second week in a row  Gold dipped its toe into the 1280 1240 support zone  between the purple lines  in the following chart of the weekly bars  and then popped back up 

So with Gold having little downside room with which to deal given its present proximity to the rising weekly parabolic Long trend  concern of such trend flipping to Short    should Gold not put in a robust up week    is underpinned by the state of Gold s  Baby Blues   the dots in the next chart that define 21 day linear regression trend consistency  This three month view of Gold s daily bars in tandem with the Baby Blues  gathering steam to the downside would typically point to lower levels ahead 

But one thing s for certain  Gold s volatility has really compressed from the daily trading ranges exhibited at this time in 2013  One year ago today  Gold at 1396 was only 8  higher than the present 1288 level  but the expected daily trading range   EDTR   then was 24 points between the high and low  today the EDTR is just half that distance at 12 points  Here s the track of the EDTR from one year ago to date  the recent post June spike attributable  in part  to  geo jitters  

 Course  coincident with the settling in of September typically comes the unsettling of other markets at large  and  large  might rightly be the operative adjective for a fall in the S P  which given that negative correlation is still a key  Gold could well greet with glee 

Moreover  mid week courtesy of Bloomy Radio  in the wee hours came an analyst noting the price earnings ratio of the S P   having finally surpassed its own 2000   to be 19x  Were it not for the fact that the time here as of this writing was 02 30  I d have thrown off the covers  snatched up the phone and kindly encouraged them to do the calculation themselves rather than simply parrot what they hear from other sources   short of getting their famous  terminals  to properly do the math  
Those of you scoring at home know the drill   tis simply the summation of 500 factors comprised of each stock s price  divided by its earnings  times its cap weighting in the Index   For companies with no earnings  the price of the stock conservatively satisfies as its p e   Add  em up and at this writing you ll get 37 3x  Bang 
Next let s turn to how Gold is positioned ahead of potentially raucous market weeks if not months to come  In the following two panel graphic we ve matching displays of Gold s daily closes for the last three months to date  Specific to the left panel is Gold vis   vis its smooth  pearly valuation line that compares price s movement relative to those of the primary BEGOS Markets  Bond Euro Gold Oil S P   presently Gold and its valuation line are essentially at the same level   identifiable as well by the oscillator at the foot of the chart  price less valuation   Specific to the right panel is Gold vis   vis its Market Magnet which is the thicker line defining the 10 session contract volume weighted price for each day  and as you can see  Gold and its magnet are identically at 1288  Therefore  Gold is in sync with both of these measures  almost as if poised at the start finish line at a racing circuit in anticipation of the green flag to thus put the pedal to the metal 

With further respect to the Market Magnet in the right hand panel above  here is the current presentation from the data that ultimately drive the magnet  our 10 day Market Profile per the trading volume per price point  with the week s settle  red bar  of 1288 nicely nestled smack in the center of the entire trading range 

Notwithstanding being near term stuck between support and resistance  another trading month has concluded and thus  tis time to compare Gold s year over year percentage price track alongside the usual cast of characters  namely the Gold Bugs Index  HUI   Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index  XAU   the exchange traded fund for the miners  Market Vectors Gold Miners  ARCA GDX  and the rollicking royalty company Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   And as is the norm  the precious metals equities continue to out pace Gold itself two to threefold regardless of direction   RGLD infinitely so  

And now for this edition s finale  the case for Gold 2000 today  Let s first see where we are contextually by bringing up Gold s Structure and key sectors as defined since achieving the All Time High on 06 September 2011  Each  candle  in the chart is a week s worth of trading 

To be sure  there are all sorts of overhead broad based trading sectors of resistance with which to deal  albeit we ve seen Gold make a net gain of as much as 70 points in a single session    9 0  on 17 September 2008   Either way  since the writing of the first Gold Update back in 2009  through these years we ve on occasion made the case that  given Gold is money  it ought be at this price or that price  primarily in  1  correlation to non asset supported sovereign money supplies  the increases in which far out pace any production rate of Gold  and in  2  dependency upon the point in time from which one makes the calculation   And please dispense with the prattle about about Gold s being a non correlated asset  were it so  its price today ought revert back to  35 oz   then further be adjusted for changes in supply and tied to some nominal rate of natural inflation such as that for bubble gum or shoelaces  
Whilst our calculations have comprehensively pointed to higher levels for Gold  we did specifically state in 2011 that price had indeed gotten ahead of itself  So in marking this  our 250th missive with something special  and timely too as would be vacationing readers emerge from the woods   or as dear old Dad used to say  as the Great American Sap tows his boat back from the lake with a mile of cars behind him   as they all morph back into reality this StateSide Labor Day weekend   which in my day meant returning the office in one s tweeds   we now calculate the Gold price as follows 
The Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis provides M2 money supply data all the way back to 1980  That s the maximum amount of readily available data that we ve got and  tis from there we initiate our calculation  So here we have then  and now 
31 October  1980

FRB s level of M2 Money Supply  1 59 trillion
Price of Gold  642 oz 
Global Gold Tonnage 94 000

30 August  2014

FRB s level of M2 Money Supply  11 48 trillion
Price of Gold  1 288 oz 
Global Gold Tonnage 179 000

 Wait a sec  mmb  I already see where yer goin  with this and your  642 from 1980 is way too inflated  cause Gold was still comin  off that  800 bubble  so yer analysis is bogus man    
Now just stay with me  Squire  for you re about to yet again see why  tis I  not you  who makes the responsible effort to go deep inside the numbers  as we re next going to slash that  624 in half 
The Gold tonnage as noted back in 1980 was just 52  of what  tis today  Which in turn is to say that when you ve a lot more of something   tis worth a lot less  Therefore  let s dilute the 1980 price of Gold by multiplying it by 52   et voil   now our  624 basis is instead reduced to  334  which is less than the average price of Gold from 31 October 1980 through any day since then 
The rest is easy  today  the FRB s level of M2 Money Supply is  11 48 trillion  an increase since 1980 of 622   Simply multiply such increase by our diluted 1980 Gold price of  334 and we get  roll of the timpani  crash of the cymbals  amidst heavenly choral harmony    2 077     and yet Gold today is but a lowly  1 288  Should one yet opine that our 1980 basis even as diluted for a larger Gold supply today is still too high  as we ve pointed out in the past  we re not even incorporating into this calculation the burgeoning faux dough contributions of the BOJ  nor those of the PBC  nor from the BOE  nor even from the ECB  the latter which in 1980 had yet be 
 Yeah  mmb  all that fancy schmancy stuff aside  that fact is Gold is only  1 288  bud    
And indeed Squire  as we always assert  price is the truth  To boot  tis determined by supply and demand  Beyond sovereign banks and private sector prudent purchasing in countries such as China and India  the demand for Gold is vapid  But vapid may well be the minds of those who fear not being in expensive equities  the delusional demand driving stock market indices well up and beyond earnings support as noted earlier  However  when it all comes crashing down    and  twill    consider to where the price of Gold might rise were every brokerage account across the land and  round the world tuck a little of the precious metal into its mix  For what might price be were 10  of managed portfolios rather than today s 5   or likely less  therein integrate some Gold  Will you be left on the sidelines  I certainly hope not  Indeed one wonders if the infamous Albert Edwards  notion of Gold topping  10 000 is not so far  literally  fetched after all 
But for today  let s focus on righting the price to  2 000

11814,233329,RGLD,Gold Stock Leaders Continue To Lead,opinion,"There s a serious disconnect going on between the precious metals and some of the leading mining stocks   Take a look here at SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD   having a hard time taking back the 200 dma   It s below both the 50 and the 200 

Now take a look at a mining leader  Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV    FNV has finally just come back to it s 50 dma   It s been holding this moving average for the most part ALL YEAR   Impressive strength in FNV considering gold is still drifting in a Stage 1 base 

Check out Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   it s the same story as FNV   Holding the 50 dma all year long   It s just now retesting the 50 even though gold has been weak for 2 months 

Now check out what s going on in Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  right now   Gold has been correcting from early July until early September   What has NEM been doing   Going up   NEM is holding the 50 and 200 now   NEM doesn t seem to care that gold is correcting   This is interesting because NEM had been weak for most of the year but now it s showing relative strength 

This is interesting stuff because either all of these separate stocks are completely wrong and are about to tank with gold  or they are correctly forecasting an end to the gold bear market   I would bet on the latter  given the fact that they also correctly predicted the start of the gold bear market in 2011 
I think a lot of recent weakness in commodities was due to the surging dollar  but the dollar is due for a break and given the fact that commodities didn t break support on this monster dollar surge I think they are simply retesting their base in anticipation of a new bull market ",2014-09-04,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-stock-leaders-continue-to-lead-224698,224698

Some of the leading gold mining stocks that are falling today include Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Barrick Gold  USA   NYSE ABX   It should be noted that Barrick Gold Corporation is considered to be one of the largest gold mining companies in the world by market capitalization  Barrick Gold Corp stock will have daily chart support around the  15 00 level in the near term ",2014-05-27,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-mining-stocks-look-tarnished-214159,214159
11828,233343,RGLD,Catalysts That Materially Affect Natural Resource Stocks,opinion,"Renowned investor Peter Lynch once said   The person who turns over the most rocks wins the game   All resource investors should be turning over rocks  but who has time to track hundreds of companies  to visit projects  to meet with management  The Gold Report has asked Sprott s Rick Rule  Canaccord Genuity s Joe Mazumdar and Oil   Gas Investments Bulletin s  Keith Schaefer to identify a select group of natural resource companies they feel are poised to make a move before the end of the year  We will be tracking these precious metals and oil and gas companies with game changing catalysts on the newly launched Natural Resources Watchlist 
The Gold Report  A catalyst is identifying a future event that will materially impact a share price for better or for worse  A maiden NI 43 101  Funding from a strategic partner  Permitting and feasibility studies  Before we talk about specific companies  would you tell us what types of companies you follow and why you are following them 
Joe Mazumdar  I primarily cover exploration and development companies in the precious metals sector  There is a difference between catalysts for explorers and for developers  For explorers  it s like buying a lottery ticket we re looking for that drill result  With the developers  the investor audience tends to be more risk averse  They re waiting for the company to meet their bench points  So the companies I cover tend to be the ones that the risk averse invest in  They want this thing to come to function  They need a management team that can raise the funds and put the asset in production 
Keith Schaefer  I follow mostly the junior energy sector in Canada and the U S   looking at both producers and service companies in oil and gas all around North America  Their assets can be anywhere in the world as long as they list them on a reputable exchange in North America  So I m looking for something with some leverage  Leverage does not mean depth  Leverage means either few shares outstanding or a very large land position that hasn t been developed yet that perhaps the market doesn t appreciate  So I look for a pure play with leverage and a great team that has built and sold a company before 
Rick Rule  At Sprott  we have to be a bit broader  We manage about  10 billion in the resource space so we can t be too narrow  We have several preferences  One would be companies that have an unanswered question where we think that a yes answer will give us a ten  or twentyfold return  Sprott is  in part  an alpha shot  and those characteristically are ones that don t have definitive catalysts or else they wouldn t go up in value  What Keith does is of special interest to Sprott  We are looking for oil and gas companies that are new and for converging technologies to unlock access to oil and gas resources where there s no exploration risk but there s exploitation risk  where getting yes answers is repeatable 10 000 or 20 000 times 
The other thing that we really like in markets like this is what we call reality at a discount   200  300 or 400 million   400M  was spent in the last bull market  money that was raised very cheaply  The money delivered a conclusive answer but it didn t deliver a conclusive answer in a timeframe that satisfied a market that has a problem with holding stock long weekends  We also like commodities that are deeply out of favor  ones that sell at discounts to their production cost  In that circumstance  either the cost of the commodity goes up or the commodity becomes unavailable 
TGR  When should an investor accumulate a position leading up to a catalyst 
JM  It depends on the catalyst  If it s something happening with development plays in a recovery  it all depends on the market s thinking  If you re waiting for a permitting decision  permitting risk is the issue  For feasibility studies  we all make estimations and forecasts as to what those will look like  So already embedded in the market is an expectation  The issue is does it meet or not meet that expectation  That s really where you have to depend on the management team to meet that expectation  A lot of the risks for mining development companies are about meeting expectations and potentially surpassing them 
TGR  Keith  are the catalysts the same in oil and gas investing as they are in hard rock mining 
KS  The reality is that both games are about production and reserves  On the exploration side  a drill hole and a reserve report would be major catalysts  One thing that investors can take some comfort in is  despite all the nuances between the industries  it really does come down to production and reserves and finding a team that has done it before  So on the junior side  the catalysts are very similar 
TGR  When do you believe an investor should start to accumulate a position leading up to a catalyst 
KS  Three things  The time factor  How much time before the catalyst  The further away the catalyst is  the more likely you are to buy the stock in advance to take advantage of any speculative premium  Two  what s the downside of that catalyst not happening  That s where I really want to find a catalyst that s basically for free  Then the other thing I want to know is how well known is this catalyst on the Street because if I m reading it in a research report that has just gone to 6 000 retail clients  chances are I m not going to play that catalyst nearly as much because everybody knows about it  But if I ve been digging around myself and figured out a catalyst in advance of the Street  then I m way more apt to buy the catalyst 
TGR  Rick  when should we accumulate a position 
RR  I m perpetually early  I would say that irrespective of the nature of the business with regard to catalysts  you re better off buying in a bear market rather than in a bull market because the price of success and the price of failure is lower  But it depends  and I think Keith gave a very good answer to the question  It depends on the nature of the catalyst and its importance to you  If you re a large institutional investor  moves in the market don t matter  You have to be right  which means that the only catalyst that really matters to is a takeover because if you buy Sprott sized positions  you only have one way out 
A lot of what I do is invest in prospect generators  process and being willing to take advantage of the time arbitrage  Convergence in technologies proves up a large acreage spread where you can project success to over 10 000 locations is a catalyst that becomes apparent to somebody who works  but it isn t apparent to the broad market until it sees it s on a report of financial statements  The type of catalysts that one pays attention to has a lot to do with one s disposition and temperament as a speculator  and it varies from person to person 
TGR  Traditionally  stock prices have been driven by news  but in the current environment  some companies aren t getting the bumps that they would expect from the catalysts that they deliver  Why is that  Do you see that changing 
JM  In my sector  we ve seen over the past few years some people selling into the news  There might be a positive event as expected  but the stock actually trades down because people are selling to look for the next one  With quality stocks  we ve seen positive news have positive impacts 
KS  In the oil and gas space  we ve actually almost had the opposite problem where catalysts are getting priced in immediately  and they re getting priced in two years in advance  The leading stocks in Canada make no sense whatsoever on current metrics  These are companies that have the lowest profit margins  and  yet  they have the highest valuations 
Why is that  Because they re pricing in the catalysts two years in advance  They re saying there won t be any negative surprises because gas prices now are at absolutely rock bottom  and I totally trust this team to meet its numbers every single quarter for the next three years 
That s where you see a big difference between the hard rock and the soft rock sides  On the oil and gas side  catalysts are being priced in really fast for the simple reason  as Rick has said  this new technology has brought in an entirely new industry  That says it s very low risk and we re going to take that to the bank two to three years out 
RR  This discussion about stocks moving on news and the fact that they re not moving on news  to me  is a real blessing  It means that the analyst can buy reality at a discount  You can have time to study the data and make an informed decision  In good markets  you don t have that luxury  You have to anticipate the market s reaction to news  So when you ask how long it s going to last  my hope as a check writer is that it lasts forever  The process right now is rational  as it was in 1998 2002  as opposed to irrational 
The greatest investor today  Warren Buffett  famously said you shouldn t buy the stock if you didn t know it well enough that you would be delighted to see it fall in price 30  in two weeks after you bought it so you could buy it more cheaply  Sadly  I ve tested that thesis dozens of times in my career  but the truth is that it speaks to the market that we re in  We re in a market that s rational  Of course  maybe that s why medical marijuana is so popular right now  People don t want rational expectations 
KS  All the stocks in my sector  oil and gas  have had a hell of a run  and this is a pretty difficult time to be dipping your toe in the water  It s been undergoing a six week plateau correction  About 10 days ago we started to see some upward movement  but most of these stocks have run anywhere from 50 100  since the beginning of February  In my sector  this is traditionally not a smart time to be buying  You want to wait probably another month to see really what s happening  But we ve seen a lot more seasonal strength than I would think  To be going whole hog into something right now is really difficult 
TGR  Joe  can you tell us which companies with pending catalysts you ve identified for our Watchlist 
JM  We cover Dalradian Resources Inc   TO DNA   which has Curraghinalt  a high grade underground gold project in Northern Ireland  We ve had a few derisking encounters recently  We had a recent resource update  which lifted the Measured and Indicated resource  We re expecting a revised scoping study  and it s starting to do a bulk tonnage program over the next year or so  Curraghinalt s head grades are about 8 grams per ton  8 g t  diluted 
The big thing about Northern Ireland that people might have an issue with is permitting  The issue is the usage of cyanide in those types of work  What we tried to do in our modeling is remove the use of cyanide  The underground bulk tonnage permit that Dalradian already has goes a long way to permitting the future underground operation  The company has a market cap of around  90M and about  17M of working capital right now 
The other company that we recently initiated on is Rubicon Minerals Corp   AMEX RBY   It has a market cap of about  370M and working capital of about  180M  It has the Phoenix gold project  a significant land package in Ontario s Red Lake district  which is one of the cornerstones for Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG   Rubicon came out with a derisking scoping study in August 2013  It managed to attract a gold stream with Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  of  75M and will complete a bought deal  Right now  Rubicon has a drill program of 38 000 meters  38 000m  going on there  We expect production by H2 15 
Another company has a high grade gold project in Burkina Faso  West Africa Roxgold Inc   TO ROG   It has a market cap of  179M and working capital of about  35M  It has the Yaramoko project with 16 700 hectares  16 700 ha  in Burkina Faso  The 55 zone is where it has the feasibility study  We re expecting permitting soon pending financing  so production there in 2016 
The other two that I will put forward are exploration companies that we don t cover but we like  One is Cayden Resources Inc   OTC CDKNF   It has a big land package in central Mexico  Its project is called El Barque o  with 46 400 ha of ground  It s a low sulphidation gold project that it just started a significant gold program on  We should be getting drill results over the summer  It s relatively shallow and very amenable to open pit  On May 14  Cayden announced some intersections of 26m and 2 35 g t 
The other one I ll point out is Cordoba Minerals Corp   TO CDB   The company has a market cap of around  40M and working capital of about  10M  Cordoba is looking for gold rich copper porphyrys in Colombia  I ve been down to the Mid Cauca Belt  and I wasn t overly impressed with the ability to permit there  This project though looks like the northern extension of the same structure  but it s basically Caribbean  at a much lower elevation and closer to active open pit mines  which is really unusual in Colombia  It s an early days exploration play  It has a significant land package  25 780 ha  and a big drilling program from June through December 
TGR  Keith  let s talk about some oil and gas companies  What companies have you outlined 
KS  I have four companies in mind  Two are service companies and two are producers  When we think about service companies in the energy patch  we think about drillers  frackers and the big mainstream types of companies  but these two are a little oddball  They re on the periphery  That s the opportunity because the mainstream really hasn t discovered them yet  One is called rdx Technologies Corp   TO RDX   It has a technology that takes all the energy out of waste fluid streams  It can pull energy out of restaurant waste streams  It can pull energy out of oil and gas waste streams and turn that into No  4 diesel fuel at a lower cost than mainstream uses  There are a couple of catalysts coming up 
Rdx started a new program that it is franchising across the U S  It has one big facility in Carthage  Missouri  that s cash flow positive  It s improving the business model  What it s able to do now is set a franchisee up for about  1M  It is doing its first five franchisees  We re going to hear back on this company probably sometime late summer on how these first few are doing  If rdx can show the market that these five are up and running and generating some positive cash flow for the franchisee and for rdx  it s a cookie cutter model that can be replicated very quickly  So that is something that I think the Street can latch on to 
The other catalyst here is rdx is hoping to finish the sale of its facility in Los Angeles  which will net it  5M  That won t give it enough cash to grow but will allow it to get a bank line  So we see greatly increasing funding available to it  With the two catalysts  the sale should happen literally any day  and we should get our first meaningful update on the franchisee program in late August 
The other one is a company called NXT Energy Solutions Inc   TO SFD   It has a neat technology that is proven out in the field where it can tell where the reservoirs are for oil and gas  and if the reservoir has been breached  which means it can tell if there s fluid present  It can t tell if the fluid is oil or gas or water  but it can tell you the fluid is there  It s 5  the cost of seismic  so it s a huge advantage  particularly for frontier exploration 
NXT is in the seventh or eighth inning of signing three or four contracts that are big enough to materially change this company  Investors have been waiting for little over a year for a big contract  It has been getting small ones here and there  It had a bunch of warrants exercised and is cashed up  Its balance sheet is in great shape  Getting these contracts over the finish line in the next three months would be something that would really make a difference for this company and  I think  change its image in the market  That should happen by the end of August 
The other two companies are both producers  One is Chinook Energy Inc   TO CKE   It has one of the top management teams in Calgary  it s valuation has been masked by the fact that 20  of its production is in Tunisia  In the last few years Tunisia has not been one of the hot spots in the world for oil production  So Chinook suffered through a huge discounted valuation 
Canadian production usually gets valued in the market today around 8x cash flow  international production gets valued at about 2x cash flow  or  if you re lucky  3x 
There s a huge disconnect in value there and the Street has forgotten really who it is  that Chinook has one of the top teams in Calgary  The industry will value it much higher than the market will  This team should be able to sell that Tunisian asset  2 000 barrels a day  2 Mbpd   for about  80M  I think the sale is imminent  this sale could cause a dramatic revaluation of that company  Most of the Street has a pretty good idea of who the buyer is  and we re just waiting for this to happen 
That sale will leave Chinook with net cash of around  50M  an asset based in Canada and a team that really knows how to extract value both out of the ground and in the market  Chinook s management team comes from the Storm group of companies  and Storm has had three or four iterations that evolved and have done very well for shareholders  Right now  its sister company  Storm Resources Ltd   TO SRX   trades at 11x cash flow  which is crazy  But that s what happens when you have a good team develop a good asset in Canada  Chinook s Tunisian assets should get sold in the next quarter  which would be a big jump for it 
The second company is a big Permian play down in Texas called Lynden Energy Corp   OTC LVLEF   There are three big catalysts that all could happen very quickly  One  Lynden could sell its Wolfberry assets  which it has been marketing  Two  the first horizontal drill into these assets has just happened  It s being drilled by one of the best operators in the business  a company called Diamondback Energy Inc   NASDAQ FANG   FANG NASDAQ   The third is that Lynden is drilling its own first vertical well in a big asset called Mitchell Ranch  It has a 50  interest on 100 000 acres  Getting that big a land package for that small a company is stunning  If this well hits  it s a game changer for the company 
TGR  What s the timeframe on the news 
KS  The two wells have been spud already  We should see that within two months for sure  The sale of the Wolfberry assets is totally up in the air  That s a  130M deal  so it will take time 
TGR  Rick  what companies have you outlined for today 
RR  This is truly a target rich environment  but we don t think in six month terms  One of the things that s interesting to me is how many of my potential names have been used up by this panel  People need to be more investment oriented and less speculatively oriented  My belief is where we are in the market  that is  a cyclical decline of the secular bull market  many people would be well advised to buy the very  very best companies in the industry and look at a return with raw materials as the catalyst  In that regard  you d then buy names like Randgold Resources Ltd   NASDAQ GOLD   Goldcorp  PotashCorp   NYSE POT   Cameco Corp   NYSE CCJ   In 2000 2001 we could buy BHP Billiton Ltd   NYSE BHP  at  12 without too much downside  knowing that the upside was equivalent to a penny stock  I would say buy the very best  wait five years and then come back and chuckle and say thank you to me 
I m going to name one big stock  an oil and gas company called Devon Energy Corp   NYSE DVN   where I have a natural gas warrant  The company has 100 000 oil shale drilling locations in the U S  that are proven with existing economics and existing technology and a rapidly improving balance sheet  That s my sensible pick 
Then I m going to be nonsensible  and I m going to talk about one that everybody hates Ivanhoe Mines Ltd   TO IVN   where the catalyst is Robert Friedland not dying  which I don t think will happen 
My top pick is really self serving  My biggest single position  conflicts of interest up and down  if the natural resource market responds in the next five years the way I think it will  is Sprott Inc   TO SII   The leverage to the upside is that we have  340M in cash on the balance sheet with  50M year free cash generation  if the resource market does half as well as I think it will  it s going to be stupidly pleasant 
TGR  Thank you for identifying these companies  Any parting thoughts 
RR  This is my fifth cycle  I can t tell you when a recovery is going to take place  but I can tell you that it is going to take place  Day follows night  This market may take 12 months to recover  It may take 18 months to recover  Good markets are going to come back just as good markets came back in 2002 2003  We ll be having a very different discussion then  The truth is tiny companies  as long as they survive for two or three years  as long as they have reasonable properties and a management team that has enough respectability on the Street to catch a bid  are going to triple  The catalyst that you need to happen is the normal insanity around mining stocks to return halfway  That s all that you need  I just can t tell you when 
TGR  Thank you all for your time  and good luck

11830,233345,RGLD,Van Eck Fund Manager Joe Foster Is Building For The Upswing,opinion,"Lackluster gold should find some of its sparkle in the second half of 2014  according to Joe Foster  fund manager at Van Eck Associates  The prospect of loosened import and tax restrictions in India is one potential catalyst  and stabilization in the exchange traded funds is another positive  He shares with The Gold Report his perspective on the likely state of merger and acquisition activity in the gold equity space this year  and discusses companies positioned to ride the upswing 
The Gold Report  Gold has been hovering between  1 250 and  1 300 ounce   1 300 oz   How have supply and demand factors shifted since earlier in the year  when things seemed more bullish 
Joe Foster  At the beginning of the year  gold was being driven by risk concerns  Investors started worrying about risk when we saw problems in emerging markets like Thailand  Turkey and  eventually  Ukraine  The Chinese economy seemed to be slowing down 
It was less of a supply demand story and more one of people looking at gold as a safe haven and a hedge against some of the risks in the world 
TGR  Is the world less risky now than it was three months ago JF  I don t think so  but these things move in phases  Since then  the stock market is hitting new all time highs  and people have become complacent again  The market is not that worried about risk right now 
TGR  You have talked about the impact of exchange traded funds  ETFs  on the market  Do you see demand coming back for ETFs any time soon JF  I think the ETFs have stabilized  We saw inflows into the bullion ETFs early in 2014  We have seen some outflows the last couple of months  The best we can say is that ETFs have stabilized  the relentless selling pressure of last year is gone 
TGR  Has the rise of ETFs added volatility to the market that wasn t there five years ago JF  I don t think so  Gold has always been a relatively volatile market  The ETFs have added depth to the market  and they ve brought people into the market who probably would not have been there otherwise 
TGR  A lot of people are saying that China  while still growing  is growing at a slower pace  Will that change in the near future JF  I m not an expert on China  but I know a little about what drives gold demand in China  We have to look at two things  One is the wealth effect and the growing upper and middle classes in China  That creates demand for gold as an investment and as jewelry 
The second angle is gold as an investment asset  The Chinese don t have very many places to put their money outside of real estate  stocks and gold  Even in a weak economy  gold is a safe investment 
TGR  If India relaxes its import restrictions  as rumored  what impact could that have on the gold price and  by extension  the mining equities  JF  If India should relax its gold taxation and its import restrictions  the impact could be big in H2 14  There is a lot of pent up demand in India  That s one of the catalysts we re looking for as we move through H2 14 
TGR  Could that move gold up as much as 5  or 10   If gold increased that much  how long would it take to move the gold mining stock prices up JF  One of the things missing over the past year was the seasonal pattern brought on by Indian demand  If we have a normal fall season in India  we would expect a stronger gold market moving into the fall and year end 
I m not sure about putting a number on that effect  With normal Indian demand  I could see the gold price at  1 300 oz  even  1 400 oz is not out of the question 
As far as gold stocks go  they re strongly correlated with gold  Where gold goes  the stocks will follow  I m convinced of that  If we see strength in the gold market going into year end  that will be reflected in the stocks 
TGR  A lot more mines are economic at  1 400 oz than they are at  1 250 oz  aren t they JF  Definitely  A lot of mines are struggling at current gold prices 
TGR  When we last talked  you were bullish on the prospects for the midtier and small cap stocks  Is that still your sweet spot JF  We still like those companies  Even at current prices  we re finding companies that can grow  This year  we ve had some exciting mergers and acquisitions  M A  activity that has panned out for us 
TGR  You re talking about the Osisko Mining Corp   OTC OSKFF  deal JF  Osisko  yes  but we just had an announcement that Papillon Resources Ltd   ASX PIR  is being taken out by B2Gold Corp  B2Gold Corporation  AMEX BTG  and Sulliden Gold Corp   TO SUE   We hold all of those stocks 
TGR  Is this the start of a lot more M A JF  It s possible  but I don t think this year will be any different than the last couple of years  In the current environment  a lot of companies are undervalued  Management doesn t want to sell their companies if they re at low valuations  I think this will be a below average M A year 
TGR  So far this year  how are the stocks in the Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund doing 
JF  The fund is up 11  year to date  though it doesn t feel like it  because all the positive momentum from early in the year has dissipated  That said  to be up 11  when gold s at  1 244 oz is an accomplishment  The stocks so far this year are outperforming gold  We ve been looking for that for quite some time 
TGR  That s very impressive  What have been the top performers JF  Osisko  because of the takeover opportunity  has been a great performer  Other M A targets like Papillon have also done very well 
Also  the royalty companies  Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  and Franco Nevada Corp   NYSE FNV  have done well for us  In the junior stocks  Roxgold Inc   TO ROG  has performed well 
TGR  When you re looking at companies like Roxgold and Papillon  are you looking for geographic diversification or for individual companies that might have catalysts and good prospects JF  It s a process that looks at quite a few things  First we look at company management and the location of the properties to determine if there is any geopolitical risk  If there is geopolitical risk  we want to know how the management will deal with it 
Once we get comfortable with where the properties are located  it s all about the geology  the metallurgy and the engineering for the jurisdiction  It comes down to whether we think it can become a profitable mine in the future  or an attractive acquisition target for a larger company 
TGR  Do you want to talk about any of your Top 10 companies JF  Tahoe Resources Inc   NYSE TAHO  is one  it s another good performer  It has done a fantastic job starting its mine in Guatemala  It s becoming one of the dominant midtier silver producers 
TGR  Have you held Tahoe for a long time  JF  We ve held Tahoe pretty much since the company was created 
TGR  Are most of your holdings long term  How much do you change the portfolio every year JF  We have very low turnover  We do a lot of due diligence  Once a company gets into our portfolio  we tend to hold it  As long as the company is doing the right things and creating value  we become very long term shareholders 
TGR  What smaller holdings do you have  perhaps companies that are just starting to get traction JF  I would put Klondex Mines Ltd   OTC KLNDF  in that category  It s developing some high grade  underground properties in Nevada that we re excited about  It has a great management team 
TGR  When you visited the Klondex site  what excited you JF  It came down to the geology very high grade  near vertical veins and it looked as if the mining isn t that complicated for an underground mine  The continuity of the veins and the overall geology of the deposit are such that it could become a very profitable underground operation 
TGR  Do you have some recent additions to the portfolio JF  We added Cayden Resources Inc   OTC CDKNF  and Castle Mountain Mining Co  Ltd   TO CMM  to the portfolio this year  Both are works in progress  Cayden is doing some drilling  which we hope will prove meaningful 
Castle Mountain is redeveloping a property in California  It is doing studies  still figuring out the best way to go about it 
Both companies are working through issues  whether they be metallurgical or strip ratios or finding more ounces  Whatever the issues  they re robust properties that will enable them to create value as they develop 
TGR  Before you bring on a company  do you visit the site JF  Not always  but we do a lot of traveling  It just depends on the situation 
TGR  Are there any other companies you want to call out from the portfolio  JF  Others that we think could become acquisition targets include Continental Gold Ltd   OTC CGOOF   Its project in Colombia looks really promising  a multimillion ounce deposit 
Torex Gold Resources Inc   TO TXG  has a Mexican property under development  That will be a big mine  and the project may become an acquisition target  Even if it doesn t  it will become a core cash flow generator for Torex 
TGR  You have given our readers lots of good ideas to think about  With all that s happened in H1 14  how are you adjusting your portfolio to prepare for H2 14 
JF  I think the market is in the process of finding a bottom  Gold will probably struggle through the summer  but I think  1 200 oz should prove to be a solid floor under the gold price 
While we re in this bottoming process  we want to prepare the portfolio for the next upswing in the gold market  That s what we re doing now  using these times when gold has fallen out of favor to position ourselves in companies and get ready for the next upswing 
TGR  Makes sense  Joe  Thanks for your time and your insights

11831,233346,RGLD,Is It 2003 Again  Frank Holmes Predicts A Renewed Love Trade For Gold,opinion,"Close your eyes  Imagine India growing and importing gold again freely  China and the U S  investing in infrastructure  Europe stable  The Middle East conflict free  What would that mean for commodities  In this interview with The Gold Report  U S  Global Investors CEO Frank Holmes outlines the developments that could move us toward that vision and the impact that scenario could have on gold  diamonds and steel 
The Gold Report  You recently wrote an article called  It s Morning in India  that marked the election of Narendra Modi s pro business government  How much of an impact can one man have on the demand for commodities 
Frank Holmes  At U S  Global Investors  we believe that government policies are a precursor to change  That is why we focus on fiscal policies all over the world to understand the impact they will have on everything from interest rates to money supply  What makes Modi special is that he understands that job growth and creativity come from fiscal stimulus  Creating tax free zones  breaking up monopolies and streamlining regulations and bureaucracy can unleash intellectual capital  Modi s track record in the state of Gujarat illustrates his ability to produce significant growth  He is a no nonsense  pro business person 
TGR  Let s look at what you have called the love trade  Its traditional seasonal impact on the gold market was quashed by taxation and import bans  How much of an effect could the pent up demand have on the gold price if the government eliminates those disincentives 
FH  India is a big market and it can have a big impact  There is a high correlation of rising per capita GDP in China and India and rising consumption of gold for gift giving  In the past three years  global GDP has shrunk from 5 5  to 3   This year  it looks as if it is going to be back up to 3 5   Growth and prosperity in America creates an economic sounding board that creates money around the world  Add to that the demand created by the religious holidays in the second half of the year first Ramadan and then wedding and Diwali seasons  followed by Christmas and Chinese New Year and it looks very positive 
Even JPMorgan Chase s Global PMI  the Purchasing Managers  Index  is looking up  The forecast of the next six months of economic activity shows the 1 month above the 3 month average  When that happens  consumption usually increases significantly in all commodities 
TGR  Let s quantify the term  significantly   Are we talking about a 2  increase  A 10  increase  More 
FH  Well  that s hard to say  but I have a suspicion that gold can easily jump 30   up two standard deviations  because it s been down two standard deviations  Meanwhile  gold stocks are cheaper today than they were during the crisis of 2008  relative to the price of gold  So if we have a 30  increase in the price of the gold over the next 12 months  the gold stocks could rally 60   For that to happen  we would have to see peace and prosperity in China  India  Southeast Asia and the Middle East  because that really triggers the consumption of gold 
TGR  How do you determine what companies in your portfolio are poised to do well if the gold price increases 
FH  Quality of management is a key factor  We look for technical engineers and geologists  but also at whether leadership understands the capital markets and has relationships with newsletter writers  buy side and sell side analysts  Those companies that have those relationships when they come out with news will enjoy a better response in the capital markets  So the quality of senior management is very important 
Our investment philosophy is driven more by the quality of the company rather than by leverage to the gold price 
We love Virginia Mines Inc   TO VGQ   It s a high quality  low risk exploration and royalty company managed by Andr  Gaumond  who has an incredible track record  He knows all the newsletter writers  he knows all of the sell side and buy side analysts  and the company owns a role in Goldcorp Inc  s  BA GG  high grade  l onore project  which he found and is slated to go into production in late 2014 
Another low risk  high grade gold producing company that we see as having significant upside is Klondex Mines Ltd   TO KDX   At the beginning of the year  Klondex Mines completed what we think is a transformational transaction with the purchase of Midas mine and mill from Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM   Management is highly respected  At one time  Franco Nevada Corp   NYSE FNV  owned the Midas mine  Klondex Mines and Virginia Mines delivered 6  and 20  returns in 2013 when the Market Vectors Gold Miners Exchange Traded Fund  ARCA GDX  was down 60   That is impressive 
TGR  What is the next catalyst for Klondex Mines 
FH  We see the value in the Midas project facilities  That s the catalyst  Once you unleash that and the quality of management and its ability to communicate its future growth  it could have an impact 
Another high grade name with strong performance is MAG Silver Corp   AMEX MVG   which has two projects in Mexico 
TGR  MAG Silver just released a new resource estimate for the Juanicipio mine  Did that meet your expectations 
FH  MAG s 44  share is 71 million ounces grading 601 grams per ton silver  That makes MAG Silver stock very desirable right now  We think it could get taken over at some point 
Another company that we like is NGEx Resources Inc   TO NGQ   It s got a great promoter  Lucas Lundin as chairman  and it s led by well known CEO Wojtek Wodzicki  Los Helados  Filo del Sol and Josemaria are major copper gold porphyry deposits between Chile and Argentina with tremendous upside  Lucas Lundin is not afraid of drilling up something and selling it  A lot of time management falls in love with the asset and the value never gets unlocked  We like the way NGEx s management thinks 
TGR  All three of these stocks are up since the beginning of the year  Do you credit that to management 
FH  Absolutely  They are always communicating  We don t have to hunt them down to find out about a press release or news  The top analysts and fund managers know what they are doing  That proactive attitude creates trust in a personal or a professional relationship 
TGR  What are some other performers in your portfolio 
FH  One thing that is very important for stability in a portfolio is the royalty companies  Sandstorm Gold Ltd   ARCA SAND   Franco Nevada  Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD   and Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  are all up this year 
Royal Gold has been the big champ  Last year  Franco Nevada was the leader  Silver Wheaton was able to borrow  1 billion   1B  for five years at 1 6   That is unbelievable  Why would you ever want to own Newmont Mining or Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX   when you can own Franco Nevada  It has 60  gross profit margins and a royalty on all those operations  You don t have to worry about all the fiascos or leveraged balance sheets  Management owns a big portion of the company  Franco pays dividends on a regular basis  Just consider revenue per employee  which is  50 million   50M   In most companies   500 000 revenue per employee is good 
Today  royalty companies function like mining finance houses  That s a great business model  That is why they are one of the core holdings for any portfolio 
TGR  Is this an important time for royalty companies because there is such a desperate need for capital 
FH  Capital markets are broken  Regulations are so excessive for junior mining companies that it is increasingly difficult to just walk in with a beautiful piece of property in Quebec and raise money  Therefore  private equity and royalty companies are very significant for junior mining companies right now 
We are seeing a shake up  Weak properties and weak management are just not going to get funded  Great management and great properties can go to Franco Nevada or Royal Gold or Silver Wheaton and really advance their projects 
TGR  Your Gold and Precious Metals Fund  USERX  did very well at the beginning of the year considering the market  You re up 11 83  compared to the last 12 months when it was down 32   Is that upswing a sustainable trend 
FH  It s all about concentration  Alpha comes from two things  a  the ability to pick better companies  and b  overweight them relative to any index 
If an index is 5  Franco Nevada and I have 15  for my portfolio  I m three times overweight the index and that stock outperforms  That is how I ve massively outperformed the index  Conversely  underperformance comes from overweighting in a very poor stock  Our alpha is coming from focusing on the companies that I mentioned  like MAG Silver  Virginia Mines  NGEx Resources  and balancing those volatile names with the royalty companies 
TGR  Does the same logic hold in other commodities 
FH  The other commodity we love is diamonds  We love Lucara Diamond Corp   TO LUC   which is another Lucas Lundin company  For less than  50M  he got his money back in a year  It s really simple math  We now have seven billion people on earth and if even 1  of those people experience a dramatic rise in per capita GDP and they all buy luxury goods  that is a boon for companies like LVMH Mo t Hennessy Louis Vuitton S A   PARIS LVMH   which currently has a market cap bigger than Goldman Sachs Group Inc  We own Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  because when things start to get better  people want nice things 
Disruptive technologies are making millionaires and billionaires out of a concentrated percentage of the population like Dr  Dre and the five people behind WhatsApp 
TGR  Well  this isn t as sexy  but what about nickel and steel 
FH  Nickel is much more of a straightforward supply demand story  Nickel is used in alloying steel  including the steel that will be used in the  550B pipeline China is building to Russia  If there is a supply shortage out of South Africa and mines shut down in North America  the price could immediately go up  Copper levitated a couple of years back even though the economy had slowed because earthquakes and strikes impacted the supply  If we get any type of supply constraints  then prices could change quickly 
Right now  we have an oversupply of steel  The Chinese have been dumping steel on the world  But that pipeline agreement with Russia could be a signal that the country is embarking on an infrastructure boom that will absorb a lot of the steel  Combined with Modi s infrastructure ambitions in India  that could mean a lot more demand for steel and copper 
TGR  Are you predicting the same significant impact as in gold  a couple standard deviations 
FH  I think we have the potential for one of those great global rallies we witnessed in 2003  2004 and 2005  If China and India start building meaningful projects for their people and we get a bottom in Europe  with America on an upswing  I think that we could see a global surge  It s not going to be as inflated as it was in 2003 because the housing component is not going to be as leveraged  Housing has the highest multiplying effect for money because so many people touch each dollar to create a house  Therefore  I don t think we re going to get close to the surge we had 10 years ago  but I do think we can get at least three quarters of that 
TGR  Your Holmes Macro Trends Fund  MEGAX  is a diverse basket of industrial  energy  technology  healthcare  consumer product and financial stocks that are impacted by the macro issues you just outlined  What criteria do you use for building that portfolio 
FH  We look at companies that are actively growing their revenue more than 10   generating bottom line up to 20  return on their equity  and demonstrating 20  growth in earnings 
As John Derrick described in his Periodic Table of Sector Returns  we can learn a lot by examining movement in the top sectors  This is an amazing indicator  We track quarterly how many S P 1500 companies across all sectors qualify for this beauty contest  This past March the number went from 160 names to 180 names even though GDP was down in America  That shows wonderful  broad based economic growth  Back in the peak of 2006  it was over 200 names  then it fell down to under 100 names  So it is going in the right direction 
Another positive is that industrials are strong  and that is usually highly correlated to the consumption of commodities and good for per capita GDP because wages are typically more than  15 hour in that sector 
TGR  More than half of the Macro Trends Fund is composed of large cap  over  10B companies  Are you worried about a bubble in the large indexes 
FH  The word bubble has been abused  If you research the causes of a true bubble  it s usually excessive leverage  borrowing  The great crash of 1987 when investors lost 40  of their wealth in two days was predominantly because the S P futures market was leveraged 10 1  In the crash of 2008  we had a housing market leveraged 90 1  Today  there is some concern about leveraged buyouts  but governments are going to have to keep interest rates negative or extremely low to counter regulatory creep and keep the economy moving 
TGR  So you think today s stock prices correlate to the true value in the companies 
FH  Sure they do  Look at dividend yields  A 10 year government bond is 2 5   and you can buy some of these big cap stocks with a dividend yield greater than 10 years out  We don t know who will be president 10 years from now  but we do know we will still be using Procter   Gamble s products and drinking Coca Cola 
Plus  fewer companies are issuing stock options  Instead they are giving executives stock grants over five years so there s a real aligned interest for senior management in these companies to buy back their stock  and increase their dividends against their cash flow  Look at Apple Inc   NASDAQ AAPL   It announced a 20  buyback  revenue per share is jumping 20   That s profound  There are very few IPOs relative to companies buying back their stock and increasing their dividend  That means the stock market is still very attractive

11832,233347,RGLD,Mining Cycles Are Good for Royalty Companies And Investors,opinion,"Pierre Lassonde revolutionized investing with the creation of the first gold royalty company  Three decades later  he is as confident in this model as ever  especially considering the difficulties of the majors in discovering large  high grade reserves  In this interview with The Gold Report  this director and former chairman of the World Gold Council discusses the significance of the shift in gold ownership from West to East  the problem of mining scale and the results of the industry s failure to develop new prospecting technology 
The Gold Report  You wrote  The Gold Book  The Complete Investment Guide to Precious Metals  in 1990  What have been the biggest changes in gold investment since then 
Pierre Lassonde  The first biggest change is the development of gold exchange traded funds  ETFs   They began in 2004 and went from zero all the way up to over 2 650 tons of gold  Ownership is now down about one third  but that s still about 1 750 tons of gold held by this instrument 

The second biggest change is the rise of the royalty companies  Franco Nevada Corp   NYSE FNV  started as a royalty company in 1985  Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  started about 10 years later  Silver Wheaton Corp   NYSE SLW  started in the early 2000s  These companies combined have gone from zero to well over  20 billion   20B  of market cap today  at their peak they were around  30B 
The third major change is the astounding decoupling of gold equities from the gold price  The latter went from  250 per ounce   250 oz  in 2001 to just over  1 900 oz in 2011  In turn  the gold equities rose  but nowhere near the percentage the gold price did  This decoupling has hurt gold producers tremendously 

TGR  Some argue that ETFs are responsible for this decoupling because they allow people to invest in gold without buying physical bullion or gold mining shares  Do you agree PL  Not at all  In the 1970s  after the gold price went up  earnings and dividends went up  as did the shares of gold equities  The margin expansion that enabled this has disappeared  This is 90  of the reason gold equities have decoupled  It is a self inflicted wound and nothing to do with gold ETFs 
TGR  Some people deprecate gold ETFs as paper gold  arguing that it has the same problems as fiat currency  How do you respond PL  I can speak only to the SPDR Gold Shares ETF  ARCA GLD   the instrument created by the World Gold Council  WGC   I was very much involved in its creation  The documents that established it state clearly that every ounce of gold bought on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  must be backed by an ounce of physical gold 
I have been in the vaults of HSBC in London and seen the  60B in gold there  As far as the SPDR Gold Shares ETF is concerned  these claims of  paper gold  are complete fantasy  SPDR Gold Shares is physical gold  It trades on the NSYE to make it easy for people to buy and sell  Before ETFs  it was very difficult to buy gold and selling was an ordeal 
TGR  When gold topped  1 900 oz in September 2011  many goldbugs believed that  based on macroeconomic considerations  the price would top  3 000 oz and beyond  Was that view wrong  overstated or ahead of its time PL  It was clearly wrong when we look at what happened  That view was based on the idea that the Federal Reserve was issuing so much paper that significant inflation would appear shortly  and that  in turn  would boost the gold price up and up and up  Three years later  we still don t see any inflation  What these people forgot is that the velocity of money fell tremendously in 2008 and has never really recovered  The money being created by the Fed is being sat on by the banks 
TGR  After the gold price collapsed last year  many quoted John Maynard Keynes  assessment of gold as a  barbarous relic   What do you make of that  PL  Tell that to the Indians and the Chinese who last year bought over 2 800 tons in physical gold  mostly for jewelry and gifting  The last 10 years has seen a huge gold transfer from the West to the East  People in the West look at Western statistics and argue that the price of gold must collapse  They forget we are no longer the No  1 market in gold in the world  Chindia is  China and India  Those are the No  1 and No  2 gold markets in the world 

Last year  we saw about 900 tons of gold come out of the ETFs  We saw 400 tons of gold come out of the COMEX  Goldman Sachs predicted that gold was going to  900 oz  But at  1 250 oz  the Chinese and the Indians stuck their hands out and said they would take it all  Gold then stabilized at  1 250 oz 

TGR  You re a director of the World Gold Council  WGC   which publishes research on global trends in the gold space  Which factors now control the price of gold  Where do you see its price going PL  As I mentioned  the largest gold markets are China and India  China has 300 500 million people entering the middle class  which has a huge affinity for gold  The situation in India is similar  So the Chinese and Indians will determine the gold price 
TGR  You said that you see the gold price going sideways  Short term or long term  PL  Short term  I think  We re not seeing the kind of disgorgement from the ETFs and the COMEX that we had last year  Inventories are building up  In the short term  June and July are normally the two softest months of the year for the gold price  So we could retouch the lows of 2013 
Going into fall 2014 and 2015  gold will be sideways to up but not dramatically so until inflation returns  and the U S  dollar is effectively devalued 
Asian demand for gold jewelry follows Economics 101  The higher the price  the less the demand  the lower the price  the greater the demand  So if gold goes to  1 800 oz  much demand will disappear  unless people are buying for financial reasons 
TGR  As we know  China is not the most transparent jurisdiction in the world  Do we know how much gold the Chinese government has now  Can we make a good guess PL  The only thing that we know for certain is that in 2009  the last time China reported its official central bank reserve to the International Monetary Fund  it had exactly 1 054 tonnes of gold  Many speculate that that number has increased since then  I would tend to agree  simply because we have seen a fairly big jump in the import statistics in the last couple of years 
We know that China is the largest gold producer in the world  It produces over 400 tons of gold  but that gold has to be sold to the central bank  which then sells it back to the jewelers  I think that two or three years ago  the central bank started to keep home produced gold and began importing gold to sell to the jewelry market 
TGR  WGC figures suggest that personal gold buying in China will continue to increase over the next few years PL  Gold demand in China has been related to the growth in gross domestic product  GDP   For more than a decade  each 1  growth in GDP resulted in 1 5  growth in the gold market  Last year  however  the growth was more like 2  or 2 5   Much of that gold ended up as collateral in back to back loans  commodity loans  So gold is being used as a financial instrument  as well as for jewelry 
TGR  Do you believe China seeks a dominant position in world bullion ownership PL  Three points  First  the Chinese authorities very much encourage private gold ownership  for instance in TV ads  Second  10 years down the road  the Shanghai Gold Exchange  SGE  is likely to determine the gold price  not the COMEX  Third  I have maintained for quite a few years that when we reach the peak in this gold cycle  the SGE will resemble a casino  The Chinese have a huge propensity for gambling  and this is what will likely propel the gold price to levels that we probably can t even imagine 
TGR  Highlighted by suspension of construction at Barrick Gold Corp  s  NYSE ABX  Pascua Lama project in October 2013  the gold majors have acquired a reputation of being sluggish and unresponsive  Is this fair PL  To some extent  I think the majors have a scale issue  A company like Barrick or Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  needs to replace 7 million ounces  7 Moz  of production a year  which means depletion of something closer to 8 5 9 Moz year  looking at the exploration success of the last 15 years or the lack thereof  we see that the majors are going for lower grade material because that s what they can find  The majors are not replacing the Goldstrikes and the Hemlos  the high quality mines of the 1980s and the 1990s 
That said  I think that Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG  has done a superb job of upgrading itself  It spins off projects that don t meet its requirements  it makes money from them and keeps increasing the quality of its portfolio  Goldcorp is now producing 3 Moz gold annually  That s far more manageable than 5 7 Moz year 
TGR  With regard to scale  what do you make of a possible merger of Barrick and Newmont PL  I don t believe in the synergies that are being touted  The mining industry is singularly without synergy simply because each mine is a different business  A silicone company can build one plant to replace five  because it s the same product  Each gold mine is different  Some are open pit  others are underground  Each gold mine requires different equipment  They have different types of ore with different metallurgies  Gold mines are run independently  The only synergy is replacing a few dozen or few hundred accounting employees at the head office 
Second  I can t imagine how Barrick and Newmont are going to replace 14 15 Moz year gold  We haven t found a 15 Moz deposit in over 15 years  We haven t found a 30  Moz in well over 20 years  Barrick and Newmont have six projects that will peter out over the next decade  Those are incredibly difficult to replace  I just do not understand the logic behind a merger 
TGR  Is the gold industry comparable to the oil industry  in that gold  like oil  has become ever more difficult and expensive to find and produce  PL  The big difference between the two industries is the use of technology  The oil industry has done a much better job than the mining industry with research and development and creating new technology  Look at three dimensional  3 D  seismic  The oil industry went from 9 dry holes out of 10 to 7 successes out of 10 because of 3 D technology  We have none of that in the mining business  We re still using the same technology we used 100 years ago 
The oil industry developed fracking  a new technology that opened up vast new basins of tight oil  Then there are the deep waters where they come up with huge discoveries  The oil industry still has an enormous amount of great oil coming at  15 20 barrel  When you consider a market price of  100  the margins are quite unbelievable  Similar results have eluded the mining industry  and that s why margins have not expanded  The gold price has risen 500   but we still end up with  200 oz margins 
TGR  You had kind words for Goldcorp  What do you think of Barrick s prospects after its recent shift in management PL  Barrick has a number of really excellent mines  I ve worked my whole life with the 80 20 rule 80  of all your money comes from 20  of what you do 
TGR  The Pareto principle PL  Exactly  If you are the CEO of Barrick  you realize that five of your mines probably produce 80  of profit and earnings  So why would you want 23 mines  Barrick s CEO could slim the company down  actually make a ton of money and have a much easier time with reserve replacement  There are things that can be done to make that company work far better than it has over the last decade 
TGR  Do you think it s moving in a positive direction PL  I take a wait and see attitude  I m a Doubting Thomas  you have to show me 
TGR  Do you think that the prices of the gold majors will be the first to move on higher gold prices PL  Yes  if history repeats itself  The gold price went up from 1971 to 1974  then we had a 50  correction  From 1976 to 1980  gold went from  90 oz all the way up to  800 oz  From 1974 to 1976  the gold equities had a terrible time  losing over 50   Then from 1976 gold equities made a big move upward  and the first movers were the bigger companies 
The question today is whether the public will believe that the majors have reformed 
TGR  The royalty model has grown in popularity as people look for safe ways to gain exposure to junior miners  How has this changed in the last 30 years PL  I co founded Franco Nevada in 1982 and am now its chairman  Franco Nevada invented  if you will  the royalty model  We were the first company to have a business model based on purchasing and creating royalties  It has worked incredibly well 
The model has evolved to some extent  We explain the royalty model by pointing out that when investors buy gold ETFs  they must first of all pay others to hold their gold  So they are getting dinged 35 basis points a year for safety  When gold rises up 10   investors get a 10  increase  minus the service charge  The royalty model  we say  is a gold ETF on steroids  When investors buy shares of Franco Nevada or a similar company  they get so many ounces of gold but they also get  today  a 1 6  yield  So we pay investors to hold the share  At the same time  royalty company managements reinvest their money  so they have growth in the per share value of the company 
TGR  How have the benefits of the royalty model been demonstrated by the history of Franco Nevada 
PL  The original Franco listed at  0 35 a share  Every  1 000 invested in the company in 1982 became  1 2M in 2001 after the sale  That was about a 36  per year compounded rate of growth  The new Franco came out in 2008 at  15 share  and the stock today is trading around  53  That s about a 21 22  compounded rate of return over the last six years 
TGR  How do you rate your company s prospects going forward PL  They re just as good as they ve ever been  When times are really tough  as they are now  and we have over  1B in liquidity  we can put our balance sheet to work  We can buy and create royalties  And when times are really good  and mining companies can get all the equity financing they want  that s also great for us because that money goes to explore the lands that we already have  The cycle is our friend 
TGR  How would you rate the prospects of Royal Gold and Silver Wheaton PL  Royal Gold was created by a friend of mine  If copying one s business model is the highest form of flattery  well  he told me that s what he did  It s well managed and does quite well  It s in gold but also in base metals 
Silver Wheaton  as the name implies  is focused on silver  It has also done very well  but the silver space is smaller than the gold space  So at some point  I think that model will run out of runway  I would expect that company will eventually try to compete in the gold space 
TGR  How do you rate the prospects of smaller royalty companies such as Gold Royalties Corp  and Sandstorm Gold Ltd  n ARCA SAND   PL  The smaller companies all need to find a royalty that will anchor them  In the case of Franco Nevada  it was Goldstrike  where the deposit went from 500 000 oz gold to now having produced 40 Moz gold  Until that anchor is found  it s a really difficult business because the deals are small  and the payouts are very uncertain  As a result  I think many junior royalty companies will not survive 
TGR  Are you seeing or do you expect to see high net worth and institutional investment returning to the large cap gold space PL  The short answer is yes  The question is when  Right now hedge funds and some high net worth individuals who know the space are nibbling here and there  But if you look at the precious metals funds  one month there s a bit of influx  and then the next month they lose money  They ve been losing money for two years  We have not seen the public really come back into the stocks at all 
Some of the institutions that have never been in gold are now kicking tires  looking at companies that lost the most last year 
TGR  You re a director of New Gold Inc   AMEX NGD   A year ago  you said  with regard to its Blackwater gold project in British Columbia  that there is a 50 50 chance it will become a 25 Moz camp  Are you as optimistic now as then  PL  I am  My only qualification is that thank goodness I didn t say it will become a 25 Moz camp by 2014  Blackwater itself is a 10  Moz system  The work we ve done on our property in the last year  and it s a huge area  has shown us that there are at least five other areas with very high geochemical anomalies and geophysicals  But we will have to do a lot of drilling before we can come up with the next 5 Moz or 10 Moz deposit 
TGR  The decision by the Canadian federal government to reject for the second time Taseko Mines Ltd  s  AMEX TGB  New Prosperity mine cast a kind of a pall on mining development in British Columbia  B C    What s your view on this  How does New Gold stand in this regard PL  Natural resource development in B C  is not a heck of a lot different than in Ontario  It depends on your relations with First Nations  New Gold developed the New Afton copper mine in B C  after developing great relations with the First Nations peoples there 
We ve developed the same good relationships at Blackwater  as we have with the 10 12 First Nations at our Rainy River property in Ontario  which we bought from Rainy River Resources last year 
The same rules apply to the oil  gas and pipeline companies  The oil and pipeline companies that are in trouble have terrible relationships with native people  A company in natural resources development in Canada today better have a great team of people who understands the rights and needs of First Nations and can build cooperative relationships so that everyone can profit

11833,233348,RGLD,The Macro Gold Silver Relationship,opinion,"After making fools of the Gold stock bears  the initial thrust off of the right side of the bottoming pattern is making heroes of the bulls    especially those who remained steadfast in their bullishness throughout the bear market   Indeed  there is now some chest thumping going on by Team PermaBull 
The first move has been impressive in bursting upward off of what NFTRH has called  the 205 parameter   a right side shoulder point of a large Inverted Head and Shoulders    The initial move is maturing amidst the bullish cheer 

We have done extensive work on various time frames and components of the precious metals sector  beyond the weekly view of HUI above   Of particular interest lately has been the Silver gold relationship and its relevance beyond the insular and highly obsessed upon precious metals sector   There is an entire macro story playing out 
The chart above is a simplified map of the HUI s bottoming process   The red dotted line is there to show one level of potential resistance   Indeed  this level on a weekly chart  245 250  cross referenced well with the same level shown on a daily chart for different reasons   So did its implied support level at 225    
We call that confluence and we like confluence of data points in refining probabilities in market management 
Bottom Line
There has been a lot to like in the precious metals lately  but certain conditions are stretching toward limits  like the silver gold ratio  which is either going to continue upward and eventually change the macro or it is going to reverse  probably soon 
In a real bull phase  it is not wise to sell out all positions unless you are strictly a trader  but some profit taking is always allowed   It s your risk and your capital after all  and you do not owe anything to the perma bulls   For my part  I am taking profits on big runners like Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  and Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW  and looking more toward value in the exploration and young producer areas   They are out there 
While I don t tend to broadcast NFTRH s most important analysis far and wide  I do believe in publicly asking people to keep it real and rational   There will be pullbacks  likely from readily identifiable levels   Often there will be pullbacks in individual stocks  as I notice in two quality exploration developer companies as I write this post  
The positive moves to form the right side of the big bottoming pattern on HUI are now indicating that general sector pullbacks could be good buying opportunities  we have specific support levels documented    So again  it is okay to take some profits along the way and re deploy on lower risk opportunities 
The only differences between the precious metals sector of today and that of the bear market are that today it stands a chance of finishing a maturing bottoming pattern and entering a phase when a  buy the pullbacks  regimen will work well   But interim pullbacks will come and they will come from logical resistance areas as sentiment gets too frothy ",2014-06-24,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-macro-gold-silver-relationship-217213,217213
11834,233349,RGLD,GDX  2014 s Next Great Trade ,opinion,"Recently  the Gold and gold mining stocks have surged higher over the past three weeks  The highly followed Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDX  jumped higher by more than  4 a share since May 29  2014 
Today  GDX is trading lower by 0 37 cents to  25 90 a share  The ETF is now overbought on a daily chart  so a pullback over the next couple of days to weeks should be somewhat expected  While a pullback is possible  traders and investors must now keep an eye on the weekly inverse head and shoulder pattern that is forming on the chart  A weekly chart close above  26 a share on the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF would trigger a buy signal for the pattern  The target for the bullish inverse head and shoulder pattern indicates a move up to the  35 area  Leading gold mining stocks such as Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  and Goldcorp  NYSE GG  also have the same weekly chart head and shoulders pattern as GDX  Please understand that these patterns have not yet triggered  so until they do  these equities could still be somewhat volatile in the near term ",2014-06-24,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gdx:-2014's-next-great-trade-217220,217220
11835,233350,RGLD,Large Cap Precious Metals Stocks Now At Inflection Point,opinion,"In today s report I would like to take a good hard unbiased look at some of the big cap precious metals stocks that have been in rally mode since the first of June  This rally has been pretty impressive so far but is it the real thing 
Yesterday I showed you some charts on the ARCA Gold Miners Index  GDM  going from the 60 minute short term look to a year and a half look that showed the two big patterns we have in place right now  the falling flag and the inverse H S bottom  Today I would like to follow up with some big cap PM stocks  on the 60 minute chart and the bigger long term charts  that have their own respective year long trading ranges 
First let s look at the 60 minute chart of the GDM that I  ve already showed  that had a H S top forming  Yesterday GDM did some more work on the right shoulder that is making the H S top a little more symmetrical now  Keep this H S top in your mind when we look at some of the other big cap PM stocks in a bit 

Below is the 2 year weekly chart that shows the blue parallel downtrend channel that we ve been following for some time now  These are the two chart patterns I m going to show you today  the little H S top on the 60 minute charts and this year long blue trading range on the longer term big cap PM charts 
The combination of where these little H S tops lie in relation to the top rail of these big one year trading ranges may be be giving us a big clue that we are just at the top of this one year trading range  which may continue for who knows how much longer  I do know everyone is super bullish right now on the precious metals complex  so maybe now might be a good time to go against the crowd  After we look at some of the more important big cap precious stocks you can make up your own mind 

First let s look at the biggest of the big cap PM stocks  Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   The 2 hour chart below shows a potential H S top that has yet to break below the neckline  Keep on eye on where this potential H S top resides on the longer term chart  just below  this short term look 

Below is the daily chart for ABX that shows our little H S top has formed just below the bottom rail of the big blue bearish rising wedge as a backtest so far 

Now the weekly chart that shows our little H S top forming at the bottom rail of the bearish rising wedge as the backtest  You can see how critical this area is right here on the biggest PM stock there is 

Let s now look at the star performer for this rally off the June low  Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  

Below is a daily look at RGLD that shows its big  one year trading range is a rising wedge formation  You can t really see the small H S top but it s there  just below the top rail at reversal point  4 

Below is a weekly chart that shows the rising wedge with our little H S top forming just below the top blue rail at reversal point  4 

I have to show you the monthly chart for RGLD as it ties all the timeframes together  As you can see  this is the third backtest to the bottom rail of the long term black rising wedge  How critical is this backtest 

Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV  has been another high flyer during this June rally 

The weekly chart of FNV looks a lot like RGLD  which shows a very long term  black uptrend channel and now another backtest from the underside making it the fourth at this point 

Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW  has been another star performer during the June rally 

SLW s trading range has been a triangle formation  As you can see  it had a false breakout of the bottom rail and then reversed direction and rallied all the way back up to the top blue rail 

Below is the daily chart that shows Randgold Resources   NASDAQ GOLD  expanding triangle and our little H S top at reversal point  4 

Here s a long term look at Randgold 

Let s look at one more big cap PM stock  Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG  and its 2 hour bar chart 

Below is a daily chart for GG that shows its black falling flag at its one year trading range 

The weekly chart really puts the blue falling flag into perspective 

This last chart for GG shows its entire history going all the way back to 1994  You can see it s a classic bull market that ended with that massive H S top 

This is where we stand today with regard to the big cap precious metals stocks  Note thatt those little H S tops on the two hour charts weren t there two days ago  They started to show themselves Tuesday with some follow up work on the right shoulder yesterday They still haven t broken down yet  which means they are still incomplete patterns 
The charts I ve shown in this post  on the bigger  one year trading ranges  indicate the top rails are still hot and should be respected  even though there were many different one year congestion zones  Nobody knows with 100  certainty how things will evolve from here  but there is a lot of evidence that this June rally could just be another reaction within the one year trading ranges exhibited by most of the PM stocks 
We need to be prepared for whatever the markets throw our way  If these small H S tops start to break down  then we will need to act accordingly  The first thing will be to exit the Junior Portfolio stocks  The big cap precious metals stocks are truly at an inflection point right here and now   which we can take advantage of with just a little more information  Keep an open mind and let s see what kind of hand the market deals us 
NOTE  Just so you know I m not biased  here is the possible inverse H S bottom everyone and their brother is now seeing  May the best pattern win ",2014-06-26,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/large-cap-precious-metals-stocks-now-at-inflection-point-217408,217408
11850,233365,RGLD,Portfolio Manager Greg Orrell   My Belief In Gold Has Not Wavered ,opinion,After the extreme volatility of gold in the last few weeks  OCM Gold Fund Manager Greg Orrell is more convinced than ever of the necessity of owning gold assets  In this interview with The Gold Report  Orrell lays out the rationale for buying these cheap gold stocks from around the world  including California of all places  The Gold Report  How has your bullish view on the gold sector evolved as a series of crises has jolted both the international stock market and the price of gold  Greg Orrell  First off  my belief in gold as a monetary asset has not wavered  Japan basically admitted that it is bankrupt with its intention to aggressively debase its currency  Normally such actions would invoke  and may still  a race to the bottom as each country engages in economic warfare to deal with its debt issues  At this juncture the fear of global deflation among the G7 crowd remains its worst nightmare  especially as additional stimulus by the Federal Reserve is showing diminishing returns  With high debt levels in both the private and public sectors around the world  stimulating economic growth is proving elusive  These alarming events are setting the stage for the next leg up in the dollar gold price  in my opinion  The fiscal and monetary crisis is ongoing and underscores the necessity of owning gold assets  Though agonizing  the past 18 months have been nothing more than a consolidation for gold from the September 2011 highs of  1 900 ounce   1 900 oz   The recent decline in gold prices below  1 500 oz is not the end of the bull market in gold  despite the barrage of negative commentary by those wanting to dance on gold s grave  The destruction of currencies is in full bloom  but it is not a straight line  The problem for many gold investors is that they can see the endgame  Gold prices rise in a straight line at the end of a monetary system  but we are not there yet  It takes some patience to hold the course while the establishment fights tooth and nail to keep the dollar system from failing  TGR  The years 2009 and 2010 were better for gold stocks  Can you talk about how things changed after that and how investors can best respond to the precipitous drop in market value GO  A number of factors go into the poor performance of the gold shares over the past couple of years besides the gold price  We have seen investor rotation out of defensive posturing and then the gold miners ended up being their own worst enemy  Gold share investors became concerned  and rightfully so  with rising operating and capital costs  poor capital allocation and growing resource nationalization  This in turn made bullion exchange traded fund  ETF  products more attractive and prompted a trend of shorting the miners versus long gold positions  Let s look at the world s largest producer  Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   It incurred cost overruns at the Pascua Lama project in Latin America  And it overpaid for a copper asset in Africa after spinning off its African gold assets a couple of years earlier  Each of these instances led to contraction of cash flow and net asset value multiples for the whole sector  and set a theme for the industry  At this point  the pendulum has swung too far  with the shares basically discounting everything that could go wrong and more  Therefore  if an investor is not in the gold sector  now is an opportune time to take advantage of the significant decline in share values as there are signs of positive change taking place within the sector  TGR  Can you provide any insight as to why longer term investors  and also new gold investors  should buy into the current gold market GO  The rationale for owning gold assets remains simple  global deterioration of sovereign credit and a growing need to debase currencies in order to meet future obligations  whether it s here in the U S   Europe or Japan  The policy of socializing risk with monetary and fiscal policy has destroyed the balance sheets of the Western world  We are in a phase of experimental central banking  which I believe is going to end badly due to the dislocations of capital it has caused through prolonged periods of negative rates  In the event economic growth were to take hold  an unleashing of built up reserves in the system would set off inflation with a corresponding rise in rates  Just imagine the effect of a change in the direction of interest rates and the collateral damage that will create in the bond markets and the interest rate derivative markets after all of these years of managing a zero interest rate policy  The cost of funding the U S  deficit will rise exponentially  More quantitative easing begets more quantitative easing  Investors need to have some type of asset to balance their portfolios  Policymakers who got us into this mess are unlikely to navigate us out of it  History tells us that only gold is a good place to be  TGR  Is now a good time to be looking at the gold miners  including the juniors  GO  Absolutely  With current sentiment negative on the miners  it is an incredible opportunity to buy gold shares and recapture lost value  A major problem for the mining industry is that its business model is flawed  Gold investors are not strictly interested in taking money from one hole in the ground and putting it in another  Investors want participation in cash flow through dividends and earnings leverage to higher gold prices along with the potential for increased shareholder value through discovery   Not paying dividends was great for management  geologists  engineers and everyone but the investor who was locked out of the cash flow  Now falling share prices have put the onus on management to compete with the ETFs for investor dollars  A number of CEOs are being shown the door  Marginal projects are being shelved  Dividends are increasing  Management is beginning to understand that the needs of shareholders must be prioritized  Granted  the decline has been painful  but in my 30 years in the business  this is exactly what needed to happen  TGR  Has the balance in your portfolio between bullion  large caps  mid caps  small caps  ETFs  royalties and cash changed over the last five years  GO  Because production is cheap  we are weighting toward the large  and mid cap producers  They are poised to recapture value as sentiment turns around in that space  The smaller  macro cap exploration and development companies are bombed out  and a number of companies are trading where market cap per resource ounce is down to  10 or lower  Those companies are interesting as long as they have a balance sheet and they re not diluting their shares to keep the lights on  Royalty companies have outperformed along with bullion over the last five years because of all the negative factors that I mentioned previously  But I m not adding to the royalty companies right now because the operating companies offer better value  TGR  You re not adding to bullion GO  Not at this time  We re keeping bullion around 5 6   The miners  in my opinion  offer tremendous value at this point with gold reserves in the ground  TGR  Who are some of the companies you think are attractive in the middle and small spaces  GO  Endeavour Mining Corp   EDV TSX  EVR ASX  is interesting right here  The share price has been washed out because it is a higher cost producer  around  900 oz  Its market cap is down to under  400 million   400M  with 300 000 oz  300 Koz  of annual production in West Africa  but is slated to grow to 450 Koz over the next couple of years  That s a 50  increase  Endeavour is driving expansion mostly from internally generated cash flow  Esperanza Resources Corp   EPZ TSX V  is cashed up with over  70M and with experienced management is developing a couple of attractive heap leach projects in Mexico  One project can put up 35 Koz year and another one can do 110 Koz year  Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ  is a major shareholder  Esperanza could be an early day Alamos Gold Inc   AGI TSX   Avala Resources Ltd   AVZ TSX V   50  owned by Dundee Precious Metals Inc   DPM TSX   is trading down at dirt prices  The company has an entire Carlin style belt tied up in Serbia where it has outlined close to 3 million ounces  3 Moz  so far  The company s market cap is  12 15M  with  9M in the bank  it s not a bad option the market will appreciate the optionality value on the company s assets at some point  TGR  Are you a fan of the royalty model GO  I am a fan of royalty companies  The revenue comes right off the top so royalty holders have no exposure to increases in costs and typically have exposure to increases in reserves  Royalty companies often acquire the royalties from the original property owners  Another form of royalty is the creation of a gold or silver stream  the royalty firm helps to finance the project and receives gold or silver in return  We have seen a pick up of companies selling either net smelter royalties or streaming deals on projects as a way to finance in a marketplace where equity capital has become expensive  TGR  Are there any royalty companies that people should be looking at GO  We own a couple of the big ones in our portfolio  Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX  and Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE   We also own Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE   Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX  is the up and coming player in the royalty space  It s a highly competitive business  Recently a number of junior companies have cobbled together questionable projects that most likely won t come into production in order to claim that they are royalty companies  Franco  Royal and Silver Wheaton have committed significant dollars to individual projects of late  which increases their risk profiles  However  with the diversification of their asset bases at this point  it should not be a problem with all three positioned to grow revenues substantially over the next three years  So overall I do like the royalty model  TGR  What is your take on pure play gold producers GO  I prefer pure play gold producers  but those deposits are hard to find  Randgold Resources Ltd   GOLD NASDAQ  RRS LSE  is a good example of a pure gold play  as are a number of other intermediates and juniors  But often base metals accompany gold  All of the major gold producers produce copper  Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE   Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   Yamana Gold Inc   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE   New Gold Inc   NGD TSX  NGD NYSE MKT  and Barrick  Production has been shelved in many big copper gold porphyry deposits because it is so capital intensive  Consequently  we are more likely to see the smaller  pure gold projects go forward  In the past  the majors looked for big projects because they did not want to operate the smaller mines  Now they are focusing on grade and smaller projects that won t blow up the company  It may be smarter to take on 10 projects producing 150 Koz than to try and capitalize one project capable of producing 1 5 Moz  TGR  Do any particular firms come to mind in that area GO  Gold Fields Ltd   GFI NYSE  out of South Africa says it is going to focus on smaller projects  around 150 200 Koz  I ve heard the same thing from Newmont  Management is not going to be punished for making a small acquisition versus a buy of  5 billion  The big buy days are not likely to return any time soon  Managements  excuse that it was difficult to manage multiple smaller assets rather than a couple of large ones has been cast aside as the large projects have shown to expose companies to too much risk  TGR  We both live in California where there s a history of gold mining  but current public awareness is limited  What the story GO  There is gold in the Mother Lode Belt in Northern California  in Imperial County in Southern California and in Siskiyou County in far Northern California  The unemployment rate in those areas is pretty high  so the residents are open to mining s economic benefits  It is the outsiders who are up in arms about mining  Regulations have been put in place by a very staunch environmental crowd in California  but it s no different than what we see around the world where local residents are in favor of a mine because of its economic benefits  only to have the professional environmentalists come in and oppose the project  TGR  What junior gold miners in California are worthwhile  GO  One project that has the potential to turn mining around in California is the Sutter Gold Mining Inc   SGM TSX V  OTCQX SGMNF  start up of the Lincoln mine on the Mother Lode Belt in Amador County  It s a high grade  underground mine that s financed by its 50  shareholder  the Rand Merchant Bank  The first 150 200 feet  150 200 ft  of that deposit is going to pay back the capital cost of building and developing the mine  The mines on either side of it historically produced down to 4 000 ft  Production will start off relatively low at about 22 Koz year  But there are significant growth opportunities at the Lincoln mine and along the Mother Lode Belt for Sutter to exploit once it has established itself  I am very excited about its prospects  TGR  How do the California companies stack up against Nevada based mining companies GO  Atna Resources Ltd   ATN TSX  has a heap leach mine down in Southern California that has been going for quite some time  New Gold has the old Mesquite mine  which is a heap leach mine near the border of Mexico  But California has hardly any mining activity  or even exploration activity  So I would say it doesn t stack up at this point  TGR  Is that primarily because of environmental regulations or the political climate or the availability of gold GO  The perceived difficult environmental and permitting climate in California has been a deterrent  If a company wants to do open pit mining in California  it must be prepared to backfill the pit  That is not required in most places  TGR  How expensive is it to backfill GO  Handling waste material can be quite expensive  So the real California based opportunity is underground mining in the Mother Lode Belt and that also is where the higher grade ore is  TGR  Maybe we ll see a replay of 1849  GO  We re not going to see a replay of 1849  What we ll see is a replay of the underground mines of between 1900 and 1940  Some of those were just great mines and were the blue chip companies of their day  The gold is still there  TGR  Thank you  Greg   is the portfolio manager of the OCM Gold Fund  He is also president of Orrell Capital Management  the investment adviser to the fund  Orrell has over 28 years of

11851,233366,RGLD,Special Report  How To Find Money In Any Market,opinion,Money  Mining companies need it and investors want to know that companies will use that money to make them money  An innovative conference sponsored by the Society for Mining  Metallurgy and Exploration  SME   called  Current Trends in Mining Finance An Executive s Guide  What Are Lenders  Investors Looking For    brought together about 145 experts who were actively funding and running companies and looking for answers  In this interview with The Gold Report  SME Executive Director David Kanagy and Conference Co Chair Tim Alch share some insights about alternative funding that could help more companies survive the year   The Gold Report  You put on a two day conference last week in New York   Current Trends in Mining Finance An Executive s Guide  What Are Lenders  Investors looking For   Why this topic now   David Kanagy  SME has held some financial conferences in the past  but it has been more than 10 years since the last one  so it was time  The program was intended for senior executives and mining industry specialists  bankers  analysts and investors  It covered project evaluation and executive decision making  mergers and acquisitions  tax and accounting issues  resources and reserve reporting  and other risk factors that are making the current financial market for the minerals industry a bit difficult right now   TGR  What has changed in the market since 2008  Is this really the worst market you ve seen or does it just feel like that   Tim Alch  The market rebounded nicely immediately after the 2008 financial crisis largely as a result of China s continued growth  However  in the last two years China has been perceived as slowing from an average of 10  gross domestic product  GDP  annual growth to something approximating 7 7 5   This growth is on a larger GDP number  however  which is important to understand   Today  we are also concerned about the European market and  most immediately  price support in the commodity sector  Over the last 10 years  costs of production have been steadily rising so there is considerable concern right now that the strong pricing environment the metals and minerals sectors enjoyed may be subject to pressure  The environment has become very selective and risk off  particularly in the global mining finance space in the past 9 10 months   The financial markets impact lending and investor appetite for risk  Luckily alternative sources of capital are stepping into the fray  Private equity  as well as sovereign wealth funds and state owned enterprises from Korea  Japan and China  are now investing in natural resources   TGR  Are countries looking to secure access to coal  oil and base metals to fund future growth or are they looking at it purely from a return on investment standpoint   TA  In certain sectors and geographies  stability and security of supply of raw materials is a concern and it is driving certain parties to invest with just more than internal rate of return concerns   TGR  Where is this supply security showing itself to be most important  Base metals  rare earths  gold  Are they looking for short term fixes or focusing on long term security   DK  All of the above  Every sector has its own challenges  It s a difficult and a complex market right now  No one  with the exception of strategic long term investors  is looking to long long term greenfield investment projects  The ones that will get the best funding right now are more short term opportunities that could get an immediate return or a greater return over the next few years   TA  Some enterprises  including electronics companies or automobile manufacturing companies or even steel industry producers  have in the last several years made strategic investments in projects  properties and resources to ensure that they have a stable supply of various industrial minerals  including copper  iron ore  rare earths and the electronics metals  as a result of their need to ensure that they will have a steady supply   TGR  If these alternative funding sources are looking for short term needs rather than long term payoffs  does that mean that the producers will recover faster than the explorers   DK  I would say that that s a true statement   TA  What is of interest in the space today are brownfield expansion projects as opposed to the greenfield or exploration oriented projects  Those projects that are adjacent to existing properties or operations and that are clearly identified as being low cost are seeing money continued to be invested  but it is on a very selective basis   TGR  Is that also true of gold and silver  Is there interest in precious metals exploration projects  And  if so  is there more interest in certain parts of the world   TA  There is still interest in the precious metals sector as a store of wealth due in part to inflation concerns within the current monetary easing policy  But investment is going into jurisdictions with stable  secure political environments that are less subject to changes in rules and regulations to delay projects from advancing   TGR  Previously  you listed the different alternative funding sources  did the conference cover streaming and royalty companies  Have they been a factor in keeping the lights on for mining companies   TA  Yes  streaming  forward sales and alternative sources of capital were discussed along with private equity   TGR  Crowd sourcing is something new in the finance sector  Is it part of the mining sector or is it just talked about more than it is being done   TA  My sense is that it s too early in the mining and minerals space to say if it is actually having an impact  We are still largely dependent upon traditional sources  as well as the alternative sources  including forward sales  royalties  streaming  private equity and the sovereign wealth funds  as well as state owned enterprises  Remember mining is a capital intensive sector   TGR  On the royalty and streaming side  a number of new  smaller players doing small deals have joined the big royalty companies  Do you think that s a sign of that market maturing  Will there be even more companies coming into the space or is there only so much room and we can look forward to consolidation in the royalty space   DK  My sense is that there s more interest in greater participation by a greater number of players in the royalty and streaming space because there s opportunity and need for it  Where there s opportunity and margins are still realizable  that s where the capital is going  A lot of these are very one off type of situations  But a few larger ones  including Royal Gold Inc   RGLD  and Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW   have been successful  They re tapping an opportunity with their expertise  as well as the capital they have available  I think royalties and streaming are going to play a greater part down the road   TGR  What about private equity  Is that becoming a more important source of funding   TA  It is because certain informed  long term or long only investors perceive value in the space  The equity valuations in the mining and minerals space have become so depressed in the last year and certain private equity investors see an opportunity   TGR  Are there things companies can accomplish with private equity that might be more difficult in the public market   TA  Companies can tailor the relationship from the beginning between management and the private equity sponsor  The long term support that comes with that relationship is also very important in an environment like this   TGR  There has been quite a bit of debate about what s going to happen to all the junior mining companies on the TSX  Some have said that as many as 500 companies listed on the Venture Exchange are going to go out of business in the next year  Will all these alternative sources of funding allow more companies to get through this difficult funding period   DK  There will be some contraction  but I am hopeful and don t think it will be on the massive scale you ve just mentioned  People are very cautious right now  Companies seeking or in need of capital in the current environment will have to demonstrate that a project has possible returns in the next 2 3 years rather than 10 20 years out   TA  Low cost operations and production is paramount to attract investment  If a company can demonstrate high grade quality of resources in the ground that can be produced at low costs within the first or second quartile of industry cost curves  those projects are better able to raise capital and find interest among the investment community   TGR  Is that even more important with the institutional audience  Are institutions getting back into this market and  if so  what will it take to keep them there   TA  The intermediate to long term outlook even the near term outlook for the mining sector is very favorable  but it needs to be carefully scrutinized and I don t think the institutions have walked away  They are just sharpening their pencils like all investors today and making sure that they will see a return  The fundamental long term story for raw materials  metals and minerals is intact on a macro basis worldwide  Growth in emerging markets where demand for raw materials on a per capita or growth of GDP basis is greater than in the developed nations is intact and likely will continue growing at above average rates   DK  You started the conversation by asking whether these are the worst conditions the metals market has seen  and I would say they are not  It may not be as lucrative as it was two or three years ago  It s more difficult now  but I don t think it s the worst we ve seen  But it is changing and I think the investors and lenders are asking more questions  People are doing better due diligence  asking more questions questions that probably should have been asked many years ago  Now that the need for a return is paramount  investors are asking more and better questions   TGR  We have talked about a number of different funding trends  What answers do you hope attendees came away with from your conference   DK  We featured about 50 speakers in 17 panels on topics ranging from lending and financing to political risk  The 145 people attending heard from leading experts from the banking  financial and technical advisory sectors  as well as accounting  legal  political risk and social and local economic development experts who all shared what they are seeing today and how they are managing opportunities for investing or financing in the global mining sector  Many attendees expressed thanks and walked away saying they learned from the experiences and observations of others  All of which has encouraged the SME to have this conference again next year   TA  This was more than just an educational seminar it was a chance for investors to get real answers from experts about what they are doing right now   TGR  Thanks for your insights   Tim Alch is a vice president and senior minerals business analyst at Behre Dolbear   Co   USA  Inc  Alch is

11852,233367,RGLD,3 Experts On Gold And The Effect Of  QE Tapering,opinion,The severe drop in commodities and equity markets that followed the US Federal Reserve s indication that it could soon  taper  quantitative easing  QE  had Gold Investing News  GIN  wondering what would happen to gold if QE actually came to an end   GIN solicited the opinions of three experts  Frank Holmes  CEO of US Global Investors  Julian Phillips  analyst at The Gold Forecaster  and Peter Schiff  CEO of Euro Pacific Capital   GIN  If the US Federal Reserve does go ahead with tapering QE as it suggested it would last week  what would be the impact on the gold price   Frank Holmes  I think the news should be good for gold investors  Not only is the Fed maintaining its course  the world is also continuing its synchronized easing  With this global easing cycle  gold and equities had been moving together  but have been taking vastly diverging paths in the past six months  In fact  according to UBS Investment Research  the gold to S P 500  INDEXSP  INX  ratio has fallen to lows not seen since 2008  As I often remind investors  gold buyers are a diverse group  but generally fall into one of two categories  Most of the attention gets focused on those who purchase out of fear of damaging government policies  i e   the fear trade   I think gold can easily bounce here  The ratio  I would say  10 percent on the downside  30 percent on the upside over the next 18 months   Julian Phillips  While the Fed has made plans for such tapering  markets are discounting this already and reading that it is deflationary   Consequently  the Fed s planned impact will not happen  Instead  they may find that they have to counter the bond markets sell off with a statement that calms the market so it then has to wait for the Fed s action   Unfortunately  what we have been forecasting for more than a year now is happening  financial markets across the world are turning mercurial   The Fed has had to endure the handicap of almost zero government support for growth  something that has undermined its efforts and will continue to do so  This won t change until an election that brings in one or the other party with a clear program of economic growth  but as the Bank for International Settlements is now warning   is growth enough   In the Eurozone it is the structure that is conspiring against an economic recovery   It s important to bear in mind that since the credit crunch in 2007  we have been hearing of the  coming recovery   Mr  Bernanke has reassured the world that growth is now visible enough to contemplate tapering off QE  hoping markets would take this as positive news  But instead they have focused on the accompanying rise in interest rates that must happen  With markets discounting these rises  they are precipitating them at prices that undermine growth  The US economy remains fragile and the rest of the developed world in recession  Rises in interest rates will now savage growth   This becomes a deflationary environment  while money supply continues to expand tremendously  Combine the two and you have unstable markets   We look at the gold price in 2007  when it fell from its then peak of  1 200 to below  1 000 before the uncertain and unstable developed world s economies caused it to turn around and resume the rise to over  1 900  We are entering not just a repeat of that time  but one where past efforts have failed  Now we have confirmation that governments and central banks have failed to rectify matters and remain faced with the same  but worse problems  We expect that once the current falls have been completed  a turnaround will begin to take gold and silver prices higher and considerably past previous peaks  The current fall is now not supported by large volumes of sales  simply the holding back by buyers  When prices do turn  we see them turning quickly and moving higher on lower volumes   Please note that the fundamentals on the monetary front have never described such a positive picture for gold since 1971  I do not believe that gold will stay down at these levels for long  The monetary problems that have brewed so far to date tell me that gold is not down and out by a long way   Peter Schiff  excerpt from his June 21 commentary Tapering the Taper Talk   It s fascinating how the goal posts have moved quickly on the Fed s playing field  Months ago the conversation focused on the  exit strategy  it would use to unwind the trillions in bonds and mortgages that it had accumulated over the last few years  Despite apparent improvements in the economy  those discussions have given way to the more modest expectations for the  tapering  of QE  I believe that we should really be expecting a  tapering  of the tapering conversations   As a result  I expect that the Fed will continue to pantomime that an eventual exit strategy is preparing for a grand entrance  even as their timeline and decision criteria become ever more ambiguous  In truth  I believe that the Fed s next big announcement will be to increase  not diminish QE  After all  Bernanke made clear in his press conference that if the economy does not perform up to his expectations  he will simply do more of what has already failed   Of course  when the Fed is forced to make this concession  it should be obvious to a critical mass that the recovery is a sham  Investors will realize that years of QE have only exacerbated the problems it was meant to solve  When the grim reality of QE infinity sets in  the dollar will drop  gold will climb  and the real crash will finally be upon us  Buckle up   GIN  In this new gold price reality  under  1 300  do you see more negative fallout from the major gold miners in terms of project cancellations  deferments lower production  Which major gold companies are best able to weather the storm   Frank Holmes  Mining companies have stopped making dumb acquisitions  are increasing their dividends and one company is buying back their stock to improve  shareholder yield   which is a combination of raising dividends and stock repurchases  Supply is contracting and companies that have their costs under control will perform well  For those reasons  I favor companies such as Alamos Gold  TSX AGI NYSE AGI   Royal Gold  TSX RGL  and Franco Nevada  TSX FNV NYSE FNV   which pays monthly dividends   Julian Phillips  Barrick Gold  TSX ABX NYSE ABX  Newcrest Mining  TSX NM ASX NCM  and Gold Fields  NYSE GFI  are writing down their assets and financing is drying up at the moment for unfinanced juniors  Supplies of gold come from two main sources  scrap sales at  1 700 tonnes and newly mined gold at  2 800 tonnes  The SPDR gold ETF  ARCA SPY  has supplied around 500  tonnes in the last three months and the banks and hedge funds that engineered the  bear raid  on gold around 300  tonnes in the same period  Only the SPDR fund remains a seller of gold now  Scrap sales have petered out to a trickle while mining companies have had to reduce their gold reserves  heavily cutting out the low grade reserves as they became unprofitable  It may be that they can maintain production levels at past levels  but their life is now shorter  So from now on we do expect to see newly mined gold production slow   Combine the fall in scrap  newly mined gold and the large tonnage sold in the US ceasing  and you can see that supplies have fallen in the last month dramatically  The major miners we have mentioned as well as the well established miners such as Goldcorp  TSX G NYSE GG  will ride out this storm  GIN  Is there hope for the junior gold mining sector in this new lower gold price environment    Frank Holmes  I believe three trends will hurt the junior resource cycle for the next few years  1  A lack of discoveries  2  geologists having no relationship with money managers or capital markets  and 3  excessive government regulations  But there are mining companies that are adapting to these challenges by focusing on a return on capital model or increasing their dividends   Based on new rules  the regulatory environment is anti risk taking which will impact the formation of capital and job creation  Further  commodity prices are soft and this impacts investor sentiment  and finally there have been so many delays and disappointments with emerging countries changing the tax laws and environment rules  When we add up all three factors  the juniors will continue to be under pressure unless they have a world class discovery in a safe jurisdiction    Julian Phillips  Some of the well financed  capable juniors will recover tremendously  That s why George Soros bought  225 million in derivatives in them  We see this current gold price  or lower still  as a temporary opportunity   Taking a longer view from the fourth quarter of this year onwards we see a very different environment for gold and silver than the one we are in now  The government action against gold imports into India is perhaps a greater factor than current US gold sales right now  so we are watching to see how that market is countering these moves to see the shape of their demand going forward  If they do counter their moves we should see demand from Asia jump strongly in that quarter  By that time  US sales of gold should have terminated ,2013-06-27,Commodity Trade

11853,233368,RGLD,Bonds Smashed  Gold Hashed,opinion,On Wednesday whilst munchingmy modest tuna half sandwich at the club bar  a fine friend with a budding interest in Gold asked where one would be if having dollar cost averaged into Gold over the last couple of years   Well under water   was my knee jerk response  although  twas an intriguing question   For you WestPalmBeachers down there  dollar cost averaging is the periodic investment of the same amount of money into a security regardless of its price    Clearly if having already been dollar cost averaging into Gold since it was  365 oz  on this date 10 years ago  one would certainly be sitting in the pound seats today  buying  1 000 worth of Gold at each month s opening price   basis COMEX futures   beginning in July 2003 would be a total investment to date of  134 000 into 205 units of Gold with a current profit of  116 000 and a break even price of  654 oz   More specifically to my friend s question however  dollar cost averaging into Gold only during its decline from the 06 September 2011 All Time High of  1 923 oz  wouldn t even find one today in the 50  bleacher seats  at best peering in through a knot hole in the right field wall   Nevertheless  to exemplify using dollar cost averaging via the poor man s convenient method of buying Gold  shares  via the SPDR Gold Shares ETF  GLD  which is regularly priced at just under one tenth  9 7   the level of Gold itself  had one purchased  1 000 worth at each monthly opening price from October 2011 to date  the accumulation thus far would be 132 shares   rounding down to the nearest whole share at each purchase   for a cumulative investment of  21 077  including round trip commissions of  18 purchase   resulting in a current loss of  5 474 with the break even price now at 159 67  some 25  below July 2013 s opening price of 119 94  GLD at this writing is just 118  yet it goes without saying that upon Gold reaching 2000  the price of GLD ought be 194  in turning whirling  round that  5k loss into a least  4k gain  and that s without any further purchases from here   which obviously would be a mistake   At Gold 2500  we d find GLD at 243  such profit then having increased to just under  11k   again without any added units   and so forth   The point of the exercise really is to emphasize the wisdom of buying Gold  especially when  tis on the cheap like this  Were I to offer you one Dollar for two quarters  you d indubitably make that exchange  Similarly today  you might value what you perceive to be  2 400 worth of Gold that is being offered for a mere  1 200 as an absolute bargain  Think about it   tis hardly rocket science    But mmb  you always say the market is never wrong  so isn t  1 200 the right price     Tis absolutely the right price  Squire  The net result of the market s buyers and sellers hashed Gold into a 1  loss for the week down to the 1222 level    and as you can see on the chart  the rightmost bar was comparatively a bit of a stub   higher low and lower high   given in part to the StateSide Independence Holiday   Still  dear Squire  expand that cranial capacity for a moment and consider the difference between price and value  Recall from last week s missive the selling of a sports car back in the 1980s for  2 500  That was the price  Today  what is  100 000   That is the value    Tis the same with Gold  Regular readers have seen us come up with all sorts of measurement tools for valuing Gold   a favourite being its offset to the debasing growth in StateSide M2 money supply alone over the last thirty years  suggesting Gold ought already be north of 3000   Yet whilst this pounding down of market price is very real  in terms of value  such selling gone beyond the absurd  As an illustration  let s look at Gold versus Oil after the dive of 2008 s Black Swan to date   The following graphic shows the percentage tracks of these two markets per their daily closing prices since the start of 2009  Naturally  Gold and Oil have a proven tendency to generally be in positive correlation  whether it be due to geo political concerns as we re currently seeing over in Egypt  or to the more normative aspects of inflation and Dollar debasement  Pay particular attention to the two dashed lines in the chart  those are the linear regression trendlines for both markets  and note that they are practically parallel  Yet look how far the percentage track of Gold s actual price has wandered from trend  you don t think this market is crazy oversold  Such refined technical terminology aside  one ought well recognize value when one sees it And briefly with respect to Oil  which traded during the week from as low as 96 07 to close yesterday  Friday  at 103 63  that should work its way into your local petrol pump over the next week or two  I just filled up for  4 46 gallon here in San Francisco   which as you may have read is now America s  snobbiest city  according to some travel publication  I realize we re known the world over for our fruits and nuts  but this is really pushing it   Anyway  five bucks per gallon in due course for this town shan t surprise me a wit Yet  whilst watching the Tour de France this past week on the t l   I saw the lads pedaling past a petrol station near Bastia  Corsica  the green neon sign sporting a price of  1 68 litre  In the event you re heading in that direction for the summer s vacation  let s do the math   1 68 x 3 79 litres gallon    6 37 gallon x  1 2839      8 17 gallon  Best forget the rental car and simply cycle about How s the Bond  Simply Smashing Or more accurately stated  smashed  In Bond Land  the yield on the US 10 Year Treasury Note has risen better than 100 basis points in just the last nine weeks  When was the last time that happened  The nine weeks ending in the first week of 2011  What did Gold then do right into that September  It rose as much as 553 points   40    Let s review our chart of the 10 year yield which as you know at 2 715  has already broken above the orange resistance triangle formed from 2011 into 2012 Not that history would necessarily repeat itself with such timed precision  however a 40  rise in Gold from the current 1222 level would put the price at 1711 by Springtime en route to The Northern Front  1750 1800   With rising yields comes the whiff of inflation  which in turn is the foundation of The Gold Story  Recent demand for Dollars is adding to their cost and clearly the StateSide economy must be on the move given the rosy June employment statistic of 195 000 jobs having been created  an increase of 17  over expectations  as further embellished with an upside revision for the May data  But wait a sec  mmb  the U6 rate of unemployment went up from 13 8 to 14 3   Good on ya  Squire  evidently you ve stopped watching the news and turned to more substantive sources  Were more to so do we d see Gold far higher that currently  tis  In any event  the permeation of worsening unemployment into the economic fabric ought keep monetary accommodation in continuance which naturally shall redound to higher Gold levels   More Dollars Please   Fundamentally elsewhere as well  the one economic constant remains that there is simply not enough dough to make it all go out there  The slowing of growth in China is now being reported as significantly bleak such that it

or so since Gold  after having gotten ahead of itself  more recently then got behind itself  and now of late has completely lost hold of itself  And struggling at an even more sorrowful pace have been the paper Gold vehicles of the HUI Gold Bugs Index  the Philly Exchange s XAU Precious Metals Index  the exchange traded miners fund GDX  and roller coastin  RGLD  Royal Gold   Here are their comparative year over year percentage tracks with the paper players all down  round  50   Ouch Still  in the July September period of a year ago  you can see how the paper brethren outperformed Gold itself to the upside  But as queried by the chart s question mark  can the equities again outpace the yellow metal in the next surge   Tis their wont to so do  however fighting the tide of a declining stock market would require extra effort Gold s Valuation via BEGOS  A Broader ViewGenerally our charts for the BEGOS markets  Bond Euro Gold Oil S P  in valuing each component by its movement versus that of the other four are via a three month view  the two primary interests being  1  observing price crossings of the smooth pearly valuation line  and 2  oscillator distance of price from that line   as displayed in the lower panel of the chart   However  this time for Gold we re presenting the full year over year view   as will be the case at the new website which I thought of launching on Bastille Day    14 July    but given the fragile nature of the French economy  have instead opted for 01 August  which is of course Swiss National Day and thus has more of a Solid Gold  weighty feel to it   And for some nine months now  look at how the smooth valuation line has time and again repelled Gold from passing above it  shown ever so starkly as well in the oscillator view Technically to me  this is unsustainable and is yet another reason to expect Gold s imminently turning higher  dare I say  with a vengeance that shall surprise the  Cool to be Cruel to Gold  crowd How about some more evidence of downside unsustainability  let s next turn to this two panel graphic as regards trend consistency for the BEGOS bunch  On the left we ve the familiar chart of Gold  its daily bars spanning the last three months to date along with the Baby Blues which measure the  consistency  of Gold s 21 day linear regression trend  When the baby blue dots are above the  80  level  a bonafide consistent uptrend is declared as in place  On the right we ve thus ranked the BEGOS markets  including their sub markets  by the number of trading days that have passed since the last time each product s Baby Blues were greater than  80    And 192 trading days for Gold encompasses nine months  which without running a millennium to date study  I have to think is a record  Think we re overdo for a Great Gold Rally   HELLO    So to get the party started  here we ve Gold s trading profile spanning the last 10 sessions   the current 1222 level in red   and it suggests we first try to ascend through that trading resistance up to 1256   following which with a little surge of herd we can get over the next resistance hump in those upper 1200s and move back up into the 1300s   and beyond  Shan t be necessarily easy of course  as there is a lot of work to do given the inglorious state of the Gold Stack   Gold s All Time High  1923  06 September 2011  The Gateway to 2000  1900  The Final

this week  Given its multi week run down from the year s high of 1687   which I still think is firm for the duration   to as low as 1561  the S P actually moved into a technically near term oversold

11854,233369,RGLD,Bernanke Flip Flops More Than Kerry In 2004  ,opinion,This morning  the S P 500 Index e mini futures  ES U3  are trading higher by 15 50 points to 1664 00 per contract  The large surge in the stock futures comes as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke vowed to keep his money printing policies firmly intact  Currently  the central bank has the fed funds rate  overnight lending rate to the large banks  at zero to quarter percent  They are also buying  85 billion dollars a month worth of mortgage backed securities and U S  Treasuries  After the last FOMC meeting on June 19th Chairman Bernanke stated that the central bank could begin tapering QE 3 as soon as September and cut the entire program by mid 2014  Obviously  this latest statement is a 180 degree turn from his June comments  We can only wonder what is spooking him that he made this major about face in his remarks  Global stock indexes are all trading higher on the news  Gold and gold mining stocks have also rallied higher  The gold mining sector has been highly shorted so this important industry group could see a potential short squeeze  Traders should watch for early strength in the leading gold equities such as Newmont Mining Corp  NEM   Goldcorp Inc   USA   GG   and Royal Gold  Inc USA   RGLD   Traders that want to track the entire gold mining sector can follow the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  GDX  Below you may find the video ,2013-07-11,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bernanke-flip-flops-more-than-kerry-in-2004-175058,175058
11855,233370,RGLD,Gold Stocks Outperforming Gold Year To Date,opinion,"This chart shows the year to date performance of gold vs gold stocks  We see that gold stocks of all kinds have outperformed gold itself  The Market Vectors Gold Miners fund  ARCA GDX  is an ETF of larger  more established miners  Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners fund  ARCA GDXJ  is an ETF of junior miners  Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   Sandstorm Gold  ARCA SAND   and Franco Nevada Corporation  FNV  are royalty stocks  which are basically firms that invest in other mines in exchange for a share of their output 

Personally  I think these trends may continue though I still favor the accumulation of gold in the long run  as I think it is a safer  less speculative investment  More important  though  I think the outperformance year to date further supports the notion that the entire gold market has bottomed  and bulls are gearing up for the next leg up ",2014-05-05,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-stocks-outperforming-gold-year-to-date-211590,211590
11856,233371,RGLD,Gold Seeing Beyond The Economic Haze,opinion,"We ve made mention in recent missives of the capability for Gold s price to travel a great distance in merely a day   as was noted by 131 points from low to high on 26 September 2011  or as we saw last year on 15 April 2013 from high to low by 160 points   Brought to us  of course  in part by the COMEX not imposing daily high low price limits on Gold  in concert with the furious one sided trading thrust on the part of central banks and or hedge funds hoovering away all of the standing bids and or offers 
Remindful of this was from that which I heard on the radio a few mornings ago  Almost as if  twas preordained  I flipped on the bedside set in the wee hours to coincidentally catch the tail end    but likely the most salient part    of an interview with seasoned financial wizard Jim Rickards  His being pro Gold  he emphasized the importance of one s buying the yellow metal now   in bullion form rather than via equities   to thus avoid the anxiety of seeing from the sidelines Gold suddenly rising by  100 per day  and then one s capitulating to finally buy after the price is already up to  3 000 oz  Given this being the reality of not  if  but  when    twas quite the brilliant and yet common sense point  Well done James 
 Twas further remindful of a pending paradigm shift we ve been considering for some time  that of a material movement by the investing public at large away from the stock market toward hard assets  Not that everybody shall comprehensively abandon the stock market  but having been undone back in  00 to  01  S P  51    and then again to have beared the decline of  07 to  09  S P  58    this next crash for which we remain vigilantly watchful is bound to leave a lot of folks scratching their heads  Once burned  twice shy is one thing  but thrice thrown into the fire begs the question   What else ya got  
Alternative investing vehicles such as hard assets may well gain popularity en masse  We ve of course all heard the frequent radio adverts in recent years for Gold and Silver  But this past week I heard for the first time an advert for Oil  Time to rush out there and buy your own derrick  Whilst I hardly expect the majority of investors to suddenly become commodities traders  let alone hard asset owners  I d watch for a further proliferation of ETFs of all sorts  sizes and leverage multiples  with 24 hour trading windows in mirroring the futures markets  to become the next Big Thing in wealth vehicles from 401Ks to day trading accounts across a much larger percentage of the investing public   Recall that Gold is perhaps at best represented in just 5  of managed portfolios  
In the meantime  specific to the stock market  from the days of the DotBombs through the SubprimePredators  to what we anticipate shall be today s FacePlants  the signs certainly are there for the next market meltdown  Our  live  measure of the S P s valuation remains high at 28 9x  and the Index itself  1881  essentially where  twas both one and two months ago in spite of all the encouraging economic data which is causing our barometer to rise 

Indeed the whole reason we created the Econ Baro back in 1998 was to remove the guesswork of trying to piece together in one s head a resultant picture from the persistent flow of incoming data  to therein discover as well that the Baro leads the S P  or at least it used to so do  As a valued reader of The Gold Update and director of money management said in a recent tele conference to clients  paraphrased       market metrics that have worked for better than 30 years don t anymore     What s wrong 
The data that feeds the Econ Baro is only as reliable as  tis reported 
 What are you inferring  mmb  
Provably nothing  Squire  Yet from the  Hearsay Dept   the economy s ability to eke out a  0 1  GDP gain in Q1 was courtesy of the Commerce Dept  s calculating a slower rate of growth in its Price Index  And then just yesterday  Friday   the Labor Dept  announced stellar April job growth with quite the reduction in unemployment   quietly sweeping under the table the lowest job participation rate in 36 years  
Still  the Fed s Taper Caper continued this past week  the FOMC voting to pump dough into the economy at better than  2 billion per work day  Admittedly we ve been speculating that were the Econ Baro  instead of rising  be declining  that there would not be a further tapering at the mid June meeting  But now  at least as lead by the Baro  it looks as though they ll still taper toward less paper   barring a Baro belly flop in the interim  
And yet throughout these dizzy days of the towering  soon to be tipping   S P and seeing through the economic haze are two markets that may be the wiser  toward an inevitably weaker Dollar  One is  of course  Gold  which we ll go over in the usual graphic detail  But the other is the Bond market  Was it not suppose to have been long since crashing by now  Seems as if reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated  If anything   tis been soaring  ranking second in performance year to date   6 4   only to Gold   7 9   within our BEGOS Markets spectrum  The following chart shows us the 30 year Bond s performance thus far in 2014  its futures price in rose and yield in blue 

 Who knew  
A look at the burgeoning Bond suggests the Econ Baro is perhaps being belied by the data it receives  If so  reality shall only right it in due course   What s the whole point of being pretty on the outside when you re so ugly on the inside      Jess C  Scott  
Who knew  indeed  Gold knows  Amidst its many positives that we regularly enumerate  price continues to remain firm in spite of the parabolic Short trend s having now been in place for five weeks  per the rightmost red dots 

At least to this point  such  descending trend  looks no worse than a near term consolidation within the overall broad term consolidation 
As we next turn to Gold s 21 day linear regression picture  let s bring along Sister Silver as well as in viewing their respective daily bars and  Baby Blues   the dots which define trend consistency 

Note the two arrows on Gold s panel  they depict very resilient  power bars    from both 24 April and yesterday   wherein hard selling early in the session was then met with even more vigorous buying  driving price well above the prior days  closes  One gets the sense that price sub 1300 is perceived as an absolute bargain   as is sub 1900  below which price is lagging behind growth in our StateSide M2 money supply alone  hint hint  nudge nudge  elbow elbow      As for the Baby Blues  they are now in decline for both metals  albeit Silver s dots show her as the weaker of the pair as she s been donning her industrial metal jacket more often this year in sympathy with the S P than her precious metal pinstripes 
From the standpoint of reliable Market Rhythms  for the third week in a row we bring up this paired graphic of two of the best  the MACD  moving average convergence divergence  on the daily bars for Gold and Silver  Of late  these time proven measures for profitable trading have become a bit whippy   

   the good news being that should Friday s buying surge continue into the ensuing week  the attendant MACDs ought reflect more definition and thus duration for these new upside crossovers   The profitable signaling quality of these measures is on our Market Rhythms page  
Not unexpectedly  Gold s volatility is on the increase  As culled from our Market Ranges page  follows is the EDTR   expected daily trading range   from a year ago to date for Gold  its gauge now on the rebound at better than 18 points per day 

Indeed  Friday alone spanned 32 points from low to high as shown below per the Golden Swath across almost the entirety of Gold s 10 day trading profile  Settling yesterday at 1300  white bar   price sits just below the 1301 resistor  as further supported by the profile s other apices at 1290 and 1284 

Meanwhile  the Gold Gang at large remain down percentage wise from this time one year ago  But as an exception  the wheelin  and dealin  royalty company Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  is up a twinkling 24  as you can next see  And as another month is in the books   tis time we go year over year also with Gold itself  the Gold Bugs Index  HUI   the Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index  XAU   and the exchanged traded miners fund Market Vectors Gold Miners  GDX  

Lastly   tis finally happening  purchasing power perceptions indicate that China    and yes I know a lot of you are convinced from the FinMedia headlines  tis instead the now roaringly robust UK    but rather  tis China which is now en route to passing the USA as the world s largest economy  And why not  China is like Texas  everything is BIG  Yes its land mass is almost identical in size to that StateSide  but there are 425  more folks living on it  The USA was established 238 years ago  China s first emperor was bollocking about back some 2 235 years ago  Number of ethnic groups  USA 6     China 56  China s calling code is 86 vs  the US  paltry 1  Why even Beijing is 12 hours ahead of New York City  And to rub it in locally  just across the street here is the PRC s consular residence  sitting on the single largest residential real estate lot in the City of San Francisco  So throw in the towel America  Yes  it may be Kentucky Derby Day over here  but in the Year of the Horse   tis China that gallops toward the head of the pack

11858,233373,RGLD,Juniors Operating From The Driver s Seat  Adrian Day,opinion,"Adrian Day has spent years making money for clients by steering them into and out of positions in precious metals equities  While higher commodity prices are always welcome  the founder of Adrian Day Asset Management says in this interview with The Gold Report  that he maneuvers toward more telltale fundamentals like strong balance sheets and sound business plans  He believes investors should shift toward companies helmed by experienced managers with skin in the game and with exceptional projects  and names a handful that fit the bill 
The Gold Report  In an  with The Gold Report after the March Prospectors   Developers Association of Canada convention  you said that Gold had bottomed and that it would be a mistake to sell it too soon  Since then the ongoing situation in the Ukraine and mixed buying and selling news from China has further blurred the gold picture  What is your near term forecast for gold 
Adrian Day  When you have a market that s declined the way gold has  it would be a mistake to imagine that it s going to bounce back quickly  There s little question that gold has bottomed  I think we re going to see higher prices for the rest of the year 
TGR  Gold fell back in late March  What was behind that 
AD  Two major items hurt gold in March  One was the Chinese economy  The manufacturing and export numbers have not been good  History tells us that recessions are bad for gold and if the Chinese economy went into a recession that would have a negative impact on gold 
The second item was concern over monetary tightening  particularly in the United States  U S  Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen initially made statements that focused on ending additional bond buying  That set a negative tone  More recently she and other Fed people have made it clear that monetary policy is going to remain easy for some time 
I think the market grossly overacted  China is still growing at over 7  a year with under 2  inflation  That s real growth of more than 5   Frankly  it s not that much different from when China was growing at 10  with 5  inflation 
TGR  What s the trade in gold now 
AD  At the early stage of a bull market or a recovery from a correction  we tend to see everything move  But the senior miners go first for obvious reasons  they have more liquidity and the names are well known  We saw that in the rally from December through March when even names like Barrick Gold Corp   TO ABX  NYSE ABX  and Kinross Gold Corp   TO K NYSE KGC  moved up 
Frankly  we can talk about everything that s wrong with the senior miners but they re very cheap and they re the ones producing  If the gold price moves up  the companies that actually produce gold should move up too 
TGR  What is your prognosis for investors in the junior gold sector 
AD  In May or June we ll probably see gold move up to  1 350 1 370 per ounce   1 370 oz  and I suspect we will begin to see some of the juniors move up more  The juniors move more rapidly as a recovery develops 
TGR  With so many juniors out there  where should investors focus 
AD  Investors should focus on companies that have good balance sheets because that enables them to move ahead with their plans without excessive dilution  They should also look for projects that could potentially be taken over  The senior gold producers are hungry for both reserves and mines  We ve seen this recently with the takeover of Osisko Mining Corp  If you re Barrick producing 7 million ounces a year  7 Moz year   that means each year you have to find another 7 Moz  That s difficult  Juniors and exploration companies with coveted assets will be in the driver s seat 
TGR  Investors want to know how they should manage their gold portfolios through the summer months  Refresh  Reload  Rebalance  What s your advice 
AD  A little bit of everything  If there are stocks that have moved ahead of themselves  it would be a good idea to sell them and raise the cash for any additional market weakness  which I would expect to see over the summer 
Another strategy  unless you are trading in an individual retirement account  is the opportunity to take tax losses  That s always a sound tactic in the gold space 
TGR  Adrian Day Asset Management  ADAM  has had some success with the prospect generator model  These companies find economic deposits and then bring in partners to help or fully fund further exploration  Is that the biggest asset of these companies 
AD  Prospect generators  biggest asset is their ability to preserve their balance sheet  The average exploration company has to spend a lot of money to find economic deposits  By its nature an exploration company constantly has to go to the market to raise more capital  The prospect generator model obviates that huge downside by using other people s money  The other big asset prospect generation gives these companies is exposure to multiple mining projects  A lot of exploration companies might only be able to drill one or two projects at a time  While the majority of a project likely belongs to someone else  some of these prospect generators have 5 or even 10 drill programs going on at the same time using other people s money  If investors buy a basket of prospect generators  they are getting exposed to perhaps 60 or 70 drill plays  which is a good thing 
TGR  Please tell us about some prospect generators that you re following and may even be buying 
AD  There are several but my favorite remains Virginia Mines Inc   TO VGQ   In its early days Virginia was more of a pure prospect generator  but its main asset today is a royalty on  l onore  Goldcorp Inc  s  TO G  NYSE GG  next gold mine  which should start up by Q4 14  Virginia was one of the few gold stocks that went up last year and the year before  But it s down this year  It s down because there s a misunderstanding of an  l onore technical report from Goldcorp  NI 43 101 rules allow companies to include only reserves  That means Goldcorp must exclude over half the resource and high confidence resources from that study  Goldcorp has continued to emphasize  however  that this is a long life  robust mine that will operate for at least 20 years  And Goldcorp is continuing to drill 
TGR  The  l onore royalty is considered one of the best royalties held by a junior  Virginia recently bought another small royalty  too 
AD  Virginia is buying little royalties all the time  It did another deal last year with TerraX Minerals Inc   TO TXR   Virginia is always looking for projects that can enhance value  It has over  40 million   40M  in cash it s in the driver s seat  I would use the price decline as an opportunity to buy 
Another prospect generator is Almaden Minerals Ltd   Almaden Minerals Ltd   TO AMM  AMEX AAU   I think it s a good price right now  The company s key asset is the Ixtaca gold silver deposit in Mexico  where Almaden decided to go it alone  It just released a preliminary economic assessment  PEA   and a PEA can include resources  whereas a feasibility study or technical report  such as Goldcorp s on  l onore  can include only reserves  These are high confidence resources about 85  is in the Measured and Indicated category 
Almaden has completed all its infill drilling  so it could likely convert much of the resource to reserves without additional drilling  Ixtaca is a low grade  bulk tonnage project with good infrastructure and lots more drill targets around  It has a reasonably high capex for the size of the deposit but Almaden isn t in the business of building mines 
TGR  Almaden s share price was once above  3  Now it s well below  2 
AD  The stock went way above where it should have  Stocks tend to overrun on the downside just as they overrun on the upside  Almaden has continued to drill that project for the last year or so with excellent results  but it s been a bit of a yawn for the market  The market has almost come to expect good results 
TGR  What s going to push the stock back above  2 
AD  Good question  Over the next 12 months Almaden can complete a prefeasibility without spending much money  That s normally a very weak period for a stock  It is going to continue to drill other targets and if it makes another discovery on a nearby target  I think that changes the picture  Almaden has  12M   2 5M in gold bullion  plus 6 7M in shares of juniors  Almaden also has Duane and Morgan Poliquin the father and son team that runs it  They re two of the best people in the business 
TGR  Perhaps one more prospect generator 
AD  One we ve been buying recently is Riverside Resources Inc   TO RRI   Riverside remains a pure prospect generator  The company does both traditional joint ventures and strategic alliances  a sort of twist on a traditional joint venture  Riverside has alliances with Antofagasta Plc  LONDON ANTO  and Hochschild Mining Plc  LONDON HOCM   Riverside works mostly in Mexico  but also in British Columbia and the U S  Again  it has about  9 5M  plus  3M in equity from other juniors  The key to Riverside is the activity  It will launch at least three drill programs this year  with more than  6M being spent by its partners 
TGR  Would you say that Tajitos or Penoles is Riverside s flagship asset 
AD  I m not really buying Riverside for any one project  To me that s the beauty of a pure prospect generator  With Virginia the royalty is the number one asset  With Almaden Ixtaca is its number one project  With Riverside and with other prospect generators that we own  we can t really say what their key projects are because over the last five years those key projects have often changed 
TGR  Royalties are another staple of ADAM s gold portfolios  You stick mostly with large royalty equities like Franco Nevada Corp   TO FNV  NYSE FNV  and Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  TO RGL   Are there some small cap royalty equities that you re buying 
AD  We largely stick with the larger ones because if you have a lot of money to put to work you go to the big cap names first  If I could only pick one gold stock I would pick Franco Nevada  That s a cornerstone of a portfolio  The reason I like royalty equities is the same reason I like the prospect generator model it minimizes risk and the upside takes care of itself 
One of the smaller ones I like a lot is Gold Royalties Corp   GRO TSX V   That s a  6M company  I should point out that ADAM is a 10  owner 
Gold Royalties now has 20 royalties after acquiring a package of Qu bec royalties  one of which is perhaps three or four years from production  The company received its first royalty payment earlier in the year from Metanor Resources Inc  s  TO MTO  Bachelor Lake gold mine  It might appear that Gold Royalties doesn t have a great balance sheet about  500 000 but it has an extremely low burn rate  Gold Royalties believes it can raise money when there is something to buy  Gold Royalties has come to me twice saying   We want to buy this and we re raising some money   I like that concept  The stock has declined significantly in the last month  This is an incredible opportunity to buy it  but it is very thinly traded 
TGR  Another one 
AD  I like Callinan Royalties Corp   TO CAA  a lot  The stock has a yield of 4 6   Much of its cash flow is from HudBay Minerals Inc  s  HBM TSX  HBM NYSE  777 mine  which is a base metal mine near Flin Flon  Manitoba  The 777 mine is good for at least another eight years  President and CEO Roland Butler is an extremely good steward of other people s money  Butler is Callinan s largest shareholder and I always like to see management with strong positions  Butler thinks most royalties for sale are overpriced because there s a lot of competition  He s taken the unique approach of trying to generate royalties through exploration alliances with prospect generators  For example  he did an exploration alliance with Evrim Resources Corp   EVM TSX V  in Mexico  Evrim is another one of my favorite prospect generators  albeit a smaller one  Callinan has about  28M and is buying back shares 
TGR  You re on a roll 
AD  Another is Solitario Exploration   Royalty Corp   TO SLR   Solitario has three main assets  One is the majority owned Mt  Hamilton gold project in Nevada  Money is being raised to put that into production  The second is the Bongar  zinc project in Peru  There s not a lot of a big zinc mines coming onstream over the next three or four years  Solitario is carried to production on Bongar  but I would not be surprised if it converted its 30  interest to a royalty  The same goes for the joint venture Pedra Branca platinum palladium project in Brazil with Anglo American Platinum Ltd   JO AMSJ   the largest platinum producer in the world  Solitario is carried to production there  too  and if you re a South African platinum producer with all the headaches in South Africa  you re looking for platinum deposits elsewhere 
TGR  It s noteworthy that you re long on all these names 
AD  By nature I m not a trader  I much prefer to find a really good company with good management and a good balance sheet that I can hold for many years  If investors have a really good position in Callinan  for example  and see the stock run up to  2 20  I have no objection with trimming a little with the emphasis on  a little  and then look to buy it back if it drops back to  1 80  These are definitely long term positions  they re investments  not trades 
TGR  What are some other well funded juniors with promising projects that could warrant a long position 
AD  Mandalay Resources Corp   TO MND   It s traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange but it doesn t have a high profile in North America  I think that s one of the reasons the stock is so low  Mandalay has producing assets in Australia and near term production assets in Chile  primarily gold and silver  It s a  300M company that pays a 3 3  yield  It s trading at  0 98 and I think it s just a steal  We re buying away on that one 
Another well funded junior is Asanko Gold Inc   TO AKG   Asanko Gold Inc  AMEX AKG   the former Keegan Resources  Asanko has a strong balance sheet  an experienced management team and a very large gold resource at its flagship Esaase gold project in Ghana  West Africa  Development is moving slowly but all the ingredients are there  To me  this is a long term hold while Asanko develops Esaase and puts it into production 
Another company that has good funding is Rye Patch Gold Corp   TO RPM    OTC RPMGF   It has a good balance sheet and a royalty on Coeur Mining Inc  s  CDM TSX  NYSE CDE  Rochester gold silver mine in Nevada  Rye Patch can t sell that royalty at the moment but it s probably worth about  20M on its balance sheet  Rye Patch ended the year with about  8M  Basically  Rye Patch s cash plus the value of the royalty equals the market cap  All the exploration that Rye Patch is doing three exploration projects in Nevada comes for free  That s what I really like 
TGR  Parting thoughts for investors 
AD  If gold goes to  1 800 oz  Barrick  Kinross  Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  and others are all going to do well  But until then you need to stick with companies that have good people  good balance sheets  and strong business plans  Stick with the best whether it s the seniors  juniors or exploration companies  Don t be too quick to take profits  but keep an eye on companies that deviate from their business plan

11872,233387,RGLD,Aldis  Hicks  Miners Downsizing Capital Expenses For Smart Growth,opinion,Smart companies are beginning to ignore analysts  insistence that production growth is always good  and to focus instead on growing their margins by lowering capital expenses  This is good news to U S  Global Investors Inc  s Brian Hicks  co manager of the Global Resources Fund  and Ralph Aldis  senior mining analyst and portfolio manager of the Gold and Precious Metals Fund and World Precious Minerals Fund  Learn what kinds of companies attract the interest of these active managers in this Gold Report interview  The Gold Report  The Nov  1 edition of  suggested that gold equities generally perform poorly in a U S  election year but rebound strongly the following year  Do you expect a better year for gold and gold equities in 2013  Ralph Aldis  This year has not been a stellar year for gold equities  Most of the gold equity funds have negative returns for the year  Brian Hicks  We believe gold equities will do well next year  largely due to macroeconomic factors that have been in place for some time  but which will become even more pronounced in 2013  Those factors include central banks expanding their balance sheets and increased concern over deficit spending here in the U S  Looking at how cheap gold equities are relative to the bullion price  that spread will continue to be arbitraged in 2013  TGR  Every media outlet in the country is talking about the fiscal cliff  If the U S  goes over the fiscal cliff  what effect would that have on the gold price and on gold equities  RA  No one has the stomach to let the country fall off the cliff  A compromise will be reached  The most likely scenario is that the government will have to print money in flight  That will be a very clear signal to own gold bullion  and gold equities will be handed their marching papers to go higher  BH  Whether we get a compromise or go over the cliff  which is the less likely event  gold will do well  Either way  there will be a lot of uncertainty and concern about financial assets  That will prompt people to see gold as a hedge  TGR  Gold equity investors have seen more volatility than gains in recent years  Should they expect more of the same over the next four to five years  BH  The volatility has held true for the markets in general  it has not been specific to gold equities  On a relative basis  gold equities have outperformed the broader market since 2008  To prepare for volatility  investors should be balanced  not overweight in any particular sector  You want to be able to capitalize on the volatility to the upside or the downside  Gold equities are somewhat countercyclical  they can diversify a portfolio and be additive to overall risk adjusted returns  RA  When silver was hitting close to  50 ounce  oz   the regulators raised margin requirements something like five times in five days  That knocked silver for probably its biggest correction ever in a single week  If you live through that type of correction once  you become gun shy about going long on equities when the metal prices are going up  More generally  the tech bubble  the credit crisis  the real estate crash and the large number of baby boomers approaching retirement are all causing people to sell equities  They are turning to fixed income or structured interest rate products  That provides a great buying opportunity for equities  BH  Generalists talk about gold being in a bubble  but I agree with Warren Buffett that the real bubble is government bonds  At some point  that money will have to come out  When it does  it will be looking for returns and for yield  Gold stocks will be poised to capitalize on that  TGR  How should gold equity investors handle common market corrections  RA  One strategy  if you are certain that you are in a bull market  is to stay long the entire time  I would say you stick with it  However  in managing our funds  we always keep some cash on hand so we can buy stocks on these dips  For example  a company releases a good news story and the stock starts moving twice as much as any other stock that day  It is probably prudent to sell perhaps 1  of your position because you will be able to replace it later at a cheaper price  TGR  Another edition of Frank Talk discussed how companies  margins are being compromised and growing thinner  What must gold companies do to boost investor confidence  RA  The industry s mantra has been  grow production   That is what the analysts look for and what companies are trying to do  but it is difficult to grow production  You can grow production through your own organic discovery or through acquisition  Too often  companies overpay or size up a marginal project from say  30 000 tons  30 Kt  day to 60 Kt day  They have tried to grow production at the expense of lowering margins  If they lower their margins  they can no longer pay a dividend  If the gold price corrects  the project may no longer be economic  Management needs to focus on return on capital  on making a sound investment in something that you can make money on  For example  Randgold Resources Ltd   GOLD NASDAQ  RRS LSE  models all of its projects on  1 000 oz gold  Its cutoff is a 20  return on  1 000 oz gold  That focus on delivering a return is why Randgold s share price has done so much better than everybody else s  BH  Randgold s success also is a function of having its CEO  Mark Bristow  as such a sizable owner of its common stock  We looked at stocks with high insider ownership versus those with low insider ownership  By a wide margin  precious metals companies with significant management ownership have outperformed companies that do not have much participation from their management teams  TGR  What will drive up the value of gold equities over the next five years  RA  Gold prices will go higher  Central banks around the world are hedging by buying gold in lieu of currency for their reserve holdings  Also  investor demand will push values higher  Companies need to focus on growing their returns and not on growing the company or the production profile  Focusing on returns will allow them to pay a dividend  TGR  Do you own any companies with a market cap over  300 million  M  that do not pay a dividend  RA  Yes  There are companies in the growth phase  in the capital phase where they are not cash flow positive in the sense of having sufficient free cash flow to start writing checks to shareholders  While some companies are paying modest dividends of 1 2   paying a dividend is more the exception than the rule  The only high price dividend payers are companies whose share price has been knocked down  like Gold Fields Ltd   GFI NYSE   TGR  Given gold companies  heavy capital expense  capex  demands  do you see the major players getting to dividends in the 4 5  range  RA  Rather than increasing dividends  companies have been upsizing their projects to grow their production profile  The only people making money are the consultants earning fees by telling the mining companies what to do with their project and the companies building the actual mines  Gold companies are making profits but they are not yielding exceptional returns  The majors are all trying to push upside of the project in the false belief that if they move all the cash flow forward  they will get a higher multiple  TGR  If the companies in your funds are making less money than their consultants  why are you in this sector  RA  Our funds are weighted differently from indexes that focus on the big four  Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE   Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  and Newcrest Mining Ltd   NCM ASX   As active managers  we are trying to scope out the companies that are doing the right things to achieve the top returns we want for our shareholders  BH  Ralph and I agree that Randgold would be the bellwether and it has been a core holding for many years  It has created shareholder value throughout the cycle  It is defensive in that it has high grades  its projects are stress tested at  1 000 oz gold  It has done very well since 2000  much better than the price of bullion  That is the type of company we look for  RA  Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM TSX  AEM NYSE  is another company that got severely punished earlier in the year for a couple of missteps  but management knows what it is doing  TGR  Were you disappointed to see President and COO Ebe Sherkus step down  RA  Agnico Eagle s culture is strong enough to survive that  The company has a deep pipeline of talent to fill the voids when they come up  TGR  What is your investment thesis  BH  Our view is that gold stocks have been derated since the introduction of the SPDR Gold Trust  GLD  exchange traded fund  That derating is reflected in lower multiples to cash flow and earnings  because returns on capital have not been sufficiently higher than their cost of capital  However  lower oil prices and fuel costs  as well as the delay or outright cancellation of many capital projects  could provide some relief in the cost of labor and raw materials  From that standpoint  over the intermediate term  margins could start to expand  That would be good for gold equities  We also think money will continue to flow into the sector because we are bullish on gold  Historically  if you pick the right stocks  you get 2 1 leverage by owning the stock versus the commodity  Our job as active money managers is to sift through the large universe of companies and pick stocks that will exhibit that leverage in a rising gold market  RA  George Topping  an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus  caught the gist of what needs to happen in his report   Don t Build It and They Will Come   Since that report  companies like Rainy River Resources Ltd   RR TSX V  have started looking at how to downsize projects  That may be the catalyst that will take some of the pressure off the margins  The other thing that has hurt gold companies in this cycle is understating their cash costs  Only government officials really believe a cash cost of  700 to produce an ounce of gold  Governments look at those numbers and say  you guys are making windfall profits  so we need to raise your taxes  To combat that  companies need to talk about the cost to produce an ounce of gold in total cost terms  That is beginning to happen  The World Gold Council met at the Denver Gold Show to talk about how to transition from a cash cost definition to a total cost definition  This would make the industry more transparent and the companies more accountable  TGR  Can you name some companies with projects that have downsized capex to mine more efficiently and more intelligently  RA  Rainy River and Keegan Resources Inc   KGN TSX  KGN NYSE MKT  just announced downsizings  Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE  has talked about rethinking its development process  We will see a trend of companies taking the foot off the pedal and thinking about what makes sense  If you can develop a project at a higher margin  that is the smarter choice  TGR  What equities are you bullish on  RA  You have to give the royalty companies some serious thought  They are insulated from capital cost increases  at least on the cost structure side  Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE   Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE  and Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX  have done very well  Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V   an up and comer  has created good returns  These companies have to be careful about buying a royalty on a project that has margins that may be too thin and getting in too deep  The royalty company may not be on the hook for more capital  but it has a lot of costs if that project is not built  BH  Several silver companies look interesting  The price of silver is high enough for some of the lower cost silver companies to generate free cash flow and superior returns on capital compared to their precious metal peers  Tahoe Resources Inc   THO TSX  TAHO NYSE  is run by Kevin McArthur  former CEO of Goldcorp  A proven mine builder  and we particularly like that he owns 4M shares of that stock  so he has a vested interest in the company s success  which may translate into a substantial dividend yield  TGR  Would now be a good time to look at Tahoe  after its stock prices have come off its high  BH  Yes  Tahoe is entering a sweet spot in the lifecycle of a mine  It is far along in development and is poised to start production  If you look at the earnings power Tahoe has at current silver prices  it looks cheap to us  RA  Kevin McArthur has a vision for taking Tahoe forward  If anybody can build it in Guatemala  he s the man to do it  I recently attended one of Kevin s presentations in Panama  where he talked about paying a  2 share dividend  But he understands this is a cash cow  BH  The Escobal project in Guatemala is a world class deposit  The further along it gets in development  the more derisked Tahoe becomes and the higher the share price  TGR  Silver Wheaton CEO Randy Smallwood expects a strong Q4 12  What is underpinning that optimism  Is there a new stream about to start up  RA  I am not aware of a new stream coming on line  It may be related to a timing delay in ounces sold  or to production setbacks over water issues at Pe asquito  If those issues are cleaned up  production can return to normal  BH  The important thing with Silver Wheaton is that it is a large cap company now but it can still grow its attributable production via silver stream north of 10  between now and 2016 with no ongoing capital expenditures  It also has a dividend policy of 20  of its cash flow  Plus Silver Wheaton has over  500M in cash that could be used to make further investments that would be accretive to earnings and operating cash flow  TGR  Are you buying companies now in the expectation of more merger and acquisition  M A  activity as the gold price rises  RA  Not really  I think M A activity is on hold as companies figure out how to optimize their existing projects and increase their margins  Stupid acquisitions are one of the best ways to destroy capital  I do not believe M A is the way to go right now  However  a couple of companies could be in play just on valuation  Dundee Precious Metals Inc   DPM TSX  gets penalized for being in Eastern Europe and for having a smelter in Namibia that was recently attacked by the environmental minister without any evidence for his allegations  Dundee Precious Metals is looking at putting a pyrite recovery circuit at its main mine  Chelopech  It would not cost much to do  but would probably boost gold production by half  With that circuit in place  it may be a good purchase for Eldorado Gold Corp   ELD TSX  EGO NYSE   Dundee Precious Metals probably has 50  upside from where it is at right now  Another company  Gran Colombia Gold Corp   GCM TSX V   was taken over two years ago and the assets were bought out of bankruptcy  It has hired new people on the ground who are really doing first class work  I visited last week with the new mining engineer in charge of the underground work at its Segovia operation  We reviewed every stope model and the pay yields on everything needed to turn the asset around  Gran Colombia also has its Marmato operation  a high grade underground operation that never had a mine plan  Its new consultant  Lee Hill  has worked all over the world and he loves this project  Marmato has probably 17 Moz gold  with an official number around 13 Moz  But when you look at the four holes already drilled  you can see substantial amounts of gold  Then  you start thinking that this may be an underground mine  not an open pit  Its share price is in the  0 35 range and if it shows the asset can be turned around  that stock is very cheap and is a potential takeout  TGR  You place a premium on communication  Why is that  RA  We try to keep the lines of shareholder communication open because that signals to people how engaged we are in what we are trying to do  Shareholder education builds shareholder loyalty  We cover a lot of topics  Frank Holmes travels the world and talks to thousands of people  Brian and I visit projects and have regularly scheduled calls with analysts three and four times a week  We try to synthesize our view and share it  The overall market seems to be highly depressed  and everybody just wants to talk about the negatives  but there is opportunity  BH  As analysts and portfolio managers  summarizing what happened over a week s time  help us put events in perspective  When you have to write about it  you have to think clearly about the issues  It s a good tool for us as well  TGR  What is a good rule of thumb for precious metals equities investors  RA  On the gold and precious metals side  at a minimum they should keep 5 10  of their overall portfolio in gold and gold stocks and rebalance it annually  The good thing about gold and gold stocks is that they are not as positively correlated to the overall market  When your gold equities are down  your other stocks tend to be up  if other stocks are down  the gold equities are probably making up the losses  We find that to be a great portfolio diversifier over time  If you do the efficient frontiers  gold equities not only lower the overall volatility  they also raise the average return  TGR  And you  Brian  BH  The precious metals market is surprisingly inefficient  There are opportunities to trade around core positions when you have dislocations in the market  whether it is a geopolitical event or a change in government policy  On an individual basis  it can be daunting to navigate that on your own  We add value by having the resources and the time to be active managers and to capitalize on these dislocations and inefficiencies  I would say let professionals manage your gold portfolio for optimal risk adjusted returns  TGR  Brian and

11873,233388,RGLD,Paolo Lostritto  Separating The Gold Mining Haves From The Have Nots ,opinion,After months of turmoil that have lasted longer than investors could have imagined  the mining world has been divided into haves and have nots  There are gold companies that managed their balance sheets wisely and there are those that burned through cash and are left begging for financing  It s a great time for those flush companies that don t need handouts to take advantage of the resulting valuation differential  says Paolo Lostritto  the director of research and mining and metals analyst at National Bank Financial  In this interview with The Gold Report  Lostritto talks about a subtle shift he has seen in the market that may signal a bull run similar to that of the late 1970s and early 1980s  The Gold Report  National Bank Financial began taking a defensive approach to gold equities in April by focusing on companies with strong balance sheets  which could fund their own growth and not have to go to the equity markets to survive  Does Alamos Gold Inc  s  AGI TSX   780 million  M  takeover offer for Aurizon Mines Ltd   ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE MKT  validate that defensive thesis  Paolo Lostritto  We were right to have a defensive approach  but we probably weren t defensive enough  Multiples contracted much more aggressively than even we expected  There was a raft of project delays  cancellations  and capital and operating cost increases that have decimated the space so much that less than half of the gold mining industry is actually making money based on our all in cost estimate from third quarter data  The Gold Report  National Bank Financial began taking a defensive approach to gold equities in April by focusing on companies with strong balance sheets  which could fund their own growth and not have to go to the equity markets to survive  Does Alamos Gold Inc  s  AGI TSX   780 million  M  takeover offer for Aurizon Mines Ltd   ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE MKT  validate that defensive thesis  Paolo Lostritto  We were right to have a defensive approach  but we probably weren t defensive enough  Multiples contracted much more aggressively than even we expected  There was a raft of project delays  cancellations  and capital and operating cost increases that have decimated the space so much that less than half of the gold mining industry is actually making money based on our all in cost estimate from third quarter data  Royalty companies are positioned well in the current market environment  The junior market has been absolutely decimated  There hasn t been a better market for royalty companies to talk to junior developers and work out royalty deals to bolster their existing pipeline of royalty assets  TGR  What royalty companies do you follow  PL  I follow Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE   and my partner Shane Nagle follows Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX  and Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V   TGR  Sandstorm is a relatively recent entry into that space  Do you expect more royalty companies to come into the mix  PL  There s definitely an attraction to the royalty model  which was pioneered by the founders of Franco Nevada  There is a lot less risk  yet the shares still give you exposure to exploration upside  Yes  there are a number of groups out there trying to create new royalty companies  but the hardest part is to attract a premium valuation  In order to attract a premium valuation  the royalty company has to have a portfolio of royalties  It s very difficult to gain enough critical mass to attract that premium valuation and truly be in a situation where one plus one equals three  Groups are trying  but it s not easy  TGR  Will larger royalty companies like Royal Gold and Franco Nevada buy up some of the smaller royalty companies  PL  I would imagine that they have reviewed their competitor s portfolios  However  a company like Franco Nevada just finished spending  1 billion on the Cobre Panama project with very little short term impact on its share price  We believe the asset will eventually start to improve the share price as it gets closer to generating cash flow  It s very difficult to move the needle for larger royalty companies and as such they try and focus on longer life assets or assets they believe have exploration upside  TGR  What are some junior companies that still have some value and could rebound if capital loosens up  PL  Given our cautiously optimistic perspective  we focus on companies that have strong balance sheets and leverage to the gold price  as they are a great risk versus reward investment  Our top idea is Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE   It has not been a popular name and the stock s been beat up  There s probably another write down coming as part of its fourth quarter earnings  but we believe the market is already pricing that in  In addition  the company has a 2 5  yield  which pays you while we wait for better clarity regarding its development plans  We believe Kinross s shares should benefit greatly from an increase in the gold price  We currently have a  15 share target  but if the company executes on its plan and the gold price does what we think it could do   20 share is not out of the question  TGR  Do you see Kinross as a takeover target  PL  If it were a takeover target  it would have been picked off already  I m not recommending it for its takeout valuation  I m recommending it from a leverage standpoint  but leverage is a double edged sword  If we are wrong and the gold price corrects further  there should be enough balance sheet strength to survive for the next couple of years  TGR  Are you excited about any smaller names  Are there some assets out there like Aurizon that are single mine operations generating a fair bit of cash flow  but remain vastly undervalued  PL  There are a few junior producers that we cover but not all of them have the balance sheet quality of Aurizon  Claude Resources Inc   CRJ TSX  CGR NYSE MKT   Lake Shore Gold Corp   LSG TSX  and Kirkland Lake Gold Inc   KGI TSX  all burned through their balance sheets during 2012 and had to raise funds to survive  TGR  Doesn t Claude have assets near Red Lake that it was developing  PL  Claude has assets at Red Lake that it was dewatering  but it was using the dewatered mine as a platform to do further drilling  TGR  Is it on hold now  PL  Claude has scaled down spending on that project because it has been expensive  TGR  What about production at its Seabee mine in Saskatchewan  PL  We re modeling for 2013 and probably will get some updated guidance shortly  Currently  we re modeling 47 6 Koz in 2013 and total cash costs of  1 129 oz  That compares to roughly 47 5 Koz in 2012 at total cash costs of  1 077 oz  TGR  Do any juniors fit your defensive thesis  PL  That s the thing there are not many juniors that fit the defensive thesis  There are a number of single asset production companies that are interesting  but they have hair on them  Kirkland Lake Gold has been one of the most disappointing stocks of 2012 as its ramp up has taken longer than expected  We think there is a tremendous amount of value at Kirkland Lake but the disappointment of 2012 could mean that it s going to take some time to alleviate some of the balance sheet risk and win back market confidence  It s the same story at Lake Shore Gold  Both companies  share price should react well to a higher gold price but we prefer the balance sheet strength offered by Kinross  and the dividend isn t bad either  TGR  Is there anything on the explorer side that makes sense  PL  There are a lot of things out there that are exciting  Pilot Gold Inc   PLG TSX   which is covered by Shane  has had some notable drill results  Pretium Resources Inc   PVG TSX  PVG NYSE  has also had some exciting exploration with its work in the Valley of the Kings  We continue to like Mountain Province Diamonds Inc   MPV TSX  and Romarco Minerals Inc   R TSX   which are both trying to get their construction permits over the short  to medium term  TGR  What s the one message you want to get across when you re out there giving presentations to various institutions  PL  I want to highlight that we see the early signs of money flow but that we are not out of the woods yet  It is about the velocity of money  The initial reaction would be for the market to start to price in higher interest rates  however  we would only start to worry about the gold trade if the outlook for real interest rates was positive  Everybody has had a very difficult 2012  No one wants to jump in with both feet because that would be imprudent  But if we re right  and the velocity of money picks up  then we could be in for an interesting three year period whereby foreign exchange  FX  reserves increase  The velocity of money could take the existing FX reserves from  10 trillion  T  to even  15T just by way of circulation and drive the gold price higher  TGR  How long could that be sustained  PL  In the 1970s  after we went off the gold standard  the gold price increased from US 35 oz to US 200 oz  Then we went through a notable recession in 1973  which led to a deflationary scare until 1975 similar to the one we went through in 2012 which caused the gold price at the time to correct from US 200 oz to US 100 oz  It was only when the velocity of money started to pick up that the concerns regarding deflation shifted toward concerns about inflation  Central Bank Interest rates started to rise  but inflation rose at the same rate or faster  It was a controlled burn in terms of devaluing the currency  That s a better scenario for central banks than being behind the curve and pushing on the string  Once that started in 1976  we went from US 100 oz to as high as US 800 oz  Even if we used gold s average price of  US 400 oz during the 1980s  it is a pretty impressive fourfold move  Who knows what s going to happen  but the data s starting to suggest that this is bubbling to the forefront  There are still a lot of challenges to deal with the U S  debt ceiling and European sovereign debt issues are still a concern but I encourage people to take a second look at the space as there could be some opportunities  TGR  Thanks for sharing your thoughts with us  Paolo  PL  Certainly  You re welcome   currently serves as director of mining equity research for

11877,233392,RGLD,Gold Explorers   In The Right Location   Will Survive  ,opinion,In ancient Greece  farmers would plant crops based on prophecies from an oracle  Today investors look to spreadsheets and minute by minute charts to try to predict the future  Trying to be a prophet is an unprofitable occupation  The secret to wealth is buying wholesale  waiting and hopefully selling it retail We all love sales and discounts when prices drop for fast food  clothing or cars  However  when it comes to mining stocks investors look for momentum and major price rises continuing to bid up the price to overbought levels  Instead  they should look for quality assets on sale in mining friendly jurisdictions The key to making money in the mining market is when you buy not when you sell  Mining equities are priced at irrationally discounted levels and many in the business for many decades have never seen such a disconnect between the share prices and the underlying assets  This may be exactly the time to seize on opportunities of buying mining shares on sale  Wall St  will intoxicate investors with a poison that takes away reason and forces us to follow the flavor of the month  This is happening right now in the ignored and undervalued resource sector and true contrarians who can dismiss the negativity in the market and press could make a fortune if they have patience and fortitude  Technically  gold is basing and should reverse at support and could break out of  1800 later this year There is no doubt that 2011 2013 has been one of the toughest markets for junior miners in several decades  Although the 2008 panic was more severe and quick  this 24 month downtrend has been very long in duration and has shaken out the common speculator  Retail and momentum investors believe good times are here again and are chasing the overbought large cap equities into new highs  especially the banking and housing sectors  Contrarian  patient and smart money is stealthily acquiring quality juniors at pennies on the dollar The hard asset contrarians like myself realize that Central Banks have been printing fiat currency incessantly over the past decade  Record sovereign debt and Central Bank Balance Sheets should support an eventual breakout for gold and silver into new highs  This will eventually cause speculation to return to the junior mines  New gold discoveries have fallen to new lows despite records amount of exploration capital spent  This may lead to an eventual growth crisis for the gold majors who have made poor acquisition choices in questionable risky jurisdictions Costs at some of these mines are soaring above estimates and increased geopolitical turmoil in less stable jurisdictions has forced the majors to take write downs and reassess their growth plans  Investors may soon shift capital from being on the sidelines or in large cap equities into the more speculative junior miners sitting at multi year lows Despite the bearish markets and irrational price declines  the quality juniors with experienced management teams  exploring in stable mining jurisdictions with supportive backing will survive and separate themselves from the pact  They will come out stronger after this bear market is completed This may provide investors with potential long term gains as they are able to buy these quality juniors at ridiculously low valuations  These junior exploratory companies may actually be less risky than large producers with high cost mines operating in dangerous places NuLegacy Gold  NUG V  may be doing it right and at these low levels may provide an intriguing risk reward scenario  They have an experienced  proven team and are exploring next to the two recent major discoveries in mining friendly Nevada   Barrick s Goldrush and Newmont s Long Canyon are some of mining s best discoveries in recent years as the resources continue to grow  NuLegacy is next door to both of these properties where a current gold rush is stealthily underway  The Chief Operating Officer  Dr  Roger Steininger has over 40 years of experience exploring Nevada and is credited with the discovery of the 21 million Barrick Pipeline Mine in the Cortez Trend while consulting with Royal Gold in 1989 NuLegacy separates itself from the typical junior miner with an impressive partnership with Barrick to explore Red Hill in one of the most exciting areas in Nevada   the Cortez Trend  There have been over 52 million ounces of gold discovered and Barrick s Goldrush Deposit has grown in the past four years from 2 million to 14 million ounces of gold Being partnered with Barrick and next door to Goldrush on the Cortez Trend could soon be very attractive in this environment where Barrick is desperate for resource growth and as speculation returns to the junior market Many juniors do not have what NuLegacy offers  A management team with a track record of exploration success  a partner like Barrick and Renaissance and exploration in mining friendly Nevada next to Barrick s Goldrush Deposit and Newmont s Long Canyon Deposit Barrick s Goldrush deposit which is one of the most significant discoveries in the world today sits only a couple of miles from NuLegacy Gold  Being next to one of the great discoveries by Barrick with over 14 million ounces of gold and having the largest gold miners as a partner is a  major  advantage in this market and sets a junior apart from the crowd In addition  NuLegacy Gold is partnered with Renaissance Gold on the property right next to Newmont s Long Canyon called Wood Hills  NuLegacy and Renaissance announced that drilling has already begun Newmont eventually bought out the Long Canyon Deposit which was discovered by AuEX now known as Renaissance for billions of dollars  NuLegacy is in the right place with the right team NuLegacy Gold  NUG V  appears to be forming a falling wedge with increasing momentum  This could be indicative of a potential reversal near two year lows  Look for a breakout from the falling two year downtrend at   14  Notice the strong accumulation and increasing momentum despite the downtrend for the past two years which may be indicating smart money acquiring shares Disclosure  Nulegacy is a sponsor on my free website and newsletter Listen to my recent interview with the Nulegacy CEO James Anderson below Below you may find

11878,233393,RGLD,5 Mining Companies That Meet Jamie Mackie s Success Criteria,opinion,While Jamie Mackie  senior vice president and investment adviser with Macquarie Private Wealth  thinks the mining sector could sink further  he also believes now is the time to buy  carefully  In his first Gold Report interview  he discusses strategies to mitigate junior mining risk  including royalty and streaming companies  large and small  The Gold Report  Investing in mining equities is a cyclical play  Are we at a point in the cycle for investors to return to mining equities  Jamie Mackie  I think the gold mining stocks are at or near the bottom  Research from the Ned Davis Research Group shows that pessimism is extremely high typically an indication that we are close to a bottom  From our perspective  that is the best time to position yourself  Once the market begins to turn  it will happen rapidly  Investors need to recognize value and get in reasonably early to avoid paying up later  I compare the situation to being at a huge party  the party being the blue chip  dividend paying sector  The party has been going on for quite a while  and it is hard to leave the party and sit in a room all alone  But that is what investors should do  spend time in the room alone  waiting for others to join them  TGR  From a wealth building perspective  how do mining equities fit in a world that is deleveraging  JM  Your choice of the word deleveraging is interesting because I would say the world as a whole is not deleveraging  True  U S  households have begun to deleverage  which has been positive for the market  Corporations have been deleveraging for some time  but now  due to artificially low interest rates  they are beginning to take on more debt  Governments except for those with austerity programs  like Greece  Ireland and Italy have leveraged up massively  They are trying to make up for shortfalls in spending by corporations and consumers  Once governments ramp up spending  it is difficult for them to reduce expenditures later on  Governments are engaging in currency wars in an attempt to get their currencies down so their economies can compete globally  This is self defeating  It inflates the money supply and puts downward pressure on the value of the currency  Money printing is an insidious form of taxation on personal savings  People who want to protect against the ongoing depreciation of their savings need to have hard asset exposure  This process isn t stopping  Witness the March 20 decision by the U S  Federal Reserve to continue with the Quantitative Easing program  Owning quality mining and energy companies or the commodities themselves offers protection against this  TGR  As a private wealth manager  how much of a typical portfolio are you allotting to junior mining equities  JM  Right now  in the 2 3  range  so fairly modest  Our focus is more on energy equities right now  TGR  How do you counterbalance the risk junior mining equities represent  JM  Our approach to offsetting the risk in junior mining focuses on senior blue chip and dividend paying equities  Although as things get more expensive we are taking money off the table  As price earnings ratios for specific equities get out of our comfort range  we want safer opportunities  People often ask whether bonds would be a good risk offset  We view the bond sector as the most expensive  inflated bubble ever  Apart from very short duration bonds  we are on the sidelines  Perhaps a better way to offset the mining stock risk is with a larger portion of physical gold  perhaps a 70 30 ratio  Of that 30  in equities  70  would be in larger cap  Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  type equities and the rest in smaller  well capitalized juniors  TGR  How do you mitigate risk before you take positions in junior mining equities  JM  Management is number one  Does management have skin in the game  It is important that management be aligned with our interests  TGR  Do you have a rule of thumb for ownership percentage  JM  The bigger percentage of management s net worth  the better  Quality of the management team is really more important  Generally  if members of the management team are confident in their abilities and their projects  they will take significant positions  TGR  What other factors help you mitigate risk  JM  Time to production is important  The mining sector has something we call the  valley of death   A company has a great discovery  it takes six years to get into production  meanwhile  the stock plummets and the company cannot get financing  It is at 6 12 months before production that interest in the equity picks up again  Then you look at the size of the ore body  Is the project big enough to attract the attention of an even higher quality buyer  Is the project in a good jurisdiction  We have had what could be described as investment fatigue over political issues  TGR  Investment fatigue is an interesting concept  Can you expand on it  JM  When a government changes  the question becomes what one owns after the change  Egypt and Mali are two examples  Countries that follow British common law tend to be more stable from the point of view of jurisdiction and ownership  Russia is a country with a legal system quite different from British common law  It has been difficult to work in China from a property ownership point of view  Argentina s somewhat erratic government has been tough  Other countries Peru  Colombia and Chile  for example have improved a lot  TGR  Which small cap mining equities have withstood the rigors of your due diligence  JM  B2Gold Corp   BTO TSX  BGLPF OTCQX  has a number of high quality projects in decent jurisdictions  It is reasonably capitalized and can still raise money  TGR  The B2Gold management team has built companies before  for example  Bema Gold  which was sold to Kinross Gold Corp  K TSX  KGC NYSE  for about  3 5 billion  Do you think management plans the same with B2Gold  JM  Junior gold miners tend to be taken out by the bigger players  That is the ultimate liquidity event  and it would not surprise me if that was the plan  B2Gold could go to a Kinross or a Goldcorp  but for the time being I think it will stay independent  TGR  What other companies are on your list  JM  Detour Gold Corp   DGC TSX  has come through the valley of death and is on its way to production in about six months  Its capital risk is almost out of the way  The company is capitalized now and it looks quite cheap by most measures  TGR  It published guidance of 350 000 400 000 ounces gold this year  Has Detour said what it plans to do with its cash flow  JM  Management says it wants Detour to remain a single purpose mining company  It does not want the headache of running more than one mine  I suppose its first step would be to pay down debt or perhaps issue a dividend  TGR  It is a pretty impressive mine  located in a very stable jurisdiction in northeastern Ontario  Do you want to see a dividend  JM  We would be delighted with a dividend  Dividends help the market value an equity differently  The idea is to start with a dividend program that allows a company to improve its business without taking on additional debt  When companies pay too much dividend  it hurts their stock  TGR  Do you have any other names  JM  There is IAMGOLD Corp   IMG TSX  IAG NYSE   It has a great balance sheet and interesting projects  The company is trying to reposition itself in Canada  and the stock looks cheap because of those efforts and issues with a couple of their international projects  It has an almost 4  dividend now  We have been buying IAMGOLD  TGR  Do you expect a price rebound or might future events keep the price down  JM  I see way more upside in IAMGOLD than downside  Mali may not be the best jurisdiction  but the company has not had any interruptions there  The project generates a lot of cash  The issue in Mali is that the mine is not being expanded  IAMGOLD is a minority partner and does not really control its destiny  That is why the company is trying to reposition in Canada  where it controls 100   IAMGOLD has huge cash on the balance sheet  The company can move forward regardless of what the share price does  I think it should recover nicely  maybe not to  16 share  but to  11 12 share  TGR  Does its exposure to Africa concern you  JM  I think that is already discounted in the share price  Every day that passes  IAMGOLD is generating more cash  Sanatana Resources Inc   STA TSX V  has a property immediately adjacent to the Cote Lake in Ontario  Canada  property owned by IAMGOLD  TGR  Was that the Trelawney acquisition  JM  Sanatana was a partner with Trelawney on the Watershed project  TGR  Is this play based on the idea that if Cote becomes a mine  Watershed will be developed  JM  I would think so  yes  TGR  Sanatana is a very small market cap company doing exploration  The two questions are management and cash  What are your thoughts on both  JM  I trust Sanatana s management  The team does what it says it will do  Peter Miles is a straightforward  honest guy  The team s technical capability is way beyond what you would anticipate in a small mining company  Buddy Doyle and Troy Gill are as good or better than you would find in any senior mining company  The company has enough cash to keep going for a while  probably until it has NI 43 101 equivalent resources  TGR  Is there enough cash to get the company through 2013  JM  Yes  I think so  TGR  What other companies would you like to discuss  JM  We have followed Gold Standard Ventures Corp   GSV TSX V  GSV NYSE  through its ups and downs  The company seems to be on the road back up  It is in a highly prolific area in the Carlin Trend in Nevada  The company has had great results  The management team includes highly qualified technical people  TGR  You visited the site  What were your impressions  JM  Gold Standard s mine is next door to a number of great mines  which you can see from the property  That dramatically improves the likelihood of success  The company also has people very experienced with developing bigger mines in the area  TGR  What did you think of the most recent drill results on the North Bullion Fault Zone  JM  The company had some great results  5 15 grams per ton on the target zone  and long length  This is not a tiny vein  This is a small company that would be attractive to a potential buyer  TGR  I would like to change the subject to royalties  You are fairly bullish on precious metals royalties  The royalty model is inherently lower risk than actual mining  but royalty companies typically have a lot of exposure to movement in metals prices  What is your outlook for gold and silver prices for the rest of 2013  JM  The party going on in the blue chip  dividend paying equities has resulted in an exodus from the mining sector and from the gold exchange traded funds  ETFs  into stocks that generate income  The resulting sales of gold drove the gold price down  On the other hand  physical gold is being bought by longer term  stronger investors  i e   the Chinese  Indian and other developing countries  governments  as well as individuals there  Private investors seeking insurance against currency debasement are buying the commodity  too  The ETF liquidations will cease at some point in the near future so in two to six months out we should see stronger gold prices  mid  1 600 ounce  mid  1 600 oz  or higher  Silver is different  It has industrial uses  including some pretty healthy growth areas  such as electronics and water treatment  A lot of its uses are consumptive  and although there is some recycling  a lot of silver disappears  The ETF market has not been nearly as big on the silver side  and therefore not as disruptive as the gold ETFs  By year end  silver could be  on a percentage basis  somewhat higher than today  TGR  Could it push  35 oz by year end  JM  Silver is a volatile market  There will be spikes and retrenchments  but it could get there  TGR  As of March 7  2013  Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE  and Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX  were trading at about 21 times their estimated 2013 cash flow  Does that suggest the larger royalty plays are overpriced or is there further upside  JM  Franco Nevada and Royal Gold deserve to be trading at some premium  However  at current levels I would probably be liquidating some percentage of my holdings to reinvest in the next tier down  Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE  and Gold Royalties Corp   TSX V GRO  are good examples  You would not transfer your entire Franco or Royal Gold positions down  but by taking a percentage off  you would see bigger upside on the smaller royalty companies  TGR  Would you explain the difference between Silver Wheaton and Gold Royalties for our readers  JM  Royalty companies get the pure price flow through for the commodity without any of the production cost risk  Streaming companies effectively pay for capital development  which helps companies build out a mine or develop a project  then the streaming company takes  for example  the gold stream of a gold copper play as Silver Wheaton recently did with Vale SA  VALE NYSE   The streaming companies allocate an operating cost component or production cost component  so they have slightly more risk to commodity price variations than a pure royalty play  TGR  How do royalty companies benefit from resource expansion on their mining properties  JM  That is the big upside on royalty companies  In most of the projects they finance  they are buying into a royalty stream based on resources outlined in an NI 43 101  Gold mining companies tend not to make capital expenditures to develop new reserves on their existing properties until they need to  Once a project is up and running smoothly  and the company has paid down some debt or proven that the economics are justifiable  it will drill up the surrounding land and get more reserves from that  The streaming company gets huge upside on the pure future development of the mine  That is probably one of the reasons Franco and Royal are trading at such great multiples  TGR  Smaller royalty players have entered the market  such as Premier Royalty Inc   NSR TSX  and Americas Bullion Royalty Corp   AMB TSX   Do they offer value or are they simply trying to piggyback on the success of the larger names  JM  I am sure there is some mimicry of larger royalty companies  However  given the disarray in the mining sector and the dearth of capital on the junior side  there is an opportunity for smaller royalty companies to structure really attractive deals  There are just a handful of royalty companies  It is difficult for Franco  Royal Gold or Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V  to take on these smaller projects  So there is lots of room for small entrepreneurial companies to do deals smaller than  say   100 million  TGR  In effect  if Franco finds a royalty play that could be profitable but does not meet its scale  the company could pass it on to Gold Royalties Corp   which already has an agreement in place with Franco to accommodate this  JM  And the reverse  too  Gold Royalties could find a project that is too big and go to Franco for help on the funding  TGR  What does Gold Royalties have in the pipeline that will produce growth for shareholders  JM  The company has a number of projects  The Metanor Resources Inc   MTO TSX V  project is onstream and producing cash flow  Its next projects are 18 to 24 months out  even up to three years out  Most of those projects are in Qu bec  Ontario and the Yukon  TGR  Premier Royalty has a chart on its website showing that a royalty index consisting of Silver Wheaton  Franco Nevada and Royal Gold outperformed the gold spot price by 54  from January 2008 through January 2013  Should investors expect similar gains over the next five years  JM  These stories are evolving and benefiting from expansions in reserves and resources as the companies move projects forward  Royalty companies have the benefit of not having to pay for exploration or construction and are protected from operating cost escalation  The royalty companies could outperform the gold spot price  TGR  What are your royalty holdings  JM  Franco  obviously  We have owned Gold Royalties from its genesis  We own Silver Wheaton and are buying more  That one has a lot of upside  it is doing great deals in the right sectors  and has expanded into gold  TGR  What advice would you give retail investors that they ought to hear  but might not want to hear  JM  The stock market is massively fickle and the mining sector is in difficult times that could prevail for an extended period  In the long run  this is a self correcting event  Mines will be delayed if things carry on as they are until demand returns  grows and outstrips supply  Further decreases in the commodity price will damage equity values  Strong companies have the upper hand  and at some point  they will use it  They will find and purchase the best projects  although we have not seen much merger and acquisition activity lately  I think even Goldcorp and Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  are shell shocked  They have had huge cost escalation in projects and are looking to finish them before taking on others  That has been a real wet blanket on the junior mining sector  The world keeps growing  along with demand for commodities  Currencies will continue to be debased  Inflation will begin to drive commodity prices higher  The biggest question right now is when  Nobody has a good answer  The inflation numbers provided by governments are nowhere close to accurate  Good measures might be the cost of building a mine or the associated operating cost  If the costs were the prescribed inflation rate of 1 5   the mining sector would not be having such huge cost overruns  If you take a position in the junior mining sector  you have to be patient  although patience does not seem to be a virtue in the current market  TGR  Jamie  thank you for your time and your insights   has more than 33 years

11880,233395,RGLD,Peter Krauth  Precious Metals The Antidote To Fiat Currency Threat,opinion,Peter Krauth  resource specialist for Money Map Press  considers the precious metals space an overarching requirement for investors  He sees value in every sector  although he admits it takes a contrarian mindset to see the opportunity among stocks that have been trending down for as long as 18 months  In this Gold Report interview  Krauth shares names from majors to mid caps to royalty companies  including those in the platinum group metals space  where supply and demand tensions will move the price of palladium up  The Gold Report  Peter  playing equities is all about timing  With many resource equities trading near all time lows  it seems like a buyer s market  Do you agree  Peter Krauth  Central banks have been on a fiat money printing binge since 2008  In the last 18 months  that is starting to have the desired effect  The global economy seems to be healing  Demand for goods is coming back strongly  the Dow Jones Industrial Average is setting new records  But at the same time  there will be a serious price to pay with inflation  Commodities tend to benefit from inflation  This is a very good and important space that investors need to include in their portfolios  TGR  Does that hold true across all commodities  PK  The entire secular commodities bull market is not completely over  It has been going for 12 years  but the average tends to be closer to 17 years  This bull market might last 20 years or even longer  if you consider development in China and India home to nearly one third of the world s population along with the rest of the developing world  These populations are improving their standards of living  growing their incomes and looking for a better lifestyle  That means someone will have to make all the stuff they will want to acquire  However  there could be a serious low or even a setback in the form of seriously reduced economic demand or an inflationary crisis  That would quiet things for a while  but would also do a lot of cleansing  After that  we will be back on our way  Nonetheless  investors have to be picky  Every resource has its own cycle  It takes a lot of research to decide where you should be and when  TGR  What are you telling the readers of your newsletter about increasing their exposure to natural resources in their portfolios  PK  Right now  I see opportunities in base metals  energy and agriculture  And of course  precious metals will remain an overarching requirement to have exposure to commodities  The larger gold miners have become extremely cheap  with very compelling valuations  As a group  they have not been cheaper since the secular bull market started  Gold may have been in consolidation mode since it reached  1 900 ounce   1 900 oz  in September 2011  but I believe the secular bull market is far from over  despite the possibility of some sideways or downward price action  The Market Vectors Gold Miners  GDX   an exchange traded fund  ETF  that many consider a proxy for the Amex Gold BUGS Index  HUI   has a price to earnings ratio  P E  of 10  far better than the average blue chip stock  which is closer to 16 17 P E  TGR  Some say the gold price is like a ball when you drop it  The first bounce is the highest  and the bounces keep getting smaller after each drop  Does that pattern worry you  PK  No  As the consolidation moves forward in time  the price range gets narrower and narrower  At some point  that will have to change  The price will either drop down or break out of its narrowing price range  I believe it will break out  The gold price is unlikely to stay very stable for an extended period  There is too much political and economic instability  The run on the banks in Cyprus is an example  a lot of Southern Europe has too much unemployment and sovereign debt  Ongoing gold purchases by the central banks provide renewed support for the gold price  All of these factors  and others  will support the gold price  at least in the  1 500 oz range  It could continue sideways for some time  but the bias is very much on the upside  TGR  What analysis do you do on small  and mid cap resource names before adding them to your portfolio  PK  My main filters are management  location  cash strength  ease of execution and asset quality  This analysis eliminates many potential plays  but there are more than enough attractive opportunities if you stick to those that stay within those parameters  I see no reason to take on additional risk  TGR  Which small  and mid cap resource names in your portfolio might you share with our readers  PK  My favorite development stage play is Paramount Gold and Silver Corp   PZG NYSE MKT  PZG TSX   The company recently released a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  on its San Miguel project in Mexico  The numbers look very attractive  Its initial capital requirements of  232 million   232M  are pretty reasonable  The mine would actually produce about 57 000 oz  57 Koz  gold and more than 3 million ounces  3 Moz  silver annually for 14 years  If you were to convert the forecast silver production to gold  it would be more than 115 Koz gold equivalent  Au eq  produced annually  With the 5  discount rate that the company used to evaluate the project  the net present value  NPV  exceeds  707M  with an internal rate of return  IRR  around 32   This single project at a  707M NPV is more than double the company s current market cap of  290M  On that basis alone  the stock should be twice its current  2 16 share trading price  Shares barely budged on the news of the San Miguel PEA  That is a ridiculous reaction  and a clear sign that sentiment is coloring everything gold related  TGR  You buy Paramount for San Miguel  and you get Sleeper  its precious metals project in Nevada  for free  Is that what you are saying  PK  Or vice versa  or you buy Paramount for both San Miguel and Sleeper and get a lot for free  Paramount released PEA results on Sleeper in July 2012  The startup costs would be about  340M  production would be 172 Koz gold and 263 Koz silver annually  The average operating cost was  767 oz Au eq and the IRR was about 26   at  1 384 oz gold price  If you bumped up the gold price to  1 615 oz  the IRR shoots up to 40   This makes Sleeper very attractive at the current gold price  Paramount prudently used lower gold and silver prices in its estimates  TGR  Will Paramount have any trouble raising that  232M to develop San Miguel  PK  Paramount just had some warrants exercised  so it is cashed up to  18M  That should carry it through 18 to 24 months  I believe it will keep moving both projects forward  Both are attractive and could draw the interest of a major  TGR  Might Paramount sell one project to develop the other  PK  I could see that as a possibility  however  given its advantageous cash balance compared to the rest of the industry  I doubt Paramount will be pushed into that situation anytime soon  It could probably even raise cash to tide it over without being overly dilutive to its shareholders  Both projects are in great jurisdictions and have great infrastructure  With each project worth about  700M  that is close to  1 4 billion   1 4B  in value  and the market values Paramount at less than  300M  Realistically  the shares could be 4 5 times what they are trading at now  TGR  Please tell us about another name  PK  We hold Timmins Gold Corp   TMM TSX  TGD NYSE MKT   a small producer whose San Francisco mine is in Mexico  The company had record gold production last year  a 27  increase year over year  YOY   It is expanding its crushing capacity  which should allow for another 25 30  growth in 2013  For a small producer  its P E is 10 5  and its forward P E is 7  It has a  28M cash balance and roughly  20M in debt  Timmins is very well run  It is a smaller producer with a great future  TGR  Timmins looks to be a company that would benefit from a change in market sentiment  Do you think the market is already factoring in last week s news that the Mexican government may raise taxation rates and royalties on mining operations  PK  That is possible  but the Mexican government understands what it is doing  Gold production is growing fast there  On raising taxes and royalty rates  Mexico will be the rule  not the exception  We expect to see this everywhere  Governments are hungry for income  If gold continues to rise  these companies will be increasingly profitable  This rise in taxes will have only a temporary dampening effect  it will not hurt the bull market in any way  TGR  What will Timmins do with its cash flow  PK  Timmins is expanding its crushing capacity  drilling off and expanding its resource  I believe that as the company was drilling off and delineating more ounces  its finding costs were  10 oz an incredible return  Its exploration program is relatively aggressive  but the company also is confirming the gold in higher confidence categories  TGR  Are there any other names you would like to discuss  PK  In silver  we hold Aurcana Corporation  AUN TSX V  AUNFF OTCQX   which also has been growing its production quickly  In mid December  the company reached commercial production at its Shafter mine in Texas  It also produces in Mexico from a project called La Negra  Shafter is a milestone that will move Aurcana to much higher production levels this year  I look forward to seeing Shafter s contribution in the company s Q1 13 results  Even without Shafter  Q4 12 production was up 34  YOY  overall 2012 production was up 42   La Negra is another exciting project  In October 2012  Aurcana announced a new resource there  which brought the silver resource from 4 9 Moz to more than 115 Moz  Aurcana s P E is relatively high  at about 39  It is a smaller silver producer but it is profitable  which means a lot  Its forward P E is estimated at 5 3  which is very low and makes it very attractive  The forward P E reflects the higher production levels and  therefore  profitability  TGR  Aurcana has four institutional analysts covering it  Does institutional coverage on a small company reassure you  PK  Institutional ownership is more important  Ownership means more than just giving an opinion  Institutional investors tend to take a longer view  TGR  Both Shafter and La Negra are past producing assets  Aurcana has nothing in the pipeline beyond those two  although both are producing fairly strong cash flow  What does Aurcana plan to do with that cash flow  PK  The plan is to plow it back into drilling off and expanding the resource and increasing production capacity  Aurcana wants to mill and crush more of the ore it gets out of the ground  At La Negra  the company wants to prove up higher levels of its 115 Moz silver  Shafter is a similar story  In the first phase  production at Shafter will be around 3 8 Moz with 1 500 tons per day  1 500 tpd   The second phase will achieve 2 500 tpd  That could actually increase the Shafter production to approximately 6 3 Moz silver annually  That is close to 70 80  growth from the initial production targets  If Shafter reaches its phase 2 targets  it will be the third largest primary silver mine in North America  TGR  You recently wrote about the coming global shortage of palladium and the likely rise in the palladium price  Investors have heard similar refrains from experts relative to rare earth elements  lithium and even some base metals  Those commodities have witnessed only what one might call sporadic price gains  Are you  crying wolf  when it comes to palladium  PK  The fundamentals for palladium s supply demand profile are very solid  On the demand side  two thirds end up in vehicles  mostly for catalytic converters  Car sales are growing very quickly  In 2011  77M vehicles were sold worldwide  in 2012  81M  This year  the forecast is to reach 85M and the 2018 estimate is 104M  A lot of that growth will happen in China  which also has a serious pollution problem  China has been increasing its emission standards as its air becomes relatively unbreathable  On the supply side  Russia accounts for 44  of palladium production  South Africa for 38   South Africa has serious labor disruptions  In August 2012  miners at Lonmin Plc s  LMI LSE  Marikana mine went on strike  Clashes between strikers and the police resulted in 46 deaths  Protests and strikes have multiplied since then  In January  Anglo American Plc  AAUK NASDAQ  decided to close and sell off several of its platinum mines  Labor problems and production costs have just become overbearing  The mines are not profitable anymore  That does not help supply  Ore grades from Russia have been falling quickly  Output from Norilsk  the world s largest palladium producer  is declining  Russia also sells palladium into the physical market from Gokhran  its state repository  In 2010  as much as 1 Moz of the physical palladium representing 15  of the global supply came from Gokhran  In 2011  that dropped to 775 Koz and last year to 250 Koz  This year  Johnson Matthey forecast Gokhran will supply only 150 Koz  In four years  supply from Gokhran will have dropped from 15  of the global supply to only 2   Some insiders say there will be no supply from Gokhran in 2014  TGR  Are resource equities the best way to play palladium  PK  They are  Palladium s demand outlook is solid  and Russia and South Africa source of 80  of the supply will have a difficult time keeping up with demand  As a result  palladium prices will continue climbing  That will attract investors to things like palladium ETFs  As those ETFs use the metal as backing  it will drive up physical demand further  The equities provide leverage to the palladium price  If companies can mine palladium at a relatively low cost  they can generate healthy profit margins  That is how investors should play this trend  TGR  There are few platinum group metals  PGM  plays out there  Can you give us one or two names  PK  I like Colossus Minerals Inc   CSI TSX  COLUF OTCQX   a developing precious metals miner  Its flagship project  Serra Pelada in Brazil  is fully permitted and has environmental  installation and mining licenses going back to 2010  The mine is under construction  with first production planned for early H2 13  It has done all kinds of metallurgical testing and expects very good recoveries  The company has come across some extremely high grade intercepts for gold  platinum and palladium  Some of the high grade intercepts have been 4 600 grams per ton  4 600 g t  gold over admittedly short intercepts  about 2 2 5 meter  2 2 5m  sections  1 600 g t platinum and 1 700 g t palladium  Its margins are likely to be extremely wide  so it should be a very profitable producer  Some of the grades at Serra Pelada are among the highest on record  The project has drilled 100 000m to date  and a lot of exploration upside remains  TGR  For a long time  a group of workers called the Cooperativa de Minera  o dos Garimpeiros de Serra Pelada  COOMIGASP  held a percentage of Serra Pelada  Does it still own a percentage  PK  Yes  that group still owns 25  of Serra Pelada  TGR  Is Colossus likely to try to buy them out  PK  I think that could be part of its long term plan  TGR  Is Colossus on target for production in H2 13  PK  Yes  It has a  75M contingency for construction and working capital  It sold some of its production in advance to Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V  and Sandstorm Metals   Energy Ltd   SND TSX V   but it has the right to repurchase half of those commitments  Platinum and palladium production will be relatively important  in addition to gold  This makes it an interesting way to play the PGM space  Investors can be part of a company that is very close to production and should have attractive profit margins  TGR  With its margins and its unusual gold PGM project  is this a takeover target  PK  Yes  Imminent producers inevitably become targets because they are irresistible in terms of adding to production and reserves  Colossus would be a trophy piece for a miner that wanted to own potentially large  high grade reserves in a good  relatively safe jurisdiction  TGR  Why have we not seen a pure PGM royalty play  PK  The market for a pure royalty play in PGMs is probably just too small for a given royalty company to focus solely on these metals  its growth opportunities would be limited  There are few PGM projects being developed  PGMs are found in places that are not the best or most attractive places to work  Outside of South Africa and Russia  there are relatively few viable locations  therefore  there are very few PGM projects coming onstream in the next two years  TGR  Large cap royalty plays in the precious metals space have had a pretty good run  Some are trading around 21 times projected 2013 cash flow  Is there still value there  PK  I think so  Some are trading at relatively high P Es  but there is opportunity  First  along with other precious metals equities  they have sold off to some extent  Second  and more important  they are being valued using gold prices that are probably too low  The average analyst thinks that gold will average somewhere around  1 500 oz by 2015  They may be right  but if you look at their projections since 2007  analysts have regularly underestimated the gold price by several hundred dollars  Inflation and money printing by central banks will not back down  Precious metals royalty companies will certainly come back quite strongly as gold continues to rise  TGR  What are a couple of your favorites in the royalty space  PK  Our portfolio has Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX   About 68  of its revenues come from gold  Of its large inventory of assets  39 are producing  28 are development stage and almost 140 are exploration  We also hold Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX   a smaller royalty company with an  870M market cap  It has been aggressive  and is growing quickly  It has very savvy  experienced management  including Nolan Watson from Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE   Sandstorm s recent purchase of a controlling interest in one of its competitors  Premier Royalty Inc   NSR TSX   grew its book quite quickly  It also closed a large deal with Entr e Gold Inc   EGI NYSE A   This is a great space  Royalty companies will continue to perform very well over the medium and long term  I definitely want to maintain exposure to precious metals royalties  TGR  Shares of Royal Gold were trading near  100 share last fall  and now it has fallen to below  70 share  It is rare to see a royalty company fall that far so quickly  What happened  PK  I believe delays by Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  on a large project that Royal Gold has a royalty in weighed on the stock  That does not concern me  We doubled our purchase price and took profits  We continue to hold Royal Gold as a free ride  On a technical basis  Royal Gold is trading below its 200 day moving average  That 200 day average tends to be a magnet that a stock gravitates back toward and sometimes moves considerably beyond  When it does so  it can be a time to take some profits and wait for it to become more of a value once again  TGR  Do you have some parting thoughts for us  PK  We are in a secular resource bull market that still has lots of legs and will last several more years  The imprudent behavior of central banks printing copious amounts of fiat money just makes serious inflation more of a threat to people s savings  Commodities tend to be a strong beneficiary of inflation  I think everyone needs some exposure to commodities  But there is the element of cyclicality for all resources  at any given point in time  it makes sense to be in certain resources or to play them certain ways over others  TGR  Peter  thank you for your time and your insights   is a former

11899,233414,RGLD,Cosmos Chiu Finds Mining Opportunities Around The World,opinion,Cosmos Chiu  a director and research analyst with CIBC in Toronto  focuses on midtier gold producers  but his coverage gives him a leg up on truly understanding royalty companies  assets  In this interview with The Gold Report  Chiu talks about how much longer royalty companies could continue to outperform the rest of the market  while also discussing companies he follows in some of his favorite jurisdictions  The Gold Report  Gold spiked to about  1 800 ounce  oz  after the latest round of quantitative easing was announced  It was at about  1 700 oz recently  What s responsible for gold s recent price weakness  Cosmos Chiu  If you look back  the month of October is usually the weakest month of the year  Because investors look at it as a seasonably weaker month  there s less demand  That has held true this year as well  TGR  Could gold finish the year higher than where it is now  CC  Different factors that could drive bullion higher in November and December  including the restocking of jewelry for the winter holidays in the West and in India  the rethinking of the role for gold following traditionally weaker markets in October  and continued bailout concerns for Spain and Greece  It has also been a favorable monsoon season in India as well  That should also help increase demand coming from the Indian population  TGR  Do you forecast strengthening investment demand  too  CC  Investment demand was lower for the first half  but there s been strong central bank buying  which certainly helps  Demand isn t just composed of exchange traded funds  TGR  What s your investment thesis for midtier producers predicated on higher gold prices  CC  They re in the industry of producing gold so higher gold prices don t hurt  Even though they re in production  they re small enough to have meaningful growth ahead  It s not that hard to grow a company by 20 30  during the next year if a company has a starting base of 200 000 oz  200 Koz   Some of the midtier companies benefit from dealing more with pure gold instead of base metal byproduct credits  base metal contracts and smelter contracts  There s sometimes less complexity in running these companies as well  I just got back from traveling to a road show in Europe I go about twice a year  Investors are still very bullish on the gold and silver prices  One key question that s been unanswered in North America and across the pond is why have equities underperformed the commodity and will that continue  Costs  more or less  are not stable they re not going down  but they re not increasing at the same rate they did before  Earlier  they were increasing at a faster rate than the increase in the gold price  There has been some margin deterioration  We don t have any concrete evidence that this has reversed  but we certainly have seen some of the input costs moderate a little  That s going to be a key driver for some share price catch up to the underlying commodity  Companies  multiples will start to move more consistently as investor confidence continues to come back  TGR  What about jurisdiction  CC  People always like to bring up political risk  But what is political risk  Is it higher taxes  The risk of expropriation  The risk of war  To understand political risk  investors have to understand all these different types of risks  And don t ever forget about permitting challenges and issues like that  Investors need to understand that there s a wider scope to political issues than what s highlighted in newspapers  TGR  What s the first thing you would tell an investor interested in African gold plays  CC  Africa is one of the fastest growing areas in the world  While mining in South Africa is well developed  a lot of opportunities are still currently available to investors in other parts of the continent  I quite like Burkina Faso  Ghana  Sierra Leone  They provide good value for investors  I d also say it s a mistake to lump together all countries in the entire region  There might be issues in Mali  for example  but that doesn t mean all the other countries are impacted  TGR  Which countries in West Africa are you most bullish on  CC  I look for stability in the government and exploration upside  The three that I like the most are Burkina Faso  C te d Ivoire and Ghana  I currently have an outperform rating on Perseus Mining Ltd   PRU TSX  PRU ASX   which is one of the best startups in the past year  Its operations at the Edikan mine in Ghana are running really well  It met its targets and has a second project  Sissingue  that s being built in C te d Ivoire  TGR  It s an interesting project  but at the same time it s not into full scale development because it s awaiting the government s decision on something called a super profits tax  What do you know about that  CC  The government is planning to impose a super profits tax on the gold industry  but in the end I believe the goal of any tax rate changes in C te d Ivoire will be to make it more comparable to other West African countries  The end result  I believe  will be more of a catch up to the norm rather than the government trying to take all the economics away from that project  For my modeling purposes  I ve already put in the higher tax assumptions and the project continues to be profitable with a very good return on investment  TGR  Is Perseus on target to meet its production estimates  CC  It is  It reaffirmed last week its targets once again for fiscal 2013  which is the year ending in June  Based on my numbers  I agree that it will meet those targets  TGR  How much gold is Sissingue going to produce per year  CC  It s going to be producing close to  100 Koz life of mine  on top of what it s producing at Edikan  My 12 to 18 month target price for Perseus is  4 share and it s currently around  2 60 share  TGR  SEMAFO Inc   SMF TSX  SMF OMX  recently made the transition from one  Benoit  to another  Benoit La Salle  the long time president and chief executive officer of the company  handed the reins to Benoit Desormeaux  Is that a positive change  CC  Benoit Desormeaux has brought something different to the table even though he s been with the company for quite a while now as the chief financial officer  His focus will continue to be generating value at Mana  He s only been at the job for a few months  but he has the desire to generate value for investors by developing Mana  Samira Hill and Kiniero  TGR  The cash costs from operations at SEMAFO were higher than expected in the second quarter  Is that something shareholders should get used to  CC  Cash costs have increased in the third quarter mostly due to mining lower grades  closer to 2 grams per ton  g t   when it had been mining 2 5 g t in previous quarters  It happens  Any deposit has lower grade portions and higher grade portions  I don t think it s a long term issue  Also  power isn t as abundant as it would be in Canada or Mexico  A lot of costs are dependent on fuel prices  There s a lot more power being generated by fuel  SEMAFO was definitely impacted by higher fuel prices early this year and last year  The reverse is also true  As fuel prices moderate  SEMAFO and similar companies will have more favorable cash costs  TGR  You have a 12 to 18 month target price of  6 share  Its shares are currently trading above  3  Where is that growth going to come from  CC  Mana is the flagship asset and I expect that to continue  It s had some exploration results from different areas within its mining concession  There should continue to be upside in terms of resources coming from Mana this year and into 2013  TGR  Where will the next wave of producers come from  What are some development stage projects in West Africa that you re keeping an eye on  CC  West Africa is the most favorable jurisdiction  There s a greenstone belt that goes through all these different countries  It s quite simple  The more greenstone belt  the more exploration potential for a country  Mali has been a historic producer of gold  but given the recent instability in the country  exploration and production have been more muted of late  One up and comer  although it doesn t hold as much of the greenstone belt  is Sierra Leone  It has several projects under development  Given the civil war that devastated the country more than 10 years ago  it is looking forward to and very supportive of foreign investment  TGR  Are there some other junior narratives that are compelling  CC  Pilot Gold Inc   PLG TSX   I covered Fronteer Gold  which was eventually acquired by Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  almost two years ago  Fronteer s management went on to create Pilot  The entire management team stayed intact  When you invest in junior exploration companies  you want to be investing with a good management team  I would say that Pilot has a very good management team  It has some pretty interesting assets in Turkey and Nevada  too  TGR  Pilot Gold has a preliminary economic assessment on Halilaga in Turkey that said it has a net present value of  474 million and a 20  internal rate of return  taking a little more than 2 5 years to pay that back at  1 200 oz gold and  2 90 pound copper  Are those numbers sufficient for development or does Pilot Gold need to make the economics even more robust to reach a production decision  CC  I was on site last year  The good thing about Halilaga is that there continues to be upside potential  We don t have to sit back and say   This is all we have and is this good enough   It has more potential than what is being shown today  That certainly makes it more attractive as a development decision  It also has a joint venture partnership with a very strong company  Teck Resources Ltd   TCK NYSE  TCK A TSX   that would help to fund some of the development needs  TGR  Does Newmont still own a piece of that as well  CC  It does  Newmont subscribed to the latest round of financing that Pilot Gold had  It topped off and made sure that its percentage stayed the same  TGR  How would you compare Turkey to West Africa in terms of gold exploration potential  CC  They are very different  I was actually in Turkey two weeks ago on a mine tour  The mineralization is different in Turkey because there is a larger silver component  The mining is somewhat different in that there is more heap leaching  The infrastructure is better  However  gold mining is not yet a huge component of Turkey s economy  There s a culture behind gold production  of course  given the history of the country  That said  at this time  it s not as well developed yet as Canada  Australia or other jurisdictions with a longer  modern mining history  TGR  Royalty companies have been the sector s star performers over the last few years  How do you decide which royalty companies to cover  CC  To analyze royalty companies well  you need to understand the underlying contracts and the underlying mines  We have an advantage because we cover most of these underlying mines that actually pay a royalty to companies like Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  FNV NYSE   Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  RGL TSX  and Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE   At this time  I have Sector Outperformer ratings on Franco Nevada and Silver Wheaton  You need to look at the composition of these royalty streams  Where are they coming from  Is gold a byproduct of these streams  are the economics driven by gold or is it driven by silver or some other precious metals  How big of a component is each stream of the total net asset value  NAV   You never want a single stream to dominate the NAV of a royalty company because part of the royalty attraction is the diversification of risk  I always say they re one of the easier types of companies to cover they tend to meet my earnings and cash flow targets quarter over quarter  TGR  Do you expect royalty companies to perform as well over the next three years as they did over the last three years  CC  It s certainly been a good environment for royalty acquisitions  We ve seen all three do accretive deals within the last two months  For example  Silver Wheaton did a deal with HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM TSX  HBM NYSE   Franco Nevada purchased a royalty from Inmet Mining Corp   IMN TSX  and Royal Gold topped up its royalty at the Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc  s  TCM TSX  TC NYSE  Mt  Milligan project  The favorable conditions for royalty acquisitions should continue for the next two to three years  TGR  What are some of the favorable royalty contracts that Royal Gold has with producers  CC  The royalty that served as the first cornerstone for Royal Gold was the Cortez contract in Nevada  The asset  operated by Barrick  paid Royal Gold quite handsomely for a long time  up until about two years ago when it switched to mining Cortez Hills  The Cortez royalty created a very important cash flow generator for Royal Gold for a long time so it could leverage cash flow into purchasing other interests  Looking ahead  some of the bigger ones that Royal Gold has would be Pe asquito  which is a key Mexican mine for Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE   and the Andacollo  a key mine for Teck  which is looking into further expansions  TGR  When is Pe asquito slated to go into production  CC  It s already in production  It s a staged approach to development  but it s already been in production for quite a while now  It has a mine life of more than 20 years  The royalty company doesn t have to pay anything  so an expansion is the best thing that can happen to it  There s more gold upfront  more production and more payment to the royalty  but there s no additional capital expenditures needed  TGR  Will royalty companies pay larger dividends  CC  It s a double edged sword  They want to return investment to investors  but  at the same time  why would they if they have opportunities out there where they can continue to generate positive alpha for the company itself  We ve seen over and over again how these royalty acquisitions have increased the NAV of the company  I believe companies will keep it at a certain point  say more than a 1  yield  to make sure that there is some return to investors  but they will want to make sure that they also are able to capitalize on opportunities  TGR  There aren t a lot of royalty companies  but do you see further consolidation among them  CC  I wouldn t be surprised  I ve covered them for a long time  I ve seen International Royalty Corp  get taken out by Royal Gold and Gold Wheaton taken out by Franco Nevada  It s much easier for a larger royalty company some of these companies have been around for a long time and it takes a long time to build up a good portfolio  The diversification benefits are not as clear for some of the smaller companies  I wouldn t be surprised if there s more consolidation knowing that it s actually quite a small space in the end  Royalty company financing has become more mainstream  Many of these mining companies are looking at it from the perspective that they want to have a royalty financing component as part of a more integrated financing package  They want to do some type of equity financing  a portion debt financing  a portion project financing and also a portion of the royalty financing  TGR  What are some investable themes that our readers should watch for in the precious metals space throughout the remainder of this year and into 2013  CC  I ve been telling clients to look for the companies that will deliver on their promises  Look for companies that have the ability to capitalize on some of this cost abatement that we might see in some parts of the industry  From my perspective  I favor companies that are more pure gold than the ones with a significant base metals component  TGR  I ve appreciated speaking with you today  Thanks  Cosmos   director  Precious Metals Equity Research  CIBC World

11974,233489,RGLD,Some Miners Now Signaling We re In A Gold Bull Market,opinion,"Over the past 6 months gold has made two important lows  a December 2013 low and a June 2014 low   The June 2014 low was a fake breakdown turned fast move higher   This is very important  since every rally in gold has failed for the past couple of years during this bear market   Now we finally have a breakdown in gold that failed  a bullish omen   But a hidden piece of information that is just as bullish as this failed breakdown is how certain mining stocks are behaving 
Mining stocks come in all different shapes and sizes but one factor that binds them together is the price of gold   Mining is a tough business  and even the best mining companies in the world can t function well with a low gold price relative to their cost of production   So when the gold price is in a downtrend all mining stocks tend to get punished and sometimes severely punished   But one thing to remember is markets are always forward looking   So we should expect that if gold were to finally stop its downtrend  the market would start to reward the  better  mining stocks with higher prices 
This is actually exactly what we are seeing in certain mining stocks right now   We now know that gold made a major bottom in December 2013  because we can look at it in the rear view mirror on a chart   So once gold made that low  pressure started lifting on the stronger mining stocks   But gold made a secondary low in June 2014 that exerted additional pressure on the mining stocks   This actually pushed many weaker mining stocks to even a further new low   But the stronger stocks rejected this secondary bottom in gold  and either traded sideways or continued higher 
Let s take a look at some examples   The first example is Stillwater Mining  NYSE SWC   a platinum and palladium producer   Stillwater is more tied to platinum and palladium than gold or silver  but since they are all precious metals which are very strongly correlated it s a valid example   Once precious metals made that important December 2013 bottom  the pressure on SWC drastically reduced and it immediately launched into a new  uptrend   This is very bullish action   It s even more bullish the way Stillwater rejected the pullback in precious metals from March to June 2014   Stillwater remained in a strong Stage 2 advance during this pullback and took barely any technical damage 

Taho Resources  NYSE TAHO  is a new silver mining company   TAHO broke out into a Stage 2 advance in early 2014 as gold made its bottom  Then when gold had the pullback this year  TAHO just traded sideways above the 30 week moving average   It didn t give up much ground at all and continued to outperform gold as well   And once the June breakdown in gold failed  TAHO started breaking out to the upside again 

Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD  is a royalty company in the mining space   RGLD had very similar technical action to TAHO   A breakout in early 2014  then a pullback with the gold pullback into June 2014   Then  as the pressure from gold was lifted in June when gold bottomed  RGLD once again broke out to the upside 

These aren t the only mining stocks exhibiting this behavior   Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV  and Primero Mining Corp  NYSE PPP  are two more examples   The point is though that these mining stocks are now 6 months into a new bull market   They clearly could be sending a signal that the gold market is a lot stronger than most people think   If this is the  turn  in the gold sector  then it s not a surprise to see some leadership in mining stocks take hold as the entire sector gradually turns back to the upside ",2014-06-26,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/some-miners-now-signaling-we’re-in-a-gold-bull-market-217441,217441
11999,233514,RGLD,Sprott Gold  A New Approach For Gold Investors,opinion,"The new Sprott Gold Miners ETF  NYSE  SGDM  was launched in July  SGDM focuses on major mining and streaming companies and offers investors an innovative new way to gain exposure to gold equities 
The Sprott ETF provides all the aspects of traditional ETFs that investors like   a low management fee  0 57    passive management  exposure to a diversified basket of stocks  and full disclosure of holdings on a daily basis   with an alternative indexing methodology for selecting the holdings of the portfolio 
John Ciampaglia  who led the development of the ETF at Sprott Asset Management LP  said SGDM tracks the Sprott Zacks Gold Miners Index  the first index to use qualitative company factors to select and weight gold stocks  He said 
 Traditional gold miner indexes select their holdings in a very simple way  stocks are  market cap weighted   which means the biggest companies in the sector are also the largest holdings in their portfolio  
 In the mining sector  having the majority of your exposure allocated to the biggest mining companies can be dangerous  Bigger is not always better   says Rick Rule  Chairman of Sprott US Holdings   Currently  high debt loads  operational cost overruns  and lost revenues from projects that have been placed  on ice  are weighing on a lot of the biggest players in our sector  Some of the biggest companies in the mining sector have long histories of destroying shareholder value  To us  taking a more thoughtful approach to creating an index makes a great deal of sense  
The Sprott Zacks Gold Miners Index  which dictates the holdings of SGDM  places emphasis on gold stocks that display the best revenue growth and balance sheet strength  The Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis to ensure that the latest company results are reflected in the composition and weighting of the Index 
So what are the top holdings in SGDM right now 
Royalty and streaming companies currently make up a large share of the portfolio  These companies buy up future revenue streams from mining companies or juniors  but don t bear the operational expenses themselves  This gives them substantial upside to the price of gold  and their generally low debt levels makes them financially stronger and less vulnerable to sector downturns 
The 2nd largest holding right now is Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   at 15 8   the largest royalty and streaming company in the world  founded by Pierre Lassonde  Royal Gold Inc  NASDAQ RGLD   4 5  holding  and Silver Wheaton Corp  NYSE SLW   3 0  holding   two other big streaming companies  are also represented because of their strong relative revenue growth and lower debt ratios 
SGDM does hold a number of traditional mining companies but  because of their high debt ratios and lack of revenue growth in recent quarters  some of the biggest gold miners in terms of market cap currently make up a relatively small percentage of the portfolio  Among traditional gold miners  Randgold Resources  is currently the top holding  15 9    Its gold production for the second quarter of 2014 was 277 283 ounces  which was an increase of 41  over the same period last year  
 We believe we have constructed an ETF that is well suited to investors looking for an alternative to existing market cap weighted gold miners ETFs   said Rick   Sprott has a long and successful history of investing in gold equities and we are happy to provide our clients with a new way to participate in the ongoing recovery in the sector ",2014-09-04,Commodity Trade Mantra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sprott-gold:-a-new-approach-for-gold-investors-224786,224786
12077,233592,RGLD,The Dark Side Of Streaming Deal,opinion,"In September  Robert Quartermain did something highly unusual for a mining executive   he signed a streaming deal with an early exit strategy 
Miners have raised US 4 2 billion from 11 stream sales in 2015  alarming some observers who worry that miners are giving away vast amounts of future   
In September  Robert Quartermain did something highly unusual for a mining executive   he signed a streaming deal with an early exit strategy 

Overwhelmed by the sheer volume of opportunities available in volatile commodity markets  precious metal  streaming  companies are looking to team up to take on large acquisitions that they might not be able to readily afford on their own 

Quartermain  the CEO of Vancouver based Pretium Resources Inc   was alarmed at how much value miners are giving away in gold and silver stream sales  in which future output is sold at below market prices in exchange for an instant cash infusion 
So when he sold a US 150 million stream on Pretium s Brucejack project in British Columbia  he insisted that the deal include buyback options for Pretium in 2018 and 2019  and that it cap the number of gold and silver ounces that can be sold 
 When you start putting in higher levels of streaming  and the stream lasts forever  then the potential upside starts going to streaming holders and  away from  your existing shareholders   Quartermain said in an interview 
This will go down as the biggest year ever for metal streaming deals  and it s not even close  Miners have raised US 4 2 billion from 11 stream sales in 2015  according to Financial Post data  That is nearly double the US 2 2 billion raised in 2013  which is the second biggest year on record 
For the most part  mining analysts and investors have cheered these deals  But their sheer number has caused alarm for some observers  who worry that miners are giving away vast amounts of future upside once metal prices improve 
The metal streaming business was created back in 2004  In these transactions  a streaming company like Silver Wheaton Corp  gives a mining company an upfront cash payment  In return  it gets the right to buy a fixed amount of precious metals production from the miner at a fixed price that is far below the market price  The streamer can then sell the metal for a profit  The biggest players in this business are Silver Wheaton Corp  N SLW   Franco Nevada Corporation  N FNV  and Royal Gold Inc  O RGLD  
This past year was one of the worst ever for large mining companies  which suffered because of falling commodity prices and high leverage  They needed cash badly  and the streaming companies were more than happy to provide it  Mining giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation  N ABX   Glencore  L GLEN   Teck Resources Ltd  N TCK  and VALE SA  N VALE  all sold streams in 2015 
On the surface  these deals made a lot of sense for mining companies  Their stock prices are so depressed that they do not want to even think about issuing equity  And the last thing this sector needs is to take on more debt  So they sold future metal production instead 
 When companies are between a rock and a hard place  they often sell what s good because they can t sell what s bad   said John Tumazos  an independent analyst 
The problem is that streams destroy much of the future  option value  for mining companies  Since the streaming metal is typically sold at fixed prices far below the market price  the streamers get all the benefit when market prices go up 
To take an extreme example  Silver Wheaton was buying silver from some mining companies at less than US 4 a pound in 2011  when silver prices rose to almost US 50  It was a massive transfer of wealth from mining companies to a streaming company 
Another concern is that streams can eliminate the exploration upside from a mine  If a miner has agreed to sell a fixed percentage of gold or silver production from a mine to a streamer  it will have to sell more metal if it makes a new discovery on the property and boosts production 

When companies are between a rock and a hard place  they often sell what s good because they can t sell what s bad

John Ing  president and gold analyst at Maison Placements Canada  said streaming is reminiscent of hedging  in which metal is sold in fixed price contracts  Hedging was all the rage in the gold industry in the 1990s  when prices were low  But it became a massive liability once prices rose far above the value in the contracts  Barrick had to spend more than  5 billion to unwind its hedge book in 2009 
Eventually  hedging became a toxic word in the industry  It is almost nonexistent today 
 It wasn t until the price of gold went up that everybody realized what Barrick was leaving on the table   Ing said 
 The same thing is going to happen  to streaming  when the price of gold goes up again  Not until then will people focus on the dark side of the streams  
For investors that don t like streaming  the good news is that miners are starting to preserve more upside for themselves in these transactions 
For example  Barrick struck a US 610 million stream sale with Royal Gold last August that guarantees higher sale prices down the road  For the first 550 000 gold ounces and 23 1 million silver ounces that Barrick delivers to Royal Gold  it receives 30 per cent of the prevailing spot prices  For every ounce after that  it receives 60 per cent of the spot prices  So if silver prices go up  Barrick stands to benefit 
Handout Pretium Resources Inc Pretium s Brucejack project in British Columbia 
Pretium Resources Inc   N PVG  went even further by negotiating optional buybacks of its stream and capping the total amount of gold and silver to be sold  If Pretium discovers more metal at the Brucejack project  it won t go into the stream 
Traditional streaming companies like Silver Wheaton and Royal Gold are looking to buy streams that will last for decades  so Pretium s deal is not for them  Instead  Pretium sold the stream to two private equity firms  Orion Resource Partners and Blackstone  N BX  Group 
These companies are just looking for a good return and are not bothered by the idea of having their stream re purchased in a few years  That is a relatively new concept in streaming  and it could be a game changer if more private equity firms and other players decide to compete with traditional streamers 
Quartermain said his deal is proof that miners have alternatives to conventional streaming  He hopes other companies will follow Pretium s lead and try to maintain some upside in these deals 
 We ve shown you can  even in challenging markets  finance good projects and achieve that upside for shareholders   he said

12085,233600,RGLD,Gold Mining Stocks Now Breaking Down,opinion,"The Gold BUGS Index  HUI  dropped sharply on Monday 11th January  but managed to hold above its 50 day and 20 day moving averages by the barest of margins  It therefore hasn t yet fallen by enough to signal an end to the rebound that began on 17th November 

However  while the HUI is hanging on by the skin of its teeth  several high profile gold mining stocks have already broken out to the downside  For example 
1  Despite offering excellent value  Kinross Gold Corporation  N KGC  clearly broke below support on Monday and appears to be heading for a test of its September low 

2  B2Gold  N BTG  broke out to the downside last Friday and extended its decline yesterday  It does not yet offer great value and the recent downside breakout projects significant additional weakness prior to a sustained bottom  but it sure looks  oversold  

3  Royal Gold  O RGLD   one of the world s lowest risk and highest quality gold stocks  made a new bear market low yesterday  The price action suggests that the stock is on its way to  30  but the risk reward is very attractive at  35 or lower 

4  Newmont Mining  N NEM  plunged below the bottom of a 3 month price channel on Monday and appears to be heading for a test of its September low 

With the USD gold price having broken above resistance at  1088 last week  and having held above its breakout level during the pullback of the past two trading days  why has the gold mining sector been so weak 
I think it s mainly because of what s happened to non gold mining stocks  As illustrated below  the Diversified Metals and Mining Index  SPTMN  has fallen by about 20  over the past 5 trading days and plunged to a new bear market low on Monday 11th January  The gold mining sector is certainly capable of bucking a general downward trend in mining stocks  but it would take a lot of strength in the gold price to offset the downward pull caused by the sort of general mining collapse seen over the past few days ",2016-01-12,Steve Saville,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-mining-stocks-breaking-down-379594,379594
12086,233601,RGLD,Huge Miner Bankruptcies Possible Soon,opinion,"The commodities bust may be about to claim some brand name victims 


Freeport McMoRan  N FCX  is off to a brutal start in 2016 with its stock price down nearly 40  in just over a week  The company is being battered by a barrage of negative news items  with the latest being another analyst downgrade  The rough start  which follows a very tough 2015  has a lot of investors wondering if the company will make it through the year in one piece 
The weakness in the copper price has been the biggest weight on Freeport McMoRan s stock this year  Its price recently hit a six year low due to growing concerns of a worsening slowdown in China  which is the world s biggest copper market  With copper falling below  2 per pound it calls into question Freeport McMoRan s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to both manage its debt and fund its capex plan  It s a plan that is based on a  2 copper price in 2016 and  45 per barrel for oil  Presently  copper is a few pennies below that level  while oil has plunged into the low  30s 
Those price weaknesses not only will weigh on the company s cash flow  but are weighing on the value of oil and copper assets  That s making it even less attractive for Freeport McMoRan to pursue asset sales to pay down its large debt load  In fact  asset values have fallen so steeply that one Jefferies analyst is concerned that  window of opportunity for Freeport McMoRan to repair its balance sheet may have closed   That s after the company has yet to find a funding solution for its oil and gas business after searching for alternatives for more than a year 

 Bloomberg    The cost of insuring Glencore  L GLEN  Plc s debt against default rose to a more than six year high as the price of raw materials such as copper continued to tumble 
The trader and miner s credit default swaps increased to as much as 946 basis points  the highest since April 2009 on a closing basis  according to data from S P Capital IQ s CMA 
Slumping commodity prices have battered Glencore  prompting it to scrap a dividend payment  sell new shares and outline asset sales as it seeks to curb debt to maintain its investment grade rating  Copper dropped to a six year low amid a rout in metals as muted Chinese inflation increased concern that demand from the world s largest buyer of raw materials will slow 
 CDS levels are driven by commodity prices and in the case of Glencore  especially copper   said Max Mihm  a Frankfurt based portfolio manager at Union Investment  which holds Glencore bonds among assets totaling about  271 billion   If prices fall further and stay low Glencore will need to do more to protect its IG ratings  

A lot of big  diversified miners produce silver and gold as byproducts  so if  say  a copper mine closes because of that metal s recent price collapse  that also takes precious metals out of the production stream and other things being equal raises their price  So far so good for gold bugs 
But fans of gold and silver streaming companies  including this writer  are watching the carnage in copper and oil with mixed emotions  Many of the miners now teetering on the edge of insolvency have cut deals in which they promise to sell their byproduct gold and silver to streaming companies in return for big up front payments  That money may now be at risk 
Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   the biggest streaming company  recently paid Canadian miner  N TCK  610 million for a future share of the silver produced by the latter s Peruvian mine  The number two streaming company  Silver Wheaton  N SLW   has paid  and   N VALE  over  1 billion for portions of the gold and silver produced by some of their mines 
What happens if some of these miners subsequently go bankrupt  That s not clear  but it can t be good for the streaming companies whose cash will be tied up  at best  and might simply disappear 
Meanwhile  the never ending precious metals bear market is producing a steady drumbeat of smaller gold and silver mining failures  some of which are streaming company partners  Most recently    N RBY  fell to effectively zero after announcing that oops  its reserves were only one tenth of what it had previously promised  Streaming company Royal Gold  O RGLD  is on the hook for  75 million to this one 
Looking on the bright side  the streaming companies are highly diversified  with dozens of deals spread around the world  So the failure of any one   even a big one   probably isn t an existential threat  It is  however  a near term problem for buyers of these stocks  But also possibly a long term opportunity if the streaming companies get swept down in the general carnage ",2016-01-14,John Rubino,https://www.investing.com/analysis/huge-miner-bankruptcies-possible-soon;-great-news-for-gold-and-silver-380033,380033

12088,233603,RGLD,Gold Royalty Companies Continue To Progress,opinion,"The large gold royalty companies remain among our top holdings  notwithstanding the high valuations and our comments on the overall gold market and short term concern on the gold stocks 
Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd   TO OR   12 90  is all cashed up  as its two core royalties proceed well  It has about CA 650 million available for investments  of which CA 260 million is cash   after spending about CA 220 million in the last year on several royalties 
In addition to the cash and credit  Osisko now has 53 royalties  Its two core royalties are performing well  Canadian Malarctic offers a high 5  royalty on one of Canada s premier mines  with a long life  low cost profile  and continues to meet guidance  The new  l onore  another long life  low cost mine  is overcoming ramp up hurdles as the advance royalty is now fully paid 
Cashed up and ready to pounce  With the cash  Osisko is on the hunt for new assets  preferably a large  cash flowing asset  With its strong core assets  growing royalty investments  innovative royalty growth model  and strong balance sheet  Osisko remains a strong holding  As a newer company with less diversified revenue sources  the stock is trading at a discount to the group  1 2 times book versus over 3 for Franco   and the stock has underperformed the last six months  At the current depressed price the stock is down from over  13 50 three days ago Osisko is a buy 
An unusual loss and impairment for Franco  Franco Nevada Corp   TO FNV  NYSE FNV   60 82  continues to perform well  meeting guidance for last year  despite lower commodity prices generally  It saw an unusual loss for the quarter  because of impairments  both on oil and gas assets and also  unusually  on a mineral property  Rubicon s Phoenix mine  
Last quarter  Franco drew down on its line of credit  adding debt for the first time ever  This was to acquire the Antapaccay stream from Glencore  LON GLEN   By year end  it had paid half of the  460 million it drew  and  following a financing   intends to repay it all  by the end of this month  becoming debt free again  Currently  Franco has  1 2 billion available credit for new deals  so is certainly in a strong position to acquire more royalties or streams  As can be seen from recent transactions involving not only Franco but also Osisko  Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD   and Silver Wheaton Corp   TO SLW  NYSE SLW   there is potential for more streams from the base metal producers who continue to struggle with low prices and high debt levels 
Strong growth just from existing assets  The year ahead promises growth from existing assets  including a full year from Antamina as well as the start of revenue from Antapaccay  and a smaller royalty  Karma   There is substantial growth over the next five years even without adding another asset  Despite high valuations  Franco remains a core holding  for the top management  rock solid balance sheet  broad diversity of assets and strong political profile  and the ability to grow into its valuations  Given that we already hold Franco  we will wait for any correction to add to positions 
Royal Gold Inc   RGLD NASDAQ  TO RGL   49 50  has seen its stock double from the depressed levels of mid January  There is nothing to report now  but would hold  and await a pullback before buying more  It remains good value  but is due for a pause

12089,233604,RGLD,Silver Wheaton  The Ultimate Streaming Service,opinion," There s a healthy appetite for streams right now   That s according to Randy Smallwood  CEO of Silver Wheaton  NYSE SLW   who stopped by our office last week during his cross country meet and greet with investors 
Randy should know about the appetite for streams  His company had a phenomenal 2015  the best year we ever had   he says highlighted by two successful stream acquisitions  strong production and fully funded growth  Silver Wheaton stock is up more than 51 percent for the year  And the company just received the  presented by the Prospectors   Developers Association of Canada  PDAC   for  demonstrating leadership in management and financing for the exploration and development of mineral resources  
We were one of Silver Wheaton s seed investors in 2004  In the summer of that year  the company was spun off from Wheaton River  a producer that took its name from a stream in the Yukon where one of its mines  the Luismin property  produced silver  It was founded by Ian Telfer  chairman and CEO of Wheaton River  and the company s then chief financial officer  Peter Barnes  who later headed up Silver Wheaton management  My friend  the mining financier and philanthropist Frank Giustra  also had a hand in its conception 
As the only pure silver mining company  Silver Wheaton couldn t have been founded during a more opportune time  The commodities boom was still young  I remember that when the idea for the company was shared with me  what I found most attractive was that it had virtually no competition    NYSE FNV  which had been acquired by Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  in 2001  wouldn t be spun off for three more years  It was a no brainer to put capital in this new endeavor 
Wheaton River was eventually bought by Goldcorp  NYSE GG   and today  Silver Wheaton is the world s largest precious metals streaming company  with a market cap of over  9 billion 
But Wait  What s a  Stream  
A  stream   in case you were wondering  is an agreed upon amount of gold  silver or other precious metal that a mining company is contractually obligated to deliver to Silver Wheaton in exchange for upfront cash   The company s preferred metal is silver because  as Randy puts it  it s a smaller market and has a higher beta than gold   The payment generally comes with less onerous terms than traditional financing  which is why miners favor working with Silver Wheaton  or one of the other royalty companies such as Franco Nevada  Royal Gold  NASDAQ RGLD  and Sandstorm Gold Ltd N  NYSE SAND   

Streaming allows producers to  take the value of a non core asset and crystallize that into capital they can invest into their core franchise   Randy  prepared for the PDAC awards  With operating costs mounting and metals still at relatively low albeit rising prices  royalty and streaming companies have become an essential source of financing for junior and undercapitalized miners  Between 2009 and 2014  operating and capital costs per ounce of gold rose 50 percent  from  606 to  915 per ounce  according to Dundee Capital 
Gold and Silver at 15 Month Highs
Paradigm Capital estimates that between 80 and 90 percent of global miners  operating costs are covered when gold reaches  1 250 an ounce  The metal is now at this level it s currently at  1 298  up 22 percent so far this year but as recently as December  prices were floundering at  1 050  which cut deeply into producers  margins 
Royalty and streaming companies  on the other hand  get by with a materially lower cost of  440 an ounce 
From only 11 stream sales in 2015  miners collectively raised  which is double the amount they raised in 2013 
These partnerships are a win win  The miner gets reliable  hassle free funding to cover part of its exploration and production costs  and the streaming company gets all or part of the output at a fixed  lower than market price  A 2004 streaming arrangement made with Primero  NYSE PPP  on the San Dimas mine in Mexico entitles Silver Wheaton to buy all of its silver for an average price of  4 35 an ounce  With spot prices now at more than  17 89 an ounce  up 29 percent year to date  the San Dimas property is one of Silver Wheaton s more lucrative assets   The mine represents an estimated 15 percent of Silver Wheaton s entire operating value  according to RBC Capital Markets  
As part of its contracts  Silver Wheaton gets the added value of optionality on any future discoveries  This is important  since an estimated 70 percent of all silver comes as a byproduct of other mining activity  including gold  zinc  lead and copper  According to Randy  all of Silver Wheaton s silver is byproduct 

Huge Rewards  Minimal Risk
Investors find royalty companies such as Silver Wheaton attractive for a number of reasons  not least of which is that they have exposure to commodity prices but face few of the risks associated with operating a mine 
They have minimal overhead and carry little to no debt  Franco Nevada  in fact  added debt for the first time ever last year to buy a stream from Glencore  OTC GLNCY   By year end  the company had already paid down half this debt  and it plans to tackle the rest this quarter 
Royalty companies also hold a more diversified portfolio of mines and other assets than producers  since acquiring new streams doesn t require any additional overhead  This helps mitigate concentration risk in the event that one of the properties stops producing for one reason or another 

Consequently  margins have historically been huge  Even when the price of gold and gold mining stocks declined in the years following 2011  Franco Nevada continued to rise because it had the ability to raise capital at a much lower cost than miners  And with precious metals now surging  royalty companies are highly favored  with Paradigm Capital recommending Franco Nevada  which has  exercised the most buying discipline among the royalty companies   and the small cap  highly diversified Sandstorm 
With only around 30 employees  Silver Wheaton has one of the highest sales per employee rates in the world  According to FactSet data  the company generates over  23 million per employee per year  Compare that to a large senior producer like Newmont  which generates  only   200 000 per employee 
 Royalty companies can often minimize political risk because they don t normally deal directly with the governments of countries their partners are operating in  This is especially valuable when working with miners that operate in restrictive tax jurisdictions and under governments with high levels of corruption  Silver Wheaton s contract with Brazilian miner Vale  NYSE VALE   for instance  stipulates that Vale is solely responsible for paying taxes in Brazil  which are among the highest in Latin America 
Vancouver based Silver Wheaton pays only Canadian taxes 
Political risk is still a thorny issue  however  When government corruption is too pervasive  or the red tape too tortuous  the miner s corporate guarantee is obviously threatened  In cases such as this  Silver Wheaton can simply elect not to work with the producer  as it had to do recently with an African producer 
A key risk right now is Silver Wheaton s ongoing legal feud with the Canadian Revenue Agency  CRA   regarding international transactions between 2005 and 2010  Randy says the company might finally be nearing a resolution to the dispute 
 We do have resource risk  We do have mining production risk   he says   But with that risk comes rewards  and I think if we re selective in terms of our investments  the rewards far outweigh the risks  I think we ve been really successful making sure we invest in good quality  high margin mines  We really put a strong focus on mines that are very profitable

32959,254474,RGLD,Coronavirus Outbreak Gives Gold A Boost  5 Top Picks,opinion,The outbreak of coronavirus in China  which resulted in investors  concern over the recovery of global economic growth and left an impact on stock markets  boosted demand for safe haven assets  The demand for precious metal gold  considered as a major investment option under market turmoil  also got a boost On Jan 23  future price of gold for February delivery surged  8 70 or 0 6   to settle at  1 565 40 an ounce on Comex  That was the highest most active contract settlement since Jan 7  Notably  gold price soared to a near seven year peak of  1 610 90 per ounce on Jan 8  following the escalation in U S  Iran geopolitical conflict  After that  the price of this precious metal stayed above  1 550 Coronavirus May Affect Global GrowthThe Chinese authority has already confirmed that as many as 26 people have died due to coronavirus and the total number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 830  Additionally  the United States  Japan and South Korea  all reported confirmed cases of coronavirus following visits to China Coronavirus is the major outbreak of a disease in China after the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002 and 2003 in which more than 8 000 were affected globally and 800 died  Economists estimated that the Chinese economy was impacted by roughly 0 8  due to the SARS outbreak Coronavirus has forced the government of China to lockdown 10 cities with a total population of over 33 million  Certainly  this measure will jeopardize normal economic activities of a large number of people  China is severely suffering from a nearly two year long tariff war with the United States  The recently signed interim trade deal was viewed as an opportunity to revive the sagging economy of the Asian giant Moreover  deterioration of the Chinese economy will significantly affect global export demand and therefore delay global economic recovery Other Drivers of Gold PriceSeveral major central banks  including the Fed are pursuing easy monetary policies  resulting in a lower interest rate  In fact  the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have adopted a zero interest rate policy for more than a year Negative interest rate is forcing investors to park their money in other avenues rather than bank deposits and debt securities  Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold cheaper for investors holding other assets Moreover  concerns over overvaluation equities in several large markets  chances of a no deal Brexit and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East  which may result in surging crude oil prices  could lead to market fluctuations Buying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil   Additionally  central banks are buying gold for rapid balance sheet expansion  resulting in a gold price rally Strong ProjectionsAccording to a report by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   the wealthy are stocking up on physical gold  as in bullion  coins and bars  The research firm raised its target price for gold to  1 600 per ounce in 2020 Heritage Capital projected gold price in the range of  2 500   3 000 an ounce in 2020  citing recessionary concerns and political uncertainty  Altavest estimated a rally in the  1

107262,328777,RGLD,Fed Holds Rates Steady  Here re The Big Winners ,opinion,The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate steady and shows no signs of raising rates in the near term  The Fed holds the fed funds rate in the range of 1 5 1 75   Fed Chair Jerome Powell has categorically said that the central bank is quite comfortable with its current monetary policy as it provides cushion against weak global economic growth  In fact  the Fed is more likely to trim rates going forward as the central bank continues to find it difficult to achieve the desired inflation target of 2  Needless to say  inflation remained below the Fed s target since 2012  except for 2018  Powell added that  we are not satisfied with inflation running below 2   particularly at a time such as now where we re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment  when in theory where inflation should be moving up  The Fed had trimmed interest rates three times last year following nine hikes in the previous three year period  Drop in business investments and of course consistently low inflation were the reasons for the rate cuts  At the same time  President Trump wanted the Fed to slash rates more aggressively  thanks to record low unemployment levels Rate Sensitive Stocks to GainThere are several sectors  including utilities and real estate  which do remarkably well in case of no rate hike  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet the requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Thus  low interest rates will help pay off debts and book profits However  higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Rate hikes are also a dampener for real estate activities  After all  higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for projects  which will significantly affect companies  predominantly involved in the construction business Banks Should RallyA decline or steady interest rates adversely impact net interest margins  Needless to say  a bank s profit margin depends on its net interest income or the difference between the rates they charge as long term loans and the rate they pay for short term borrowings But if we look into non interest income  banks continue to expand consumer lending businesses  Housing and car loans have increased considerably  thanks to lower interest rates  Lenders made  700 billion in mortgages in the third quarter of last year  thanks to customers  rush to refinance  especially due to low mortgage rates Gold Prices to RiseGold mining stocks also have a fair chance to gain  Thanks to the dovish expectations  gold prices are expected to rise  This is because lower interest rates tend to make bonds and other fixed income investments less attractive Money will flow out of bonds as they can t provide higher yields  and in turn may flow into gold Top 4 ChoicesWe have  thus  selected four solid stocks from the aforesaid sectors that are poised to gain from Fed keeping interest rates steady  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

107268,328783,RGLD,5 Stocks To Make The Most Of Coronavirus Scare ,opinion,China s National Health Commission confirmed that coronavirus cases in China have risen to 9 692 and the death toll in the mainland has touched 213  The figures astonishingly are higher than the number of severe respiratory syndrome  SARS  cases registered in 2003 The virus has spread beyond the Chinese boundary with reports of cases in Germany  Australia and United Arab Emirates  On Jan 30  the World Health Organization  WHO  declared a global health emergency  After the Emergency Committee meeting held in Geneva  Dr  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  WHO s director general said that there are 98 cases of coronavirus reported in 18 countries apart from China already This rising concern that coronavirus will impact the global economy is dampening investors  sentiment and has increased volatility in equity and bond markets Gold   A Safe Haven in Coronavirus CrisisThe volatility in the stock market induced by the coronavirus pandemic is pushing investors toward safe haven assets like gold Gold futures are trading near the highest close in more than six years and this has helped the miner s shares to gain traction  On Jan 30  gold futures soared as the spread of coronavirus propelled demand for safe haven investments  Gold for April delivery increase 0 8  or  13 20 to settle at  1 589 20 per ounce Coronavirus Outbreak Lowers Mortgage RateFears of the impact of coronavirus on the global economy have dampened the stock market and volatility has set in  The yield of the 10 year Treasury note has fallen over the past week  and mortgage rates typically follow its direction On Jan 30  Freddie Mac reported that the 30 year fixed rate mortgage averaged 3 51   lower by nine basis points from the prior week and is a percentage point lower now than it was a year ago  This had boosted mortgage applications and if coronavirus continues to spread at the current pace  it can push mortgage rates even lower Per the Weekly Mortgage Application survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association  demand for mortgages had increased 7 2  for the week ending Jan 24  Additionally  refinance applications rose 8  for the week ending Jan 24 and surged 146  from the same week last year 5 Stocks to BuyGiven the massive outbreak of coronavirus and the fact that scientists are yet to discover the source of the virus or a cure that could put an end to the outbreak  it is quite evident that the effects of the pandemic will surely dampen the stock market  This in turn will push investors toward the yellow

107279,328794,RGLD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  NorthWestern  TopBuild  Citigroup And Royal Gold,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 31  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NorthWestern Corp    NYSE NWE    TopBuild Corp    NYSE BLD    Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   and Royal Gold  Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Fed Holds Rates Steady  Here Are the Big WinnersThe Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate steady and shows no signs of raising rates in the near term  The Fed holds the fed funds rate in the range of 1 5 1 75   Fed Chair Jerome Powell has categorically said that the central bank is quite comfortable with its current monetary policy as it provides cushion against weak global economic growth  In fact  the Fed is more likely to trim rates going forward as the central bank continues to find it difficult to achieve the desired inflation target of 2  Needless to say  inflation remained below the Fed s target since 2012  except for 2018  Powell added that  we are not satisfied with inflation running below 2   particularly at a time such as now where we re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment  when in theory where inflation should be moving up  The Fed had trimmed interest rates three times last year following nine hikes in the previous three year period  Drop in business investments and of course consistently low inflation were the reasons for the rate cuts  At the same time  President Trump wanted the Fed to slash rates more aggressively  thanks to record low unemployment levels Rate Sensitive Stocks to GainThere are several sectors  including utilities and real estate  which do remarkably well in case of no rate hike  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet the requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Thus  low interest rates will help pay off debts and book profits However  higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Rate hikes are also a dampener for real estate activities  After all  higher interest rates will increase borrowing costs for projects  which will significantly affect companies  predominantly involved in the construction business Banks Should RallyA decline or steady interest rates adversely impact net interest margins  Needless to say  a bank s profit margin depends on its net interest income or the difference between the rates they charge as long term loans and the rate they pay for short term borrowings But if we look into non interest income  banks continue to expand consumer lending businesses  Housing and car loans have increased considerably  thanks to lower interest rates  Lenders made  700 billion in mortgages in the third quarter of last year  thanks to customers  rush to refinance  especially due to low mortgage rates Gold Prices to RiseGold mining stocks also have a fair chance to gain  Thanks to the dovish expectations  gold prices are expected to rise  This is because lower interest rates tend to make bonds and other fixed income investments less attractive Money will flow out of bonds as they can t provide higher yields  and in turn may flow into gold Top 4 ChoicesWe have  thus  selected four solid stocks from the aforesaid sectors that are poised to gain from Fed keeping interest rates steady  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  BHP Group plc   NYSE BBL    Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd    TSX OR    Pretium Resources Inc    TSX PVG    Royal Gold Inc    NASDAQ RGLD   and Golden Star Resources Ltd    NYSE GSS   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Coronavirus Outbreak Gives Gold a Boost  5 Top PicksThe outbreak of coronavirus in China  which resulted in investors  concern over the recovery of global economic growth and left an impact on stock markets  boosted demand for safe haven assets  The demand for precious metal gold  considered as a major investment option under market turmoil  also got a boost On Jan 23  future price of gold for February delivery surged  8 70 or 0 6   to settle at  1 565 40 an ounce on Comex  That was the highest most active contract settlement since Jan 7  Notably  gold price soared to a near seven year peak of  1 610 90 per ounce on Jan 8  following the escalation in U S  Iran geopolitical conflict  After that  the price of this precious metal stayed above  1 550 Coronavirus May Affect Global GrowthThe Chinese authority has already confirmed that as many as 26 people have died due to coronavirus and the total number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 830  Additionally  the United States  Japan and South Korea  all reported confirmed cases of coronavirus following visits to China Coronavirus is the major outbreak of a disease in China after the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002 and 2003 in which more than 8 000 were affected globally and 800 died  Economists estimated that the Chinese economy was impacted by roughly 0 8  due to the SARS outbreak Coronavirus has forced the government of China to lockdown 10 cities with a total population of over 33 million  Certainly  this measure will jeopardize normal economic activities of a large number of people  China is severely suffering from a nearly two year long tariff war with the United States  The recently signed interim trade deal was viewed as an opportunity to revive the sagging economy of the Asian giant Moreover  deterioration of the Chinese economy will significantly affect global export demand and therefore delay global economic recovery Other Drivers of Gold PriceSeveral major central banks  including the Fed are pursuing easy monetary policies  resulting in a lower interest rate  In fact  the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have adopted a zero interest rate policy for more than a year Negative interest rate is forcing investors to park their money in other avenues rather than bank deposits and debt securities  Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold cheaper for investors holding other assets Moreover  concerns over overvaluation equities in several large markets  chances of a no deal Brexit and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East  which may result in surging crude oil prices  could lead to market fluctuations Buying pressure on gold is likely to remain firm as investors will focus on precious metals as a store of wealth and hedge against market turmoil   Additionally  central banks are buying gold for rapid balance sheet expansion  resulting in a gold price rally Strong ProjectionsAccording to a report by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   the wealthy are stocking up on physical gold  as in bullion  coins and bars  The research firm raised its target price for gold to  1 600 per ounce in 2020 Heritage Capital projected gold price in the range of  2 500   3 000 an ounce in 2020  citing recessionary concerns and political uncertainty  Altavest estimated a rally in the  1 650 to  1 750 per ounce range in the months ahead  The world s biggest hedge fund  Bridgewater Associates  recently projected a  2 000 per ounce price target for gold in 2020  citing global uncertainties Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in gold stocks with strong growth potential  We have narrowed down our search to five such
