Prepared Remarks 
OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fifth Third Bank s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call   Operator Instructions I will now hand today s conference over to Mr  Doll  Please go ahead Chris Doll    Director of Investor RelationsThank you  Dkitria  Phonetic   Good morning and thank you all for joining us today  Today  we ll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019 Please review the cautionary statements on our materials  which can be found in our earnings release and presentation  These materials contain reconciliations to non GAAP measures  along with information pertaining to the use of non GAAP measures  as well as forward looking statements about Fifth Third s performance  We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward looking statements after the date of this call This morning  I m joined by our President and CEO  Greg Carmichael  CFO  Tayfun Tuzun  Chief Operating Officer  Lars Anderson  Chief Risk Officer  Frank Forrest  Treasurer  Jamie Leonard  Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun  we will open the call for questions Let me turn over the call now to Greg for his comments Greg D  Carmichael    Chairman of the Board  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Chris  and thank all of you for joining us this morning  Earlier today  we reported record full year 2019 net income of  2 5 billion or  3 33 per share  Full year adjusted net income of  2 1 billion was also a record for the Bank As I reflect on the past year  I m very pleased with the significant progress we made positioning Fifth Third for long term success  In addition to the record net income  we generated our best full year core return on tangible common equity excluding AOCI in over a decade  up 120 basis points from last year  We produced our lowest efficiency ratio in over a decade  which decreased 160 basis points from last year  We generated peer leading household and deposit growth  all while reducing deposit cost during the year Also during the year  we successfully integrated MB Financial  We added significant scale in the Chicago market and expect to generate even stronger deposit  household and revenue growth going forward  We successfully navigated the evolving interest rate environment as our full year 2019 core net interest margin expanded 5 basis points after expanding 18 basis points in the year before  which is at the higher end of our peer group  We generated record fee income  including corporate banking  as our capital markets business generated double digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year  We also generated record revenue in wealth and asset management  while generating positive inflows every quarter during the year Net charge offs and other key credit metrics remained at or near historically low levels throughout the year  We generated nearly  0 5 billion of excess capital through Worldpay transactions in 2019  which is yet to be deployed  And we returned over 110  of adjusted earnings to shareholders in 2019 through a 27  increase in our dividend and through share repurchases In summary  we are extremely pleased with the progress we have made and expect to build on our strong performance in 2020 and beyond For the fourth quarter  net income available to common shareholders was  701 million or  0 96 per share  Reported results included a positive  0 28  primarily from the successful Worldpay tax receivable agreement transactions completed during the quarter  Since the spin off of our processing business 10 years ago  we have generated over  7 billion in pre tax value for our shareholders  with another  195 million remaining in TRA income  which will be fully realized over the next five years  Tayfun will discuss the fourth quarter TRA transaction in more detail Our fourth quarter financial results were very strong  reflecting our prior North Star investments to further diversify our revenue streams  prudent balance sheet management  continued expense discipline and our success in achieving the targeted financial outcomes from the MB Financial acquisition  We generated very strong fee revenue  including a new record in capital markets  Our net interest income results once again reflect our ability to successfully manage the balance sheet despite the lower rate environment  which led to strong NIM performance in the quarter We continue to manage our expenses diligently  This reflects our continued focus on generating efficiencies throughout the Bank  while still investing in high priority areas to support revenue growth  We remain on track to achieve the  255 million in annual savings from the MB acquisition by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and are excited about the revenue synergies that are emerging Loan growth during the quarter was consistent with our previous guidance  reflecting the generally subdued macroeconomic environment  Total commercial loans were stable and consumer loans were up 1  sequentially  Following our trend  we successfully generated strong core deposit growth while proactively reducing deposit cost more than our previous guidance  Our average loan to core deposit ratio of 90  is the lowest in over 15 years Credit results during the quarter were partially impacted by our conversion to a national charter  Excluding this impact  net charge offs were up just 1 basis point sequentially  with consumer flat and commercial up 2 basis points  Provision was primarily impacted by growth in specific reserves related to a couple of commercial loans Before I turn over to Tayfun to discuss our results and outlook  I d like to once again emphasize our strategic priorities to outperform through the cycle and generate long term shareholder value  As I mentioned  we have been very successful in executing our priorities throughout 2019 and have delivered on our targeted outcomes as expected  We will continue to focus on these priorities going forward  including  leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation  investing in talent  capabilities and process improvements to generate relationship growth and improve profitability  continue to expand our presence in select geographies  focusing on high growth markets  We are investing in the Southeast footprint with better deposit growth trends  higher expected population growth and greater market vitality  And lastly  we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout the Company To that end  our capital allocation priorities are  organic balance sheet growth  fee generating non bank acquisitions  paying a strong dividend  and share repurchases  Bank acquisitions are not a priority  Our medium term CET1 capital target remains at approximately 9 5   We plan to increase our dividend another  0 03 this quarter  Subject to Board approval  we expect to execute our remaining buybacks from CCAR 2019 Our clearly defined strategic growth priorities  our proactive balance sheet management  and our ongoing discipline throughout the Bank position us well for the future  We continue to focus on striking the appropriate balance in order to generate positive operating leverage this year  while continuing to invest for long term performance  I m pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results  Our strong performance this quarter was a direct result of our employees  hard work and dedication to keeping the customer at the center of everything we do With that  I ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Greg  Good morning  and thank you for joining us today  Let s move to the financial highlights on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation We are pleased with our overall financial performance and strong finish to a strong year  Similar to the trends all year  during the fourth quarter  our net interest income  net interest margin  non interest income and non interest expenses  all performed in line or better than our October guidance  Reported results for this quarter were positively impacted by  0 28 per share from several notable items  The most significant was a  265 million after tax gain from the Worldpay TRA transaction  which added approximately 20 basis points to our CET1 ratio  Similar to all of the strategic decisions related to our legacy processing business over the past 10 years  the TRA transaction creates significant value for our shareholders by monetizing gross cash flows that previously expected to occur primarily from 2025 until 2035  Consequently  we are also no longer exposed to FIS  taxable income capacity in the future related to those cash flows  and we still have multiple years of annual benefits impacting our fee income in the future  We provide more information on the transaction in our presentation appendix In addition to the TRA transaction  reported results were also affected by a  34 million after tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap  a  15 million after tax contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation and a  7 million after tax impact from MB merger related charges  Additionally  our quarterly results were negatively impacted by a  7 million after tax impact to provision for credit losses  resulting from our conversion to a national charter  Our earnings materials provide more information on the various credit metrics that are affected by this conversion  Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials  fourth quarter pre provision net revenue increased 14  from the prior year Our core return on tangible common equity excluding AOCI also increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 14 8   while our tangible book value per share increased 10  from last year  Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward  while maintaining tight expense control  We will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors and maintain a prudent approach to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future Moving to Slide 5  total average loans were flat sequentially as consumer grew 1  and commercial was stable from the prior quarter  Our focus continues to be on generating higher quality loan growth to maximize our returns through the full cycle  In our commercial business  similar to last quarter  strong production levels in both regional middle market and corporate banking were offset by elevated payoffs  We have experienced higher than usual payoffs this quarter in our leveraged lending and structured finance portfolios  as well as in our construction portfolio New loan production in regional middle market banking has increased every quarter since the first quarter of 2019  Our new loan originations  particularly in Cincinnati  Chicago and Florida  were strong in the fourth quarter  Total commercial line utilization was stable In commercial leasing  our balances continued to decline due to our 2018 decision to hold new originations in our large ticket indirect segment and focus on driving relationship oriented growth  We expect to see lease balances decline by approximately  300 million by the end of 2020 as a result  Beyond 2020  this impact should be lower Average commercial real estate loans were up 1  from last quarter  primarily reflecting draws on prior period commitments  Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk based capital remained very low at less than 80   Commercial loan growth will likely remain relatively muted in the near term  reflecting the subdued environment for corporate capital investments  We will continue to maintain our focus on client selection and prudent underwriting in the best long term interest of our shareholders Average total consumer loans grew 1  from last quarter  predominantly driven by strong auto loan production of  1 7 billion within the same risk return profile that we have targeted for the past number of years  The decline in home equity balances continues to reflect high levels of payoffs and paydowns  Our credit card growth continues to track in line with the industry The residential mortgage portfolio was flat sequentially  We expect this portfolio to remain flat for the foreseeable future  barring any significant changes in the interest rate environment  In the first quarter  we expect total average loan balances to remain relatively stable sequentially  For the full year 2020  we expect average loans to increase approximately 4  relative to last year with growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios Moving on to Slide 6  reported net interest income declined 1  compared to the prior quarter  The purchase accounting adjustments benefited our fourth quarter NII by  18 million and our net interest margin by 5 basis points compared to  28 million and 7 basis points in the third quarter  Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion  NII was relatively flat with just a  4 million decrease sequentially  Interest income benefited a couple of million dollars from seasonal dividends The adjusted fourth quarter NIM of 3 22  decreased 3 basis points from the third quarter adjusted NIM  which was better than our October guidance of down 4 basis points to 5 basis points  Our relative NIM performance throughout this cycle    this rate cycle has been outstanding Our focus on reducing our overall interest bearing liability costs to offset the impact of lower market rates remains very high  Interest bearing core deposit rates were down 19 basis points during the quarter  better than our previous guidance range of 15 basis points to 18 basis points  We expect interest bearing core deposit costs in the first quarter to decline approximately another 8 basis points to 10 basis points from the fourth quarter  assuming the Fed remains on hold  Combining our first quarter forecast with the results of the past three quarters  we will achieve a cumulative 30 basis point decline in interest bearing core deposit costs since the Fed started lowering interest rates last year  resulting in a 40  beta On a core basis  we expect first quarter NIM to expand 1 basis points to 2 basis points from the fourth quarter core NIM of 3 22   reflecting the increasing benefit from the forward starting hedge positions that became effective over the past few months  For the full year 2020  we continue to expect core NIM to be 3 25   consistent with our October guidance and down just 2 basis points from our core 2019 NIM  assuming no Fed rate cuts this year For the full year  we currently expect net interest income excluding purchase accounting adjustments to increase approximately 2   We expect our first quarter net interest income excluding purchase accounting adjustments to decline approximately 2  sequentially  impacted by day count and the relatively stable loan growth outlook  Our first quarter outlook also assumes partial reinvestment of the investment portfolio cash flows  which may change depending on the environment Moving on to Slide 7  we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in October  Adjusted non interest income decreased only 2  sequentially as deposit fees and corporate banking fees performed better than expected  offsetting a portion of the seasonal decline in mortgage revenues  Continuing its recent trends  corporate banking fees exceeded our guidance  Our capital market teams generated record revenues this quarter  up 10  from the third quarter  For the full year  our capital markets fees were up 12   following 15  year over year growth in 2018  We are very pleased with the second half revenue strength in capital markets  especially the growth from our regional banking client activities  Our focus on client selection and deepening those relationships is working well to diversify our revenue streams  The power of our One Bank model  which engages all business lines in meeting our clients  needs  is very visible in our financial results We generated very strong 30  growth in corporate banking revenue in 2019 relative to 2018  reflecting the investments we have made in our North Star project in talent and in advanced capabilities to better serve our clients  As we anticipated  the return to those investments will continue to reward our shareholders Mortgage banking revenue decreased 23  to  73 million sequentially and increased 35  relative to the fourth quarter of 2018  Origination volume of  3 8 billion was up 13  from the prior quarter  Our gain on sale margin was 156 basis points in the quarter  impacted by seasonally lower application volumes in the quarter and tightening primary secondary spreads Wealth and asset management revenue increased 4  from the prior quarter due to higher personal asset management fees  We finished the year very strong in new AUM flows and expect this trend to continue in 2020  Deposit service charges were up this quarter with higher fees in consumer as well as commercial  We expect a stronger year in 2020 in our consumer and commercial deposit service charges  based on the trend that we are seeing Our 2019 non interest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wide scope of product and service capabilities  For the full year 2020  we expect core non interest income growth of approximately 8  relative to the adjusted 2019 level of  2 711 billion  including the expected Worldpay TRA benefit in the fourth quarter  We expect first quarter non interest income to decline approximately 3   reflecting seasonally lower mortgage and interchange revenue  Our first quarter forecast also does not include any investment gains  In total  as a result of NII growth and strong increase in fees  we expect to achieve a very strong 4  total revenue growth in 2020 Moving on to Slide 8  fourth quarter reported pre tax expenses included merger related items totaling  9 million  intangible amortization expense of  14 million and a contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation of  20 million  Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials  non interest expense was flat sequentially  We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB related expense savings  We continue to expect to achieve  255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter of 2020  Additionally  we expect our total after tax merger charges  inclusive of the merger related charges recognized in current and past periods  as well as projected future charges  to be approximately  245 million after tax  which is  5 million lower than our deal estimate As is always the case for us  our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes  Excluding these seasonal items  we would expect our total expenses in the first quarter to be down approximately 1  sequentially  Total first quarter expenses including the seasonal items are expected to be up approximately 5  from the adjusted fourth quarter  which also includes the full impact of the  3 raise in our minimum wage to  18 an hour  Although in the short term  the increase in minimum wage is dilutive  in the long run  we expect to achieve a stronger financial outcome through lower turnover  improved workforce quality  lower recruiting expenses and more effective training For the full year  there are a number of discrete one time changes  including the impact of the minimum wage increase and the increase in direct regulatory fees related to the OCC charter conversion  In addition  we are planning to continue to rationalize and modernize our technology infrastructure  which will result in additional in year expense growth relative to our recent trends  These three unique items are expected to increase our total expenses by approximately 1   We are anticipating a minimal increase in discretionary expenses outside of these items  Excluding these unique items affecting 2020  total expenses should increase less than 2   In total  including these items  we expect total adjusted expenses to increase between 2  and 3  compared to adjusted 2019 non interest expenses of  4 372 billion  which reflects growth in expense items tied to strong revenue performance that I mentioned Regardless of our 12 month outlook  which calls for positive operating leverage resulting from strong revenue and disciplined expense growth  in this uncertain macroeconomic environment  we intend to maintain flexibility to achieve positive operating leverage under potentially less favorable economic conditions  We recognize that as we navigate through the environment  investments in projects with lower returns may be de emphasized or delayed in order to focus our capital investments in the highest areas of importance within the four strategic corporate priorities Turning to credit results on Slide 9  due to our national charter conversion  fourth quarter credit results were impacted by accounting policy changes to conform to OCC guidance regarding certain assets  which resulted in an increase in TDR and OREO balances  These changes increased consumer NPLs by  83 million and NPAs by  113 million  which added 7 basis points to the NPL ratio and 10 basis points to the NPA ratio  The same change resulted in a one time  10 million increase in charge offs  all within our consumer portfolio  Excluding the one time OCC impact  net charge offs remained at historically low levels during the quarter  The consumer net charge off ratio was flat and commercial was up 2 basis points sequentially  The adjusted NPA and NPL ratios continue to be benign and in line with the levels that we have seen all year The ALLL ratio increased slightly to 1 1  of portfolio loans and leases  driven largely by two factors  The larger portion of the increase was due to higher specific reserves for two middle market commercial loans in two different industries  We expect these loans to go through our resolution process in the first or second quarter  We also increased the allowance in our credit card portfolio as the incurred loss methodology captured the uptick in historical loss rates  As we discussed before  the higher credit card loss rates are related to growth in certain promotional test portfolios  which are expected to run off and result in more normalized charge offs toward the end of the quarter    end of the year  Card charge offs were actually down 20 basis points this quarter compared to third quarter With respect to the CECL adoption  which is in effect as of January 1  the day one adjustments will result in an increase of approximately 48  to 50  or between  645 million and  675 million to our allowance for credit losses  which includes reserves for unfunded commitments  and is below the upper end of the range that we provided in October  As a reminder  this increase includes the impact of the MB acquisition accounting methodology pertaining to our non PCI loan portfolio and the CECL treatment of reserves  which adds more than 10  to the increase that I mentioned  As discussed previously  excluding the impact of MB  we expect reserves for commercial loans to decrease and consumer and mortgage loans to increase relative to the incurred loss methodology  We plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10 K disclosure Consistent with peer banks who have recently commented on the impact of CECL  given the number and potential volatility associated with the underlying variables supporting the CECL methodology  we expect more volatility in our quarterly provision expense  Our calculations for the allowance for credit losses rely on various models and estimation techniques  utilizing historical losses  borrower characteristics  economic conditions  and a reasonable and supportable forecast  as well as other relevant factors  For expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years  we will use three macroeconomic scenario  From there  we assume losses revert to historical levels over a period of two years on a straight line basis Given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under CECL  we will be providing forecast for net charge offs for the foreseeable future  Overall  we expect our full year 2020 charge offs to remain near historically low levels and be in the 35 basis point to 40 basis point range  which is up just a few basis points compared to the 36 basis point to 37 basis point charge off rates that we have seen in the last couple of quarters  Again  I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential fluctuations in losses on a quarter to quarter basis  given the current low absolute levels of charge offs Turning to Slide 10  capital levels ended the year very strong  Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 9 7  and our tangible common equity ratio  excluding AOCI  was 8 4   Our tangible book value per share was  21 13 this quarter  up 10  year over year During the quarter  we completed  300 million in buybacks  which reduced our share count by approximately 10 million shares or about 1 5  of our common shares outstanding compared to the third quarter  We expect to execute the remaining approximately  600 million of repurchases over the remaining two quarters in this CCAR cycle  Between the Worldpay sale gains in the first quarter of 2019 and the impact of the recent TRA transaction  we have nearly  0 5 billion of additional capital above our initial expectations as we proceed into the 2020 CCAR exercise  As we discussed last quarter  the pacing of our preferred dividends has recently changed in light of our September issuance and the conversion of existing preferred stock to floating rates with quarterly payments  We expect our preferred expense to alternate between  17 million and  33 million every quarter going forward  assuming no issuances or change in LIBOR Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook In summary  I would like to reiterate a few items  Our fourth quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we ve made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle  Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies  As always  we remain intensely focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through various economic cycles With that  let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q A Chris Doll    Director of Investor RelationsThanks Tayfun  Before we start Q A  as a courtesy to others  we ask you to limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions  We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning  During the question and answer period  please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator  Dkitria  please open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  guys  Thanks for taking my question  Hey  Tayfun  I just wanted to ask about the fourth quarter provision and give some detail on the items impacting it  in addition to just the move to the national charter  But you had  it sounds like  a couple of commercial credits and then the impact from the credit card portfolio as well  Just as you think about things sort of on a go forward basis  how much of that proves transitory and how much  if any  is sort of a new run rate  In other words  if it was higher than expected this quarter due to some of those kind of revert back down  or what s the best way to think about it Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Scott  I will make a few comments and I ll turn it over to Frank for the credit piece  We believe that clearly these couple of credits that just happened in one quarter impacted the provision numbers  which we believe to be transitionary  If you look at our guidance for next year  we are clearly expecting continued stability in benign credit performance away from sort of the accounting related changes in our credit metrics  This truly was just one of these quarters where a few credit loans came up  But  Frank  do you want to comment on that Frank R  Forrest    Executive Vice President and Chief Risk OfficerTayfun  I will  And Scott  we ve talked about before  the commercial business    and we ve  Phonetic  done this a long time    is lumpy  It s the nature of the business  lumpy  One quarter  that makes a trend in either direction in the commercial business  and it s something that you manage over an extended period of time  These two credits are non related to each other  They re both kind of core middle market companies  The company has actually banked for a long period of time  One is a retailer  One is in the hospitality sector  They re just    they re going through a workout and they happen to hit at the same time  But if you revert back to the year and if you look at our overall  again  results for the year  we re actually very pleased with the asset quality for the year  As we said before  our criticized assets came within our expectations for the year  Our outlook for 2020 has really not changed other than maybe a 2  Phonetics  basis points  3  Phonetics  basis points increase  just given the economy  And overall  our nonperforming assets for the quarter were centered on these two items  the  50 million net flow at the end of the day When we think back to the work we ve done in the Company intentionally over the last four years  we ve repositioned this company to be strong through operating cycles  So we re highly confident    I m highly confident we ve done that  These are middle market credits  The increases we ve actually seen for the year in our problem credits have been tied to kind of the lower end middle market  A lot of that s reflective of repositioning the rating system from MB  Some of it s in our systems as well  Those credits tend to be very well secured and historically have a loan loss rate  and it s a very granular portfolio  which is what we like to see When you think about the portfolios  at least in my experience  where we    you should be concerned  as you think about the economy  when an economy slips  Phonetic   it s commercial real estate  it would be your large corporate book and it would be leveraged  And when you think about our commercial real estate book  we have the lowest concentration of commercial real estate loans than  Phonetic  any of our peers  And that portfolio has performed exceptionally well  And we position it with companies today that are basically national and large regional developers that are essentially investment grade or near investment grade  lot of liquidity  Our large corporate books performed exceptionally well  our shared national credit book  very low level of criticized assets  and it s very diverse  We manage the risk exposures there  I think  very prudently And when you think about leverage  leverage in our case  we ve been focused on reducing that for now for four years  We ve reduced over  5 billion in leveraged loans in the last four years  which is a 48  decrease  But we feel very good about the remaining leverage that we have today  We have specialized groups that lend to that sector according  Phonetic  to the line of business  and they re tied together with specialists that we have in risk  And we manage it prudently  we monitor it prudently  So our overall thesis  I suppose  is that when you think about the portfolio and what Fifth Third has done over the last four years  we ve completely repositioned this portfolio for success  and we re highly confident that that work will project itself as we move forward in 2020 and beyond under any economic scenario Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  I appreciate that  And then separately  Tayfun  I was curious on the gain that you got from the change in the TRA agreement  do you guys have the same flexibility to repurchase shares with that gain as you do under kind of a more traditional    if you were to just sell shares and get an after tax gain in that way Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNot with the gain that we book  We typically go to the Fed with a specific request  But clearly  the first quarter 2019 gain on share sales  we are able to buy back shares with that  But obviously  this gain that we booked in the fourth quarter goes into our overall capital ratios  which gives us a better starting point for the 2020 CCAR exercise Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystYeah  Okay  perfect  Thank you Chris Doll    Director of Investor RelationsDkitria  are you there OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  good morning guys  Can I ask a question on the right side of the balance sheet  you talked about loans growing 4  this year  I m wondering if you could put the deposits into context in terms of the mix of deposits and what type of growth you re expecting on the deposit side overall  Thanks Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI suspect that I ll turn it over to Jamie with details as well  We obviously have had a very good year both in consumer as well as commercial deposits in 2019  We expect that our stable growth in consumer accompanied by good growth in household will continue  We do expect a stronger year in commercial deposit growth as well because we have a good amount of focus on the partnership in our treasury management group and our commercial deposit  Jamie  anything you want add James C  Leonard    Executive Vice President and TreasurerKen  this is Jamie  One of our goals this year is that we do match loan growth with deposit growth  And so for us  we would expect core deposits to be growing similarly to the loan side at 4   Tayfun mentioned our focus is really improving the share of wallet that we get on the commercial side of the aisle because historically  retail  as you know  has been a very strong provider of deposits and funding for the Company over the years  So our focus is getting commercial up to those levels  So we would expect commercial to outperform those numbers  and then on the retail side  to be a little bit less than that 4  number  in part because we are intentionally running down our CD portfolio and repricing a lot of those higher cost CDs around 2  or so  right now  repricing them down in the 1 25  range  So we are driving those deposits out the door  which results in a little bit lower retail deposit growth number  However  you see that benefit show up in our deposit costs  both in the fourth quarter as well as a big support to what we expect in the first in the second quarter of the year Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystGot it  OK  And maybe as a follow up  on the first quarter outlook  you talk about down 2  but you    NII  But you did indicate that you expect the core NIM to be up and loan stable  So can you help us flush out what the other deltas would be in terms of    you mentioned the seasonality of securities and some of the deposits  Like what else    it seems like that there wouldn t be so much of a drag on fourth to first James C  Leonard    Executive Vice President and TreasurerYeah  From an NII dollars perspective  the fourth to the first is really driven by day count of  10 million  then higher wholesale funding costs and the impact of seasonal runoff in DDAs  That s about  5 million  And then the investment portfolio  we expect to be down about  10 million from the elevated fourth quarter levels  The fourth quarter levels include a lot of the year end one time mutual fund dividend amounts  and that was  6 million  And so  the other portion of the investment portfolio reduction is that we did not reinvest cash flows in the fourth quarter  And as Tayfun mentioned  given where rates are right now  we don t expect to reinvest all of our portfolio cash flows in the first quarter  So we ll be opportunistic  If things change  we certainly have the capacity to reinvest  But right now  we re running the portfolio at about 21  of total assets  And that s    will probably be in that 21  to 22  range over the course of the year Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And maybe this is a good point for us also to add that for the year  our NII guidance for the year basically assumes a fairly flat  even maybe a slightly down average portfolio balance  So for those of you who are modeling investment portfolio numbers for 2020  our decisions on the investment portfolio tend to be very opportunistic  But for now  as we sit here at the beginning of the year  we re not anticipating an increase to investment portfolio balances  If we do see opportunities  if the environment changes  that clearly will have an impact on the actual performance when we get to the end of the year Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Thanks guys OperatorYour next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey  good morning  On the CECL front  if you could help us think about how provision on a day two basis could shape up in terms of either on a quarterly basis as we go into 2020 or how we could think about it on a full year basis on how it s impacted by the adoption  Thanks Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Yeah  I think the progress in our reserves and the impact on the provision number is probably very similar to others  except for when you look at what s driving the higher reserve rates  it really is the longer dated loans and some of the consumer credit outstandings  We  as you know  have been very clear on our expectations with respect to the residential mortgage portfolio  We do not intend to grow that portfolio  not necessarily because of CECL  but just because in the current interest rate environment  I don t think that we re getting paid to grow that  And home equities have been declining  That s another portfolio that has a relatively large increase in    under CECL compared to the incurred methodology  So those two portfolios should not contribute much in terms of increases in reserve coverage The one portfolio that we continue to grow is auto  Now  auto CECL is also higher than auto incurred loss  So that should have a slight sort of increase  But if we continue to grow our commercial book  as we have done so in the past  that s our biggest book  and we will continue to grow that  I suspect that our coverage ratio ultimately will not change much from where we are standing  but we re all going to have to wait and see how this plays out  It is without having not even a quarter under our belt  it is very difficult to establish good  reliable trends  given the impact of these various macroeconomic scenarios that we will be applying John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thanks Tayfun  And then  separately on the MB side  just wanted to see if you can give us an update on banker retention  I know there was some concerns about that a few months back on some headlines that everything you had indicated that you re retaining a majority of your targeted employees as part of the deal  You mentioned that last quarter  Just want to get an update on that front and where    how that s been progressing Greg D  Carmichael    Chairman of the Board  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  John  Thanks for the question  This is Greg  First of all  we feel really good about the talent that we have in the Chicago market  as evidenced by the strong production numbers that we re seeing from Chicago  As you would expect  we have a target of  255 million of expense reduction  So a lot of that reduction shows up in the form of individuals to late  Phonetic  expenses and so forth that did not have jobs offered to them  So a lot of attrition  you would expect to see that  I would tell you in general  80 plus percent individuals we offer positions to or with the company remain  We feel really good about that  And our ability to hit our expense targets that we modeled in this attrition is exactly where we d expect it to be  So we re    there s no surprises here We ve also taken a best of breed approach  So when you think about leadership in that market  all right  and as  Indecipherable  as CEO  we ve retained the best of breed we thought to run that company  There s redundancy  There s optimization that s going to occur  You would expect certain individuals to look for other opportunities as we modeled in  So it s very much in line with what we expected  There was no surprises here  And we ll achieve the objectives we ve mentioned  But more importantly  the outcomes in Chicago  when you look at our retail franchise  our wealth business and our strong  strong core middle market production  we re really excited about what we re seeing there  and also the revenue synergies as they start to come together as we integrate that business into the rest of our business  whether it be asset based lending  leasing  capital markets  into the old MB book  we feel really good about what we re seeing there  And we re very bullish on the ability to accomplish our objectives that we set forth in that market  but there is no surprises here John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  Thanks Greg  I appreciate it OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks  And just in terms of corporate banking  obviously  you ve had really good success over the last couple of years with that business  And I know your fee growth is obviously higher for 2020 in general  But can you just talk specifically about corporate banking in terms of what you re expecting from that line  Is that    like how far forward can we continue to expect sort of those double digit gains  I m just trying to understand what s sort of transitory versus more of a sustainable growth rate Greg D  Carmichael    Chairman of the Board  President and Chief Executive OfficerKen  I ll add to this and then I ll turn it over to Lars for a little more color on this  First off  when you go back and think about our North Star commitments  a lot of those investments were in corporate banking  capital markets area  And those investments we said will start to materialize from a revenue perspective in 2019  you re seeing that  Strength in 2018  continued strength in 2019  We continue to invest in that area because once again  it provides the products and services we need to better support our clients  And we have a great team assembled and we continue to make great progress in that area  So we would expect that performance to continue as we look into 2020 and beyond  So Lars  let me give you that Lars C  Anderson    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Ken  we re really pleased with how the North Star investments foundational  Phonetic  have really played out  We shared with you in particular the replatforming of our FRM business  We re already seeing the benefits of that  You can actually see that in our foreign exchange performance this quarter  FRM business is really coming back  It s strong  But in addition to that  a real focus on our advisory model  our relationship banking model and aligning our businesses to both our middle market focus as a company as well as our industry verticals to be an advisor  a consultant  which that meant that we really needed to go after the investment banking piece of capital markets  And that is paying big  big dividends for us today So an example of that would be Coker Capital that we acquired  and that perfectly aligns with our advisory approach to the healthcare industry  Most recently  you saw the fact that we recruited 12 investment bankers in San Francisco  It aligns with our renewables and solar business  So that s the theme here is to continue to build out a broad platform to serve the industries  geographies and segments that we plan to win in  Now look  we may not be able to control the ultimate loan growth quarter to quarter or year to year because there are macroeconomic impacts on that  But one thing we can do is  bring them advice  solutions  and those are often tied toward our fee products and services  And you re seeing that come through in our corporate banking success  I m really proud of the talent that we have Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystAll right  That s great  And then  just maybe one follow up question for Tayfun  You mentioned that you have higher regulatory expenses related to the charter change in 2020 as part of that 1  extra expense growth next year  Is there any seasonality related to that  I m trying to figure out what s    again  what sort of unusual first half kind of driven expenses versus this just permanently increases your expense base  Thanks Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  there is no    Ken  there is about  11 million   12 million just the direct fee that we pay to the OCC  It s just    that s that marginal increase in indirect costs  But there is no seasonality Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystAnd it s just an ongoing expense going forward Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s correct  The change is a unique change year over year  but it will be in our expense base going forward Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystPerfect  All right  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Erika Najarian    Bank of America    AnalystHi  good morning  I just wanted to reiterate maybe the point that you made earlier  If the NII or the non interest income revenue outlook fell short  there is room to pull the expense lever and potentially we do better than the 2  to 3  range to achieve positive operating leverage for 2020 Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so we clearly    we have always intended to    in the past number of years to achieve it  We achieved it every year  And we continue to keep the same target  And when you look at the contents of the remaining expenses beyond that 1  sort of unique change  Erika  clearly our largest expense is in compensation  And there is an underlying inflation built into that  and that consumes over 0 5 point of that expense increase  And in addition  there is also another 0 5 point or so in expense increase related directly to revenue growth  So if the revenues sort of tend to come in slower than we expect  we believe that it will be reflected on expense growth as well  And then  we re going to have to make some choices as to where to invest and where not to invest to wait out a slower revenue growth environment Erika Najarian    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matt O Connor with Deutsche Bank Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank     AnalystGood morning  I was wondering if you could talk a bit about just commercial borrower sentiment  You did mention that the payoffs were quite high in 4Q and had a somewhat muted outlook for commercial lending  I think it was the first quarter  But it seems like maybe commercial and corporate sentiment is improving  Maybe it s just literally  Phonetic  the last few weeks here  but that s one of the themes that we ve been hearing from some other banks and maybe some of the things in the credit markets point to that as well  So  are you seeing some early signs of that  Or is it a little bit of a different customer base for you guys than maybe we re seeing elsewhere Lars C  Anderson    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Matt  So first of all  just to address the first quarter  there s seasonality issues in that  So I would really be looking to Tayfun s guidance for the year  That s what we re focused on is executing in 2020  There has been a heightened sense of caution as we have moved through the second half of 2019 with some of the global tensions  tariffs  those kinds of things  But some of the resolution of that  we re beginning to hear some positive things  We re seeing some activity levels that are reflected in the pipelines  not just from a lending  but also from a fee solutions perspective  That is giving me a little bit more confidence as we look at 2020 and a potential pickup in activity levels there  So frankly  I m not looking at 2020 with a lot of concern  I feel like that we can go out there and execute  given where we have positioned our resources in the Southeast in middle market banking  in industry verticals  But in summary  there is still a sense of caution  but I would describe it as positively migrating  As you see  a number of things start to play out in the global marketplace and with some of the trade tariff activities recently completed Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank     AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And then  just separately  you reiterated sort of your interest in additional fee deals  You ve talked about this in the past  Just remind us kind of which areas you must be looking to complement  And are they sizable enough that you kind of pull back a little bit of your capital versus your target  Or they re just not going to be meaningful enough to really impact the kind of capital and buyback story  Thank you Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  The capital decisions are independent from that  Matt  because they    the timing of these availabilities are random  We have in the past    we re very clear  Lars mentioned the confidence that we have in our advisory businesses  in commercial  We clearly    if we can    if we come across opportunities to even grow our advisory M A services etc   we will be looking for those  Long time ago  we started talking about potentially adding more capital markets capabilities in commercial real estate  As they may become available  we will be focusing on those  We have invested in our asset management business  There are opportunities that are financially feasible and rewarding  We will be looking at those  So it is going to be more business commercial oriented fee oriented opportunities  But at this point  what we do with the capital that we have is somewhat independent of the opportunities  If we see the opportunities  we will execute them regardless of whether we re sitting on  0 5 billion of capital or not Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank     AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystHey  good morning  guys  First  I wanted to clarify a couple of points on credit  First  you obviously    on the commercial side  you obviously mentioned the specific allowances for two commercial credits  You also had a big increase in NPL formation in commercial  I think  165 million  on Page 21  I think  Frank  you mentioned that was also related to the    those two specific credits  I just wanted to confirm that was the case  And also on CECL  Tayfun  just again a clarification  And I have to sharpen my pencil on this  but I think your allowance takes your ACL ratio to like 160 bps  170 bps  I guess what you re saying is that obviously  there is volatility  there s more things driving quarterly provision  but your best guess at this point would be that it sort of stays in that range and we should be modeling provisions with charge offs and growth  Is that sort of the right way to think about it  So a couple of questions with more a clarification question on   Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI ll take the CECL one and then I ll turn it over to Frank  I think your numbers are right in the ballpark  Saul  And yes  sitting here looking at the balance sheet progress  without necessarily having a clear cut knowledge of macro scenarios  I can only assume that it s probably going to stay around those levels  But obviously  after a couple of quarters under our belt  we will be able to give you a more precise answer on this one  Frank  on the credit side Frank R  Forrest    Executive Vice President and Chief Risk OfficerYes  on the  165 million  your question was is it inclusive of the  50 million  And the answer is  yes  it was  And just as a reminder  in the workout business  things are lumpy  It s    you don t package things up in any package and you have even inflows and outflows  We want to    we analyze inflows every quarter in detail and look to see if there s any particular trends that are bothersome to us  So we didn t see anything there in particular that s spread out  I will say the flip side of that is  we had a really strong quarter on collections  So our net at the end of the day was  50 million  which I think about as sort of those two credits that were there before  So that s the story there  And again  it doesn t    I don t think portend anything different in our outlook for 2020  We feel very good about 2020 based on where we sit today Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystGreat  That s really helpful  Thanks a lot guys OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystHey  good morning  I just wanted to follow up on Tayfun s comment early in the call about the accelerated paydowns of leveraged loans in other commercial  Is that attrition going to continue do you think  Or would you look to replace those loans this year Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Our intent is not necessarily to grow the leveraged portfolio to make up for the faster payoffs  We will make loan decisions independent of the payouts  But Lars  any comments on that Lars C  Anderson    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  No  so actually going back to a previous question  just so that you understand  the build that you see  and we have seen both in middle market and corporate banking  increasing volumes of loan production throughout the year  and that is really encouraging  which I had mentioned about 2020  some of my optimism On the flip side  and part of the muted impact in the ultimate balance sheet  a softness in the industry that we re seeing has been in paydowns  elevated paydowns  However  the complexion of that changed in the fourth quarter  In the fourth quarter  rather than just deleveraging of some of our portfolio  what we saw with the two biggest drivers was number one  higher risk assets in the leveraged lending portfolio where we actually saw a decline there  And that s a positive thing  It s strengthening our balance sheet  And it s not that we will not extend credit into the leveraged lending market  but we re being very disciplined and selective in that market  The second piece of it goes back to what Frank said earlier  We saw pretty significant paydowns in our construction lending line of business  which I ve shared previously in prior calls that we expected that that would begin to occur  This is a sign of a healthy commercial real estate portfolio late in the cycle  So maybe a little bit more than you asked  but to kind of frame it  we do not see that leveraged lending will be a growth area for us for a period of time this late in the cycle Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystGreat Lars  That s really helpful background  Thank you both for the comments OperatorThank you  Your final question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking the follow up  I just wanted to ask on your GreenSky relationship  I know you guys had renewed that relationship  Just at a top level  any changes to how you re thinking about appetites for those types of credits  And then  I guess more specifically  were there any changes in the terms as a result of that renewal Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI can t necessary    yes  we renewed the relationship  and we renewed the relationship having had the experience with GreenSky over the past couple of years and having seen a fairly stable credit performance  Having said that  we believe that the renewal actually benefits us the way it was done  the way it was structured from a credit support perspective  as well as pricing perspective  That s all I m going to comment  given the fact that they re the counterparty to the agreement  But we feel pretty good as to where we ended during the renewal discussion Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystAll right  That sounds great  Thank you Tayfun Tuzun    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay Chris Doll    Director of Investor RelationsWell  there is no further questions  Thank you

177537,399053,FITB,Fed Unveils Plans to Reduce Stress of Wall Street s Stress Tests,news," Bloomberg     Wall Street banks will have to wait a bit longer for regulators appointed by President Donald Trump to make the Federal Reserve s stress tests less stressful  Their reward for being patient could be many more concessions than they industry anticipated 
Randal Quarles  the Fed s vice chairman for supervision  said Friday that a planned overhaul of the annual exams won t be in place until at least 2020 
But in good news for Wall Street  he said the revamp could target three issues that have long frustrated bankers  the possibility of having dividend and share buyback plans publicly rejected  the testing process s lack of transparency  and reducing the stigma of failing what s know as the qualitative part of the assessments 
Implemented after the 2008 financial crisis  the Fed uses the exams to assess whether banks have enough capital to withstand the losses that would be triggered by another downturn  The exams have led to embarrassing headlines for firms that have failed  and blocked them from returning money to their investors 
Another Concession
Quarles  speaking at a Brookings Institution event in Washington  also said Friday that the Fed plans to give Wall Street another reprieve by delaying a related rule change that will force the biggest banks to hold more capital 
The Fed proposed in April that its risk based capital regulations be tied to its stress tests  The result    a new  stress capital buffer  based on each firm s performance in the tests    is expected to result in megabanks having to boost capital  For the rest of the industry  however  the changes would result in capital cushions falling by tens of billions of dollars 
Revising the rule for the biggest banks will take longer than the 2019 completion the Fed anticipated  Quarles said  He added that parts of the proposal may still move forward next year 
Comments on the earlier proposal  have flagged certain elements of the regime that could benefit from further refinement   Quarles said  He said the Fed expects to adopt a rule in the  near future  to implement some of the ideas while re proposing other aspects    including ways to answer bankers  concerns that the resulting capital demands could be subject to volatile swings from year to year  Many of his other suggested changes address long standing industry complaints 
More Transparency
The Fed is considering revising its proposal to let banks know their stress test outcomes before they plan their capital distributions  That would reverse one of the most dramatic aspects of the tests in which lenders have to guess at the amount of capital they d be able to return to shareholders through dividends  and risk the Fed publicly rejecting their plans 
Quarles also said he favors scrapping the requirement that banks stay above a certain leverage threshold under the tests  adverse scenarios  He added that the Fed is trying to improve how it measures risk in firms  trading books 
For banks with less than  250 billion of assets  including SunTrust Banks Inc  NYSE STI   and Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   the Fed is seeking to reduce the frequency of exams to every other year  Quarles said he is urging the full Fed board to make 2019 an off year for such lenders  meaning they wouldn t be tested again until 2020 
In its April proposal  the Fed had already made stress test concessions  including removing the expectation that lenders would grow their balance sheets and keep paying dividends when facing major economic stress  The agency s proposal would also erase some of the different capital thresholds that banks must stay above  That was the carrot for the biggest lenders  which also faced a stick  Capital minimums would  somewhat increase  for firms such as JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   and  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    the agency estimated 
Quarles Skeptical
Quarles said Friday that he favors eliminating a requirement that it be publicly announced when banks fail the qualitative part of the tests  which measures each firm s ability to manage capital in a crisis  He said he supports  removing the public objection tool  and continuing to evaluate firms  stress testing practices through normal supervision  
The changes are  not intended to alter materially the overall level of capital in the system or the stringency of the regime   Quarles said 
To boost transparency  he said the Fed intends to  disclose additional detail about supervisory stress test models and results and to publish portfolios of hypothetical loans and associated loss rates   The agency is also considering  additional transparency regarding scenarios and scenario design   he added 
The Fed has been hesitant to reveal much about its tests because of fears that providing too many details would be akin to giving banks the answers before the exam  Quarles said Friday that he s always been  skeptical  of that concern 
Quarles is scheduled to appear at hearings in the House and Senate next week to update oversight committees on the Fed s regulatory efforts

177539,399055,FITB,Online student lender CommonBond lays off 18 percent of staff,news,"By Daniel A Medina and Anna Irrera
NEW YORK  Reuters    Online student lender CommonBond has laid off around 18 percent of its staff  a company spokeswoman said  citing a plan to shift investment into new areas 
The start up s layoffs follow challenging years for the online lending industry  which has seen widespread job cuts  plummeting shares and a stricter focus on credit quality 
CommonBond s job cuts  which impacted 22 people in total  were announced to employees in a  all hands  company meeting on Tuesday afternoon  the spokeswoman told Reuters in an email  The layoffs have not been reported elsewhere

177541,399057,FITB,Fed gives banks more stress test information  unveils 2019 scenarios,news,"By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Reserve moved on Tuesday to make its stress testing of large banks more transparent  providing financial firms significantly more information about how their portfolios would perform under potential economic shocks  During the 2019 round of stress tests and going forward  big banks will know  significantly more  information about the models the U S  central bank uses to test banks  books  including how hypothetical loans perform under the tests and more detailed information about the Fed s models  The 2019 tests will include factoring in a jump to 10 percent unemployment from the current 4 percent rate  as well as elevated stress in corporate loan and commercial real estate markets in the most severe scenario  The transparency changes  first proposed by the Fed in December 2017 and finalized Tuesday  are aimed at long running bank complaints that the current stress testing process is cumbersome and opaque  In addition  less complex banks with assets between  100 billion and  250 billion  such as SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI  and Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  will not have to face the 2019 tests  as the Fed is moving to a two year cycle for testing those firms   The industry had been tracking the 2019 testing closely  as Fed officials have said they would like to make the tests more accommodating  amid bank gripes that prior rounds have been overly harsh and resource intensive  The steps the Fed is taking to make the testing more transparent should address some of those concerns  although proponents of stricter rules on Wall Street caution too much transparency could allow banks to mask underlying risks by gaming the exam  The annual test of bank stability subjects the books of large banks like JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and  Citigroup   NYSE C  to hypothetical economic downturns to ensure they can withstand the blow without collapsing  The tests vary slightly every year  as the Fed probes for weak points in bank finances  and become more difficult as the economy improves   We are confident this scenario will effectively test the resiliency of the nation s largest banks   said Randal Quarles  the Fed s vice chair for supervision

177662,399178,FITB,Exclusive  Companies made deals that could run afoul of U S  whistleblower rules,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters     Wells Fargo   N WFC   Advanced Micro Devices  O AMD  and Fifth Third Bank  O FITB  have in recent years agreed to settlement deals that seek to muzzle former employees in ways that some lawyers said could violate U S  whistleblower protection laws  Five lawyers  including three who represent whistleblowers  said that the settlements appear aimed at blocking workers from airing their concerns and contain similarities to those used by other companies that ran afoul of government rules   The deals by Wells Fargo  AMD  and Fifth Third Bank were among a dozen such corporate settlements reached between 2012 and 2015 that were reviewed by Reuters  The companies each struck deals with departing workers that limit the employees  ability to receive money arising from any government investigations into their former employers  Some language in the settlements could run afoul of rules adopted by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  in 2011 that generally bar corporate attempts to muzzle whistleblowers  the lawyers  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment  as did a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices  A spokesman for Fifth Third said the agreement  speaks for itself  and that the company  takes seriously  its obligation to comply with all  relevant laws   A SEC spokeswoman declined to comment  Since 2015  the SEC has brought four cases targeting specific types of so called whistleblower gag orders  such as confidentiality agreements that bar employees from discussing internal wrongdoing  That followed its adoption of rules designed to encourage people to come forward with tips about possible corporate wrongdoing  The rules protect whistleblowers from retaliation and ban companies from taking any action that could  impede an individual from communicating directly  with the SEC  including through confidentiality agreements  The SEC says the program has awarded more than  85 million to 32 whistleblowers  This month  the agency announced civil charges against two companies that required outgoing employees to waive their rights to recover government whistleblower awards in severance agreements  Those companies  Health Net  now part of  Centene  Corp  N CNC  and BlueLinx Holdings  settled without admitting or denying liability and each paid six figure fines   Jordan Thomas  a lawyer at Labaton Sucharow who represents whistleblowers  said the language used in the Fifth Third  Wells Fargo and Advanced Micro Devices settlements is designed to discourage whistleblowers from reporting corporate misbehavior   As in the Health Net and BlueLinx cases  all three settlements contain language restricting the employees from collecting any money resulting from a government investigation or legal proceeding    I believe the SEC would be troubled by this   Thomas said  David Marshall  an attorney with Katz  Marshall   Banks who also represents whistleblowers  agreed   It is a device that is intended to impede   he said  However  Jonathan Tuttle  an attorney at Debevoise   Plimpton who represents companies  said some of the settlements could pass legal muster as they can be interpreted to limit employees from receiving additional personal injury damages  rather than whistleblower awards handed out by the SEC       SETTLEMENT SAMPLE The former employees who signed the settlements all claimed they were terminated or faced other actions after blowing the whistle about alleged securities fraud or other types of corporate misconduct  At least two of the employees had raised their concerns internally  The settlements came about after those employees filed complaints about company retaliation with the U S  Department of Labor  The agreements were obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests by Reuters and by University of Nebraska law professor and interim dean Richard Moberly  About half of them  including the ones used by Wells Fargo  Advanced Micro Devices and Fifth Third Bank  contained restrictions on would be whistleblowers that are similar to those cited in prior SEC enforcement actions  Some of the other settlements did not contain such restrictions or did not involve publicly traded companies covered by the SEC s rules  In the Fifth Third Bank case  the company settled in December 2014 with former employee Joseph Kremer  who claimed he was fired after informing the company of concerns that investors were being misled about the management of certain funds   Fifth Third settled with Kremer for an undisclosed sum without admitting wrongdoing and Kremer s complaint was dismissed by the Department of Labor  Kremer could not be reached for comment  The settlement states that while Kremer is permitted to participate in government investigations  he is prohibited  to the maximum extent permitted by law  from recovering  any individual monetary relief or other individual remedies    The Health Net settlement ran afoul of SEC rules despite using the same phrase  to the maximum extent permitted by law  in waiving the employee s right to a financial award  The Wells Fargo settlement  reached in September 2015  involved a former bank teller named Birinder Kaur Shankar who claimed she was harassed and fired after complaining internally about what she alleged was unethical behavior toward customers  The deal stipulated that she could speak with the SEC  but she had to waive  the right  if any  to recover any monetary or other individual relief of any sort whatsoever  arising from an investigation  except for any individual relief that cannot be waived as a matter of law   In the deal  Wells Fargo denied that it took improper action  The Labor Department dismissed Shankar s complaint  Shankar declined to comment  citing the confidentiality provisions in the settlement  The AMD settlement  struck in December 2012 between the semiconductor company and whistleblower Hishaam Mahmood required him to waive relief awarded by  any governmental agency    It also required him to affirm to AMD he has not filed a charge with any other agency besides the SEC  This line  some attorneys said  could run afoul of the SEC s rules because the regulator prohibits companies from forcing employees to notify company attorneys about their communications with the government  The nature of Mahmood s complaint could not be determined  In the settlement  AMD denied wrongdoing  and the complaint was dismissed  Mahmood could not immediately be located for comment   Tuttle said that employment agreements which require employees to disclose if they have filed complaints or claims with other government agencies could be problematic and probably should be tweaked to avoid any misunderstanding  He added that most such settlements have traditionally been drafted by employment attorneys  rather than by securities attorneys who pay attention to  every syllable that is uttered by the SEC

177791,399307,FITB,Fifth Third Bancorp  FITB  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 90 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 45  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fifth Third 
For Fifth Third  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 73  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fifth Third will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fifth Third would post earnings of  0 59 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 63  delivering a surprise of  6 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fifth Third doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fifth-third-bancorp-fitb-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200440192,200440192

177835,399351,FITB,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Fifth Third  FITB ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this regional bank a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Fifth Third is 7 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 4  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Fifth Third has an S TA ratio of 0 06  which means that the company gets  0 06 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 05  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Fifth Third looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 7 3  this year versus the industry average of 2 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Fifth Third  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Fifth Third has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

177855,399371,FITB,5 Top Bank Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Q1 Earnings,opinion,The first quarter for banks was marked by a more dovish Fed  government shutdown woes and an expected drop in trading revenues  However  corporate tax cuts work in favor of banks  On that note  let s take a look at banks that are likely to come up with encouraging numbers in the first quarter earnings season Fed s Dovish Stance Puts PressureSo far this year  the broader S P 500 has sprung back after a sell off last December  increasing 13 6  and also registering its biggest quarterly jump since 2009  However  the same cannot be said about the financial sector  Major banks  in particular  have underperformed the broader equity market  gaining 10 6  in the said period after dovish comments from the Fed that boosted other sectors became a concern for them  Fed officials agreed on remaining patient with respect to raising rates this year after global growth worries gripped investors  Inflation  by the way  has remained relatively contained  supporting the case for the Fed to hold off further rates  Such accommodative measures  at least for the time being  might dent banks  profits in the first quarter  After all  low interest rates affect bank profits as they decrease the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities Flattening Yield Curve  A NightmareA global slowdown  in fact  affected the 10 year treasury yield  The yield curve inverted on Mar 22  2019  for the first time since 2007  This means that rates for long term bonds  especially  10 year Treasury yields slipped below short term bonds  And in the process  the benchmark bond yield touched a 15 month low in the first quarter The flattening yield curve is certainly bad news for bank stocks  Needless to say  it narrows the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge from consumers  Chuck Carlson  CEO at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond  Indiana  added that bank estimates are currently going down due to the flattening of the yield curve and  there is an underlying concern about loan growth  Shutdown Woes  Drop in Trading

commodities trading are anticipated to drop 15  in the first quarter On the More Positive SideThe tax overhaul  however  has been a boon for banks  The reduction in corporate tax rates to 21  from 35  helped banks  bottom line grow significantly  In fact  banking behemoths collectively reaped more than  9 billion from the tax cut policy during the first nine months of 2018  per analysis by the Wall Street Journal  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon also recently informed investors that bank profits got a big boost last year from corporate tax cuts  And it is widely expected that tax cuts will continue to have a positive impact on bank earnings this quarter Further  an array of initial public offerings  IPO  can be a source of profits for many banks  Analysts also predict that banks in the mobile payments space will report strong results  Also  an increasing number of consumers are adopting financial technology to cover varied expenses 5 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading Into Q1

177881,399397,FITB,Why Fifth Third  FITB  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   This company  which is in the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This regional bank has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 29  
For the most recent quarter  Fifth Third was expected to post earnings of  0 67 per share  but it reported  0 69 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 99   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 63 per share  while it actually produced  0 64 per share  a surprise of 1 59  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Fifth Third  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Fifth Third currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 62   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss

In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Fifth Third looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 5 9  this year versus the industry average of 2 7

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  in Focus
Headquartered in Cincinnati  Fifth Third Bancorp  FITB  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 13 05  so far this year  The regional bank is paying out a dividend of  0 22 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 31  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 83  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 88 is up 18 9  from last year  Fifth Third Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 9 41   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Fifth Third s current payout ratio is 35   This means it paid out 35  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  FITB expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  2 76 per share  with earnings expected to increase 8 51  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  FITB is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-fifth-third-bancorp-fitb-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200395863,200395863

 If you are uncertain about whether to invest your money in bonds or stocks  an important metric that can show you the right path is earnings yield  It is the reciprocal of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  This ratio comes in handy for finding out undervalued stocks  Also  this ratio is effective for comparing stocks with market or fixed income securities  
 Earnings yield can be calculated as  annual earnings per share market price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one with high earnings yield should fetch higher returns  
 This ratio is useful for comparing the performance of the market with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index is higher than the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be said to be undervalued in comparison to bonds  This means that investing in the stock market is a better option for a value investor  
 However  while T bills are devoid of risks  investing in stocks always carries some inherent risks  Hence  it will be prudent to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market

177985,399501,FITB,Fifth Third Bancorp  FITB  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 9

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 47  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fifth Third 
For Fifth Third  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 22  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fifth Third will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fifth Third would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 64  delivering a surprise of  1 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fifth Third doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fifth-third-bancorp-fitb-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200375752,200375752

Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Influence Q4 Results
Steady Net Interest Income Growth  A modest increase in lending   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  and consumer   is expected to have led to improvement in net interest income  NII   A rise in interest rates should provide some support as well  partially offset by flattening of the yield curve in the to be reported quarter 
Management expects NII to be up 2  in the quarter  NIM is projected to expand 2 3 basis points sequentially 
Fee Income Might Rise Slightly  Fifth Third s focus on strengthening its fee income base through the North Star initiatives is likely to have lent support  Moreover  the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter under review  which might have boosted the bank s credit and debit card revenues  However  poor mortgage banking revenues during the quarter are anticipated to have offset the positives to some extent 
For the fourth quarter  the company expects non interest income to be up nearly 2  from the third quarter  Notably  corporate banking revenues are likely to increase considerably on a sequential basis as well 
Expenses Might Flare Up Slightly  Fifth Third s ongoing strategic investments in several areas  such as technology  might escalate expenses  However  the company is expected to have been successful in offsetting this upsurge through its North Star initiatives to some extent

178009,399525,FITB,Bank Stocks In Bear Market  Short Sector With These ETFs ,opinion,"Regional banks slipped into the bear market territory on Dec 4  thanks to flattening of the yield curve  Shares of SunTrust   NYSE STI    Citizens Financial Group   NYSE C    Fifth Third Bancorp   NASDAQ FITB   and Regions Financial Corp    NYSE RF   lost more than 5  on the day as the yield on the benchmark 30 year Treasury bond dropped 11 basis points  bps  to 3 16  and the yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell 8 bps to 2 91  
On the other hand  short term treasury yields rose for one month  two month  three month and six month period  Yields for those terms increased 7 bps  7 bps  4 bps and 2 bps  respectively  on Dec 4 from the earlier day  This led to the flattening of the yield curve   a predominant this year  read    
Investors should note that the U S  Treasury yield curve inverted on Dec 3 and continued the trend   that the recent inversion of the U S  Treasury yield curve hints at the weakening of the economy   As a result  SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF   CO KRE   was down 5 3  on Dec 4 and has  from its all time high reached in June  ensuring a bear market 
Inside the Flattening and Inverse of Yield Curve 
Concerns of an imminent slowdown in economic activity and falling inflation expectations amid Fed policy tightening led to the treasury yield curve pattern and hit bank shares  Actually  the movement of short term bonds is more dependent on Fed behavior than long term bonds  The Fed has enacted three rate hikes this year and is likely to pass the fourth this month 
A hawkish Fed kept pushing short term bond yields higher this year  But geopolitical risks  slowdown in the Euro zone and Japan  still alive U S  Sino trade war tensions and Brexit fears occasionally boosted a flight to safety this year and kept the rise in long term bond yields in check 
Since banks borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  flattening of the yield curve bodes ill for bank ETFs  If the yield curve flattens  net interest rate margins of banks decline  This clearly explains the underperformance of bank ETFs  Also  if the economy wanes  poorer activity and slower loan growth will likely be in the cards 
What About Big Banks 
Not only smaller banks  big banks have been under pressure as well  Shares of Citigroup   NYSE C   and Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   dropped to lows not seen since June 2017  Both stocks lost about 4 5  and 5  on Dec 4  Meanwhile  JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM    Goldman Sachs Group Inc    NYSE GS   and Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   lost 3 8  to 4 5  
What Lies Ahead 
As of now  there is a  of a rate hike in the Fed s December meeting  Probably  markets have been pricing the move and that is why we have noticed a sharp rally in short term yields  But if the Fed comes up with a dovish outlook for 2019  things may change in the coming days  The CME FedWatch Tool already shows a reduction in hawkish expectations  While there was an 84 4  chance of an upcoming rate hike on Dec 3  the probability moved down to 78 4  on the next day

178022,399538,FITB,Regional Banks Get A Tailwind From Congress And The Fed,opinion,"As the markets digest the results of the summit yesterday between President Trump and Kim Jong Un  the basic reaction seems to be  well no reaction   As we await the result of a 2 day meeting of the Federal Reserve this afternoon  the major indexes are all essentially unchanged 
The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  remains near historical lows at 12   suggesting investors are expecting little to no market response to the Fed announcement  It is basically considered a foregone conclusion that they will raise short term interest rates 25 Basis points 
Investors will watch the language in the announcement for clues about a change in the Fed s inflation target and whether there will be 3 or 4 rate hikes in 2018  though the markets seem comfortable with even the more hawkish Fed stance  as the economy is humming along just fine even as rates normalize from the very low levels of the past decade 
Higher U S  rates are largely seen as restrictive to U S  business as they raise borrowing costs and put the brakes on expansion  but one specific business actually benefits  and it s the same industry that recently got a boost from the relaxation of some of the more onerous aspects of Dodd Frank legislation   the Banking Sector 
Small and medium sized banks grnerally benefit the most from rising rates as they tend to have a much bigger portion or their business in traditional deposit and loan business than the bulge bracket banks   whose businesses are also spread across investment banking  brokerage and trading 
Mid sized regional banks also got the most relief as the Dodd Frank threshold for stress testing to determine systemic risk was raised from banks with  50B in assets to banks with  100M  The threshold will be raised to banks with up to  250B in assets  These banks will no longer qualify as Strategically Important Financial Institutions  SIFIs   and will avoid costly and inconvenient compliance reporting 
Fifth Third Bankwith  142B in assets stands to directly benefit from the reduced regulation and rising rates  Analyst expectations for earnings at Fifth Third have been rising  with 13 upward revisions in the past 60 days  Now expected to earn  2 48 share in 2018  FITB is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
In it s most recent quarterly report  Fifth Third reported a relatively flat portfolio of loans and leases  but improving credit quality with declining charge offs and non performing assets at 0 36  and 0 55  respectively and a comfortable level of Reserve coverage of 1 24   which equals a Reserve to Non Performing Loans  RNP  ratio of 252  
Associated Banc Corp  is a regional bank holding company with diverse operations primarily in the Midwest  ASB services over a million customer accounts in 8 states and has grown loan volume by an average of 10  over the past four years while keeping Loan to Deposit Ratio under 100  

An increasing portfolio of loans and deposits and increasing margins have fueled earnings growth at ASB which has posted eight consecutive earnings beats   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 now stads at  1 96 share   an increase of 29  over 2017  Associated Banc Corp is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
In addition to strong organic growth  ASB is poised to benefit from rising rates  a strong dollar and regulation reform and is among the strongest regional banks in the U S

178049,399565,FITB,Why Is Fifth Third  FITB  Down 4 1  Since Its Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Fifth Third Bancorp   NASDAQ FITB    Shares have lost about 4 1  in that time frame 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is FITB due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Fifth Third Beats on Q1 Earnings  Provisions DeclineFifth Third reported first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 57 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents  The adjusted figure excludes the net positive impact of gains from the Vantiv merger with WorldPay and charges related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap and adjustment to litigation reserves Results reflect increase in revenues along with significant decline in provisions  Expanding net interest margin and rising loans balance remain key positives  Strong capital position acted as a tailwind  However  increase in expenses was an undermining factor Net income available to common shareholders came in at  689 million or 97 cents per share compared with  290 million or 38 cents per share as of Mar 31  2017 Higher Revenues Partly Offset by Rise in ExpensesTotal adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at  1 55 billion  The reported figure was up 5 2  year over year Fifth Third s net interest income  tax equivalent  came in at  999 million  up 6  year over year  The rise was primarily driven by higher short term market rates and an increase in investment portfolio balances Net interest margin expanded 16 basis points  bps  to 3 18   mainly due to improved short term market rates However  non interest income increased 74  year over year to  909 million  including certain non recurring items   Excluding significant items  non interest income was up 3  to  553 million  Notably  the quarter witnessed a rise in corporate banking  card and processing fees and mortgage banking revenues Also  non interest expenses climbed 6  year over year to  1 05 billion  Higher compensation expenses  technology and equipment expenses were offset by lower card processing expenses As of Mar 31  2018  average loan and lease balances were almost stable sequentially at  92 3 billion  Average total deposits increased slightly from the previous quarter to  103 5 billion Credit Quality ImprovesTotal non performing assets  including loans held for sale  were  528 million  down 27 7  from the year ago quarter  Further  total allowance for credit losses was  1 29 billion  down 7 7  from the prior year quarter Moreover  provision for loan and lease losses decreased 69  year over year to  23 million  Net losses charge offs for the quarter came in at  81 million or 36 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis compared with  89 million or 40 bps in the prior year quarter Strong Capital PositionFifth Third remained well capitalized in the quarter  Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 11 95  compared with 11 90  at the end of the prior year quarter  CET1 capital ratio  fully phased in  was 10 82  compared with 10 76  at the end of the year ago quarter  However  tier 1 leverage ratio was 10 11  compared with 10 15  in the prior year quarter OutlookNII is expected to be in the range of  1 025  1 030 billion in second quarter 2018  NIM is projected to rise 3 5 bps  sequentially  For 2018  NII will likely be in the range of  4 14  4 16 billion  NIM is anticipated to be between 3 22  and 3 24   with two rate hikes  June and December  For the second quarter  the company expects non interest income to be  575 585 million  up nearly 5  from the first quarter  Notably  corporate banking revenues are likely to increase 20 25  sequentially  For 2018  non interest income is anticipated to be  2 35 billion  excluding Worldpay step up gain For the second quarter  the company expects non interest expenses to decline 2  sequentially  For 2018  non interest expenses are predicted to be  4  4 1 billion  including the impact of the minimum wage increase and the impact of lower taxes on LIH amortization  Further  positive operating leverage is expected again in 2018 Commercial loans and leases are expected to inch up 1 1 5  in the second quarter and around 4  year over year in 2018  including the impact of the run off of national leasing business  Around 1 1 5  year over year growth and 3  growth  excluding auto balances  is projected for consumer loans in 2018  Moreover  in the second quarter  consumer loans are expected to rise 1  sequentially Investment portfolio balances are estimated to remain relatively stable in the second quarter Notably  end of period commercial leases will likely decline  400 million by the end of 2018  Also  management expects total loan production to be around  4 billion by the end of 2018 Management continues to expect card balances to grow in the mid  to high single digits in 2018  Further  personal lending balances are likely to grow to  2 billion by fourth quarter 2019 from around  1 billion at the end of first quarter 2018 Management expects provision reflective of loan growth and net charge offs to be range bound with some quarterly volatility The effective tax rate is projected to be about 16 25 16 75  in 2018  including the impact from the Worldpay step up gain  Beyond 2018  the tax rate is anticipated to be about 15 5  Project North Star InitiativesIn September 2016  Fifth Third launched Project North Star  which laid down several long term financial targets without expecting any improvement in the current economic conditions  The initiatives are expected to enhance revenue growth  lower expenses and optimize balance sheet position Management expects to generate an annualized return on average tangible common equity  non GAAP  at the upper end of a range of 14  to 16   a return on average assets at the mid to upper end of a range of 1 35  to 1 45  and an efficiency ratio below 60  by the end of 2019

this indicates an improving economy  it raised fears of rise in inflation  in turn  reinforcing assumptions of a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates Additionally  a two year budget deal announced by top senators will likely further strengthen the economy  thus giving the Fed all the more reason to raise rates  This also drove up the bond yields While indications of an improving

178263,399779,FITB,Direct Line Of Funding Warnings Show Up In Corporate Credit,opinion,"One of the consequences of last year s junk bond blowup was  unsurprisingly  a dramatic decline in high yield gross issuance  The numbers were pretty stark  According to SIFMA  high yield gross issuance in Q1 was 60  less than Q1 2015  following Q4 which was 47  below Q4 2014 
As the market has come back since March  for all sorts of reasons including Mario Draghi  issuance has  as well   but not to the same sort of condition as before  In other words  volume is only relatively better than the worst months 
Gross junk issuance in June 2016 is preliminarily figured to have been  24 billion  higher than the  21 7 billion in June 2015 but significantly less than the nearly  30 billion floated in June 2014  These tough comparisons underscore the nature of not just the depth of market effects  but really the prolonged period of irregularity 
For Q2 overall  junk bond issuance was still 8  less than the same quarter in 2015  Again  that is better than the near collapse of Q1  but not anything like full restoration let alone making up for a lost year 



From the annual figures  you can clearly see that junk bonds have struggled since 2013  The  rising dollar  hasn t been kind to this part of the credit market  an obvious economic problem given that the huge burst in issuance starting in 2012 offered at least some marginal  artificial  support to the economy 
As issuance slowed in 2014  especially later in that year  it is likely more than coincidence that seemingly steady and slow economic growth gave up to slow and steady contraction  especially in manufacturing and industry 
But as much as junk bonds are  rightly  emphasized  it may be that investment grade corporate issuance suggests the next stage of destabilization in credit  Since last summer  IG volume has also dropped off  And though the estimated gross for May 2016 was the highest in years  overall in Q2 total issuance was down slightly compared to Q2 2015  when 10 20  growth in IG volume had become seemingly normal 
With three consecutive quarters now of below trend totals  it seems reasonable to assume that there are deeper corporate credit problems than just the junk bubble 



It is more good evidence that  something  changed in the middle of last year  meaning a durable or even permanent deviation from the prior trend  Given the early estimates for June issuance filling out Q2  we can also reasonably infer that despite the seemingly more  outwardly  benign conditions in the past few months after the end of the last liquidation wave  dollar  run  they were not representative of a true inflection or turnaround back toward pre summer 2015 operation 
We have suspected as much all along  especially since the more fundamental indications of eurodollar liquidity and capacity did not participate in the relief to nearly the same extent as stocks or oil prices  In some places  such as eurodollar futures  the warning of  dollar  condition hasn t much changed  if at all  from the low of February 11 
The issuance figures seem to confirm that view in the vital connection between liquidity or funding to credit to the real economy  or  as may be in the case of IG corporate debt  stock prices through buybacks  
This drawdown also seems to have extended into at least some parts of the banking system  as well  The Wall Street Journal  that ABS issuance was off 37   again including Q2  not just Q1 

America s shadow banking system slowed sharply through the end of June  with the value of bonds backed by personal  corporate and real estate loans falling  98 billion from the first half of 2015 
The resulting drop off in issuance is roughly equal to the volume of loans that Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   one of the country s largest regional banks  has on its balance sheet  according to data provider SNL Financial  It represents another weight on an economy already notable for weak business investment 

There are several possible explanations  including first the liquidations themselves  Disruptive volatility in isolation may cause only temporary pause  but repeated volatility can turn off financial interest entirely  I also have to believe that the nature of especially the second liquidation was confirming of suspicions that had been forming throughout this  rising dollar  period 
In other words  central bank promises had alarmingly fallen short or even unwound in real economic conditions that looked nothing like what was  supposed  to have been delivered by effective monetary policy  That has very real implications not just for the economy  but especially credit markets as a whole and modeled projections for both the credit and default cycles 
The further erosion  of  would only add to any reluctance of the market to absorb forever increasing supply  whether junk or IG  The same effect on the liquidity system would also be a related and similar negative factor in what might be a durable alteration to such aggregate risk appetite 

The similarities between the  rising dollar  period of the post 2012 slowdown and the monetary eurodollar irregularities of 2007 08 are astounding  The primary difference  however  seems to be pace  In the earlier crisis period  events conspired in condensed fashion to create a cascading financial effect that quickly and sharply imperiled the global economy 
This time  however  the financial blows are spaced further apart  but are no less relentless and concerning  It is  almost  a slow motion crash with plenty of time in between specific events to question why it might not be what it so easily seems  All the same elements are clicking into their unwelcome but familiar places  they are just doing so at a frustratingly leisurely pace 
This lack of follow through urgency may be in good part misleading  especially since it allows policymakers and the mainstream to continue to treat each episode as unrelated and distinct  almost  regular  randomness  In fact  they are all related if drawn out warnings about further financial and economic deterioration 
There is a direct line between June 2014 repo irregularities and October 15  2014  January 15  2015  the events of last August  the events of January February and now the continuing or even escalating negative pressures 
From the narrow standpoint of corporate credit and gross issuance  these estimates do suggest just that kind of escalation  especially given that Q2 was supposed to have been appreciably better than Q1 
Again  liquidity and funding market indications were never possessed with so much exuberance after February 11 and the PBOC s  dollar  injections  leaving the past few months to be properly classified as only the absence of further disorder and liquidation rather than meaningful retracement or systemic rebound ",2016-07-10,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC","https://www.investing.com/analysis/direct-line-of-funding-warnings-show-up-in-corporate-credit,-particularl-200140931",200140931

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for this week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed last Friday which  heading into the last week of 2014  sees the equity markets looking positive  with a possible major rotation into small caps under way  Elsewhere look for Gold to bounce hold between 1180 and 1200 in its downtrend while oil builds a base near 55  The dollar looks to continue higher while US Treasuries are biased lower in the short run  within their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite sits at resistance but with a strong look and could just keep moving up while  ARCA Emerging Markets  are biased to the upside in their downtrend  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s  ARCA SPY   ARCA IWM   and  NASDAQ QQQ   despite the moves higher  Their charts look solid as the SPY sits at all time highs and the QQQ at 14 year highs  The IWM may be breaking a 14 month range to the upside  which could trigger a major rotation into small caps  Use this information as you prepare for this coming week and trad em well

178294,399810,FITB,Fifth Third Bancorp Looks Good,opinion,"Fifth Harmony has nothing to do with Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   but if they were smart they would find a way to work the girl group into their plan  They are an interesting company as they have bought up almost every derivation of 5 and 3 websites to direct traffic to their site 
The stock had a good run higher in 2015 until reaching a consolidation zone in June  The market sell off hit it hard  dropping the price over 10  before a bounce late last week  Through that it made a higher low to go with the higher high near 22  On a Measured Move that would project to a high at 22 85 
The RSI is climbing again too  In fact on a broad scale there is now a Positive RSI Reversal in play against that January low that reinforces the 22 85 target  The MACD also turned back high off the low and is losing in on a positive cross  The stock sits at the 200 day SMA going into the week and in the lower half of the Bollinger Bands   And it has short interest under 2  
Looking at the options chains the September Expiry has large open interest on the Put side above at 21 and the Call Side at 22  These could draw the stock higher into expiration  In October contracts are just starting to build with the preference being the 18 Strike Put  possibly as protection and the 20 Strike Call  The October Strike expires the day after the expected earnings report on the 15th 
Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock with a stop at 19 30  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the September 20 Calls  58 cents   A defined risk method to participate in an upward move 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the September 20 bullish Risk Reversal  2 cents   Adds leverage and risk of ownership at 20 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the stock with a October 18 21 Collar  3 cent credit   An entry to the stock with protection for earnings 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed  Friday which  heading into the unofficial last week of Summer sees the equity markets have dodged a bullet  but still need to prove they have the strength to continue and not get pulled lower 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue to bounce in its downtrend while crude oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index is biased to the upside in consolidation while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both look to continue their bounce in the downtrends  and may turn into reversals 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s  NYSE SPY    NYSE IWM  and  NASDAQ QQQ   despite their rebounds higher  Their charts all show signs of both promise to the upside but further risk or another turn lower  Best to keep all long trades on a tight leash  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
