131606,353121,CMI,Watchdog report faults EPA efforts to eliminate pollution rules for some trucks,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration failed to do a cost benefit analysis to assess air quality or take into account the impact on children s health when it sought to eliminate pollution limits on heavy duty trucks with rebuilt engines  according to a report from an EPA watchdog on Thursday 
The Environmental Protection Agency s Office of Inspector General also faulted the EPA for failing to keep adequate records of the discussions and said the White House Office of Management and Budget  OMB  impeded the inspector general and refused to turn over some requested information 
The vehicles known as  glider trucks  have a used engine  transmission and rear axle in a new chassis and cab assembly  Under rules finalized under former U S  President Barack Obama in 2016  nearly all heavy duty trucks must use more efficient  less polluting engines as the glider trucks would effectively be phased out by 2021  The glider trucks emit up to 450 times more diesel particulate matter and up to 43 times more smog forming nitrogen oxides than new trucks  the EPA has said 
Then EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt directed that the repeal rule be completed as  quickly as possible  and not to complete a cost and benefit analysis required for  economically significant  regulatory actions  the report said  EPA  which said the 2016 rules would result up to  14 billion in health benefits  has since listed the issue as  economically significantly  in regulatory documents 
Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Tom Udall said in a joint statement the report shows  Pruitt secretly orchestrated a legally and scientifically flawed process to undo protections against dirty glider trucks  a move that would undermine decades of clean air progress largely for the benefit of one politically connected company  
EPA told the inspector general s office it anticipated making a decision about whether it will move ahead with the repeal in 2020  The EPA told the office it is  committed to the transparency of the rulemaking process and believes that public input is critical to improving regulations   but declined to comment further 
OMB spokesman Chase Jennings said it  does not release deliberative information from the interagency review process  and said it  provided appropriate information  to the inspector general 
The Environmental Defense Fund said the  EPA flagrantly and knowingly violated the law as it tried to ram through a loophole to allow more super polluting  glider  freight trucks onto America s roads  
Volvo Group North America   Cummins Inc   NYSE CMI  and Navistar International Corp told EPA in 2017 they opposed efforts to reverse glider trucks limits as it could hurt their industry 
The EPA previously said if gliders were allowed through 2025  they would make up 5  of freight trucks on the road but account for 33  of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the U S  heavy truck fleet ",2019-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/watchdog-report-faults-epa-efforts-to-eliminate-pollution-rules-for-some-trucks-2035200,2035200
131607,353122,CMI,Volkswagen attracts bids for MAN Energy Solutions unit  sources,news,"FRANKFURT  Reuters    Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  has attracted bids from Europe s Innio  Japan s Mitsubishi Heavy  T 7011  and U S  based Cummins  N CMI  for its MAN Energy Solutions  which makes diesel engines for ships and power generators  people close to the matter said 
Innio  formerly known as Jenbacher and owned by buyout group Advent  as well as the two other bidders last week made bids for the VW unit  which could have a valuation of 1 5 2 billion euros   1 7  2 2 billion  in a potential sale  they said 
Other bidders such as Hyundai Heavy  KS 267250  are no longer in the running  they added 
The divestment is part of Volkswagen s efforts to slim down and simplify the group which has 12 brands  trucks  buses  motorbikes  cars and electric bicycles as part of its business 
While the car maker is not running a formal auction process it is expected that the bidders may be asked to submit final offers at the end of February  the sources said 
Volkswagen  which has offered to retain a significant minority in the business  declined to comment  The bidders declined to comment or had no immediate comment 
The business  formerly known as MAN Diesel   Turbo  also makes turbochargers used in the oil   gas industry and in 2018 reported operating earnings of 133 million euros on sales of 3 1 billion euros 
This year  MAN Energy Solutions is expected to post roughly 200 million euros in earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  one of the people said 
Cummins trades at 7 7 times its expected core earnings  while  Caterpillar   N CAT  trades at 9 3 times and Wartsila  HE WRT1V  trades at 9 8 times 
 MAN Energy Solution s value has been in decline following years of years of underinvestment   one of the sources said  adding the industry s margins have come under pressure as demand from power plants has waned with the switch to more renewable energy sources 
Peers often specialize in just part of the unit s product range which includes 2 stroke engines  4 stroke engines and turbochargers  limiting interest  the sources added 
Volkswagen has struggled to slim down in the past after the company s works council  which has veto powers over major restructuring  blocked efforts to sell motorbike brand Ducati 
MAN Energy Solutions was originally a part of VW s trucks brand MAN  but some of MAN s assets were transferred to Volkswagen last year as part of efforts to streamline Traton ahead of the unit s listing

131608,353123,CMI,U S  weekly jobless claims fall  but labor market cooling,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    New applications for U S  jobless benefits fell more than expected last week  but the labor market appears to be cooling  with the number of Americans on unemployment rolls surging to more than a 1 1 2 year high at the end of 2019  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9 000 to a seasonally adjusted 214 000 for the week ended Jan  4  the Labor Department said on Thursday  The fourth straight weekly decline saw claims almost unwinding the jump in early December  which was blamed on a later than normal Thanksgiving Day   Jobless claims have returned to normal levels  showing the labor market is in a good place   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 220 000 in the latest week  The claims data was volatile in late 2019  with applications dropping to 203 000 at the end of November and shooting up to 252 000 in early December   The four week moving average of initial claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  fell 9 500 to 224 000 last week  U S  financial markets were little moved by the data as politics dominated sentiment  Stocks on Wall Street rose  with the main indexes hitting record highs after the United States and Iran moved away from an all out conflict  The dollar  DXY  gained versus a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury prices fell  But the labor market could be losing momentum  The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid vaulted by 75 000 to 1 80 million for the week ended Dec  28  the highest level since April 2018  The weekly increase was the largest since November 2015   The four week moving average of the so called continuing claims rose 33 000 to 1 74 million  Some of the surge in continuing claims could be related to year end volatility    The continuing claims data also may exhibit some volatility around the holiday season  but the trend in the data appears to have weakened over the past month or so   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York   PAYROLLS IN FOCUS Labor market strength is helping to keep the economy on a moderate growth pace despite a deepening downturn in manufacturing  The White House s 18 month trade war with China has sapped business confidence and undercut capital expenditure  Though Washington and Beijing in December hammered out a  Phase 1  trade deal  considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement  which is expected to be signed next week   The U S  government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 164 000 jobs in December  While that would be a step down from November s robust gain of 266 000  the anticipated pace would still be well above the roughly 100 000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population  The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged near a 50 year low of 3 5   The Federal Reserve last month signaled interest rates could remain unchanged at least through this year  The Fed lowered borrowing costs three times in 2019   Minutes of the U S  central bank s Dec  10 11 policy meeting published last week showed officials  generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity  strong labor market conditions   though some viewed next month s expected downgrade to employment growth as an indication the labor market was cooling  The government last August estimated the economy created 501 000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported  the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade  That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170 000 per month instead of 210 000  The revised payrolls data will be published on Feb  7  
 It is not clear what the data since then will look like  but we suspect more recent job growth could be revised down   said Kevin Cummins  NYSE CMI   senior U S  economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford  Connecticut ",2020-01-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-but-labor-market-momentum-waning-2055912,2055912

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by  and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Cummins Inc  Earnings Teleconference   Operator Instructions I would now like to hand the call over to Executive Director of Investor Relations  James Hopkins James Hopkins    Executive Director of Investor RelationsThank you  Good morning  everyone  and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins  results for the fourth quarter of 2019  Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Tom Linebarger  our Chief Financial Officer  Mark Smith  and our President and Chief Operating Officer  Tony Satterthwaite  We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference  Before we start  please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  Such statements express our forecasts  expectations  hopes  beliefs  and intentions on strategies regarding the future Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission  particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10 K and any subsequent filed quarterly reports on Form 10 Q  During the course of this call  we will be discussing certain non GAAP financial measures  and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures  Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today s webcast presentation are available on our website at  under the heading of Investors and Media And with that out of the way  we ll begin with our Chairman and CEO  Tom Linebarger Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  James  Good morning  everybody  I ll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2020  Mark will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year  The company implemented several measures to reduce costs and improve future performance in the second half of 2019  In the third quarter  we announced our decision to end production of certain underperforming product lines and as demand fell in the fourth quarter  we moved quickly to execute a number of additional actions to lower our cost structure resulting in a  119 million pre tax or  90 million after tax restructuring charge  Global headcount reduction actions covered by this charge began in the fourth quarter and most were completed by the end of January  We expect to realize savings from the restructuring and other actions of  250 million to  300 million  as we discussed at our Analyst Day in November  The actions we have taken will mitigate an expected slowdown in revenues in 2020 and position the company for stronger performance as market demand improves We will continue our investments in new technologies and new product launches in 2020 as we have in prior periods of lower demand  which we believe will continue to improve our strategic position in the industry and sustain our profitable growth  As always  we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the economic cycle  Now let me summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and comment on key drivers within each business  All references to EBITDA and EBITDA percent exclude restructuring charges  Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 were  5 6 billion  a decrease of 9  compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  with declines in most major markets outside of China  EBITDA was  682 million or 12 2  compared to  896 million or 14 6  a year ago  EBITDA decreased as a percentage of sales due to the impact of lower volumes and an increase in research and engineering expenses to support new product development in our core business as well as in our New Power segment  These impacts were partially offset by strong material cost reduction activities and improved pricing  For the full year  Cummins sales were  23 6 billion  down 1  year over year Our EBITDA margins were 15 8  compared to 14 6  in 2018 due to lower warranty costs  improved pricing and material cost reduction activities  and partially offset by lower volumes  the impact of higher tariffs and increased investment in research and development  EBITDA dollars were a record  3 7 billion  and operating cash flow was a record  3 2 billion  We lowered inventory by over  400 million in the second half of the year  and our strong operating cash flow supported the return of a record  2 billion in cash to shareholders in 2019  In our Engine business  sales decreased by 5  in 2019  Lower demand in the Chinese light commercial vehicle market  North American and European construction markets and the global bus market were partially offset by higher demand for pickup trucks in North America  Heavy  and medium duty truck revenues in North America were flat compared to 2018  EBITDA was 14 6  compared to 13 7  in 2018  with the negative impact of lower volumes more than offset by lower warranty  improved pricing and material cost reduction activities  Sales for our Distribution grew    business grew by 3  in 2019 Increased demand in North America and China  driven by higher sales of gensets to data center customers  was partially offset by lower demand for engines in construction and oil and gas markets  Full year EBITDA increased to 8 6  compared to 7 2  in 2018  Technical Issues  costs  partially offset by the impact of a strong U S  dollar and currency volatility in Africa  Full year revenues for the Components segment declined by 4  due to lower truck production in India and in Europe  EBITDA was 16 2  compared to 14 4  in 2018  The increase in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower warranty costs and the benefit of material cost reduction programs  which offset increased investment in the development of new products to meet advancing emission standards in China and India as well as the impact of lower volumes  Power Systems sales decreased by 4  in 2019  Demand for power generation equipment was down 3   with higher demand for power generation equipment in data center and military markets more than offset by lower demand in RV markets and for backup power in the Middle East  Latin America  Africa and China  Demand for engines and industrial applications declined by 8  driven by lower demand in oil and gas and mining markets  EBITDA was 11 7  compared to 13 3  in 2018  Power Systems revenue and EBITDA margins were below our expectations in the fourth quarter  EBITDA was negatively impacted by a  15 million charge to exit the business in Africa  part of a broader effort to improve profitability in that region  as well as higher warranty costs In addition  orders declined in multiple segments in the fourth quarter  especially in parts sales  due to lower engine rebuild volumes  negatively impacting both revenue and profits  In our New Power business  full year EBITDA was a loss of  148 million  in line with our forecast  We continue our investments in key technology areas for the future and building out our product offerings to target markets and applications most suitable to electric and fuel cell power  Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2019  starting with North America and then I ll comment on some of our largest international markets  Our revenues in North America increased 3  in 2019 primarily due to higher demand for pickup trucks and power generation equipment  Sales in medium and heavy duty truck markets were flat compared to 2018 while sales of engines to construction and oil and gas markets declined  Industry production of heavy duty trucks increased to 303 000 units  an increase of 6  from 2018 levels  Industry production remained strong for the first half of the year  supported by a record industry backlog  However  as truck orders remained weak and the industry backlog declined  OEMs began lowering truck builds in the third quarter and once again lowered production in the fourth quarter  Our market share for the full year was 32   down two percentage points from 2018 as OEMs prioritized production of their own engines when making cuts to production in the second half of the year The market size for medium duty trucks was 138 000 units in 2019  representing another strong year of demand  We maintained our clear leadership in the market with full year market share of 80   2019 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in North America  We shipped 148 000 engines to our pickup truck customers in 2019  including the highest number of engines for Ram pickups in over 10 years  During the third quarter  we decided to end production of our ISV 5 liter engine  which was primarily sold to Nissan for use in pickup truck applications  Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 5   While nonresidential construction spending remained high  we saw industry participants take steps to reduce their equipment inventory in the second half of the year  Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America decreased by 38  from last year  with lower demand from oil and gas customers  partially offset by increased shipments to mining customers  Power Generation revenues increased by 4  year over year driven by demand for military applications and data center customers  Our international revenues declined 6  in 2019  Full year revenues in China  including joint ventures  were  5 5 billion  up 4   The increased revenue was driven by market share gains in the medium  and heavy duty truck market as well as the impact of our new JAC joint venture with sales of  237 million in its first full year of operation Industry demand for medium  and heavy duty trucks in China decreased by 1  from record levels experienced in 2018  ahead of our expectation three months ago and driven by increased incentives to scrap NS3 trucks  Within the truck market  construction related dump truck sales declined 16  in 2019  while nonconstruction related truck sales increased by 6   Our market share improved to 14 8  this year from 12 7  in 2018  The light duty market in China declined 1  in 2019  OEMs accelerated the launch of new truck models in light of the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations that began in the second quarter  resulting in end users increasing truck part purchases  Our share ended the year 8 1   in line with our guidance and up 2 6  from 2018  Industry demand for excavators set another record of 236 000 units in 2019  an increase of 16  from 2018 levels  Our market share ended the year at 14   flat with 2018  In our Power Systems market  demand for power generation equipment in China was flat for the year  with lower demand for standby power offset by growth in data center markets  Increased investment in domestic fracking resulted in higher sales of oil and gas engines in 2019  increasing from  17 million to  72 million in the year  Full year revenues in India  including joint ventures  was  1 6 billion  a 19  decrease driven by both a weak economy and reduced credit availability  Industry truck production declined by 29  in 2019  and construction demand declined 34   Power Generation revenues increased in 2019  partly due to increased demand in data center markets In Brazil  truck production increased 8  compared to 2018 with strong growth in domestic demand  partially offset by lower exports primarily to Argentina  Our revenues declined 9  for the year with increased truck production in the market offset by the impact of Ford exiting the Brazil truck market last year  Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2020 and then comment on individual regions and end markets  We are forecasting total company revenues for 2020 to be down between 8  and 12  from 2019 driven by a decrease in heavy  and medium duty truck production in North America  Europe  China and India  We also expect that construction  mining and oil and gas markets will experience double digit declines in 2020 and power generation markets will decline 5  to 10   Industry production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 185 000 units in 2020  a 40  decrease year over year  The industry enters 2020 with a backlog of 123 000 units  less than half the 297 000 units when entering 2019 as order rates were consistently below truck production throughout the year  We expect orders to remain weak in 2020 with continued weak freight activity resulting in excess capacity and lower used truck market prices  We expect our market share to be flat with 2019 at 32  In the medium duty truck market  we expect the market size to be 123 000 units  a 20  decrease from 2019 after several years of strong demand  We expect our market share to be in the range of 75  to 80   Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are also expected to be down 10  compared to a very strong 2019  In China  we project domestic revenues  including joint ventures  to be down 7  in 2020  we currently project a 10  reduction in heavy  and medium duty truck demand and flat demand in the light duty truck market  We expect our market share in medium  and heavy duty trucks to be in the range of 14  to 15  in 2020  flat with 2019 and 2  higher than it was in 2018  Our share in the light duty truck is expected to be 8  to 9   flat with 2019  Industry volumes of NS VI products will increase modestly in 2020  primarily in light duty applications as city used vehicles move to NS VI standards in July of this year  followed by all remaining diesel vehicles in July of 2021  We first met standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago when we have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies to develop a range of products for Chinese markets that we expect to be well received by end users  Industry sales of excavators are expected to decline 25  from record levels in 2019 These are    it is expected that our industry as well as others will experience supply chain disruptions and loss of revenues in the first quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak  We have significant operations in Hubei province where Wuhan is located  including manufacturing and technical facilities that have been impacted by extended closures  We are monitoring the situation in China very closely to ensure the safety of our employees and their families and to minimize any impact on our operations and our customers  We are also monitoring any impact on our global supply chain by Chinese suppliers and taking precautionary actions wherever possible  In India  we project total revenue  including joint ventures  to increase 15  in 2020  and we expect industry demand for trucks to decline 5  in 2020 after a 29  decline last year  Truck production will remain at very low levels in the first quarter as OEMs reduce truck inventories ahead of the planned implementation of Bharat Stage VI standards in April  We expect demand will remain low immediately following the launch of BS VI vehicles but will increase in the second half of the year  BS VI represents a significant content opportunity for Cummins in India  and we expect to increase sales of after treatment systems by over  200 million in 2020  offsetting continued low demand across Indian domestic end markets With the transition to BS VI  we expect to maintain our market share leadership with our longtime partner  Tata  and begin selling after treatment systems to a new local customer for our Components business  We project our major global high horsepower markets will decline in 2020  Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to decline by 40  in 2020  In North America  sales continue to be impacted by fleet replacement that occurred in 2018 and the lack of new oil well drilling  In China  we expect to see lower demand as the industry absorbs the record amount of equipment purchased in 2019  Sales of mining engines are expected to decline by 20  in 2020  with lower demand in Russia and China primarily driven by lower demand for and investment in thermal coal  Demand in power generation markets is expected to decline 5  to 10  driven by lower global economic growth and lower demand from data center customers where we see construction that was originally planned for this year slipping into 2021  In summary  we expect full year sales to be down 8  to 12  and EBITDA to be in the range of 14 2  to 15 2  of sales  representing a 25  decremental margin in our base business We expect cost savings from our restructuring activities  material cost reductions and increased pricing will partially offset the impact of lower volumes and increased variable compensation costs  Before I hand it over to Mark  who will discuss our financial results in more detail  I d like to take a few minutes to share some of the progress that s been made in our New Power segment  which completed its second full year of operations last year  In 2019  we delivered full electric powertrains to both the school bus and transit bus markets  These buses are not prototypes  but are full production units for commercial use  For example  our first fully electric bus with our partner GILLIG went into service in Santa Monica  California in the fourth quarter  Our Distribution business is providing service and support for these electrified buses as well as supporting the same customers with their existing natural gas and diesel fleets  We also announced Kalmar as a partner in the first electric terminal tractor market in 2019 and with production expected to begin in early 2021  We also announced several programs with end user partners to deliver electric prototype vehicles for their use in testing  including the United States Postal Service  There are currently over 200 fully electrified vehicles with Cummins New Power Systems in the hands of our customers today At the North American Commercial Vehicle Show in October  we unveiled the Cummins PowerDrive  a flexible hybrid architecture  which seamlessly shifts between pure electric for environmentally sensitive areas with a 50 mile range and hybrid for jobs requiring more than 300 miles range  The PowerDrive system can be combined with various sizes of diesel or natural gas engines and battery pack outputs  providing our on highway customers with the flexibility needed to meet the demands of their diverse jobs and markets  We completed our acquisition of Hydrogenics last year  adding additional fuel cell and hydrogen production capabilities to our New Power portfolio  Within 60 days of closing the acquisition  we showed a fuel cell powered truck at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show and are seeing significant interest in fuel cell technology in both on  and off highway markets  The inclusion of hydrogen production technology as part of the Hydrogenics acquisition positions us well to support customers looking to utilize hydrogen fuel cells because lack of access to hydrogen is a significant pacing factor in fuel cell adoption While we are investing in our New Power segment  we are also continuing to invest in diesel and natural gas powertrains  In North America  we now provide three natural gas engines that meet CARB s offshore low NOx standard of 0 02 grams per brake horsepower hour  a 90  reduction from the current EPA limit of 0 2 grams  We launched our first natural gas variant of our Hedgehog engine platform  a 78 liter for power generation applications  in 2019  And this year  we will launch several new on highway natural gas platforms in China  Investments in diesel technology continue to drive improved fuel economy for customers as well as lower emissions  In 2019  we launched the company s new X15 Efficiency Series  which meets 2021 greenhouse gas standards and delivers up to 5  better fuel economy  In India  we ll launch all our new BS VI engines and after treatment systems in 2020  driving over  200 million in incremental revenue for the company and lowering NOx by 50  and particulate matter by over 80   We will launch NS VI products in China over the next 18 months in preparation for full adoption in July of next year  As you can see  we are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions  from diesel and natural gas to fuel cells  hybrid and fully electric options  We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be the leader in power for commercial industrial equipment Now let me turn it over to Mark Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Good morning  Thank you  Tom  I ll begin with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and then the full year before moving on to our outlook for 2020  As we already discussed  we recorded restructuring charges in the fourth quarter totaling  119 million pre tax or  90 million after tax  and we expect to realize annual savings from the restructuring and other actions in the range of  250 million to  300 million  In order to provide clarity on our operational performance  I m excluding the impact of this restructuring in my following comments  Fourth quarter revenues were  5 6 billion  a decrease of 9  from a year ago  Sales in North America declined 8  and international revenues decreased 10   Currency negatively impacted revenues by 1   Earnings before interest and taxes  depreciation and amortization was  682 million or 12 2  of sales for the quarter compared to  896 million or 14 6  of sales a year ago  EBITDA decreased by  214 million driven by the negative impact of lower sales  higher warranty costs and lower joint venture income  Warranty costs were in line with our expectations but were higher than the very tough comparison a year ago Gross margin of  1 3 billion or 23 5  of sales decreased by  233 million or 1 7  driven largely by the impact of lower volumes and  to a lesser extent  increased warranty costs  all of which more than offset the benefits from favorable pricing  material cost reduction and lower variable compensation expense  Our selling  administrative and research costs of  903 million increased by  16 million year over year  Selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  11 million  while research expenditures increased by  27 million driven primarily by new product development in the Engine  Components and New Power segments  partially offset by lower variable compensation expense  Joint venture income declined by 50     5 million primarily due to a noncash impairment of a joint venture in Africa within our Power Systems segment  Other income of  20 million improved by  16 million primarily due to better returns on the investments that underpin our nonqualified benefit plans  Due to market volatility in the fourth quarter of 2018  we incurred  24 million of mark to market losses within other income  Net earnings for the quarter were  390 million or  2 56 per diluted share compared to  579 million or  3 63 a year ago  We also incurred after tax expenses of  22 million or  0 14 per share related to actions taken to cease development and production of certain products in North America and our planned exit of the joint venture inAfrica within Power Systems  all of which will benefit future financial performance  The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19 5   Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was strong  an inflow of  838 million  down from last year due to lower earnings  which more than offset lower working capital  Now I ll comment on individual segment performance in the fourth quarter before moving on to the full year  Revenues for the Engine segment declined by 15  driven by weaker truck demand in North America and lower construction sales in North America and Asia  EBITDA was 12 1   down from 14 6  a year ago  due to the impact of lower revenues  which more than offset positive pricing and lower material costs  Distribution sales declined 1  year over year  Growth in Power Generation sales offset weaker demand from oil and gas and construction customers leaving organic growth about flat  And stronger U S  dollar negatively impacted revenues by 1   EBITDA improved to 8  from 6 8  a year ago due to the benefits of positive pricing and other operational improvements particularly in North America Revenues for the Components segment declined by 12  due to weaker truck demand in North America  Europe and India  which more than offset growth in China  EBITDA was 13 4  compared to 15 7  a year ago primarily due to lower gross margin as a result of lower volumes  As Tom has already discussed  the fourth quarter was a challenging one for the Power Systems business  with revenues declining by 12  driven by weaker demand in oil and gas  mining and power generation markets  Sales declined in most regions led by North America and Europe  EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 5 2   down from 10 3  a year ago with the negative impact of lower volumes  higher warranty costs and the impairment of the joint venture in Africa that we ve already discussed  For the full year 2019  revenues were  23 6 billion  a decrease of 1  from a year ago  Sales in North America were up 3   while international revenues declined 6   Currency for the full year was a negative 1  impact on sales  EBITDA was a record  3 7 billion or 15 8  of sales for 2019 compared to  3 5 billion or 14 6  a year ago  Lower warranty expense  material cost reduction actions and positive pricing more than offset the impact of lower sales and some increased investment in new product development and weaker joint venture earnings in India and China  Net earnings were  2 4 billion or  15 05 per share  both full year records This compares to  2 1 billion or  13 15 per diluted share a year ago  Full year cash from operations was also a record  3 2 billion  Strong earnings  especially in the first half of the year  and working capital reductions in the second half of the year contributed to the strong cash generation  Capital expenditures in 2019 was  700 million  flat with the prior year  We returned a record  2 billion of cash to shareholders or 64  of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends  We repurchased 8 1 million shares throughout the year at an average price of just over  156 and increased our dividend by 15   Moving on to the operating segments  I ll summarize our 2019 results and provide our forecast for 2020  For the Engine segment  2019 revenues decreased 5  a year ago  while EBITDA increased from 13 7  to 14 6  of sales  In 2020  we expect revenues to be down 15  to 19  driven primarily by a decline in heavy  and medium duty truck production in North America and weaker demand for construction equipment in North America and China  2020 s EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13 3  to 14 3  compared to 14 6  of sales in 2019  In the Distribution segment  revenues increased 3  from a year ago to a record  8 1 billion EBITDA increased to a record  693 million or 8 6  of sales compared to  563 million or 7 2  of sales a year ago  We expect 2020 Distribution revenues to be flat to down 4  compared to 2019 driven by lower sales of power generation equipment and construction engines globally and weaker demand for oil and gas engines here in North America  EBITDA margins are expected to be between 8 6  to 9 6  of sales compared to 8 6  in 2019  Components segment revenues decreased 4  in 2019  while EBITDA increased from 14 4  to 16 2  of sales  This year  we expect revenues to decline 9  to 13   Again  the drop in sales primarily due to lower truck production in North America  China and Europe  partially offset by more than  200 million of incremental revenues in India associated with the implementation of Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations  EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13 8  to 14 8  of sales compared to 16 2  in 2019  In the Power Systems segment  revenues declined 4  in 2019 and EBITDA declined from 13 3  to 11 7  of sales  In 2020  we expect revenues to decline a further 7  to 11  primarily due to lower sales of power generation equipment and then weaker demand for mining and oil and gas engines again  EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 10  to 11  compared to 11 7  of sales in 2019 In the New Power segment  net expense was  148 million in 2019  in line with our guidance  We currently anticipate net expense of  160 million at the midpoint of our guidance in 2020  consistent with our communication at our recent Analyst Day  We are projecting company revenues to be down 8  to 12  in 2020  EBITDA is projected to be between 14 2  and 15 2   which represents 25  decremental margins on our base business  at the midpoint of our guidance  The negative impact of lower sales will more than offset the benefits of restructuring  material cost reductions and the positive impact of increased pricing  although all of those actions will set us up for better profitability when markets return  We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 22  in 2020 excluding discrete items  with the increase in the tax rate from 2019 driven principally by a decline in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions in our forecast in 2020  Full year operating cash flow is projected to exceed  2 billion after funding the restructuring costs  We expect capital investments to be in the range of  650 million to  700 million We plan on returning 75  of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2020 as our base case  So to summarize all of this  we delivered solid results in 2019  capitalizing on strong markets in the first half of the year to generate record earnings and record operating cash flow  In response to weaker demand in most of our end markets in the second half of the year  we took a number of actions to reduce costs  address some underperforming parts of our business and to set the business up to perform better when we move to the stronger part of the cycle  We are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering improved performance cycle over cycle as we navigate the downturn that is upon us in 2020 Thank you for your time today  And now let me turn it back over to James James Hopkins    Executive Director of Investor RelationsThank you  Mark   Operator Instructions  Operator  we re now ready to take our first question Questions and Answers OperatorCertainly  Our first question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Andy Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks  Good morning everybody Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Andy Andy Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystI guess kind of a short term question to start off given the disclosure about you expect a disruption in the first quarter  A  is that already included in your guidance  And b  what does that do to the normal quarterly spread Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Well  you remember  Andy  that we    so far  most of the disruption has been during Chinese New Year  which    and so we always have in our guidance the effective Chinese New Year shutdown  But starting basically Friday last week  the shutdowns have now extended beyond what we have planned in our plan or our guidance  So right now  we don t really know what the exposure is going to be  partly because we don t know how long it s going to last and partly because if it does recover pretty quickly  we expect most of the sales to come back in the year  So we don t really know what s going to happen  But just to maybe add a few more pieces to my comments  We are basically looking at three different kinds of exposure  One  of course  is safety of our employees and their family  So we are very active trying to make sure that everybody has the support and resources they need  We know where everybody is We know people are doing wellness tests  We re just trying to make sure that we re taking care of everybody  That s  of course  job one  Job two is we want to make sure that there s no impact on customers  So we are tracking both our parts    what s in inventory  what needs to be shipped by when  how we can proactively work to make sure that if things are    there are extended delay  we have a least impact to customers  that s both for global shipments and Chinese shipments  So we have a very active set of activities on that  And then third  of course  is just shipments within China  Right now  we are planning to open our facilities somewhere between February 10 and February 14  depending on where they re located and what the province schedule is  And right now  we have    there s no backup dates given by the government  those are the dates  And so our plan is to open on those dates  And if that happens  if it happens as planned  our expectation is that the impact will be relatively modest  not 0 but not    but modest and could possibly be made up in the year  If those were to extended further because the outbreak extends further and the government has to take further actions  then  of course  we don t know yet  but we ll have to figure out then what will happen  But we are    worry about both shipments in China as well as shipments to markets outside of China because we do have a number of parts in China that supply plants outside Andy Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Thank you  I ll leave it for other OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore David Raso    Evercore    AnalystHi  good morning Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi David David Raso    Evercore    AnalystJust so we can better understand the incremental margins a bit by division  the comment about  250 million to  300 million of annual savings  how much of those savings are expected in 2020  And can you help us a bit between the divisions Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I mean  basically  we re expecting almost all of those savings in 2020  In the disclosures  you can see the split of the cost reductions by segment  So we ve broken that out for you  So you should assume that the savings are mostly proportional to the expenses incurred  with the one caveat that you will see a chunk of those expenses are in the corporate eliminations column  and those will be just    ultimately  when we report the segment results  the benefits of those savings will be shared across the segments  But you can basically do the math from there  David  The additional actions  of course  the exit of the V8 engine business is going to be all in the Engine business  And then the benefits of exiting the medium duty transmission business are going to be in the Components segment  But I think the Engine business  Components and Distribution will have the biggest benefits from those actions David Raso    Evercore    AnalystAnd the cadence  just so we get a sense of the decrementals through the year  can you give us some sense of the cadence Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I mean number    yes  so the cadence will be    most of the actions  almost all of them will be completed by the end of the first quarter  a chunk already done through the end of January  So full run rate  principally starting in the second quarter David Raso    Evercore    AnalystOf the savings Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSavings  and obviously  the comps of the base business are going to be very tough in the first half of the year given the very strong markets and performance last year  So yes  much tougher decrementals in the first half of the year  easing as the year goes along David Raso    Evercore    AnalystAll right  Thank you  very much Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  David OperatorThan you  And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning  Mark  sorry  another guidance question  A lot of the questions I m getting are in terms of  again  the cadence of earnings throughout the year  in particular  the first quarter given the cost cutting actions  we won t realize those benefits in  We have truck production down dramatically  So is there any way that you can sort of help us with how bad the first quarter is relative to the remaining nine months so people can get comfortable with just sort of the cadence of earnings throughout the year  And then  I guess  Tom  just a bigger picture question for you  You talked at the Analyst Day about opportunities for market share  There was obviously news last week on one of your larger customers  so just trying to balance the two and how you think about ultimate market share for Cummins over the long term Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So I ll try and help as best I can  So we should expect the toughest decremental margins in the first quarter  number one  North America truck was still    at least production was still booming in the first quarter  And then  yes  we re going to have a weaker start in China  By segment  I would just say  the Engine business and Components are probably going to take the biggest challenges in the year over year decremental margins  I don t foresee Power Systems continuing at what was a very tough fourth quarter  And then Distribution business  as you would expect  should be a lot more stable  So I think what s different this time  Jamie  is I don t think there s any big rebound  There isn t a big rebound built into our revenues for the rest of the year  So we re really betting    not betting  we re taking those cost reduction actions to help improve the earnings as we go forward  For the rest of this year  we re really    kind of Q2 revenues onwards are more flattish as we look out Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And Jamie  just to close on that  we put quite a bit of thought into planning for this year  And so we did    definitely took a pretty conservative view about how revenues would come out  which is now feeling pretty close to right for us  And so we did all    as Mark said  we did all our work on the expense line  We took our actions  make sure we got them done in the first quarter  in fact  mostly by the end of January so we could benefit in the year from the savings from those  not just drag them out  But there s no question that the first quarter will be worse because we ll still be implementing those  And then  of course  the China    the coronavirus is not helping  That is all negative to that  too  So we will expect a weaker Q1  But again  as Mark says  it s not a revenue story  it s an expense story that will really help us through the year  We ve done it before  so we kind of know what we re in for With regard to your bigger question  by the way  it s a good one  We still see the same opportunities for market share that we talked about  We still believe that many of the OEMs are considering which investments they want to make and which they don t  And that unlike 10 years ago  when they couldn t wait to invest in more engines  they re wondering about that  But that doesn t mean that every one in every case is going to do it  but that s still the way we see it  With regard to the specific offer from TRATON for Navistar  that  of course  is completely expected  but it s been sort of talked about and rumored and    for some time  it s not a surprise to us or I don t think anybody else  We have been having conversations with both TRATON  who is a partner of ours  We have a joint venture with Scania  We have a number of customer relationships with them as well as with Navistar throughout that time We believe that we re building strong relationships with both  I mean Navistar has been a customer for a long time  So we think we have as many opportunities from this merger or if it actually goes through as we do threats  It doesn t mean that there aren t threats  but we think there s as many opportunities as threats  So we intend to play all those cards out and see how they come out  And I think both companies see Cummins as a potential asset for them in terms of how they approach their future business  So I realize that  that s just general strategy talking  not actual numbers  but until it actually occurs or doesn t and they make decisions  there s not much more that I could say other than we are very active with both of them and there    and feel like we have opportunities with both Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystAppreciate the color  Thank you Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jamie OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGood morning  guys  Just curious if you can give a little color on the parts expectations for next year  I think that had been an area that you mentioned you had seen some weakness this year  And just wondering  given the decline in OE  how you re thinking about that business Tony Satterthwaite    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  Courtney  this is Tony Satterthwaite  I ll just give a couple of comments  We did see a little bit of parts weakness  we mentioned in the third quarter call in the automotive space in North America and the truck markets  That has normalized  and we now expect parts for next year to be relatively flat in that market  maybe up a little bit  We do see some    we did see some definite weakness in parts in Power Systems in the fourth quarter  That was one of the reasons that business did not perform as well as we hoped  as both Tom and Mark mentioned  But we do see that coming back a little bit  We are not seeing overall parts up this year in the Power Systems business primarily because of lower oil and gas engine rebuilds  We are seeing a definite slowdown in utilization and less rebuilds coming  So we are expecting parts to be a little less in 2020 in the Power Systems space Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  And then just one more clarification on the guidance for JV income  I think you guided that to be up  but it seems like some of the core markets that you re talking about are going to be down there  and yet    and I think you re guiding to relatively even market share in those segments  So could you just comment on why we should be expecting JV income to be upwards  not just lapping the impairment that you re taking this year Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s a very fair question even without the uncertainty in China  So a couple of factors  Yes  we shouldn t expect impairments to continue  Number two  we had a big disruption to our light duty business in the middle of last year with the Chinese government focusing on overloading of light duty vehicles  which caused all industry participants really to dramatically slow production and kind of reconfigure certain models  So the hit to our earnings was quite significant there  Then the third piece  which would not be visible to anybody on the outside of the company  is that we get technology fees and royalty income associated with new product introductions in different parts of our business  and we re anticipating some increases there with the launch of some new products  So all of those are the reasons why even with some weaker markets  we had a base case of higher joint venture earnings  notwithstanding the potential risks at least in the near term to China operations Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks  guys Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou bet OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan Ann Duignan    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  Good morning  everybody  Just a clarification on the Components guidance  You did guide to an increase of  200 million in revenue from new product introductions in India  I just want to be sure and certain that  that s sales directly to this new customer that you spoke about  just for clarification Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s all customers  It s just that the total content opportunity from the new emission solution products Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  We mentioned that    in my script  I talked about Tata  We are selling also to Tata as well as to new customer  And of course  now we ll be selling after treatment systems and other component technologies associated with BS VI that we weren t selling before Ann Duignan    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then just on the electrification of our New Power segment  PACCAR has been quite visible there with announcements of ventures with key components players in the truck industry but hasn t selected Cummins as their key partner  Can you maybe talk a little bit about where you are in terms of new program wins and whether you re behind or ahead of where you thought you might be at this point  Just a little bit more color on that segment  please Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Let me first just say that we ve been active talking with PACCAR and would love to win them as a customer on the electric side  too  Needless to say that it s a significant effort for us  And while we re disappointed when they choose other people  they have their own goals and things and    we are    but we are active with them  let me just say it that way  So we hope to win some of their business  and we are fighting hard to do it  More broadly  though  one thing that s true is that we are focusing a lot of our effort and attention on those markets where the near term possibility for production level demand of new power is higher  So let me just see if I can simplify the words  even I m confused by what I just said  I mean those products where electric and fuel cell power is more economically viable in the short term So that s why pluses has been big focus for us  And that s why terminal tractors is a big focus for us because when you do the range  you think about the range  you think about the ability to charge frequently  you think about the loads  those vehicles can actually almost make a case of it depending on where they get their power today on electric power or on hybrid  And then same on fuel cells  A lot of our focus and attention is on trains today  It s not because we don t think there s a truck    a viable truck thing we do  It s just that the trains are more viable now because you only have to refuel with hydrogen at one station and then the other one and then the other  So these are    again  it doesn t mean we are focused on the truck side  we are  But the fact is that those    the volumes of those are likely a little further out than the volumes of these other things  and we want to make sure that we re putting our products into production  getting full testing in real life situations  So again  it doesn t mean that we re not focused on all those other wins  It s just    our attention is drawn there where we think the most activity is and also where the most real life tests are  And then we    everyone s got a lot of products and prototypes to produce and not enough battery engineers  So that s another issue for us  is trying to focus our scarce resources on the things that we think are most viable today Ann Duignan    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  I ll get back in line in the interest of time  I appreciate the color  Thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer Noah Kaye    Oppenheimer    AnalystThanks  And just on the last question  I believe you guys are on the PACCAR refuse truck  although correct me if I m wrong  for the electric refuse truck  But I wanted to ask about medium duty  I think entering 2019  you expected your NAFTA medium duty market share to be around 75   you came in at 80   Looking at 2020 in terms of industry moving parts  I think there s one key new entrant  but you re on that platform  And so you re still suggesting there could be some modest market share loss  Just trying to understand how you think about those moving parts Tony Satterthwaite    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  Noah  this is Tony Satterthwaite  I ll just make a couple of comments  Yes  we did have a very good year in North American medium duty  The market was strong  Our position remains strong  And as you see  we ve guided to a lower market next year  Our experience has been when the market moves down  and I think our guidance is down 20   we see market share move around quite a bit as OEMs optimize their product and market    and shares in the market shift  And so we re expecting to see some decline in share  We said 75  to 80  is our guide for this year  so not significant  But we still see some pressure from those customers who have their own engines  still  and we expect that to continue  The new entrant that you talked about  that s the Mack  which is just announced last week  We re very excited about that  and we re looking forward to see how that s going to impact the market Noah Kaye    Oppenheimer    AnalystOkay  Great  And then as a follow up  I mean  it looks like your Class eight assumptions are maybe a touch more conservative than some of the third party forecast  I guess maybe just talk about what you re seeing in the market that leads you to take a little bit of a haircut Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLet s say one might have said we were a little bit conservative at the start of last year  I think it s just the overall order trend  I mean you look at the pace of freight and the old capacity in the industry  and that s where we are now  We re going to need to see a bounce back at some point in orders or the backlog is going to keep just declining  And build rates  you re going to have to adjust  So I don t think we re enormously off now  And again  at some point  we ll get through this and the market start to recover Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Noah  just    I mean just to call it  I mean Tony and I have talked to a lot of the OEMs and end users  And I want to be clear that we don t think we have    smarter than any of them about what they re going to do  We re just doing our best to trying to plan our business so that we can rightsize our expenses  make the best forecast we can for you guys and for other investors  So we re just calling it like we see it  Individual OEMs have their own view about how orders are going  what their share looks like and they can call it differently than we can  All we can do is react to schedules they are sending us  anticipate schedules they are sending us and these big picture things  which don t have a lot to do with their individual share or their individual decisions about stocking and otherwise  So I think it is one of the reasons you see these differences is that people have a different view of the market  We re standing back  We re back a step  and the change is making the best call we can make  And we have kind of tended on the conservative side in this downturn relative to the average  But in other downturns  we ve been more toward the middle or more toward the upside  It s just how we see it from where we are standing here  And again  the differences that I see and what ACT says or what we say are so small that it wouldn t change a darn thing we do  So again  I would just say  we re not looking at a different set of facts than they are or really seeing a broad difference than they are  although  again  individuals  I think these individual OEMs think they have opportunities to gain share in some segments versus others that they would know better than we do Noah Kaye    Oppenheimer    AnalystYes  I appreciate the color  Thank you Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYes  Hi  Good morning  everyone Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jerry Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Jerry Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYou folks are targeting margin improvement through restructuring actions on the same base  I m wondering if you could just expand the discussion on the opportunity set for further cost out in Power Systems  Have we cut as far as we can  Because it s surprising to see a relatively low share of restructuring in that business  And on the flip side  you have big margin expansion targets baked in for the Distribution segment  Maybe just flesh out the year over year drivers of margins up on sales down Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGreat  And I ll let Tony talk a little bit more about the details  At a high level  though  Jerry  here s what s going on  You remember with the Distribution business that we    when we merged all the independent distributors into Cummins  we mostly started with trying to figure out how to make sure we kept all the customers  we got the benefits of trying to sell across regions and things like that  We didn t really do a lot of major restructuring or efficiency work  a little bit but not very much  And so what you re seeing in the Distribution business is not only the normal kind of contraction related to the downturn because  in fact  they can track less than the rest  But their strategic effort to now get the benefits of consolidation and try to drive a much more efficient set of operations  which it s a terrific program  Tony can talk more about that  It s a great program that he and Distribution business  Tracy Embree and Jenny Bush  are leading  And then I think on the Power Systems side  we have a little bit of the opposite  We did a bunch of restructuring actions  They had already taken a bunch of actions  which  of course  makes the results even that much more disappointing  So if you re wondering if that s the way we feel  that is the way we feel And part of the reason is that unlike some of the other businesses  we ve seen a pretty consistent steady slide in sales and markets in the generator set business as a starting point and then a lot of volatility in some of the industrial applications  It just hasn t been as simple as it went down and it went up  In the mining market  we saw it go up  and then it kind of leveled off  and in some segments  as we mentioned  coming down  Oil and gas popped up nicely and then just blast it right back down again  So there s just been a lot of volatility in that  in the industrial side  which has produced less than stellar results than we d like  And then on the genset  this sort of steady decline in the market  which is despite our efforts to do restructuring just has it resulted in profitability where we want it  So I guess what I d say is we definitely are not giving up  We have a lot of work left to do to figure out how to get that business to our target profitability  We still feel confident we can  What s more is the markets are not    we have a lot more room in market improvement as it starts to turn back up  So we    while not happy where we are  we think that we have a lot more work to go  It s just not in this normal reduction in people and things because they already did a lot of that in previous restructurings Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd Tom  the actions in Distribution  can you talk about the timing of the benefits  When should we expect the phasing to come in of the programs that you just stepped us through Tony Satterthwaite    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo Jerry  I ll handle that  this is Tony  Just    we really    we are really in the beginning of that transformation  We ve taken some decisions about organization restructuring that Tom talked about  streamlining the organization  Those actions  we were able to get done as part of our overall actions  As we said  majority will be finished here in Q1  And then we will start to see improved performance of the business really from there on  We are streamlining operations  We are adjusting our footprint  We are making the organization much more efficient  And all these things  we think  will start to pay off in the second quarter  and you ll see some benefit throughout the year  You can see our guidance is up for this year over last  And really  it s a result of these efforts primarily that s moving the Distribution business performance Mark Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd we d hope we could continue to drive more benefits in the future years Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research Rob Wertheimer    Melius Research    AnalystSo just a quick one on the power gen or Power Systems or really power gen  you just touched on it  But are you seeing project delays that are just lumpiness and big project related or just kind of a general slowdown in the business  I don t know if there s a reasoning behind the slowdown you re seeing Tom Linebarger    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  What I was commenting there for Jerry is that the business hasn t been terrific for a bunch of years  I mean it s not been declining all the time  but it s either been flat or declining for a bunch of years  And it s just    that s just the nature of the genset business over the last eight or 10 years  But now    right now  what we re seeing in the data center market is some projects slipped  So data center market has been the one bright spot  So if I went over that same period of gensets  I d say data centers has been good throughout that time  kind of offsetting or partially offsetting a lot of the other decline  And it s been terrific  And that is the one where we saw a lot of projects scheduled for 2020  big customers that we are talking about doing things  several of them have already said  it s now very early in 2020  hey  we re thinking about moving this to 2021  So what happens with that  we ll see  but that s not a terrific sign  It s not that surprising  though  at this stage of the market  When you start to see the industrial stuff start to come down  then capital investments like those start to move out a little bit  that s not a big surprise  but that we are starting to see that in the data center market for the first time James Hopkins    Executive Director of Investor RelationsGreat  Thanks  So with that  I think we re at the end of our hour here  So I just want to say thanks  everyone  for your interest in Cummins as well as today  And then this afternoon  I ll be available for any follow up calls also  Thank you very much Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  62 minutesCall

131637,353152,CMI,Huge  pricey trucks haul jobs and profits for the Detroit Three,news,By Nick Carey and Joseph White DECATUR  Texas FLINT  Mich   Reuters    Mickey McMaster is on his 12th pickup truck   The 61 year old farm equipment dealer in Decatur  Texas  two weeks ago treated himself to a 2019 GMC Denali for around  69 000   a reward for long hours at work   For me this is the Cadillac of trucks  it s a real luxury vehicle   McMaster said   I ve worked my way up to afford a truck like this and it shows that I ve earned it     McMaster is the kind of customer General Motors Co  NYSE GM  is banking on as it plans to add 1 000 jobs at a plant in Flint  Michigan that will build a new generation of its largest pickups  Demand from Texas and other heartland states for big pick ups is providing a lifeline to many workers the No  1 U S  automaker is laying off at plants elsewhere   The Detroit Three automakers and thousands of their U S  workers are counting on customers like McMaster to keep buying bigger and more luxurious pickup trucks even if overall U S  vehicle demand weakens this year  as most analysts predict  At Flint  GM will build a new generation of its heavy duty Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierras  including luxury models that are some of the most profitable vehicles on the planet  GM  Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV s Ram division own the segment and are each doubling down with new or redesigned models launching this year   Sales of heavy duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600 000 vehicles a year  up more than 20 percent since 2013  according to industry data  Prices for luxury models can easily top  70 000   GM on Tuesday will celebrate the launch of a new generation of heavy duty GMC and Chevrolet pickups at the assembly plant in Flint  Michigan  that is now building all such trucks for the company   At the same time that GM is laying off thousands of U S  workers and planning to shutter five North American factories  Flint is hiring  The plant runs on three daily shifts  six days a week  As the new model s assembly system ramps up  the plant s capacity will increase by more than 25 percent  plant manager Mike Perez told Reuters   The Flint plant plans to add 1 000 workers  more than half of the 1 500 factory workers who have asked to transfer from plants GM has targeted for shutdown as part of CEO Mary Barra s restructuring plan   We re bringing in 50 to 100 people every week   said Perez  Workers last week were still finishing the job of retooling the Flint factory to build the new heavy duty trucks as part of a  1 5 billion investment project   A highlight of the new assembly line  two story tall Fanuc robots hoist a cab and a bed for a truck from separate pallets  swing them in opposing arcs  then gently lower them onto a truck frame to be bolted together by different robots   Detroit Three executives boast that the heavy duty pickup market is protected by  moats    a 25 percent tariff on imported trucks and decades of engineering that have yielded vehicles that haul 30 000 pound trailers  ride like large luxury sedans  and offer the same safety and connectivity technology as a BMW or Lexus luxury car  Pickup trucks account for three quarters of the 235 or so new vehicles Carey  CW  Williams  NYSE WMB  sells each month at his Decatur dealership  And nearly half of those are higher end  luxury models that can sell for  70 000 or more  Williams said he is not concerned about the new Ram trucks as competition for GM    Pickup trucks are our bread and butter  and we ve got the new model to prove it with all the bells and whistles customers want   he said  Mark Ary  37  a second generation owner of an HVAC installation repair business  paid  65 000 for a white 2019 Silverado High Country  He liked the air conditioning for the truck s rear seats  its 360 degree cameras  and hands free technology that allows him to call and text    GM really stepped it up with the technology for the 2019 truck   Ary said   MASSIVE  TRUCKS Ford  the leader in the heavy duty pickup segment  will launch later this year versions of its F series Super Duty pickups with a 7 3 liter gasoline engine   more than three times the displacement of the power plant in a typical Ford Fusion sedan   Fiat Chrysler s Ram brand is revving up a redesigned lineup of heavy duty pickups offering optional 12 inch display screens and a 6 7 liter  Cummins Inc   NYSE CMI  diesel engine that delivers 1 000 pound feet of torque   enough to haul a 35 000 pound trailer   GM s Silverado and GMC heavy duty trucks will offer new diesel engines  10 speed transmissions and trailer towing capability  well in excess of 30 000 pounds   said Tim Herrick  the executive chief engineer for GM s large pickup and SUV programs  The new Chevrolet and GMC trucks coming down the Flint assembly line stand out from older models on the same line  They are taller and have more imposing hoods and grilles than the older trucks   We wanted the truck to look massive   Herrick said   HEAVY DUTY INVESTMENT Detroit automakers are investing heavily to expand their profitable heavy pickup franchises beyond commercial and work customers   Each has luxury heavy duty pickup models  such as Ram s Laramie Longhorn  Ford s Limited and Chevrolet s High Country  GM has developed a multi model luxury truck sub brand  GMC Denali  Now  60 percent of GMC heavy duty pickups sold wear the Denali badge  GMC global brand chief Duncan Aldred told Reuters  With a diesel engine  sticker prices top  70 000  Heavy duty pickups are not subject to the same federal fuel economy rules as lighter trucks and sedans  They fall under less stringent standards applied to commercial trucks  where a vehicle s capacity for work allows for more fuel consumption  These pickups do not have mileage estimates on their price stickers as lighter trucks do  The growing sales of heavy duty pickups and their evolution toward luxury  personal use vehicles is drawing criticism from advocates of curbing carbon dioxide emissions    With a 7 3 liter engine  Ford s new massive pickup deserves to be launched as the Ford Valdez   Dan Becker  director of the Center for Auto Safety s Safe Climate Campaign  wrote in an email   In Flint  the assignment to build GM s new heavy duty trucks is a lifeline for workers like Randy Randall  a 41 year GM veteran who said he has worked at several GM plants  moving when layoffs hit  Now  he checks trucks at the end of the Flint assembly line  Randall smiled as a screen in front of his GMC truck flashed a message that it had passed the tests   It s got a great future   he said

131665,353180,CMI,Top Picks 2019  Cummins CMI,news,"Cummins  NYSE CMI  designs  manufactures  and distributes engines and related components for use in heavy duty and medium duty trucks  buses  construction and mining equipment  and standby power generation  explains Doug Gerlach  editor of Investor Advisory Service 
Over nearly a century  the company has earned a reputation as a leading engine manufacturer  known for the reliability and superior quality of its products  Cummins has been a beneficiary of coordinated global growth and a strong truck market  Just over half of the company s sales come from the U S 
Over the past decade Cummins has benefitted from rising fuel efficiency standards and emissions reduction regulations  which have served as a tailwind 
As a cyclical company  Cummins is dependent upon economic growth for near term results  though the company has definite long term growth characteristics  Given the recent strength  there is some question as to where we are in the important North American heavy duty truck cycle 
These concerns are mitigated in part by the current backlog  which is the highest in 20 years and gives good visibility through 2019  Furthermore  management emphasizes that demand continues to be strong and broad based globally across most of its on highway and off highway markets 
Warranty issues have been a nagging problem for the company  and management has worked to address these  In the second quarter  the company took a  181 million charge to address the performance of a faulty emissions control system in certain on highway engines produced between 2010 and 2015 
Management targets warranty costs of 2  of sales over the longer term versus the 3 1  it reported in 2017 and 2 4  guidance for 2018  The increased focus on quality appears to be reflected in the performance of more recently launched engines 
Material costs and tariffs are also a concern and a key reason why the stock is down approximately 25  from highs reached earlier this year  Cummins recently highlighted an expectation of approximately a  200 million annual headwind  split 50  50  between materials costs and tariffs 
The company reiterated its full year guidance for sales growth of 15  17   Management also reduced its expectation for tariff related expenses for this year to  80 million  down from a previous estimate of  100 million 
For 2019  the company now expects tariff related costs of  250 million  which is  50 million higher than previous projections  Cummins expects to offset the majority of the tariff costs through pricing and improvements in its supply chain 
Accounting for the cyclicality of the business  we look to more muted growth over the next five years  targeting 7  sales growth and 10  EPS growth  Five years of 10  growth could result in EPS as high as  22 00 
The cyclical nature of the business makes it necessary to adjust historical P E ratios  We estimate an appropriate high P E to be 15 0x  which suggests a potential high price of  330 and a possible annual total return of 23 2  from the recent price of  130

You can see 
Pfizer s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year   6 8  vs   14 8    The Zacks analyst believes that the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with Glaxo  the Array acquisition and the pending merger of Upjohn unit with Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   if successful  will make Pfizer a smaller company with a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines 
The smaller Pfizer should see better revenue growth as the Lyrica LOE cliff will go away  The company expects continued strong growth of key brands like Ibrance  Xeljanz and Eliquis to drive sales in the coming quarters  Pfizer is also strengthening its pipeline and hopes to launch new innovative medicines in the next five years  which can drive long term growth 
However  Lyrica generic erosion  currency headwinds and pricing pressure are key near term  top line headwinds  Estimates have remained stable ahead of Q4 earnings release  Pfizer has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters 
 You can  
Shares of BP have gained  3 7  in the past three months against the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry s rise of  4 6   The Zacks analyst believes that BP has been benefiting from a strong portfolio of upstream projects  Since 2016  the British energy giant has placed 23 major upstream projects online 
All the key projects BP has been delivering over the years backed the company to post record production levels  These projects will also help the firm boost production by 900 Mboe d within 2021  Moreover  BP plans to boost spending on renewable power business as most European firms have decided to combat climate change 
However  the 2010 oil spill incident in the BP operated Macondo Prospect is still affecting the company  Although it cleared the huge litigation expenses related to the spill  it had to divest some of its best operating properties  Also  the company expects refining margins in the December quarter of 2019 to drop sequentially due to continued turnaround activities 
 You can  
Fidelity National Information Services  shares have gained  9 8  over the past six months against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry s rise of  5 5   The Zacks analyst believes that the company remains well positioned for growth backed by its attractive core business with a recurring revenue model  digitization  and several ongoing strategic initiatives 
Fidelity s deal to acquire Worldpay is likely to accelerate its growth by boosting presence in faster growing markets  Also  the transaction will provide synergies of  700 million from revenue and cost management over next three years  However  the company remains exposed to consolidation in the banking sector and significant competition from new entrants  Also  unsustainable capital deployment activities of the company remain a concern

131676,353191,CMI,Earnings Preview  Cummins  CMI  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Cummins  CMI  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engine maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 38 billion  down 12 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 81  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cummins 
For Cummins  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 25  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cummins will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cummins would post earnings of  3 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 83  delivering a surprise of  0 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cummins doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-cummins-cmi-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200502333,200502333
131677,353192,CMI,Cummins  CMI  Beats Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Cummins  CMI  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 56 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 42 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 48 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 79   A quarter ago  it was expected that this engine maker would post earnings of  3 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 83  delivering a surprise of  0 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Cummins  which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines industry  posted revenues of  5 58 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 52   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 13 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cummins shares have lost about 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for Cummins 
While Cummins has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cummins was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 25 on  5 22 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  12 95 on  21 44 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines is currently in the top 46  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cummins-cmi-beats-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200504332,200504332

131684,353199,CMI,Asia shares rally on U S  jobs relief  sterling slugged by politics,news,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY  Reuters    Asian share markets rallied on Monday as favorable U S  jobs data whetted risk appetites  while sterling slipped after two members of the British government resigned over Brexit and put the future of Prime Minister Theresa May in doubt 
The pound peeled off around a third of a U S  cent to  1 3290  as news broke British Brexit Secretary David Davis and Brexit Minister Steven Baker had resigned 
The loss came just two days after a meeting at May s Chequers country residence supposedly sealed a cabinet deal on Brexit and underlines the deep divisions in her ruling Conservative Party over the departure from the EU 
 The outlook for the pound had brightened in recent weeks   said Westpac senior currency analyst Sean Callow  seeing a chance this could turn out positive for the currency 
 If the U K  government presses ahead with this plan despite the unexpected resignation of  hard Brexit  officials and with the US dollar losing momentum  sterling should be able make a run at  1 35 multi day  
Sentiment in other markets was mostly positive after Friday s U S  payrolls report showed tame wages and more people looking for work 
 The combination of rising employment and increased labor force participation suggests healthy but not tightening labor market conditions in June  something that will allow the Fed to continue to hike rates at a gradual pace   said Kevin Cummins  NYSE CMI   a senior U S  economist at RBS  LON RBS  
The balanced report helped Wall Street end last week in the black and Japan s Nikkei  N225  followed up with gains of 1 4 percent on Monday 
MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan  MIAPJ0000PUS  climbed 1 1 percent  on top of 0 7 percent rally on Friday when the launch of U S  tariffs on Chinese imports came and went without too many fireworks 
NOT THAT BAD
 While trade tensions fan concerns about the future  incoming data show a soaring U S  economy  a healthy labor market  and some rebound in Europe and Japan   said  Barclays   LON BARC  economist Michael Gapen 
 For now  overall policies and financial conditions still support growth and investment   he added   A sharper than expected China slowdown from a domestic credit crunch and external trade tensions could be the main risk to global growth  
Chinese shares were attempting to rally on Monday with the Shangahi blue chip index  CSI300  up 1 9 percent after hitting its lowest in almost 18 months last week 
China s securities regulator said on Sunday it plans to ease restrictions on foreign investment in stock listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges to attract more foreign capital and support the economy

1  Global Stocks Mixed  Central Banks  Data  Earnings in Focus
The global stock rally showed signs of slowing  bringing at least a momentary pause to this month s strong performance  as investors digested a raft of central bank news  while continuing to monitor a fresh batch of data and corporate earnings 
Asian Pacific markets ended mixed  as investors in the region digested the release of the Bank of Japan s rates decision and China s official Purchasing Managers  Index 
Among notable standouts  Japan s Nikkei pared losses in late trading to close the session nearly unchanged after the nation s central bank said it would maintain its easy money measures  Across the Korean Strait  South Korea s KOSPI ended at a record high  boosted by strong earnings results from Samsung  KS 005930   But Chinese equities wobbled after data showed a sharper than expected slowdown in October factory growth 
In Europe  stocks held at five month highs  supported by a jump in the shares of oil firm  BP   LON BP   which announced buoyant earnings and a share buyback program  but trading was largely muted as Germany s stock market was closed for a holiday 
On Wall Street  U S  stocks pointed to a higher open  as investors looked to key earnings reports to set the tone for the markets  On Monday  Wall Street closed lower on news that U S  lawmakers are discussing a gradual phase in of much anticipated corporate tax cuts 
2  Federal Reserve Kicks Off 2 Day Policy meeting
The Federal Reserve kicks off its two day policy meeting today  at which it is not expected to take action on interest rates  though it could point the markets toward the rate hike widely expected in December 
The policy meeting takes place just days before President Donald Trump names a new Fed chair on Thursday to replace Janet Yellen when her term ends in February  with sources saying the pick is going to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell 
Powell is seen as being more dovish on monetary policy than other contenders for the post  especially compared to Stanford University economist John Taylor  who has been regarded as another top challenger for the position 
Besides the Fed  there is a batch of data on today s economic calendar  including the employment cost index at 8 30AM ET  1230GMT   S P Case Schiller home price index at 9 00AM ET  1300GMT   Chicago PMI at 9 45AM ET  1345GMT  and CB consumer confidence at 10AM ET  1400GMT  
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was a shade higher  while Treasury yields eased up 
Investors were cautious following news that investigators probing Russian interference in the U S  election had charged President Donald Trump s former campaign manager and following reports that planned tax cuts could be gradually phased in 
3  U S  Earnings Season More Than Halfway Over

After the close  EA Sports  NASDAQ EA   United States Steel  NYSE X  and Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  are just a few of the names on the docket

Executives from Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  s Google will testify before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U S  presidential election 
Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch  Twitter acting General Counsel Sean Edgett  and Richard Salgado  Google s director of law enforcement and information security  are among the witnesses at the hearing to discuss solutions to Russian disinformation 
Facebook said on Monday that Russia based operatives published about 80 000 posts on the social network over a two year period and that about 126 million Americans may have seen the posts during that time 
Twitter separately has found 2 752 accounts linked to Russian operatives  That estimate is up from a tally of 201 accounts that Twitter reported in September 
The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the election  in which President Donald Trump  a Republican  defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton 
5  Soft Euro Zone Inflation Backs Up Slow ECB Tapering
Inflation in the euro zone slowed more than expected in October  remaining well below the European Central Bank s target  data showed  lending support to the bank s decision to withdraw monetary stimulus only slowly 
Consumer prices rose 1 4  this month  the European Union s statistics office said  That was below expectations for an increase of 1 5  and compared a final reading of a 1 5  advance in the prior month  In a further blow to the ECB s drive to boost inflation  the core rate dropped to a five month low of 0 9  
The ECB last week said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January  but extended the program until the end of September  promised years of stimulus and left the door open to backtracking  citing muted price pressures 
In a separate release  the European Union s statistics office said gross domestic product in the 19 country currency bloc increased 0 6  on the quarter and 2 5  on the year  mostly in line with forecasts

131723,353238,CMI,U S  consumer confidence near 17 year high  wages rising,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer confidence jumped to a near 17 year high in October  with households upbeat about the labor market and business conditions  which could underpin consumer spending and boost the economy in the final three months of the year 
The economy s prospects were further bolstered by other reports on Tuesday showing an acceleration in wage growth in the third quarter and sustained increases in house prices in August  The strong domestic fundamentals likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December 
 An optimistic consumer emboldened by a solid economy and an increasingly competitive labor market is likely to continue to spend  reinforcing a virtuous cycle that should be supportive of further growth   said Jim Baird  chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo  Michigan 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 5 3 points to 125 9 this month  the highest reading since December 2000 
The surge in confidence was probably driven by expectations of big tax cuts after President Donald Trump and Republicans in the U S  Congress vowed to enact tax reform this year  The proposed plan unveiled in late September promises to deliver up to  6 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals 
Record high share prices also likely contributed to the rise in consumer confidence this month  Confidence among households in the  125 000 and over income group increased sharply  but optimism among low income consumers was mostly lower 
 The rich only get richer in this economy where the advancing tide is not lifting all the boats   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York 
The Conference Board survey s so called labor market differential  derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful  was the most favorable since July 2001 
This measure  which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department s employment report  is pointing to further declines in the jobless rate and labor market slack  The labor market is near full employment  with the jobless rate at a 16 1 2 year low of 4 2 percent 
Tightening labor market conditions are gradually generating a faster pace of wage growth  A separate report from the Labor Department showed the Employment Cost Index  the broadest measure of labor costs  increased 0 7 percent in the third quarter after rising 0 5 percent rise in the second quarter 
That lifted the year on year rate of increase to 2 5 percent  the largest gain since the first quarter of 2015 
WELCOME SIGN
Signs of a pickup in wage growth  which has lagged the eight year economic recovery  are likely to be welcomed by Fed officials  who are scheduled to begin a two day policy meeting later on Tuesday  The U S  central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates this week  but is expected to increase borrowing costs in December for a third time this year 
U S  stocks were trading higher  also lifted by upbeat earnings from consumer companies Mondelez  O MDLZ  and Kellogg  N K   The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  Treasuries slipped 
Steadily increasing wages offer hope that inflation could soon trend higher  Economists say labor costs need to rise by at least 3 percent to push inflation closer to the U S  central bank s 2 percent inflation target  Labor costs increased 2 4 percent in the year to June 
A government report on Monday showed the Fed s preferred inflation measure  the personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index excluding food and energy  increasing 1 3 percent in the 12 months through September  The core PCE has undershot the Fed s 2 percent target for nearly 5 1 2 years 
 As long as the labor market remains tight and wages are firming  Fed officials will continue to expect inflation to move higher next year and thus will be inclined to stay on the gradual normalization path  even in the face of current low inflation prints   said Kevin Cummins  NYSE CMI   senior U S  economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford  Connecticut 
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack  It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation 
Wages and salaries  which account for 70 percent of employment costs  rose 0 7 percent in the third quarter  They increased 0 5 percent in the second quarter  Wages and salaries were up 2 5 percent in the 12 months through September after gaining 2 3 percent in the year to June 
A third report on Tuesday showed the S P CoreLogic Case Shiller composite home price index of 20 U S  metropolitan areas rose 5 9 percent in August from a year ago after increasing 5 8 percent in July 
House prices are being driven by an acute shortage of properties available for sale  Robust consumer confidence  rising wages and strong house prices should keep consumer spending supported for the rest of the year

131724,353239,CMI,Technology invading nearly all U S  jobs  even lower skilled  study,news,By Timothy Aeppel  Reuters    Forget robots  The real transformation taking place in nearly every workplace is the invasion of digital tools  The use of digital tools has increased  often dramatically  in 517 of 545 occupations since 2002  with a striking uptick in many lower skilled occupations  according to a study released Wednesday by the Brookings Institution  a Washington think tank   Study    The report underscores the growing need for workers of all types to gain digital skills and explains why many employers say they struggle to fill jobs  including many that in the past required few digital skills  There is anxiety about automation displacing workers and in many cases  new digital tools allow one worker to do work previously done by several   Those 545 occupations reflect 90 percent of all jobs in the economy  The report found that jobs with greater digital content tend to pay more and are increasingly concentrated in traditional high tech centers like Silicon Valley  Seattle and Austin  Texas   Graphic    The report used U S  Department of Labor data to assign a rating of zero to 100 to each occupation  reflecting the amount that each required use of digital technology  The average score for all occupations rose from 29 in 2002 to 46 in 2016  a 59 percent increase   Some jobs  especially higher paying service occupations  have long used digital tools and that continued to grow  the study found  At the same  many jobs that had little or no digital content in 2002 have now become far more likely to require those skills  Warehouse workers who move around freight saw their average score rise from 5 in 2002 to 25 in 2016  These workers now use handheld devices to track inventories and devices that sound an alarm if they try to put a box into the wrong truck  The study found the digital score for roofers jumped from zero to 22  while for parking lot attendants it rose from 3 to 26    What we found is that the more digital a job is  on balance the better the pay and also the less chance there is for total displacement of your job   said Mark Muro  a senior fellow at Brookings and coauthor of the report  Software developers  the top ranked occupation for digital skills in both 2002 and 2016  saw their rating slip to 94 from 97  Muro speculates that as that field has matured  there are more rolls for software developers to work as managers of other software developers  which mean doing less direct programming work  At the other extreme are jobs like those done by Steve Engle  a 53 year old factory worker at Cummins Inc s  N CMI  engine plant in Seymour  Indiana  One of his tasks is to insert 56 bolts on the flywheel housing of each engine as it moves down the line and tighten the bolts in a certain sequence  He now uses a tool that is connected to a computer screen  which guides him to the right bolt and will not allow him to tighten the wrong one  It also knows exactly when the bolt is tight enough and then stops   This tool won t let me do it wrong   he said ,2017-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/technology-invading-nearly-all-us-jobs-even-lower-skilled-study-862001,862001

131736,353251,CMI,Cummins  CMI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Cummins  CMI  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engine maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 8  
Revenues are expected to be  6 34 billion  up 3 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 18  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cummins 
For Cummins  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cummins will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cummins would post earnings of  3 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 20  delivering a surprise of  19 66  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cummins appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cummins-cmi-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200443207,200443207

Cummins shares have added about 30 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Cummins 
While Cummins has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

131748,353263,CMI,Shaky NAFTA deal threatens Navistar s Mexico made exports to world,news,"By Sharay Angulo MONTERREY  Mexico  Reuters    Less than half the trucks exported from Navistar s  N NAV  mammoth Escobedo plant in Mexico are sold in North America but the factory s success remains tightly tied to the uncertain future of the region s NAFTA free trade deal   Navistar s Mexican factory  now the U S  company s largest worldwide  exports to around 30 countries and sells less to the United States than competitors such as Daimler AG  DE DAIGn   one of the top three truck makers in Mexico  which sends three quarters of its Mexican made commercial vehicles north   But Navistar s reliance on tariff free imported parts shows why even Mexico manufacturers that have diversified their customer base away from the United States still fear U S  President Donald Trump s threats to scrap NAFTA    To lose this treaty would be to go backwards 40 years   said Oscar Ruiz  operations director at the plant  fearing a return to an era when barriers made foreign investment and trade expensive between the two neighbors  Trade negotiators from the United States  Mexico and Canada will meet this week in Washington for a fourth round of talks on reworking NAFTA amid growing signs of an impasse between the Trump administration and the other two signatories of the pact  Mexican officials warn that Trump is leading the region toward a protectionist trade war with his  America First  policy  flirting with major curbs on commerce  Nowadays  over half the original parts for the vehicles made at Navistar s 250 acre  100 hectare  site in the northern state of Nuevo Leon arrive duty free from the United States and Canada in hundreds of trailers every day  Ruiz said   Higher tariffs on imports or reduced trade flows would raise the cost of production and of exporting to the United States  That would make trucks more expensive for all Navistar s customers  experts consulted by Reuters said   Navistar  for example  uses Alabama made Cummins  NYSE CMI  engines in its International Prostar and LT heavy tractors  Without NAFTA  importing the engines would likely cost 10 percent more  based on World Trade Organization tariffs  according to Manuel Nieblas  a manufacturing consultant at Deloitte Mexico   With engines representing up to 45 percent of the  130 000 cost of a Prostar truck  that tariff alone could add around  5 800 to the final price   Prices would also rise for most of the up to 12 000 parts used in a Navistar truck  both due to the tariffs and slower border customs checks if trade were to be more regulated   A  LOGISTIC SPRINGBOARD   Aside from higher prices for imported parts  ending NAFTA would likely impose a 4 percent tariff on top of the total value of the Class 8 truck 18 wheeler for export to the United States   Still  that might be slight enough for U S  consumers to absorb  or for the company to shave off its margins  And Navistar s strategy of using Mexico s low costs and multiple free trade deals to export to markets from Saudi Arabia to Australia could soften the blow of any tougher export rules for the United States  Mexican Chief Executive Carlos Pardo said    More than ever I believe Mexico is a logistic springboard  where on top of a qualified work force and reasonable production costs  logistically it has created the connections to supply any part of the world   Pardo said in Navistar s Mexico City headquarters   While 98 percent of trucks exported from Mexico go to the United States or Canada  U S  truckmaker Kenworth  China s Giant and Korean automaker Kia all have a similar strategy of building in Mexico to export to countries other than the United States   Scrapping NAFTA might not hurt exports to robust European economies  but those to Latin America  Navistar s top market after North America  would become much more complicated  said Salvador Pasquel  an automotive expert at Baker McKenzie   Business with Colombia  which in 2011 was the biggest market in Latin America for U S  truck companies after Mexico  helps illustrate what could happen if NAFTA collapses  Sales plummeted after vehicles got more expensive because of changes in Colombia s trade policy  including a tax of 15 percent on the value of new imported heavy trucks    We went from exporting  817 million in heavy tractors in 2011 to barely  1 million in 2015   said Miguel Elizalde  president of Mexico s truck and bus business chamber  Anpact   One fear for Mexico based companies is that increased costs there would boost Latin American sales of trucks made in Brazil  whose vehicle industry belongs to the Mercosur free trade bloc    If it s harder for Mexico to place its products in Latin America  the big economy that could provide those cars and trucks would surely be Brazil   said Baker McKenzie s Pasquel   The worries over NAFTA coincide with a recovery in Navistar s U S  market  After a long stretch of depressed sales  orders for Class 8 trucks in the United States soared for the fourth consecutive month in September  according to preliminary data from industry forecaster FTR     Analysts expect a strong year in 2018   Although Lisle  Illinois based Navistar posted a second quarter loss  its share price has recovered lately as the company turns itself around after a disastrous bet on a costly and unsuccessful smog reduction system  Last year  Volkswagen s truck unit said it was buying a stake in Navistar as part of an alliance in which the two companies will share technology  In Mexico  growth of truck making under NAFTA has been rapid  In 1993  a year before the deal took effect  Mexico exported 1 040 heavy vehicles  Last year  it sold 106 161 such vehicles abroad  according to Anpact figures  Navistar s Escobedo plant was producing three vehicles a day when it opened in 1998  It now makes 160  with capacity for almost double that  factory manager Ruiz said  The company is under no illusion it could maintain those volumes without NAFTA  though the plant recently decided to hire 150 new workers because of recovering U S  demand   We could survive  yes  but the question is  at what level   Ruiz said

131789,353304,CMI,U S  private payrolls rise solidly  pending home sales jump,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  private employers maintained a steady pace of hiring in August and contracts to buy previously owned homes surged in July  suggesting the economy was regaining sufficient momentum for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year   Other data on Wednesday showed a sharp moderation in factory activity in the Midwest this month amid shrinking order books  indicating the manufacturing sector continued to be hobbled by the residual effects of a strong dollar and oil price slump   This should give the Fed confidence that the economy is strong enough to generate new employment and importantly  that the economy has enough forward momentum to withstand an interest rate hike   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York  The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased 177 000 jobs this month after rising 194 000 in July  August s gain was in line with economists  expectations   The services sector accounted for all the increase  with construction shedding another 2 000 jobs on top of the 5 000 positions lost in July  Manufacturing payrolls were flat after rising by 5 000 jobs in July  The ADP report  which is jointly developed with Moody s Analytics  was published ahead of the government s more comprehensive employment report for August due on Friday  According to a Reuters survey of economists  nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180 000 jobs in August after rising 255 000 in July  August s anticipated step down in job gains follows two straight months of payroll increases above 250 000  Economists say with the labor market near full employment and the economy s recovery from the 2007 09 recession showing signs of aging  a moderation in job growth is normal  The dollar rose to a three week high against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  government debt fell marginally  U S  stocks were trading lower as the stronger dollar weighed on oil prices and materials companies  FAVORABLE DATA The U S  central bank hiked interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade  but has held them steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation   But with data ranging from consumer spending to housing and industrial production suggesting the economy has regained speed after sputtering in the first half of the year  most economists expect another rate hike in December   The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting third quarter gross domestic product rising at a 3 5 percent annual rate   That upbeat assessment of the economy was further bolstered by a second report on Wednesday showing that contracts to buy previously owned homes surged in July after two straight months of declines as demand rose almost across the board  The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index  based on contracts signed last month  increased 1 3 percent to its second highest reading in over a decade   Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two  and last month s data implied a pickup in home resales after they declined 3 2 percent in July  Economists had forecast pending home sales rising only 0 6 percent last month   The latest rise suggests some improvement in existing home sales   said Kevin Cummins  NYSE CMI   senior economist at RBS  LON RBS  in Stamford Connecticut   However  we may not see all of the latest reported increase filter through as quickly as it usually does since there appears to be some delays in the pipeline   Demand for housing is being driven by the labor market  which is steadily generating increases in wages as it nears full employment  Sales  however  are being constrained by tight inventories and high prices  which are causing appraisal complications  delaying the closing of contracts  Data on house prices  residential construction  new home sales and home builders  confidence have been upbeat in recent months  Pending home sales rose 1 4 percent from a year ago  Contracts increased 0 8 percent in the Northeast and jumped 7 3 percent in the West  They gained 0 8 percent in the South  but fell 2 9 percent in the Midwest  But the manufacturing sector is lagging gains in the economy as factories continue to process the lingering effects of the dollar s past rally and oil price collapse  In addition  the sector which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy  has been hamstrung by weak global demand and an inventory correction in the United States  In a third report  the Institute for Supply Management Chicago said its business barometer fell 4 3 points to 51 5 in August  A reading above 50 indicates expansion in factory activity in the automotive heavy region  Order backlogs tumbled 14 5 points  falling back into contraction territory  New orders and production also weighed on the index  although both remained in expansion  Supplier deliveries were little changed and factory employment rose to its highest level since April 2015  
 U S  manufacturing has struggled to gain traction following the appreciation of the dollar in 2014 and 2015 and the collapse of drilling and mining activity in the U S    said Rob Martin  an economist at  Barclays   LON BARC  in New York   We expect manufacturing activity to improve just a touch over the rest of this year  ",2016-08-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-private-payrolls-rise-solidly;-pending-home-sales-jump-423462,423462

Cummins said in a court filing the recall will reduce the fuel economy of vehicles by a  negligible  amount   from 14 6 miles per gallon to 14 4 miles per gallon ",2016-10-10,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/fiat-chrysler,-cummins-spar-over-costs-of-diesel-emission-recall-431528",431528

131800,353315,CMI,Here s Why Cummins  CMI  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cummins  CMI   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cummins currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CMI that show why this engine maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CMI  shares are up 1 18  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines industry is up 0 89  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 76  compares favorably with the industry s 3 88  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Cummins have increased 10 01  over the past quarter  and have gained 26 89  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 5 48  and 8 71   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CMI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CMI is averaging 1 113 200 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CMI 
Over the past two months  12 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CMI s consensus estimate  increasing from  15 48 to  16 23 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 3 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CMI is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Cummins on your short list ",2019-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-cummins-cmi-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200433621,200433621

131822,353337,CMI,U S  House plans Friday vote on bill key to Pacific trade pact,news,"By Richard Cowan and Krista Hughes WASHINGTON  Reuters    Republicans aimed for a vote on Friday to hand President Barack Obama the coveted  fast track  trade negotiating authority he needs to complete his signature Pacific trade pact after concessions to Democrats appeared to smooth the way forward  In a memo to fellow Republicans  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the House of Representatives would vote on Thursday on new funding for a program to help workers hurt by trade  before Friday s debate on legislation to speed trade deals through Congress  That tackles a key Democratic concern  The core legislation   fast track trade authority for the president   is a central part of Obama s strategic shift toward Asia  It would be accomplished in part through the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  that could boost global economic growth and U S  exports  while setting common standards among emerging and rich nations in one of the world s biggest trade deals  The legislation would enhance Obama s negotiating clout by letting Congress set negotiating objectives for trade deals such as the TPP  but preventing lawmakers from making changes to the final agreement  The Republican controlled Rules Committee agreed to hold separate votes on the worker aid program and fast track authority on Friday  a strategy aimed at maximizing votes from both sides of the aisle  Failure of either vote would mean starting again in the House   If the legislation passes  it would reassure Japan  the second largest economy  after the United States  involved in the TPP talks  Japanese officials have said fast track approval is necessary for the creation of the 12 nation TPP  which would encompass 40 percent of the world economy   Trade votes are never an easy lift around here  but Republicans are continuing to work  and we re seeing some positive momentum in the right direction   House Speaker John Boehner said after a closed door meeting with fellow Republican lawmakers  Exiting the meeting  Representative Paul Ryan  who chairs the powerful House tax committee  said he was  comfortable  that the measure had enough backing in the House  where Republicans have 246 seats to Democrats  188  PLAYING CARDS But some Republicans want concessions from the White House before pledging support for the bill   We hold some cards that we previously haven t held with this president  and I think we ought to play them out   said Republican Kevin Cramer  who wants to lift an oil export ban  a move that would benefit his state of North Dakota  Some Democrats baulked at language that would ensure trade agreements do not lead to changes in U S  laws on immigration or climate change  addressing pet concerns of some Republicans   The vote was scheduled after congressional aides said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Boehner had found a way to pay for the  2 7 billion worker support program without cutting healthcare funding for seniors  A congressional source  who asked not to be identified  said the new funding  worth  700 million  would come from cracking down on illegal tax activities  But because that change would be included in separate legislation  a Democratic aide said members worried it might not pass   a fear that is addressed by having lawmakers vote on that measure first   Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would work  expeditiously  to approve the bill and send it to Obama   Business groups renewed lobbying efforts for fast track  with a personalized letter to each lawmaker signed by Business Roundtable Chairman and AT T Inc  N T  Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson  and Thomas Linebarger  CEO of diesel engine maker  Cummins Inc   N CMI

131823,353338,CMI,U S  proposes tighter emission standards for big trucks,news,"By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Obama administration proposed new rules on Friday to slash greenhouse gas emissions from heavy  long haul trucks  a move to attack climate change that prompted a wary response from industry groups worried about the costs  The complex proposal from the U S  Environmental Protection Agency would apply to 18 wheel tractor trailers  buses  delivery vans  beefy heavy duty pickup trucks and other commercial vehicles  They are part of the administration s broader effort to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation and power sectors of the economy  and precede a new round of global climate change talks in Paris later this year  Public stakeholders  including industry and environmental groups  will have 60 days to comment on the rules  which regulators are expected to finalize early next year   Transportation related greenhouse gases are the second largest source of emissions after power plants  accounting for roughly 27 percent of total emissions   Administration officials said the rules would reduce carbon pollution by 1 1 billion tons  1 billion metric tons   conserve 1 8 billion barrels of oil and cut fuel costs by  170 billion from 2018 to 2027  But the administration could accelerate targeted improvements as new fuel efficient technology becomes available  The new standards call for a 24 percent reduction in the fuel consumption of truck tractors by 2027 from anticipated 2018 levels  The proposed rules also require an 8 percent reduction in carbon emissions from new aerodynamic truck trailer designs  Industry groups expressed concern that the proposal  which would increase the cost of a tractor trailer rig by  10 000 to  12 000  would be a burden to vehicle makers  fleet operators and dealers  The American Trucking Associations said the new goals could lead to the development of unreliable technology that could slow the intended environmental benefits    To prevent this  truck and engine manufacturers will need adequate time to develop solutions to meet these new standards   said Glen Kedzie  ATA s energy and environmental counsel  Among the companies the rules would affect are  Cummins Inc   N CMI    Eaton  Corp  N ETN    Daimler  AG  DE DAIGn  and Volvo AB  ST VOLVb    Environmental organizations and consumer groups praised the action  but some said it might not go far enough   It s an ambitious rule that will accomplish a critical step forward by 2027   said Phyllis Cuttino  director of the clean energy initiative at Pew Charitable Trusts  The rules might be a profit generator for manufacturers of fuel saving technology such as automatic transmissions  lighter weight axles or high mileage tires  Under the proposal  emissions targets will vary for different classes of truck  and will be designed to account for the diverse types of work commercial vehicles do  Chris Grundler  director of the EPA s office of transportation and air quality  said in a teleconference  Grundler said there would be separate standards for  vocational trucks  such as cement mixers  garbage trucks or delivery trucks  and for heavy duty pickups  such as a Ford  N F  F 250 or Chevrolet  N GM  Silverado 2500HD to reflect the types of hauling and driving they do   The proposed standards would measure emissions for tractor trailers based on grams of carbon dioxide emitted per mile for every ton of freight hauled  for example  A large truck that hauls several tons of freight will burn more fuel per mile than a smaller vehicle but could be more efficient than others carrying the same loads  Agency officials said the common benchmark of miles of travel per gallon of fuel consumed was not a  useful  way to describe the proposed performance targets   However  Grundler said that if current long haul trucks average about five to seven miles per gallon  the best performing tractor trailer in 2027 should average about 10 miles per gallon hauling 68 000 pounds of freight at 65 miles per hour  Other sectors are also in the administration s sights

131826,353341,CMI,Autos Power Industrial Production Higher  5 Picks ,opinion,Industrial production experienced its first gains for the year in May  A spurt in motor vehicles and parts output was the highlight of this report  Not only did this propel the headline manufacturing numbers  it also helped offset the negative impact of the decline in production of metals and aerospace equipment Additionally  auto stocks recently received a major reprieve when President Trump decided to indefinitely delay his tariffs on Mexican imports  Nearly every American auto factory is heavily dependent on parts from that country The threat of tariffs on Europe remains  but some economists believe that this could actually boost sales of cars made in the United States  This is why it s a great time to invest in U S  stocks of autos and related parts Largest Increase in Six MonthsIn May  industrial production increased by 0 4   exceeding the consensus estimate of 0 2   This was the metric s largest increase in six months and the first for 2019  Capacity utilization came in at 78 1  marginally higher than the projected level of 78 Gains were largely broad based with motor vehicles and parts production leading the charge with a 2 4  increase  Close behind was the volatile utilities category with a gain of 2 1   This was largely due to higher purchases of air conditioners  an outcome of unusually warm weather  Mining output increased 0 1  Other categories registering increases last month include business equipment  consumer goods  nonindustrial supplies and materials output  The broad based nature of gains helped negate the impact of a few errant categories such as primary metal production  which declined by 1 9   Output of fabricated metals products moved 0 1  lower Autos Power Headline Number  Retail SalesHowever  the focus remained squarely on autos with light truck assemblies increasing to an annualized pace of 8 43 million  significantly higher than April s level of 7 84 million  Auto assemblies increased from 2 44 million to 2 56 million This doesn t come as a major surprise since auto purchases also propelled retail sales higher in May  Auto sales registered a strong rebound last month  gaining 0 7  after registering a decline of 0 5  in April A jump in sales is also a likely consequence of the Big Three  General Motors   NYSE GM    Ford Motor Company   NYSE F   and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   NYSE F   ramping up production of pickup trucks  The demand for larger and heavier vehicles has increased in recent years  thanks to falling gasoline prices Trump s Call to Delay Mexico Tariffs a Major PositiveOn Jun 7  President Trump tweeted that he was suspending his plans to impose tariffs on Mexico  indefinitely   He also stated that Mexico had agreed to take strict measures to stop such immigration and work toward stemming the  tide of Migration through Mexico  and to our Southern  NYSE SO  Border  Trump s decision was warmly welcomed by U S  automakers  The importance of access to auto parts and accessories made in Mexico for the U S  auto industry cannot be stressed enough  The proposed 25  tariff on Mexican imports would raise the cost of completed vehicles and parts by nearly  28 billion a year   Our ChoicesThe auto sector is hugely responsible for the improvement in industrial production in May  The sector also powered the spurt in retail sales last month  Trump s decision to delay tariffs on Mexican imports is a major positive for the sector Investing in auto stocks looks like a smart choice now  However  picking

131854,353369,CMI,Obama touts trade in meeting with Brazil official,news,"  CEOs urge steps toward a bilateral trade agreement
   Recommendation that U S  scrap ethanol tariff
   U S  denies dragging feet at Doha trade talks round
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON  July 21  Reuters    President Barack Obama said
on Tuesday he wants stronger ties with Brazil  especially in
the commercial area  a top aide and possible successor to
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said 
  He made what I consider a very strong and important
statement   Lula s chief of staff Dilma Rousseff  speaking
through a translator  said at the end of the U S  Brazil CEO
Forum  which brings together top U S  business and top
government officials from each country 
 Rousseff  who is Lula s preferred candidate in Brazil s
2010 presidential election  said Obama dropped in on her and
other forum participants during a meeting in the office of
White House national security adviser Jim Jones 
 The forum consists of 10 business leaders each from the
United States and Brazil  who meet at least once every six
months to make recommendations to the two governments on how
to expand trade and investment ties 
 Bilateral trade between the two countries reached about
 63 4 billion in 2008  The United States enjoyed a rare  but
small  surplus with its llth largest trading partner 
 Tim Solso  president of Cummins Inc and the U S 
co chairman of the forum  said the participants urged the two
countries to begin talks on a Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement as a stepping stone to a broader trade pact 
 White House deputy national security adviser Michael
Froman said the two governments would explore that
possibility  but had not made any decision yet 
 Brazil s Minister of Development  Industry and Foreign
Trade Miguel Jorge also also participated in the forum  along
with U S  Commerce Secretary Gary Locke 
 The two sides discussed progress on bilateral tax and
investment treaties  as well as ways the two countries could
cooperate on developing renewable energy source and addressing
global climate change  officials said 
 The CEOs recommended the United States eliminate its tariff
on ethanol imports  a move that would benefit Brazil but face
strong opposition from U S  corn growers and their proponents
in Congress  such as Senator Charles Grassley 
 The government and business leaders called for conclusion
of the long running Doha round of world trade talks 
 Froman denied the United States was dragging its feet in
those negotiations  as some diplomats at World Trade
Organization headquarters in Geneva have complained 
 U S  Trade Representative Ron Kirk has been  very active
and engaged   including meeting this week in Singapore with
trade ministers from the Asia Pacific region  he said 
 Rousseff blamed the slowdown in the talks on the global
financial crisis  rather than the Obama administration 
  I believe that we ll sooner or later continue to an
updated variant of the Doha round     I m not pessimistic
about the situation   Rousseff said

	President Trump s sudden tariff Tweets threatened to take all the air out of the market on Monday  but then stocks mounted an impressive rebound that almost got the major indices back to breakeven 
	The Dow plunged nearly 500 points at the open after the President warned that he would increase tariffs on  250 billion in Chinese goods to 25  from 10  as soon as Friday  He s also thinking about putting tariffs of 25  on  325 billion worth of additional goods 
	The news came as quite a shock  The market has been told time and time again that negotiations were going well and a deal was imminent 
	But once the initial shock wore off  the index spent the whole day recovering from the morning dip since investors still seem confident that a deal will eventually get done  The Dow finished lower by only 0 25   or about 66 points  to 26 438 48 
	The other major indices took the same trajectory  The S P was off by 0 45  to 2932 47 and the NASDAQ declined 0 50  to 8123 29  Both of these indices reached new all time highs last week  and remain within striking distance of getting back thanks to today s rebound 
	So what happened  We ve been hearing that all the negotiators were best friends and a deal could be reached in the next few weeks  maybe as early as this Friday  Well  we knew that the longer it took to get an agreement  the more chance that something could derail the whole process 
	Fortunately  nothing has been derailed yet  The plan was always to have more meetings between the countries in Washington this week  and those plans are still proceeding despite the tough trade talk  Furthermore  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will apparently be part of the discussions  which had been called into question after today s drama 
	So did the trade deal die today  Or were these Tweets some sort of negotiating tactic  It s obvious that the market doesn t think it s time to throw in the towel  The comeback on Monday showed that optimism is still high  And why wouldn t it be  We re in the late stages of a better than expected earnings season  while Q1 GDP came in at 3 2  and the April employment report added more than 260 000 jobs   
	But it was a good reminder that nothing is a sure thing until the U S  and China sign on the dotted line  Today s Portfolio Highlights Surprise Trader  The earnings trend for video game developer Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  has turned the corner into a positive direction  which leaves Dave feeling pretty good about its report after the bell tomorrow  Plus  the stock has an impressive Earnings ESP of 11 35  for the quarter  The editor added EA on Monday with a 12 5  allocation  but first he made room by selling WillScot  WSC  for a 5 2  return in less than a week  See the complete commentary for more TAZR Trader  The subscription economy is growing sharply with no end in sight  so Kevin decided to buy THE meta provider of cloud services in this area  Zuora  ZUO  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that the editor has been watching since it IPO d last year  With several institutions bullish on ZUO  he felt this was a good time to add the stock with a 10  allocation  Learn more about this buy in the complete commentary Black Box Trader  This week s adjustment replaced more than half of the portfolio  The six names that were sold today include

131936,353451,CMI,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Cummins  CMI  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cummins  CMI   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cummins currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CMI is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this engine maker holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CMI  shares are up 3 58  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines industry is up 2 7  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 0 47  compares favorably with the industry s 0 24  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Cummins have risen 9 21   and are up 13 15  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 6 51  and 8 49   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CMI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CMI is averaging 1 129 432 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CMI 
Over the past two months  12 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CMI s consensus estimate  increasing from  15 46 to  16 19 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 3 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CMI is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Cummins on your short list ",2019-05-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-cummins-cmi-is-a-great-choice-200420127,200420127

131962,353477,CMI,Cummins  CMI  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Cummins  CMI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engine maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 51 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 4  
Revenues are expected to be  5 81 billion  up 4 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 39  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cummins 
For Cummins  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 02  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cummins will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cummins would post earnings of  3 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 48  delivering a surprise of  8 90  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cummins appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cummins-cmi-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200409527,200409527

132027,353542,CMI,Why Cummins  CMI  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Cummins  CMI   which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines industry 
This engine maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10 40  
For the last reported quarter  Cummins came out with earnings of  4 05 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 75 per share  representing a surprise of 8   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  3 67 per share and it actually produced earnings of  4 14 per share  delivering a surprise of 12 81  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Cummins lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cummins has an Earnings ESP of  5 90  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 6  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cummins-cmi-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200376750,200376750
132028,353543,CMI,Cummins  CMI  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Cummins  CMI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This engine maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 82 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26 1  
Revenues are expected to be  6 09 billion  up 11 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 39  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cummins 
For Cummins  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cummins will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cummins would post earnings of  3 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 05  delivering a surprise of  8  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

132098,353613,CMI,Proposed Steel Aluminum Tariff Increase  A Cheap Thrill ,opinion,"New Fed Chairman Powell had just finished his Senate testimony  Market participants were digesting the morning s economic data and the likely Fed reaction 
Then something happened  Normally I am skeptical of the post hoc analysis of market moves  but this one was clear  President Trump announced the intention to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum  Stocks for those companies moved higher  Stocks steel and aluminum consumers moved lower   much lower   as did the entire market  Unlike most market moves  the causation was obvious 
With Thursday s stock declines added to those of the two days preceding  many investors are paying attention  I want to do a factual analysis of the situation  and then venture some suggestions for investors 
Can the President Do This 
Simply put  yes  Congress has delegated very broad powers to the President  Even when policy is shifting  requirements are for consultation  not formal approval  If the President invokes a national security threat  the authority is even greater 
The  analyzed the powers  noting the potential for challenges in court  Perhaps  but the inherent delay in that process would render this response irrelevant 
The  analyzed these powers before the election  This table provides a nice summary 

What are the Economic Issues 
The key question relates to the costs and benefits of free trade for a particular country  Wikipedia may not be the leading source on economics  but the basic story is often both clear and accurate  Here is the entry on the  underlying free trade 
 developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in  even when one country s workers are more efficient at producing every single good than workers in other countries  He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the   then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good  provided that there exist differences in  between both countries  Widely regarded as one of the most powerful yet counter intuitive insights in economics  Ricardo s theory implies that comparative advantage rather than  is responsible for much of international trade 
There is no principle in economics that is more widely accepted by those who have studied the subject 
What are the Political Issues 
The trade issue lends itself to a phenomenon that I call  perception dichotomy   One side of the issue seems obvious while the other is more nuanced  It is easy to see the impact on the producer companies   losses to foreign markets with consequent declines in jobs  The impact on consumers is much more difficult to grasp  It is not just higher prices  It can be the loss of sales to businesses who can no longer compete after dealing with higher  steel   raw material prices 
The immediately affected industries are easy to spot  easy to visit for photo ops  and easy to quantify in terms of jobs  The diffuse effect on consuming industries is more difficult 
Traditionally  Democrats have used the anti free trade argument while Republicans have endorsed the overall economic benefits of trade agreements  Bill Clinton crossed this line  forging some bipartisan agreements 
A switch in international trade posture is also a switch in the traditional party alignment 
What Will Happen 
Making this kind of forecast is always treacherous  but the forces here are clear cut  The economic theory is widely and tangibly appreciated by consumers of steel and aluminum  I expect the President to back off from Thursday s pre announcement  It will be a trial balloon  a cheap thrill  an easy claim to a news cycle 
Please note  This is not a criticism of the President or his team  If I were advising him  I might suggest a similar approach  How different is this from the  DACA agreement  which quickly disappeared  or the surprising reversal on gun control 
Floating trial balloons can be an effective ploy 
Investment Implications
Before this announcement  I had been considering some steel stocks  but they popped too much on this  questionable   news 
The combined Trump Powell meme was stagflation   the opposite of what I expect  The President may well achieve some negotiation triumphs with China  Canada  and Mexico  but these will not feature big tariffs  The overall economic prospects remain strong  so I like the stocks that were unfairly punished in Thursday s selling  One example is Cummins  Inc   NYSE CMI  which I bought near the close  There are other good  similar choices for those who understand the overall strength of the economy and corporate earnings ",2018-03-02,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/proposed-tariff-increase-a-cheap-thrill-200295471,200295471

132100,353615,CMI,Should Value Investors Consider Cummins  CMI  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cummins Inc    NYSE CMI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cummins has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cummins  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 3 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a great entry point However  the stock s PE stands above the Zacks Auto   Tires   Trucks sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 4  This indicates that the stock is relatively stretched right now  compared to its peers Nonetheless  we should also point out that Cummins has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Cummins stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cummins has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cummins currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cummins a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Cummins might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives CMI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has jumped 6 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cummins Inc  Price and Consensus    However  this bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nevertheless  the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock s prospects in the near term look good Bottom LineCummins is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 48  of more than 250 industries  which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names

Last Week Recap
In my  I asked whether the Trump Trade had reached a tipping point  That was a good guess  since the week was filled with sharp market moves driven by hints  tweets  comments  and speculation about each  Each day there was a different explanation 
Monday   Trump officials walking back some of the China rhetoric  News of an FBI raid on Michael Cohen s office seemed link to last hour selling 
Tuesday   Chinese President Xi Jinping s speech at the Boao Forum was interpreted as conciliatory  Overnight futures had already rebounded from the late selling but moved much higher on the news 
Wednesday   President Trump warned that a strike against Syria was imminent 
Thursday   Seemed to confuse even the punditry  You can always spot this when they start using  delayed reactions  and a sudden burst of worry about an old issue 
Friday   Strong start from bank earnings turned into selling attributed to   some geopolitical angst prompted investors to take some money off the table ahead of the weekend  
These twists and turns are apparent in the chart below  I doubt that  investors  had much to do with them 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I especially like the version  She includes a lot of valuable information in a single visual  The full post has even more charts and analysis  so check it out 

The gain for the week was about 2   and the trading range was a bit smaller than it has been in recent weeks  I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in our Indicator Snapshot section below 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Feel free to add items that I have missed  Please keep in mind that we are looking for current news  especially from the last week or so  WTWA is not about long term concerns like debt  These are important  of course  but not our weekly subject unless there has been some major change 
The Good

High frequency indicators  remain positive  although the long leading forecast is weakening a bit

Debt projections  This is not a new story  but there were important reports this week  The CBO released new projections   has an excellent analysis  noting as follows 

The Federal government is not only running enormous deficits  but we are doing so at a time of full employment  When the inevitable recession comes  we will be in deep trouble 


Here s the bad part  Under current law  CBO projects that the debt currently 77 percent as large as annual GDP will rise to 96 percent of GDP by 2028  And that s if Congress does nothing  If instead  Congress votes to extend expiring tax provisions such as the many temporary tax cuts in the 2017 tax overhaul and maintain spending levels enacted in the budget deal  which is called the  current policy  baseline   debt is projected to rise to 105 percent of GDP by 2028  the highest level ever except for one year during World War II  when it was 106 percent

The Ugly

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a normal economic calendar  featuring retail sales and housing data  including starts and permits  Corporate earnings will outrank the data in significance 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
The economic calendar emphasizes housing data and retail sales  but attention will turn to corporate earnings reports for Q118  The strong early reports on Friday failed to sustain an early rally in stocks  This caused many to describe this as a  sell the news  situation 
The quest to find an explanation for every market move left many wondering if a strong earnings season was  baked in  to stock prices  Unless earnings reports fuel a more sustained rally  I expect many to be asking 
Do Stock Prices Already Reflect Strong Earnings Growth 
To answer the question  we cannot avoid some analysis of what is behind the market moves  In my review of last week  the daily analysis offered little of substance  Let s organize it by the market significance of the issues  understanding that the social or human importance is much different  Drawing upon several of the better market commentators and my own observations  I suggest the following 

Threats to free trade generate the biggest response  with many fearing more than the initial impact on GDP 
Immigration has a major impact on economic growth  So far  this has gotten little attention  but it is relevant to earnings 
Scandals and accusations have a knee jerk effect  but no clear link to stocks  The headline risk is a gridlocked malaise  The few historical analogies are negative for stocks  but without a clear causal link or analysis of similarities and differences 
International crises  Once again  these threats generate an immediate market reaction  Some traders sell because they know that others will be selling 

In all of these cases a trading reaction often gets an investment interpretation  We must balance this against the expected earnings growth    and the potential impact on stock prices  The bottom up target price for the S P 500 is an increase of 16 2    calculates this by aggregating the median target price estimates from industry analysts 
 whether earnings will save the rally 

As usual  I ll save my own conclusions for today s Final Thought

The Indicator Snapshot


Short term trading conditions remained poor this week  In mildly bearish conditions our trading approaches can still be profitable  but that might not be true for everyone  We continue to monitor the technical health measures on a daily basis  If this indicator goes to fullish bearish  we liquidate trading  not investment  positions  We are not quite at that point  but I have rounded the result to  5   This is not a forecast that the market will decline  It indicates increased difficulty in trading profitably 
The long term fundamentals and outlook are little changed  Based upon historical data for this indicator  I have increased the 9 month recession probability to the 18  range  I am monitoring  but not yet especially worried  The long term technical health is 1 5  but I rounded it up

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Dan Egan s excellent  recently updated  post about safety net funds  He writes 

First  let s get one myth out of the way  Cash savings accounts are not risk free  Why  Because after accounting for inflation there is about a one in three chance you won t get back the money you put in  in real terms 


Today  with  hovering far beneath 1 percent  it s almost guaranteed that you ll make a negative real return over the next few years  This means your safety net fund will need topping up year after year to maintain its real value  It also means that you ll have a significant amount of wealth that is not growing  potentially for a long period of time 

He goes on to show the benefit of including a stock allocation  analyzing 40  as an example  He considers 50 years of rolling five year periods and analyzes the worst cases 



No formulaic allocation is right for everyone  but this is a good illustration  Most investors who are 100  allocated to cash for safety funds or more do so from fear   why investors should just calm down when volatility goes up  citing research from Prudential  LON PRU  Financial  s global investment group  The results report investment returns before  during  and after volatility spikes

5 Dividend Stocks That Guarantee Growth and Stability

	While investors avoid stocks that do not have juicy yields  it is true that these low yield stocks have a solid history of dividend growth that lead to outperformance 

Dividend Growth  A Winning Strategy
	Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds    potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market  This is because these stocks belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction 
	Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth have superior fundamentals and form a healthy and safe portfolio as opposed to those that have high yields  Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term 
	Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a hike is likely in the future 
	Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero   This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero   This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero   This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero   This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry   A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight     This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks Rank   Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment VGM  of B or better    This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum  This when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 offers the best upside potential

132539,354054,CMI,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Volkswagen  Toyota Motor  General Motors  Cummins And Fox Factory Holding,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 09  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Autos  Part 1  including Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG  OTCMKTS         Toyota Motor Corp   NYSE         General Motors  NYSE         Cummins Inc  NYSE CMI    NYSE        and Fox Factory Holding Corp  NASDAQ        

	Industry  Autos  Part 1

	Link  

	The last two years have been exceptional for the auto sector  Sales in the U S  saw record highs in both years  while China and Europe sales have caught up 

	According to    global auto sales for 2017 are estimated at around 93 5 million units  Moreover  automakers are benefiting from an increase in sales of higher margin vehicles  such as SUVs and light trucks  due to low fuel prices 

	On the other hand  automakers bore the brunt of expenses related to safety recalls and negative currency effects  Massive recalls related to Volkswagen AG s  OTCMKTS        emission scandal and Takata Corp s defective airbag inflators have been hurting the auto sector in recent years  Rising delinquency rates in auto loans are expected to hurt sales in the future 

	Despite the emission scandal  Volkswagen managed to become the highest selling automaker in 2016  With 10 3 million units  it edged past Toyota Motor Corp   NYSE       that sold 10 2 million vehicles globally  In fact  Toyota has given up the leading position for four years in a row now  General Motors  NYSE        ranked third 

Zacks Industry Rank   Positive Outlook

	The distinctive attributes of the auto industry prompted us to have a dedicated sector for the industry in our database  The automobile sector is one of the 16 Zacks sectors  unlike the S P classification  wherein autos is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector  The S P has 10 sectors compared with the 16 sectors for Zacks 

	At the expanded classification level  the Zacks auto sector is divided into six industries  Auto Domestic  Auto Foreign  Auto Truck Original  Auto Truck Replacement  Engines and Tires  The sector s retail operations are part of the Zacks Retail sector in two industries  Auto Trucks and Other Auto Parts  The level of sensitivity and exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry 

	The current Zacks Industry Rank is  37 for Automotive   Domestic   95 for Automotive   Foreign   74 for Automotive   Original Equipment   204 for Automotive   Replacement Parts   104 for Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines   218 for Rubber   Tires   77 for Automotive   Retail and Whole Sales and  247 for Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts  As a reference point  the outlook for industries with a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative  

	This implies that the outlook for auto related industries is positive  You can see this in the new  that shows the Auto sector at the number 3 spot  behind only Industrial Products and Basic Materials sectors 

	We rank all 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each 

Sector Level Earnings Trend

	The auto sector is expected to contribute 2 0  to the total S P 500 earnings in 2017  This is double its 1  market cap weight in the index at present 

	Looking at the fourth quarter 2016 results of the auto sector  earnings fell 20 2   Auto sector earnings are expected to decline 7 3  in the first quarter of 2017 and 10 5  in the second quarter  placing the sector among the laggards  However  earnings are expected to rise starting the fourth quarter of 2017 

	Total revenue increased 2 4  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2016  Revenues are expected to move up 0 2  in the first quarter of 2017 and 1 3  in the second quarter 

	In line with the weak outlook for the upcoming quarters  earnings for 2017 are expected to decline 4 3  over 2016  Also  revenues for the year are expected to go down 0 6  

	For more information on earnings for this sector and others  please read our latest  report 

Bottom Line

	The auto sector is currently facing several opportunities as well as challenges  While low fuel prices  attractive financing options and impressive vehicle launches are driving sales  slowing sales growth in the U S   rising auto loan defaults and high levels of safety recalls act as dampeners 

	Nevertheless  the IHS Automotive projection for global vehicle sales for 2017 is encouraging  At this juncture  we recommend stocks such as Cummins Inc   NYSE       and Fox Factory Holding Corp  NASDAQ        

	Cummins has an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 9 8   It recorded average earnings beat of 14 5  over the last four quarters  Cummins carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 

	Fox Factory carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company has an expected earnings growth rate of around 16 1  for the long term  Fox Factory posted positive average surprise of 15 9  over the last four quarters

132540,354055,CMI,Auto Sales In U S  Up  China And Europe Gain,opinion,"Low fuel costs and improving macroeconomic factors helped the auto sector record impressive volumes in 2016  While sales hit an all time high in the U S   China and Europe also reported strong volumes  Meanwhile  low fuel prices led to increased sales of higher margin vehicle segments  such as SUVs and light trucks 
However  the sector is facing certain challenges  the most significant one being massive recall volumes  particularly due to defective Takata airbag inflators and the Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG  VLKAY  emission scandal  Moreover  sales growth in the U S  is projected to slow down this year 
Still  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry for both the short and long term  Below  we discuss some of the key factors that should continue to drive the sector s performance in the near to medium term 
OPPORTUNITIES
Record Sales in the U S  
U S light vehicle sales inched up 0 3  to 17 55 million units in 2016  Although the percentage of increase was low  sales volumes surpassed the all time record set in 2015  Moreover  2016 was marked as the seventh consecutive year of increase in sales 
Results were driven by higher employment levels  low fuel prices  easy availability of credit  attractive incentives and economic stability  Product segments like trucks and utility vehicles continued to record strong sales 
Most analysts expect U S  auto sales to remain strong in 2017  although volumes may be lower than 2016 levels  Strong macroeconomic factors such as rising employment and personal income as well as low fuel prices will continue to drive sales  Moreover  sales of high margin product segments such as pickup trucks  SUVs and crossover vehicles are expected to remain strong this year  Per   total global light vehicle sales in 2017 will touch 93 5 million units  up 1 5  from 2016 
Further  the high average age of cars on U S  roads should continue to boost replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  The average age increased to 11 6 years in 2016  according to   Moreover  by 2021  around 81 million vehicles are expected to be over 16 years old compared with 62 million vehicles today   This will benefit replacement part manufacturers and retailers  apart from new vehicle manufacturers and retailers 
Sales in China Rev Up
Many automakers  including the likes of Ford Motor Co   F  and General Motors Company  NYSE GM   GM   have been banking on strong sales growth in China to drive earnings over the next few years  Auto sales in the world s largest automobile market increased 14 5  year over year to a record 28 119 000 units in 2016  Sales of passenger cars increased 14 9  to almost 24 38 million units  hitting a new record  Moreover  sales of commercial vehicles improved 5 8  year over year 
So far in 2017  both passenger cars and commercial vehicles recorded strong sales in China  Sales of passenger cars increased 4 6  year on year to almost 5 95 million units in the first three months of 2017  while sales of commercial vehicles rose 22 9  to 1 05 million units  Consequently  total automobile sales increased 7  year over year to more than 7 million units 
Sustained Recovery in European Union
New passenger car registrations in the European Union increased 8 4  to over 1 14 million units in the first three months of 2017  as per the   All major markets posted strong growth during the period  Rising consumer confidence  solid incentives  strong replacement demand and product launches are driving sales 
Following six years of decline  sales of passenger cars in the European Union turned around with a 5 7  year over year increase in 2014 and another 9 3  increase in 2015  The recovery continued in 2016 with a 6 8  year over year increase in passenger car registrations  Sales are expected to improve further this year 
Low Gas Prices 
While gasoline prices have been trending higher in recent months  they are significantly below the levels attained in the 2011 2014 period  Low fuel prices are a major tailwind for automakers  As fuel becomes more affordable  sales of gasoline powered vehicles   especially the larger ones that carry a wider profit margin   get a boost 
Although sales of hybrids and electronic vehicles suffer from this trend  the sales volume is significantly lower than gasoline powered vehicles  Hence  the positive impact of low gas prices outweighs the negatives for the auto sector 
Attractive  Tech Savvy Vehicle Launches
Rising sales and intense competition are encouraging automakers to come up with new and attractive  technologically advanced vehicles to gain market share  Most automakers are also revamping their popular vehicles by adding new technologies and enhancing their visual appeal to revive sales  Features such as backup cameras  automatic emergency braking and in car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments 
In fact  automakers are offering attractive optional features in vehicles to scoop up more profits  These features provide scope for surplus revenue generation from small cars  which have lower profit margins than large trucks 
Bottom Line
The auto industry is benefiting from many factors  According to IHS Automotive  global auto sales figures for 2017 are expected to reach 93 5 million units  up 1 5  over 2016  Volumes are expected to be strong this year as well  driven by sturdy sales in key markets  Moreover  sales in China are expected to grow 1 9  year over year in 2017  This represents a good buying opportunity for investors with longer term plans 
Some auto sector companies worth considering include Cummins Inc  NYSE CMI    CMI   Fox Factory Holding Corp  FOXF  and GKN  LON GKN  plc  GKNLY  
Cummins has an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 9 8   It recorded an average earnings beat of 14 5  over the last four quarters  Cummins carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Fox Factory carries a Zacks Rank  1  The company has an expected earnings growth rate of around 16 6  for the long term  Fox Factory posted a positive average surprise of 13 8  over the last four quarters

	New passenger car registrations in the European Union increased 8 4  to over 1 14 million units in the first three months of 2017  as per the    All major markets posted strong growth during the period  Rising consumer confidence  solid incentives  strong replacement demand and product launches are driving sales 

	Following six years of decline  sales of passenger cars in the European Union turned around with a 5 7  year over year increase in 2014 and another 9 3  increase in 2015  The recovery continued in 2016 with a 6 8  year over year increase in passenger car registrations  Sales are expected to improve further this year 

Low Gas Prices 

	While gasoline prices have been trending higher in recent months  they are significantly below the levels attained in the 2011 2014 period  Low fuel prices are a major tailwind for automakers  As fuel becomes more affordable  sales of gasoline powered vehicles   especially the larger ones that carry a wider profit margin   get a boost 

	Although sales of hybrids and electronic vehicles suffer from this trend  the sales volume is significantly lower than gasoline powered vehicles  Hence  the positive impact of low gas prices outweighs the negatives for the auto sector 

Attractive  Tech Savvy Vehicle Launches

	Rising sales and intense competition are encouraging automakers to come up with new and attractive  technologically advanced vehicles to gain market share  Most automakers are also revamping their popular vehicles by adding new technologies and enhancing their visual appeal to revive sales  Features such as backup cameras  automatic emergency braking and in car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments 

	In fact  automakers are offering attractive optional features in vehicles to scoop up more profits  These features provide scope for surplus revenue generation from small cars  which have lower profit margins than large trucks 

Bottom Line

	The auto industry is benefiting from many factors  According to IHS Automotive  global auto sales figures for 2017 are expected to reach 93 5 million units  up 1 5  over 2016  Volumes are expected to be strong this year as well  driven by sturdy sales in key markets  Moreover  sales in China are expected to grow 1 9  year over year in 2017  This represents a good buying opportunity for investors with longer term plans 

	Some auto sector companies worth considering include Cummins Inc   NYSE         Fox Factory Holding Corp  NASDAQ        and GKN plc  OTCMKTS

132580,354095,CMI,Auto Industry Stock Outlook   May 2017,opinion,"The last two years have been exceptional for the auto sector  Sales in the U S  saw record highs in both years  while China and Europe sales have caught up 
According to   global auto sales for 2017 are estimated at around 93 5 million units  Moreover  automakers are benefiting from an increase in sales of higher margin vehicles  such as SUVs and light trucks  due to low fuel prices 
On the other hand  automakers bore the brunt of expenses related to safety recalls and negative currency effects  Massive recalls related to Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG s  VLKAY  emission scandal and Takata Corp s defective airbag inflators have been hurting the auto sector in recent years  Rising delinquency rates in auto loans are expected to hurt sales in the future 
Despite the emission scandal  Volkswagen managed to become the highest selling automaker in 2016  With 10 3 million units  it edged past Toyota Motor Corp   TM  that sold 10 2 million vehicles globally  In fact  Toyota has given up the leading position for four years in a row now  General Motors  GM  ranked third 
Zacks Industry Rank   Positive Outlook
The distinctive attributes of the auto industry prompted us to have a dedicated sector for the industry in our database  The automobile sector is one of the 16 Zacks sectors  unlike the S P classification  wherein autos is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector  The S P has 10 sectors compared with the 16 sectors for Zacks 
At the expanded classification level  the Zacks auto sector is divided into six industries  Auto Domestic  Auto Foreign  Auto Truck Original  Auto Truck Replacement  Engines and Tires  The sector s retail operations are part of the Zacks Retail sector in two industries  Auto Trucks and Other Auto Parts  The level of sensitivity and exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry 
The current Zacks Industry Rank is  37 for Automotive   Domestic   95 for Automotive   Foreign   74 for Automotive   Original Equipment   204 for Automotive   Replacement Parts   104 for Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines   218 for Rubber   Tires   77 for Automotive   Retail and Whole Sales and  247 for Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts  As a reference point  the outlook for industries with a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative  
This implies that the outlook for auto related industries is positive  You can see this in the new  that shows the Auto sector at the number 3 spot  behind only Industrial Products and Basic Materials sectors 
We rank all 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each 
Sector Level Earnings Trend
The auto sector is expected to contribute 2 0  to the total S P 500 earnings in 2017  This is double its 1  market cap weight in the index at present 
Looking at the fourth quarter 2016 results of the auto sector  earnings fell 20 2   Auto sector earnings are expected to decline 7 3  in the first quarter of 2017 and 10 5  in the second quarter  placing the sector among the laggards  However  earnings are expected to rise starting the fourth quarter of 2017 
Total revenue increased 2 4  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2016  Revenues are expected to move up 0 2  in the first quarter of 2017 and 1 3  in the second quarter 
In line with the weak outlook for the upcoming quarters  earnings for 2017 are expected to decline 4 3  over 2016  Also  revenues for the year are expected to go down 0 6  
For more information on earnings for this sector and others  please read our latest  report 
Bottom Line
The auto sector is currently facing several opportunities as well as challenges  While low fuel prices  attractive financing options and impressive vehicle launches are driving sales  slowing sales growth in the U S   rising auto loan defaults and high levels of safety recalls act as dampeners 
Nevertheless  the IHS Automotive projection for global vehicle sales for 2017 is encouraging  At this juncture  we recommend stocks such as Cummins Inc  NYSE CMI    CMI   Fox Factory Holding Corp  FOXF  and GKN  LON GKN  plc  GKNLY  
Cummins has an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 9 8   It recorded average earnings beat of 14 5  over the last four quarters  Cummins carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Fox Factory carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company has an expected earnings growth rate of around 16 1  for the long term  Fox Factory posted positive average surprise of 15 9  over the last four quarters 
GKN holds a Zacks Rank  2 and has a long term growth rate of 6

The overall projections for the auto sector s Q3 earnings remain weak  By the end of the earnings season  auto sector earnings and revenues are expected to be down 8 8  and 4 7   respectively  This will place it among the worst performers in the 16 Zacks sectors  In comparison  total S P 500 earnings are projected to improve 2 0   with revenues also rising 1 4  year over year 
The fall in U S  auto sales over the last two months is affecting the results of many automakers  The pressure to maintain attractive incentives and deals may also strain their margins  Further  expenses related to safety recalls as well as the adverse impact of foreign currency translation remain headwinds for the sector  However  there are a few positives as well  Strong sales growth in China and Europe is the primary driving factor for the auto sector in Q3  Moreover  low fuel prices are driving the sales of higher margin vehicle segments  such as SUVs and light trucks

132643,354158,CMI,CMI  Is Cummins  High Dividend Yield Safe ,opinion,"Cummins  NYSE CMI  reported a double digit sales decline during the second quarter of 2016 and expects full year revenue to slump about 10  
Lower truck production in North America and dismal global demand for off highway vehicles and power generation equipment are weighing on the company 
As the company s key end markets continue reeling  investors are beginning to wonder how safe Cummins  dividend payment is 
After all  cyclical industrial businesses are not often the best place to find safe dividends 
Before analyzing Cummins  dividend  let s quickly review the business itself  My full thesis on the company can be seen  
Cummins has been in business for nearly 100 years and recorded total sales of  19 1 billion in 2015  The company manufactures and services diesel and natural gas engines  35  of revenue   electric power generation systems  16    and engine related components  22    e g  fuel systems  controls  filtration  emission solutions  
Cummins also owns distributors  27   that provide aftermarket services and support to 7 200 dealer locations 
Some of the company s representative customers are Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  NYSE FCAU   Daimler AG NA O N   DE DAIGn   Volvo  AB ser  B  ST VOLVb   Navistar International Corporation  NYSE NAV   Komatsu Ltd   T 6301   and Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  
By geography  North America accounts for 60  of revenue  Europe   the Middle East  14    Asia Pacific  8    and China  7   are also important regions 
Cummins has proven to be a durable business with leading market share positions over the years for several reasons 
The company invests heavily in research and development to ensure its engines comply with extensive regulatory requirements for emission and noise 
In addition to its technology edge  Cummins maintains long term engine supply agreements with key customers to ensure stable pricing and well engineered vehicles  New entrants would struggle to crack these sticky relationships 
Customers like Cummins for its technology quality and reliability  The company s global distribution network has a presence in more than 190 countries  ensuring that appropriate support is in place to service customers  engines and maximize uptime  Smaller players cannot offer such a comprehensive support network 
Let s take a closer look at the dividend to see if Cummins can continue making payments despite the downturn in many of its markets Cummins  Dividend SafetyMy goal is to never be found holding a company that cuts its dividend  While this is perhaps a lofty objective  I believe that a number of warning signs are given off before a company actually reduces its dividend 
The most likely companies to cut their dividends usually have some combination of high payout ratios  weak free cash flow generation  declining sales and earnings  overleveraged balance sheets  and no proven commitment to paying and growing dividends over time 
Tracking these key metrics is time consuming  which is why I created a Dividend Safety Score to help me keep tabs on all of these factors for companies I am interested in 
Our Dividend Safety Score analyzes 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to answer the question   Is the current dividend payment safe  
We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and free cash flow payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  profitability trends  and more 
A Dividend Safety Score of 50 is average  75 or higher is considered excellent  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Most companies that end up cutting their dividends score below 25 prior to announcing their dividend reduction 
Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   Potash  BHP Billiton  LON BLT   and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  all scored below 20 for Dividend Safety before announcing their dividend cuts 
Investors in Cummins can find some relief in knowing that the company has a strong Dividend Safety Score of 82 
Cummins  payout ratios over the last 12 months remain very healthy  even for a cyclical business  The company s earnings per share and free cash flow per share  sit at 53  and 44   respectively 
Even if Cummins  free cash flow was cut in half from here  it would still cover the dividend 
Looking further back  we can see that Cummins has historically maintained a relatively low and stable payout ratio  highlighting the company s consistent earnings generation and conservative capital allocation Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Of course  Cummins  business is sensitive to the economy  which is generally not good for dividend safety  The company s sales fell 25  in fiscal year 2009  and CMI s stock plunged nearly 60  in 2008  underperforming the S P 500 by 20  
The company s performance during the next recession will likely be a little stronger  Cummins has been acquiring its distributors over the last few years  improving its mix of aftermarket parts and services  Distributors now account for close to 30  of total revenue and should see steadier demand trends throughout a full business cycle Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite the steep drop in revenue during the last recession  Cummins  strong cost controls and working capital management preserved free cash flow  which is used to pay out dividends 
As seen below  free cash flow per share edged down just 4  in 2008 and actually increased 76  in 2009 to  4 23 per share  which more than covers the company s current dividend of  4 10 per share 
Cummins has been an extremely reliable free cash flow generator for more than a decade  strengthening the safety profile of its dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Dividend safety can be severely impacted by a company s balance sheet  especially for cyclical companies such as Cummins 
Dividend payments can be jeopardized if an unexpected downturn in demand hits and a company has too much debt relative to its depressed cash flows  Businesses will always make their debt payments before issuing dividends 
Cummins  balance sheet is in great shape  The company has  1 28 billion in cash compared to  1 65 billion in total book debt 
No major long term debt is due until 2023  which gives the company plenty of flexibility to continue reinvesting in its business and returning cash to shareholders even if macro conditions remain soft 
With a long term debt to capital ratio below 20  and strong credit ratings  Cummins should have  as well if it ever desired to borrow more money Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As a sign of financial strength  Cummins increased its dividend in July by 5 1  despite weak quarterly results 
Management is very committed to the dividend  Cummins has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1993 and increased its dividend every year since 2006 
Shareholders have enjoyed a rising yield on cost and strong double digit dividend growth rates over the last 20 years  making Cummins one of the fastest income growers in the market Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Incremental dividend growth will remain more modest until macro headwinds have subsided  but income investors can sleep well knowing that Cummins  dividend payments are very safe Closing Thoughts on Cummins  DividendCyclical companies should always be approached with an extra level of caution  While some of their dividend payments are safe  their stock prices can be whipped around with little notice as end market conditions and market sentiment rapidly change 
Despite its higher stock price volatility  Cummins is well positioned to continue paying its dividend even if market conditions worsen 
The company maintains reasonable payout ratios  generates excellent free cash flow  is increasing its mix of stable aftermarket business  has a healthy balance sheet  and has demonstrated its commitment to the dividend for nearly 25 years 
For conservative income investors able to stomach the ups and downs of Cummins  end markets  the stock s 3 2  yield could be appealing ",2016-08-15,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cmi:-is-cummins'-high-dividend-yield-safe-200147941,200147941
132680,354195,CMI,Deere Report Should Shed Light On Downtrend In Farming,opinion," N DE   manufacturer of agriculture and construction equipment  reports fiscal fourth quarter results before today s opening bell  Currently  the Estimize earnings consensus is a decent clip ahead of Wall Street s 
The Estimize community is calling for EPS of  0 81 vs  the Street s  0 74  However  Estimize is looking for lower revenues of  6 271B as compared to the Street s  6 279B 
The third quarter season was a rough one for the Industrials  and more specifically Machinery companies like Deere  Large names such as   N CAT     O TXN  and   N CMI  were crushed once again when they missed estimates due to the strong U S  dollar and global weakness    N PNR  even had an Estimize revenue consensus that was lower than the Street s  which the company still missed by  40M 
Of the 12 machinery companies in the S P 500 index that have reported thus far  all but Deere and Joy Global  N JOY    a majority have beat on earnings  7   while all but one have missed on revenues 
Deere knows well the headwinds they re up against  lowering guidance for the rest of the year  In their last quarterly release  the company predicted equipment sales would decline 24  in FQ4 2015 on a year over year basis  including a 5  negative impact for foreign currency translation  and 21  for fiscal 2015 including a 4  negative currency impact 
Just days after this report  the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  announced that farm incomes are expected to drop 36  in 2015  the lowest level in 9 years  due to a decrease in crop prices and weakness in dairy markets  To offset losses linked to equipment sales  Deere has increased the amount of used machinery they lease to farmers who are undoubtedly cash conscious at this time 

Deere s Construction   Forestry segment isn t faring much better  falling 13  in the latest quarter  and projected to drop 5  overall for the year  including a 3  negative currency translation impact  The company attributed this forecast to  weakening conditions in the North American energy sector  as well as lower sales outside the U S  and Canada   However  forestry in particular is expected to see gains in Europe 
Guidance will be key to watch today as Deere provides their 2016 outlook  So far this year the stock is down 16  ",2015-11-25,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/deere-report-should-shed-some-light-on-the-downtrend-in-farming-272452,272452
132681,354196,CMI,Before Jobs Report Release  Markets In Whipsaw Mode,opinion,"So yesterday we had a very bad ISM Manufacturing Report  It was below 50 0 for the first time in quite some time showing economic contraction  Not a good thing since this now puts Ms  Yellen in a predicament  Will she or won t she is now in question regarding that first rate hike to come this month when all the boys and girls gather for their six week get together  It was a slam dunk that the market would get what it was craving in a 25 bp rate hike  No longer is that a slam dunk based on the words of the Chicago Fed yesterday  He said he d prefer to see strength first  and that maybe we re not quite ready to raise those rates  The market rallied on that news yesterday  Strange reaction  Today it fell  All of this due mostly to those awful monthly charts  and the not so great daily charts in terms of their MACD s  While the market is in whipsaw mode  we can t get bearish on it at all until the S P 500 loses 2020 on a closing basis with some force behind that move 
The topping process could still see a new high before the party officially ends  No guarantee  but that s still out there  It s possible that all we need is some further weakness to reset those not so good looking oscillators  If that does occur  you then search for a bottoming stick that offers up greater risk reward for the long side  and remember that the long side is what you want to look at until we lose 2020 on a closing basis  If you want to short against the prevailing trend then that s your call  but I wouldn t short until we lose 2020  and then had a failed back test  So yesterday we were up and today we were down  The whipsaw is still alive and kicking  The hope of a new high is still there  Today doesn t destroy the uptrend at all  It s just more difficult to get sustainable action one way or the other  Keep it light  Buy weakness  if possible  When today was all said and done we did what one would have expected us to do yesterday  Nothing from nothing overall 
Here s what is clear  When a stock market is in full bull mode  you don t see stocks crashing out on a hint of bad news or a downgrade  Stocks  like Cummins Inc   N CMI   a few days ago on a simple downgrade fell nearly 8   We saw that in many areas today  such as trucking and other transportation areas  In a healthy market  if a stock gets a downgrade it falls 1 2  maximum  and then recovers by the end of the second day  Now stocks are falling 5   and in many cases  far more than that in a single day  A change of trend  Bad news is hitting stocks in a way we haven t seen for many years  The key is consistency  Day after day we get these downgrades  and day after day we see the same reaction  Fewer and fewer stocks are carrying the market higher when it rallies as more and more stocks  and more and more sectors  are breaking down  Again  little signs that over time may be telling a much bigger story  We shall see folks  For now  don t forget that  until 2020 goes away on the S P 500  we are still in a confirmed uptrend  As ragged as it may be  it s still an uptrend 
Next up for Fed Yellen to have to deal with is the Jobs Report this Friday  The numbers for all of these economic reports are all over the place month to month  So who knows what we ll get for this important report  But manufacturing took a dive this past month  so we better see big gains in the services area in order to get the number the market wants to see to give it confidence the Fed will still raise rates  If she doesn t raise rates  or even if the market thinks they may not  the short term action could turn ugly  The market wants to see Fed confidence  If they take another month off from hiking up the rates  the market will know that the Fed knows things are not where they need to be right now  That would be yet another excuse for more market headaches  Tomorrow will be interesting since we closed right near the 20 day exponential moving average on the S P 500 currently at 2076  We basically engulfed yesterday s nice candle  thus there is risk short term  Keep it light for now ",2015-12-02,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yesterday's-action-today....jobs-on-friday.-373978,373978

132707,354222,CMI,Positions For 2015  Still Plenty Of Life In The  Aging Bull ,opinion,"Over the past two weeks  Jeff has engaged in an email interview with Seeking Alpha s George Moriarty  and we are pleased to share his thoughts below  Enjoy 

George Moriarty  GBM   First  thank you for once again participating in our series  We really appreciate you taking the time  especially since you already spend so much time working on your WTWA series 

Jeff Miller  JM   I appreciate the opportunity to join in  I always read the entire series for the rich variety of viewpoints and great ideas  The high standard encourages all of us to sharpen our thinking before responding  so it is a valuable start to the year  I always spend a lot of time on this  but it is well worth it for my own thinking  I always learn something from the discussion and comments as well 

GBM  You use economics as part of your investment positioning  What does that imply for 2015 

JM  If I had to pick one theme  it would be the toughest challenge for investors  Staying in the market with a normal asset allocation  So many articles and commentaries refer to the  aging bull  and  lofty  stock prices  It is yet another play on using a simple heuristic to guide investments  It sounds good  but it is mistaken 

GBM  In your weekly series  you focus keenly on important economic themes and put them in context for your readers  What do you see for this year 

JM  It is not a dramatic forecast  but it is very constructive  The main economic theme is that there is no expiration date on the business cycle  Major stock downdrafts come after a cycle peak  The best indicators show to be at least a year away  The current economic expansion could go on for years  especially if there is plenty of worldwide weakness  We could easily be having this same conversation a year from now  with the economy growing and the market 15  higher  Why is the business  and stock  cycle longer  The sharpness and depth of the decline and the slow and gradual recovery  This should not really be a surprise 

GBM  Does your analysis imply a stock price target for 2015 

JM  Heh  heh  Every stock price forecast should come with an error band of     15   That is just normal volatility  Unlike the featured Street strategists  I do not wait for a target to be hit before adjusting  I always have a base case and adjust as I get new information  One factor is the falling estimates for energy stocks  We ll know more in another month  The base case is S P earnings of  126 80  If earnings grow by 8  and you apply a forward multiple of 18  often achieved in bull markets  you get a 23  increase  Let s call that the high part of the range 

Jeremy Siegel s call for Dow 20K next year could easily be right  It is approximately the historically normal increase  When I made forecast in 2010 it was based upon the odds of the market doubling versus being cut in half  I do not know if it will happen this year  but it will happen 

GBM  Would you predict Dow 35K before Dow 8500  essentially the same thing you called in 2010 

JM  Another trap question  In general  that is always a safe call  We will see another recession along that path  so it is a little premature  Following the quant corner in my weekly WTWA should be helpful in dodging the next recession linked decline  We ll take another look then 

GBM  As we head into 2015  where do you think the U S  economy is  relative to the rest of the world 

JM  Normal growth is about 3  and there is a long term mean reverting trend  That is the base case for most economic forecasts  The underlying factors are population growth and productivity  so there is room for debate about possible trend changes  The US is not like Japan on these factors  Immigration is a consideration 

A common mistake is to think that the natural state is recession  saved only when there is massive government intervention  This comes from talking pop economics instead of analyzing data  Plenty of the top rated financial sites embrace this theory  Fear sells 

GBM  What is the greatest risk facing the economy right now 

JM  For starters  it is not what most people are citing  There is a general perception that Europe and China will drag down the U S  This is a popular theme  especially among non economists with an agenda  but it is virtually without precedent 

The biggest risk is something we do not already know about  In recent years  these have included extremely unusual weather effects like the polar vortex or the Japanese Tsunami  an international crisis  or a terrorist attack  These  black swan  events can  and will  always occur 

Critics of economic forecasting often observe that the standard macro models do not allow for recessions  True enough  The best performing models predict that the long term trend of economic growth will resume  Recessions are a shock to that system  and therefore worth special attention  None of the best recession forecasting methods are flashing a warning for 2015 

But let me flip this  Nearly everyone talks about downside economic risks  There are also some significant  upside risks   I have written about this concept in the past  but it is neglected by most  The impression for the average investor is the potential upside is limited  while we might have a crash at any moment  Here are some examples of good surprises 

Housing is still dragging  What if it finally shows significant improvement 
Government spending has been a drag  especially at the state and local level  What if it gets a little stronger through higher revenues 
World events could get dramatically better  especially Ukraine  What if a solution were to be reached  Reciprocal sanctions ended  European growth fostered  A better market for China  My ballpark estimate for this alone is about 10  for U S  stocks 

And these are only examples  Investors should engage their critical thinking skills  noting articles that do not even consider upside surprises 

GBM  What do you see as the major catalysts  and major risks  that investors ought to monitor in 2015 

JM  The biggest surprise last year   and it affected everything else   was the persistence of low long term interest rates  Almost everyone was wrong about this  including me  I expected a stronger economy with the traditional shifting from bonds to stocks  I was right about the economy  but not about rates  There is always a danger in sticking with a failed forecast  but it is time for a reality check  Would you lend money to the US government for ten years at 2  

Neither would I  The most important thing to understand about the markets in 2015 is the dynamic relationship between interest rates and stocks  Why are rates so low  Let us start with what happened 

Continued low inflation
Continuing fear of stocks with a preference for the perceived safety of yield
European arbitrage

The last factor is the most important  If you have the ability to borrow in Europe  selling high priced bonds with low yield  and lend in the U S  at a higher yield  your only worry is currency risk  Dollar strength lets carry traders  go commando  and even use leverage  Individual investors in Europe may also show a preference for U S  investments   Important note  Nearly everything the average investor sees about the  carry trade  is wrong   mostly because they cite examples of the US as the  funding country   Read for a great explanation  
Result  Asset classes emphasizing yield  e g  utilities  showed strength  Assets responding to economic growth and or without dividends showed less strength  This  from Morningstar shows how the overvalued sectors became more so as well as where things stand now 

While valuation methods vary  some time spent with this tool will be profitable for investors 

GBM  About two weeks ago  you penned a mid week column on  Crucial Facts About Energy Stocks   In that  you laid out where you see opportunities in the sector  While I d encourage everyone to go read that  can you tell us how you re looking at energy now  And if any of the political or currency strife in certain countries has changed your view on the sector 

JM  There are three different levels for our consideration 

Oil prices  The normal supply demand equation has lost relevance  The leading expert on this topic    originally estimated that economic weakness contributed about  20 to the decline in oil prices  Another top source  The Schork Report  says that the market has been  broken  for three months  Stephen Schork notes that there are  falling to  20 barrel 
Exploration stocks  These are the most leveraged to prices  with the biggest reward if prices reverse  ESV is the best of the breed 
Other energy stocks  Some of these actually benefit from lower oil prices  but get dragged down as part of an ETF  Valero Energy Corporation  NYSE    Marathon Petroleum Corp   NYSE    Chevron Corporation  NYSE   are all good examples  Maybe Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE   
Related stocks perceived as having economic sensitivity  This includes a long list of deep cyclicals and material stocks  Freeport McMoRan Inc   NYSE    Cummins Inc   NYSE    Caterpillar Inc   NYSE   are all good examples 

I started with no position in energy stocks  but bought a little after the initial decline  It was a gentle initial position  Wrong  Anything was too much 

Since then I have not added  but I am watching closely 

GBM  What signals are you watching 

JM  Anything that might affect the carry trade  including the following 

European stimulus
Ukraine
China stimulus and growth
OPEC policy
The dollar

And other things that I see in daily trading  How ETFs move versus individual stocks  There is an opportunity for those watching carefully  You really need to distinguish between three approaches 

Traders
Algorithms
Pension funds

While we have been discussing this article  my viewpoints have not changed but the market has gyrated wildly  The start of the week was dominated by the trading guys  The latter part by the value guys 

GBM  What other themes are you monitoring as we enter 2015  Are there areas of opportunity that investors are missing 

JM  Here are some things that will probably happen

The Fed starts to raise short term rates  a process that will be gradual and will take a couple of years  There will be a knee jerk negative reaction describing the reduction of stimulus as  tightening  and warning that you should not  fight the Fed   This will create yet another dip to buy  since markets usually rally for many months after the start of a tightening cycle  If utility stocks have the same dividend but interest rates go back to 3  on the ten year  where we started last year  that implies a 21  stock decline   and it is not coming back  An increase to 4  would mean a 35  decline  I am not worried about interest rate effects until the 10 year gets to the 4 5  range 
Wages move higher  This healthy sign of an improving economy will be heralded as the first indication of incipient inflation 
The Fed may start a reduction of the balance sheet  probably by not reinvesting maturing holdings  Another opportunity for the Fed pundits who have been wrong all along to continue their streak 
More normal stock market volatility  The modest dips of 2014 are depicted as scary corrections  Investors should be prepared for a historically normal correction in the context of a bull market  This means 15 20   And don t expect to guess when it will happen 

Implications for 2015

Markets hate uncertainty  but that is the story on the interest rate effect  Expecting rates to rise has become a prediction without a time frame   not a good forecast  but no one really knows  Here is what to watch for 

Stronger European growth
Hint of weakness in the dollar
Ukraine resolution

Things could shift quickly if the  hot money  is pulled out of U S  bonds 

As to what investors might be missing  most of them remain under invested in stocks and scared witless  This may seem strange to say with the market hitting new highs  but the participation has been narrow  There is  yet another  bogus chart making the rounds showing a record high in stock investments 

Consider how the 2015 forecasts we have seen so far are treated  Barron s had a cover story with a panel of experts predicting quite modest increases in stocks  but the response was   Why no bears   I just watched a CNBC interview where an institutional market strategist said he expected a gain of about 10  next year   So you are really bullish   was the response  Everyone has been trained to expect something negative 

A popular blogger published a list of the five most popular charts from last year  They are all misleadingly negative and the highest rated one was completely wrong  I gave one of my Silver Bullet awards for the correction  People love to be scared  so the media delivers 

GBM  All that said  and since we re looking at broad portfolio construction here  how are you positioning portfolios heading into this year  And what has changed since last year  if anything 

JM  First off  thanks for the opportunity to describe a bit more about what we do  We manage six different programs  not funds   Each investor has his her own account with a blend of risk reward  For those who have already made it and are protecting wealth  we have a bond ladder  For clients who have stock portfolios  we have three levels of risk reward 

Enhanced yield   conservative stocks  reasonable yield  good balance sheets  We sell near term calls to enhance the yield  The idea is to break even on the stocks and generate retirement income from dividends and call premiums 
Thematic value stocks  This is an aggressive portfolio of things we expect to work in the near term  Under valued by key measures  Reasonably safe for the long term investor 
Aggressive stocks  Companies that have great prospects  but there is a blemish  Maybe it is a drug trial  Or management  Or a review of earnings  We like the company  but there is more volatility  Current holdings include and   just to give the flavor 

We expect good risk adjusted returns on all programs  but we will remain agile of the recession or financial risk odds change 

GBM  Finally  as the  Old Professor  you have always had an eye on politics  Some argue that politics is as much a threat as it s ever been today  Where do you see the interplay of politics and investing today 

JM  There is a positive aspect that few are considering   a bit of bipartisan cooperation  We are already seeing this with more GOP confidence leading to less brinksmanship   which the market hates  Increased GOP control also has increased a sense of responsibility and accountability going into the next election 

A possible outcome is that we will actually see some legislative compromises  There is a long standing theory about the  minimal winning coalition   It means that legislation needs enough compromise to get the votes on board  A good recent example was ObamaCare  which included several compromises to get a filibuster proof majority in the Senate  across party lines  There is some early evidence on the  

A secondary political issue will be the start of the 2016 Presidential campaign   Already    The market reacts and over reacts to these stories  so expect anything negative for Clinton or positive for Warren to weigh on big banks 

On the international front  the biggest example is Europe  Most people simplify the analysis of other countries by imagining a policy formed by a single leader   like a chess player  Since this is their mindset  they find it persuasive when TV experts explain things in those terms 

Those who are willing to reflect a bit will readily see the error  Suppose a foreign citizen were trying to draw conclusions about the U S   They might think that policy was strictly that of the Obama Administration  when there are many internal debates as well as disagreements  with the GOP  the liberal wing  the Tea Party types  etc  Other countries have similar diversities  European policy  for example  is the result of bargaining and negotiation 

Those studying political science or organization theory learn this in an early class  Business leaders and traders never took those classes  Investors would do well to ignore the popular press and do some independent thinking  Countries that have a lot at stake will negotiate to reach a solution  The leaders are not stupid 

GBM  Each week s WTWA has a final thought  Do you have one for 2015 

JM  There is plenty to worry about  but that is not unusual  Let me suggest an idea about stocks that I have not seen elsewhere 

Take the major market sectors  Go short those that were the leading picks last year and go long the laggards 

Most investors will be doing the exact opposite ",2015-01-14,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/positions-for-2015:-still-plenty-of-life-in-the-‘aging-bull’-238494,238494
132708,354223,CMI,Cummins  Stock Falls by 4 2 ,opinion,"Shares of Cummins  Inc  NYSE CMI struggled on Thursday   with its stock dropping by 4 2  from Wednesday s close 

What caused the sudden dip 

The company s earnings for the fourth quarter certainly didn t trigger the selloff  considering that Cummins beat Q4 expectations  Earnings per share  EPS  reached  2 56   representing a 32  jump over the same quarter last year 

The drop didn t coincide with a broader market decline  either  The three major indices experienced significant gains of 1  or more 

So something just doesn t add up 

That is  until you check out the company s revenue expectations  Indeed  the company gave pessimistic guidance for 2015 

According to Cummins  weak demand in international markets  along with a   portends a year in which continued growth will be harder to attain  Especially for a company like Cummins  which derives more than half of its revenue from overseas markets 

So the company now sees full year revenue between  19 6 billion and  20 billion  That represents a decrease of 2  on the low end and a whopping 13  on the high end 

Here s why I m not buying it 

Debunking the  Stronger Dollar  Problem

Dozens of American companies have warned that a stronger dollar will significantly reduce revenue and profits  And it s true that a stronger dollar will impact Cummins 

But the devastation is being exaggerated 

While it s generally understood that a 10  increase in the value of the dollar will reduce S P 500 earnings by  3  it s important to remember that EPS for the broad market index is still expected to climb nearly 3  this year   despite the stronger US Dollar 

In other words  the siren song of the strong dollar is a well played excuse for lackluster corporate results 

Management may need to eat its words  in fact  because Cummins had a solid quarter with the higher dollar 

Besides  the dollar has been gaining ground against most of the world s major currencies since at least July 2014  Yet it failed to impact Cummins  Q4 2014 results in any remarkable way 

Consider 

For the fourth quarter  the company reported total revenue of  5 09 billion  a 10 8  jump over the  4 59 billion reported in the same period a year ago 

Net income for the quarter also saw significant improvement  climbing to  465 million  That s an increase of 28 4  over the  362 million reported in Q4 2013 

And the company s operating income increased  rising to  581 million from  553 million a year ago 

Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  hit  661 million  up from the  566 million reported in the same quarter last year 

Ultimately  Cummins  future is still promising  Here s the main reason I m still bullish on the company 

Just Blowing Steam

FTR Transportation Intelligence has released its preliminary data showing that January 2015 North American Class 8 truck orders currently sit at 35 060 units 

While this represents a modest decline from the blistering pace of Q4 2014  it remains the strongest level of activity for any month of January since 2006  and represents a 2  year over year gain 

This underscores the confidence of motor carriers  who   after seeing several quarters of high freight demand   are just now starting to add capacity 

And with Cummins  new G Series platform  the company stands to take advantage of this capacity by providing an adaptive architecture that allows carriers to deliver higher power with increased efficiency   something every trucking firm craves 

Don t let Cummins  guidance blind you to the opportunity here  Use Thursday s decline as an excuse to average into the engine maker

Dividend Yield   History
Cummins currently has a dividend yield of 3 1   The company has paid steady or increasing dividends since 1991  making 2015 the 25th consecutive year of dividend payments without a reduction 
Over the last decade  Cummins has seen rapid dividend growth  The company has compounded dividends per share at an absurd 28 2  a year over the last decade  Dividend growth will  obviously  not maintain this break neck pace forever 
With that said  the company s most recent increase  Cummins currently has a payout ratio of 32 7   With a fairly low payout ratio  Cummins can continue to raise its dividend faster than overall company growth for several more years 
In addition to a shareholder friendly management  Cummins also has a very conservative balance sheet  The company has  1 76 billion in cash on hand  and just  1 6 billion in debt  Cummins could wipe out the entirety of its debt with cash on hand  if it chose to  As an added bonus  the company s pension is currently over funded   the pension fund has  4 4 billion in assets versus  4 1 billion in obligations 
Growth Prospects
Cummins has grown earnings per share at 14 3  a year over the last decade  The company s solid growth is a result of continued demand for the company s diesel products 
Cummins has focused on international expansion in recent years  The company continues to expand in Brazil and China  In the short term  this will cause growth to slow as these economies slow down  In the long run  emerging economies will very likely outpace the growth of the United States economy 
In addition to its international strategy  Cummins has a compelling domestic strategy  The company is fully acquiring its partially owned joint venture distributors in the United States  These acquisitions added an extra 3  to sales growth in the 2nd quarter  Cummins will continue to acquire its distributors in the United States to take advantage of synergies  The company s president and COO Rich Freeland  about the synergies resulting from acquiring distributors 
 The synergies are significant and Tom outlined several of them and you can expect redundant ADCs  call centers  our whole purchasing which as you ve seen we re pretty good at as a company  We will be able to centralize the purchasing and take advantage of that  so we ve yet to quantify that  The numbers will be significant kind of our next step and we ve consciously delayed from that other than the back office  
In addition to organic growth  growth from distributor acquisitions  and further growth in emerging markets  Cummins will also continue to repurchase shares  The company has repurchased 1 7  of shares outstanding a year over the last decade 
Valuation   Recent Results
Cummins  stock price has struggled this year  The stock is down over 10  year to date  while the S P 500  is up 2 4  over the same period 
The decline is due primarily to weakness in the transportation industry  The Dow Jones Transportation Index is down 8 9  year to date  As an engine manufacturer  this has impacted Cummins  share price 
You will note that Cummins  stock has slid more than the Dow Jones Transportation Index year to date  This implies that Cummins is struggling  Which is not the case 
The company s recent 2nd quarter earnings showed earnings per share growth of 7 8   The company s guidance shows revenue for full fiscal 2015 is expected to grow 2  to 4  
Cummins has compounded earnings per share at 14 3  a year over the last decade  This is excellent growth  Somehow  the company hasn t had an average annual price to earnings ratio above 16 during this time period  It is rare to find a fast growing stock with a low price to earnings ratio 
Recent weakness has made Cummins even cheaper  The stock currently trades at a price to earnings multiple of just 13 4  The company appears deeply undervalued given its historical growth rate and future growth prospects

132710,354225,CMI,Corporate Profits Have Peaked And Will Tank Next Year,opinion,"One of the reasons US stocks have had such a nice run is that public companies have been making a lot of money  The profit bounce from Great Recession lows was both big and fast  taking corporate earnings to record levels both in nominal terms and as a portion of GDP

The company now expects profit of  4 40 to  4 70 a share this fiscal year  which runs through January  according to a statement on Tuesday  Wal Mart had previously forecast earnings of as much as  5 05 a share  Wal Mart also posted second quarter earnings that missed analysts  estimates  Profit amounted to  1 08 a share in the period  excluding some items  the Bentonville  Arkansas based company said  Analysts had expected profit of  1 12 a share  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Wal Mart shares fell as much as 3 3 percent to  69 55 in New York  the biggest decline since May 19  The stock had already slid 16 percent this year through Monday s close 
Wal Mart announced plans in February to raise wages to at least  9 an hour this year and  10 by 2016  along with a related effort to improve training and bolster hours  The move will reduce profit by 24 cents a share  Wal Mart said on Tuesday  That includes an 8 cent hit in the fiscal third quarter  which runs through October  Wal Mart had previously said the effort would cost 20 cents this year 

The Dollar Is Just Too Damn Strong It s up by 20    30  against most other currencies since 2013  raising the effective price of US exports and lowering the value of income from overseas corporate divisions  which come in the form of depreciating currencies like the euro and yen   The impact 


 Bloomberg    American companies had a rough start to 2015 as they watched profits from overseas subsidiaries slide 
Exactly how much blame should we assign to the currency markets  Two economists at the Federal Reserve have an idea 
U S  corporate profits fell about 1 4 percent in the fourth quarter last year before plummeting 5 2 percent in the first quarter this year  partly driven by a plunge in the amount American companies  foreign affiliates earned  Of the decline in overseas subsidiary profits caused by the appreciating currency and cheaper oil imports  about a third probably came specifically from the greenback  Carol Bertaut and Nitish Sinha wrote in a post this month 
Fed policy makers have voiced concern about the strong dollar s drag on exports  both in Federal Open Market Committee minutes and in speeches  the FOMC will release a new policy statement at 2 p m  on Wednesday   It s a major point of concern for monetary policy watchers as Fed officials debate when to go ahead with the first interest rate increase since 2006 

China Has Stopped Buying Our Stuff China tripled its debt post 2009 and spent most of the proceeds on infrastructure like roads and airports  US corporations got a big piece of this business  either by selling raw materials and technology to Chinese builders  or doing the work themselves  Now that bubble has burst  leaving lower commodity prices and excess capacity in its wake 


 Wall Street Journal    With the U S  recession behind them and the European fiscal crisis fading  American companies are grappling with a new threat  China s economic blues 
In quarterly conference calls  U S  executives recited a litany of pain  from mild to severe  resulting from a slowdown in China s economy  the world s second largest 
Engine maker Cummins Inc  NYSE CMI    for example  said demand for excavators in China fell 34  in the second quarter from a year ago with no signs of improvement  For such companies as Weyerhaeuser Company  NYSE WY   less construction in China means logs and lumber pile up in the U S   pushing down prices 
 China was weak in the quarter  and we expect it to be weak as we move forward   Robyn Denholm  chief financial officer of Juniper Networks Inc  NYSE JNPR    told investors  China pulled down the networking gear maker s Asia Pacific revenues by 3  from the prior quarter  without China  they would have risen 11  
It comes at a tough time for U S  businesses  Overall  companies in the S P 500 index are on track to eke out a 1 2  increase in second quarter earnings  according to data from Thomson Reuters  That is the slowest growth since fall 2012 
The modest earnings growth was recorded on a 3 5  decline in revenues the biggest drop in nearly six years suggesting that much of the profit gain is from cost cutting  buybacks or other maneuvers  rather than increased sales 
The slowdown in China was evident last quarter in everything from business flights to elevator sales to car purchases  Rockwell Collins Inc  NYSE COL   said the flight services industry has seen international business jet flights fall 10  this year  largely in and out of China  Russia and the Middle East  DuPont  NYSE DD  Co   which makes temperature resistant materials for components in the automotive industry  lowered its growth forecast for the Chinese auto industry in the second half of the year to between 2  and 3   from past rates of 5  or higher 

Add it all up  and US corporations are looking at another year of falling revenues and much lower earnings at a time when a lot of stocks are priced for  if not perfection  at least high single digit growth 
And none of these headwinds are going away  US workers have just begun to redress the past decade s injustices  and now that higher minimum wage laws have been proven to be political winners  a whole generation of would be mayors and governors will be pushing them 
China has done exactly nothing to bring its finances back into balance so will either see a 2016 crash or bail out its banks and builders and drift into a Japanese style lost decade  Either way  its days of sucking up all the world s extra oil  coal and earth movers are over 
And with the rest of the world in various stages of decline  crisis or chaos while the Fed seems to sincerely want higher domestic interest rates  the dollar isn t poised to retrace the past year s spike  Just the opposite 
So it s a safe bet that US corporations will  in the aggregate  be less profitable next year than this year and   to the extent that earnings dictate market cap   a lot less valuable ",2015-08-19,John Rubino,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corporate-profits-have-peaked-—-and-will-tank-next-year-262138,262138

132737,354252,CMI,This Stock s Earnings Report Valuable News For Investors,opinion,"A lot of earnings results from multinational corporations revealed improving growth in the international markets  including Asia and  surprisingly  Europe  But one company just reported the reverse and its first quarter numbers were excellent based on strong domestic demand for its products 
Cummins Inc   NYSE CMI  hit it out of the park with a 25  comparative gain in North American sales  while the company s international sales were basically flat  Diluted earnings per share grew 23  in the first quarter of 2014  the company bought back three million of its own shares 
The company increased its full year guidance based on improving domestic demand  and the stock soared on the news 
Citing lower demand for power generation and mining equipment  particularly in India and Australia  the weakness was offset by strong demand for engines  sales up 11  to  2 6 billion  and components  sales up 21  to  1 2 billion  in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe and China 
The company expects full year 2014 sales to grow by six to 10  over 2013  This is new guidance  up from the previous expectation of sales growth between four and eight percent  based on improving North American demand 
A number of Street analysts boosted their earnings expectations for Cummins for 2015  the bottom line is expected to grow a little more than 20   currently 17  for this year over 2013   That is very strong earnings growth for a  28 0 billion company in a mature industry 
Cummins  10 year stock chart is featured below 

Chart courtesy  StockCharts
Every company and industry has its own particular set of circumstances  but it s material what large manufacturing corporations say about domestic business conditions  even if you aren t interested in the stock 
Cummins figures it will gain further market share this year in the medium duty truck market  with growth in engines and component sales  which currently represent 58  and 28  of total sales  respectively 
The company also says that sales of its emissions related products will continue to improve as regulations tighten  particularly in Europe 
As part of Cummins  business plan  it is buying up partially owned North American distributors  this should increase future margins quite significantly 
Management is less enthusiastic about business conditions overseas  while also noting that mining industry markets continue to experience weakness with further deterioration expected this year  
While all corporate reporting has to be taken with a grain of salt  the numbers and outlooks presented by brand name businesses are typically genuine 
As an equity investor  what companies report about their businesses is the most material news of all  and it s valuable in terms of shaping your own market view 
There is momentum in the domestic market  but it s still at the corporate level in the sense that rising earnings  share repurchases  and dividends have yet to create much wealth in the Main Street economy 
When a diesel engine manufacturing company like Cummins says business conditions are getting stronger in the domestic market  that s good news  and its business forecast is just one small factor helping to mitigate the probability of a recession this year

132758,354273,CMI,ECB Kicks The Can Down The Road  Was This Our  September Surprise  ,opinion,In 15 words or less  I don t think so  I think there is a less pleasant surprise yet to come  Mssrs Bernanke and Draghi continue to blow hot air in their respective balloons and  so far  investors have fallen for it  Neither of those economics wizards have had to actually do anything as long as they keep promising they will do something  Tomorrow  Maybe I m the fuddy duddy who will be surprised if markets roar ahead to sustainable new highs on this low volume we ve seen all summer  But maybe  instead  it will be those investors whistling past the graveyard  buying on talk alone and taking very large risks  The sound of balloons popping would be mighty scary in a graveyard at the 11th hour  If you believe as I do  you might base your investments on the following strategic considerations   1  According to Dow Theory  the Transports must confirm the rise in the Industrials for the bullish signal to be valid  Currently  the Industrials are rising  but the Transports are declining   2  Most investors are usually wrong around major turning points  This isn t a slight to any of our intellects or critical thinking skills  it merely means that if we are bullish we are most likely already buying  and if we are buying we may be running out of investable funds to keep buying even more  Right now  the American Association of Individual Investors poll shows more bullishness than at any time since April 2nd  when the S P was at 1419  and after which it plunged back to 1278  less than one point from where it began the year   3  Unlike Wall Street traders and individual investors  who are buying into this cyclical rally  the corporate insiders are not  Those who arguably know more about their own company s prospects are selling at a rate approaching 5 times their number of purchases  This level of selling almost always presages at least a short term market top   4  Advisor sentiment is as bullish as investors are  Most advisors are trend followers who pile on when things look good  after the trend is in place  and hold on longer than they should  as the trend returns to earth  So as a group they are seldom right   5  Nothing has changed in the geopolitical arena  Just because everything is quiet on the Western Front that doesn t mean it will stay quiet  We are priced for perfection  and perfection does not include China decelerating at an accelerating rate  Iran attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz  Japan falling further behind  Europe promising unlimited bond purchases subject to  audits and other considerations   US joblessness remaining high  home prices falling after summer ends  etc  Given all this rampant bullishness  it bears noting that the S P was at 1400 on April 26  It ended the month of August at 1407  7 points in 4 months  And as of this writing the S P is at 1432  up 29 in just a single day  Does that make it a buy  Or a sell   Of course  if you are in the  other camp   you don t worry that China s economy is in deep trouble  You don t worry that insider selling is near a record high  You aren t concerned by the uncertainty of a very important election which will have radically different outcomes depending upon who is elected  When you hear the term  fiscal cliff   which will mean massive tax hikes and serious belt tightening  you say  fiscal schmiscal   Who cares about the debt ceiling  Who cares about unemployment or falling housing prices or doing your best to protect your assets  All you need to know is that Helicopter Ben is going to circle your house and throw hundred dollar bills into your back yard  Even if we overlook the ethical considerations of rooting to see more joblessness  more people kicked out of their homes  and hollowed out national and homeland security  just so one can make a few bucks in the market  there is something    to those in my camp    inherently stupid about only caring that you go up along with the other lemmings  But  hey  the financial media loves you for it  Marketwatch s big headline at the end of August was   Market Up For 3rd Straight Month   That s true  but until Dr  Bernanke s one day goose of the market  it would have finished down for the month  Slim reward for going out so far on the risk limb  Sadly  this just doesn t act like a market that wants to go higher  As intelligent investors  we need to ask not   Did I mirror or beat the market this week  month  year   but rather  Did I do the prudent thing to protect my capital and then deploy it well and quickly when there was a clearer opportunity   In 40 years in this business I ve been right and I ve been wrong  But wrong usually meant only lost opportunity or being early in my purchases  I lost opportunity from mid 2009 to mid 2011 by focusing on fundamentals rather than going along with the Fed s goosing of the markets  and horrific failure to goose the economy  which was their charter   But that horse has been rode so hard that I believe it is  at best  a 1 1 payoff even if QEIII is announced  So what s next  What surprise might be in store for September  If the  Don t Worry  Be Happy    Helicopter Ben is going to do QEIII  crowd is correct and if    a big if    QEIII isn t already discounted in the current market level  I ll be surprised and chagrined  Of course  since I have no axe to grind or emotional attachment to any particular point of view  I ll take my lumps on our inverse ETFs and buy the great American and international companies selling for a song  This has been a Fed induced relative momentum market  as the Fed seems to think its job is no longer steady employment and low inflation  but keeping the stock market elevated  As a result  some great companies that are sensitive to the rotten economy are languishing  The big infrastructure and engineering firms like Siemens  SI   Chicago Bridge and Iron  CBI   Cummins  CMI   Joy Global  JOY   ABB  ABB   Deere  DEERE   and Caterpillar  CAT  are already mouthwateringly close to leaping off page 1 of my Watch List  as are some of the undervalued energy firms like Total  TOT   Seadrill  SDRL   the Norway 30 ETF  NORWAY30 L   20  of its portfolio is Statoil  near 40  energy related   Statoil  STO   Petroleum   Resources  PEO   Penn Virginia  PVA   Encana  ECA   Canadian Oil Sands  COS TO   Suncor  SU   GasLog  GLOG   Boardwalk Pipeline  BWP  and Natural Resource Partners  NRP   It s OK being right but a lot more fun being rich  hence my agnosticism when it comes to guessing   predicting   trying my darnedest to figure out where to place our funds during what I see as this particularly dangerous month in this particularly dangerous year  What we ve lost so far is mostly just opportunity and opportunity is always knocking if you are willing to hush up and listen  Ah  but what if the concerns I ve outlined thus far  or even one or two of them  work their way into the consciousness of investors and traders  Then September will be what I feared this summer might bring  I have been wrong so far  but what if I was merely too early  Then we could easily see a 12 16  correction  which would take the averages back to where they were  or below where they were  at the start of the year  I still expect a fine conclusion to 2012  But even a great market needs a pause every now and again to let a little air out of the balloon so it doesn t explode  If September proves to be dreadful and October a toss up  we will have that marvelous opportunity to take advantage of what would then be the prevailing bearish sentiment in October to load up on the kinds of companies already in our portfolios as well as those that will be before the year is out  The Fine Print  As

on  It remains to be seen whether Obama is willing to go against his party s environmentalist wing and embrace a fossil fuel like natural gas  But I tend to agree with Stan that  as a second term president  he has more flexibility to stray from the party line  And what better legacy could a president leave his country than energy independence  Please enjoy   The Surprising Obama Trade  Natural Gas By Stan Barton The unemployment rate is unlikely to drop below 7  ever again  That is because neither trickle down strategies nor big government interventions in the capitalist system can claim success in improving the U S  economy  Throughout our history  the best spurts of economic prosperity have developed from some revolutionary impetus  most recently the prosperity created by the Internet  There are few influences that can be game changing for a system the size of the U S  economy  but the recent discovery that the United States has an abundance of natural gas provides the potential for that impetus  With a champion pushing for a revolutionary change to replace oil as the primary energy source  employment and prosperity can return in full force  A policy to take advantage of the natural gas abundance will have a  New Deal  type influence on infrastructure construction and manufacturing  and it will provide cheap energy to fuel growth in many sectors  Cheaper than oil per BTU  natural gas would have long range systemic benefits for inflation control  just as Internet technology created systemic improvement in productivity  This article makes the case why we think that President Obama will focus on centering the U S  energy policy on natural gas  and how it will help stocks that are in the sweet spots  natural gas exploration  well services  pipelines  fueling stations  vehicles and infrastructure  The Obama Factor Actions of the EPA in the first four years of the Obama administration are not indicative of the regulatory flexibility that a natural gas initiative will require  Support for alternative fuel aside  Obama s record has been comparatively moderate on energy policy  Obama did not stand in the way of the southern section of the Keystone pipeline  and most expect him to approve the Northern portion now that the election is history  He has stumped for clean energy  and protecting the environment is a major part of the Democratic platform  Substituting natural gas would reduce the pollution from burning coal and oil  and that would help him keep his promise and should appeal to the environmentalists  The EPA will take a back seat to jobs  economy and energy independence  Unfortunately  there are those in his party that cannot see past wind generators  solar panels and algae as solutions to fossil fuels  The president has had to stay close to the ecological segment of his base in his first term  The second term of a president s administration gives the incumbent a chance to stray from strict party affiliation  and that is why we expect much more leadership from Obama as a proponent of natural gas in a second term  For example  he has ignored the  carbon tax  that some are proposing  and he could afford to stand with GOP lawmakers against that issue to influence their support for the natural gas initiative  The abundance of natural gas is a result of horizontal drilling and fracturing the substrate with pressurized liquids  fracking  to release the trapped gas  It should be noted that the environmental impact of fracking is not completely known  The technology has been in use for a decade and most consider its effects controllable  There are objections over the amount of water that fracking requires  and the potential pollution of groundwater  among other concerns  The new process has created the potential for jobs through innovation in mitigating these concerns and maximizing production  An example is the well servicing industry which is shaking out the traditional suppliers  opening doors for companies with the flexibility to take advantage of the new technology and its needs  This is in the infant state and the  wildcatters  are back and they will be developing clever ways to exploit the situation  just like Amazon  Apple and many others were able to get more out of the Internet than anyone originally imagined  I know that many will say that Romney would have been even better for the natural gas industry  It is true that a Republican administration would be more likely to relax environmental rules  which might accelerate the movement to centering our energy policy on natural gas  However  I think that for businesses  and the public in general  to adopt a new direction in energy with enthusiasm  all political stakeholders need to back the movement  In this polarized environment  only a second term president will be able to move to center in order to get things done  There will likely be some push back from traditional industry proponents of coal and oil  Romney would have been obligated to pay attention to those lobbyists  but any effort by Obama to include them in the new energy policy would be a win win  It is doubtful a Republican administration could get enough Democratic support for this change  Only Obama can afford to be independent  working with both parties  and I think that an investment based on that premise would be a high return  contrarian opportunity  Investment Options So how do we invest to take advantage of this revolutionary move to natural gas as our main energy source  We normally do not suggest trying to buy the bottoms or predict a change in market direction  It is a contrarian position that companies relying on increased natural gas use will flourish  and most of the stocks we are featuring are currently out of favor  This is mostly because the glut of natural gas is perceived as a negative supply demand situation  Also  the perception that Obama will not be favorable to fossil fuels is probably pressuring these stocks  The first consideration is that a stock must be a long term investment as this transition will take time  However  stock investing tries to be predictive of future reality  and now is the time to look for the companies that will flourish  The second consideration is that we should get good value for our money  since we are taking a risk on the movement to natural gas to replace oil and coal in many industries  The stocks we list here are generally selling at attractive multiples to book  sales and next year s earnings  These factors do not necessarily guarantee that the stock will go up  but they do provide some comfort that the downside is limited  The third consideration is that the stock should be one that is not completely dependent on a revolutionary movement to make natural gas the energy source of choice  An investment should have the possibility of prospering in a more moderate trend towards this commodity demand  Following are thumbnails of some stock to watch if Obama supports a game changing movement to employ natural gas  Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK  is one of the largest domestic producers of natural gas and owns natural gas resources  The stock has been punished by the gas glut and some executive mistakes  and CHK is selling well below its book value  Precision Drilling Corp   PDS  is a Canadian well driller and service company that has made substantial investments in upgrading its rigs to take advantage of the new exploration and production technology  Like CHK  the stock has been beaten down and sells below book value  Crosstex Energy LP  XTEX  is a pipeline operating partnership that has been stagnant due to subdued natural gas prices  It does pay a 9  dividend  so investors can be more patient while collecting an income  The recent massacre of dividend payers in anticipation of a higher tax rate may be overdone considering the low yield alternatives  Clean Energy Fuels  CLNE  is developing a network of natural gas fueling stations  This will be essential in a movement toward use of natural gas in vehicles  Having a market cap of only  1 billion  it is questionable if CLNE has the resources to provide the network needed  however  it does have a head start  Cummins  Inc  CMI   is an old name in internal combustion engines and is perfecting engines to operate on natural gas  It has the capacity to produce in volume the equipment necessary for vehicle use of natural gas  Primoris Service Corp   PRIM  is a specialty contractor and infrastructure company that provides a range of construction  fabrication  maintenance services  with a large presence in the petroleum industry  The infrastructure for a natural gas network would create opportunities for this company  Conclusion A policy that focuses on the expanded use of abundant natural gas would be good for the U S  on several fronts  environmental  energy independence and employment  The president ultimately must realize this obvious opportunity and take the lead in pushing such a policy  A second term president has the opportunity to cross party lines  moderate restrictive party positions and fearlessly push for revolutionary change to cement his legacy  It is only a matter of time before natural gas vehicles and power plants become the norm rather than the exception  and the stocks in this article stand to benefit from that reality  The question is when Obama or other politicians will push for this initiative  President Obama has the unique opportunity to make this happen in the next four years  Even if it turns out that others take the lead  we think that Obama would side with them  Stan Barton is the Chief Analyst for Barton Legacy Advisor  LLC  an old school advisory which is dedicated to

132762,354277,CMI,Using A Put Butterfly To Trade Cummins Inc,opinion,Entomologists tell us that a group of butterflies can  at the choice of the writer  be termed a lek  a rabble  or a swarm  I was first struck today by the bearish Fibonacci based pattern initially described by Larry Pesavento termed a bearish butterfly which had completed in heavy engine manufacturer Cummins Incorporated  CMI  As improbable as it might be  I was pleased to find that a high probability option structure that could be used to trade it  the put butterfly  I thought it would be interesting to examine for educational value this rabble First  let s look at the chart pattern  The price pattern termed a butterfly is a high probability reversal pattern that can occur in both bullish and bearish configurations  It is a variant of a two step pattern and also a variant of a more commonly known Fibonacci pattern  the Gartley The essential elements of the pattern are an initial impulsive thrust  classically termed the X A leg   a reversal of 0 618 to 1 00 of the initial thrust  the A B leg   a second thrust in the direction of the initial leg  the B C leg   and the final reversal thrust opposite in direction from the initial X A leg extending from 1 272 to 1 618 of the initial leg Verbal descriptions are confusing  but consider the characteristic visual pattern which is easily recognized once the trader is familiar with the pattern The pattern completed last Friday as indicated on the graph  and today s bearish candle constitutes a trigger for the trade  These patterns have approximately a 67  probability of success The option position I chose to trade this pattern is that of a classic put butterfly  For those not familiar with this structure it is a three legged structure that is composed of long positions for the wings and a short position for the body The classic butterfly is always constructed in the ratio  1  2  1 and the long positions are equi distant from the short position comprising the body  The position is a debit position meaning that money is deducted from the buying power of the account An option butterfly can be constructed using either puts or calls  It is important to understand that the maximum profitability of these trade structures occurs when price is at the strike of the body at expiration  Therefore  if an individual butterfly is constructed to express a directional bias  it can be constructed using either puts or calls since the strike price of the body determines maximum profitability As an aside  variations of a classic butterfly do exist  Two commonly encountered variants are an iron butterfly and a broken wing butterfly  The iron butterfly is a credit trade and is constructed using both puts and calls The broken wing butterfly is built by buying the long options at different distances from the central body  We will discuss these less common positions as different trading opportunities are presented to us To return to our current situation in CMI  I chose a put butterfly using the 90 100 110 strike prices in the January series  I chose January because December expiration is only a few days away  and butterflies work best when given a bit of duration Had weekly options been available for this underlying  I likely would have chosen to use them in order to tailor the time frame a bit shorter to allow a faster response to changes in P L The P L graph of this put butterfly is presented below Pay particular attention to the intermediate time curves indicated by the two broken lines in relation to the expiration curve indicated by the solid blue line  The broken lines represent the P L today  the lower broken line  and halfway to expiration  the higher broken line   Note that the butterfly only reaches its maximum profitability at expiration Another characteristic is the difference in slope of the intermediate and expiration lines  While the intermediate time frames react gently to changes in price  the pace of reaction to price change increases dramatically as expiration approaches It is for this reason that many option traders routinely close their butterfly positions ahead of expiration  Most experienced butterfly traders do not allow their positions to go to expiration because of the position risk with adverse price moves We welcome you to try our service to learn about more high probability trade set ups and option positions to extract potential profits while defining risk precisely ,2012-12-23,J.W.

132776,354291,CMI,Cummins Inc  Strong Growth With A Dividend Kicker ,opinion,Although Cummins Inc   CMI  is a semi cyclical company  it represents a powerful opportunity for capital appreciation as it moves out of a down cycle  Since the great recession of 2008  Cummins  shareholders have enjoyed significant earnings growth and strong capital appreciation  coupled with a rising dividend  However  recent weakness in their share price has created a great opportunity to invest in this dividend challenger on the rise  According to their CEO Tom Linebarger  Cummins is poised for strong growth  He believes the company is well positioned to exploit the current environment calling for stringent emission standards  rising energy prices  globalization and infrastructure growth    Dividend Challenger   Cummins Inc  CMI    This article looks at Cummins Inc  a Dividend Challenger  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures   In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs    Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life     A Dividend Challenger is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 5 9 straight years  Cummins Inc is a Dividend Challenger that has raised its dividend every year for 6 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Challengers list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Challengers list  Cummins Inc  A Dividend Challenger with 6 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesLearning from the Past   Looking at Earnings OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Cummins Inc s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Cummins Inc has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 14 3   see purple circle on graph  per annum Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1  The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2  The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Cummins IncThe associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 14 7  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Cummins Inc would have received an additional  44 812 21 in dividends that increased their total return from 14 7  to 15 2  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Challenger it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 5 9 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Cummins Inc is 1 09  which is historically high Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Cummins Inc represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Challenger at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Cummins Inc has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 19 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Cummins Inc long term earnings growth at 17   Cummins Inc has low long term debt at 10  of capital  Cummins Inc is currently trading at a P E of 11 1  which is outside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 20 4  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Cummins Inc s True Worth valuation would be  369 53 at the end of 2017  which would be a 25 5  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Cummins Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Cummins Inc s expected earnings would be 12 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Challenger Cummins Inc  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on Cummins Inc Summary   ConclusionsThe recent pull back in Cummins  stock price has created an excellent opportunity for prudent investors seeking growth and income an opportunity to achieve above average long term results  The company has little debt on their balance sheet  the potential for strong growth and a recent history of increasing their dividend consistent with their earnings growth  A quick glance at their historical earnings

132777,354292,CMI,This Stock Has Gained Almost 20  A Year in This Economy,opinion,If I told you about a stock that s delivered gains of nearly 20  to investors for the past five years  then I imagine you d be a little skeptical  After all  the past five years have been some of the most tumultuous years in recent memory  And even if it weren t  20  a year is a pretty tough benchmark to meet    Warren Buffett  Carl Icahn  Bill Ackman    these guys would all kill to even come close to that  not to mention probably take on a lot of risk in the process    They wouldn t have to  though  if they had just invested in one of the world s largest engine manufacturers  And best of all  as a technological leader in fuel efficiency and natural gas engines  it s poised to keep up the pace    I m talking about Cummins Inc   NYSE  CMI      With annual revenue of about  18 billion  the company makes diesel engines for construction vehicles  cars  buses and trucks  It also makes natural gas engines  engine components and electric power generation systems    Shares of Cummins have climbed 124  during the past five years    good for an annualized rate of return of 17 5   Tack on the annual dividend yield  which has averaged 1 3  during the past five years  and you get a total return of 18 8   That s nothing short of amazing  particularly when you consider the five year period I mentioned included the financial meltdown  the deep recession of 2007 2009 and the sluggish recovery we re currently experiencing     To understand how the stock managed to accomplish this    and why I think it s a candidate to keep outperforming for at least the next few years  we have to look back 10 years ago    Cummins thrived during bad times for several reasons  starting with a smart move made 10 years ago when the company decided to restructure diesel engine making operations  since they accounted for the bulk of revenue just like they do today  currently 52  compared with 18  for engine components  16  for power generation systems and 14  for sales service   Initiatives included workforce reductions  re allocation of older manufacturing equipment rather than disposing of it and canceling unnecessary information technology programs  The result was a 13  reduction in the break even point for diesel engines  meaning Cummins now only has to sell around 260 000 units a year to break even  compared with 300 000 before the restructure  These restructuring initiatives have saved about  97 million a year in operating costs  analysts estimate    Besides becoming leaner  Cummins was fortunate not to have much exposure to Europe and its severe economic problems of the past four or five years  Because management saw better opportunities elsewhere  the company has been focusing less and less on the region  European sales provided 18  of total revenue in 2007  compared with only 9  currently  Half of revenue now comes from economically healthier emerging markets like Asia and Latin America  where Cummins has become a major player through partnerships with the largest truck and truck component makers in those areas     In October 2011  for instance  it announced a joint venture with the LiuGong Machinery Co  to produce the Cummins diesel engine for pickup trucks at a new plant in the Guangxi Province of southern China  The plant is scheduled to open in 2013 with an initial production volume of 50 000 units a year  Earlier this year  Cummins announced a joint venture with Latin American distributor Grupo Laeisz to sell and service Cummins diesel engines and power generators in Costa Rica and El Salvador  Grupo Laeisz has already been distributing Cummins products in Honduras for about 40 years    Prospects are also strong in North America  which generates 41  of total revenue  This is particularly good news because business in China  Latin America and some other emerging markets are expected to slow somewhat in the coming years     Cummins  financial results are already reflecting these trends  In the first quarter of 2012  for example  sales rose 16  to  4 5 billion  compared with  3 9 billion in the same period last year  The improvement was due in large part to soaring demand for heavy duty commercial truck engines in North America  where sales of these engines rose to  892 million    a whopping 84  jump from the  485 million generated in the first quarter of 2011  Overall  North American sales climbed 40  to  1 9 billion  compared with  1 4 billion in the first quarter of 2011    In addition to favorable geographic diversification  Cummins also has the advantage of being the largest manufacturer of natural gas and hybrid bus engines in the United States  which could lead to major revenue growth if the United States further increases its commitment to cleaner energy sources   See      For instance  only about 12 000 public transit buses    17  of the country s 70 000 buses    run on natural gas  leaving plenty of room for further expansion  A similar situation exists with school buses  of which there are roughly 700 000 just in the United States    Risks to consider  Cummins is subject to stringent oversight by the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies capable of imposing new environmental regulations that increase costs to point of hurting profits    I think Cummins is a good bet to keep growing quickly because of its wise decision to largely avoid Europe and focus on economically sounder emerging and North American markets  I also like the stock because consumers rely heavily on the types of products it makes to function on a daily basis  Still  analyst projections for earnings per share  EPS  to climb 18  annually for the next three to five years seem overly

132778,354293,CMI,Cummins   An Oversold And Undervalued Dividend Stock,opinion,The market has fallen out of love with stalwart Industrial dividend stock Cummins   CMI   sending its shares down over 16  in May  Lowered guidance from fellow equipment maker Joy Global   JOY   has also helped to depress CMI s shares this week  JOY cut its guidance approx  3 4 to 4 5   down to a  7 15 to  7 45 range  and trimmed its revenue guidance by approx  1 8   based on weaker mining equipment demand from US coal miners    Here s the anomaly and the opportunity  JOY s coal mining equipment business is slowing in the US because of the ongoing natural gas boom  which is causing utility and other power users to switch from more expensive  dirtier coal  to cheaper  cleaner natural gas  BUT  as the biggest natural gas and hybrid bus engine manufacturer in the US market  Cummins will gain from this shift from coal to natural gas  as more fleet owners switch to these natural gas  and hybrid engines    Huge firms  like Waste Mgt   Walmart  UPS  and Ryder  are converting their fleets to capitalize on the fuel savings  which is substantial  the natgas engines cost approx   30 000 more  but  the fuel cost savings is about  27 000 year  It s a no brainer for these firms  which stand to save millions by switching  Indeed  Cummins estimates that its heavy duty truck sales will grow 29  in 2012  The natgas engine story is compelling overseas also   The Wall St  Journal recently reported that annual overseas growth has been 42  over the past decade in the Asia Pacific region    So  Wall Street is handing out a buying opportunity for Cummins  by incorrectly discounting its stock along with JOY and other Industrials  Here s a look at CMI s slow stochastic chart  which shows that it s below the oversold 20 line  This is also supported by its Relative Strength of 29 06  which is under the 30 threshold  In addition to being oversold  CMI is also undervalued on a PEG basis  for 2012 and 2013 earnings growth  and is toward the low end of its 5 year P E range How to play it  Given the overall gloom of the market  the most conservative way to profit from CMI is by selling cash secured puts below CMI s share price   Fortunately  CMI has high options yields  so you can achieve a break even that s very close to its 52 week low    There are more details on this and over 30 high yield Cash Secured Puts trades in our   Conversely  buying CMI and selling covered calls above its share price will also produce a high yield   This covered call trade is listed with over 30 other high yield options trades in our    Dividends  Although it still isn t a high dividend stock  Cummins really cranked up its dividend yield and payout in 2011  jumping from   26 quarter  to   40 quarter  a 54  increase Financials  CMI s financial metrics are far superior to its industry s averages We feel that the pullback in CMI is overdone  and that CMI should be one of the best dividend stocks to buy and trade for undervalued growth  The natgas engines story is compelling over the long term   as more and more companies and cities convert their fleets  Cummins will get a major slice of that business Company Profile  Cummins Inc   a global power leader  is a corporation of complementary business units that design  manufacture  distribute and service engines and related technologies  including fuel systems  controls  air handling  filtration  emission solutions and electrical power generation systems  Headquartered in Columbus  Indiana   USA  Cummins employs approximately 44 000 people worldwide and serves customers in approximately 190 countries and territories through a network of more than 600 company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6 500 dealer locations  Cummins earned  1 85 billion on sales of  18 0 billion in 2011   Source  Cummins website Disclosure  Author was short CMI put options at the time of this writing Disclaimer  This article is written for informational purposes only and isn t intended as investment advice ,2012-06-03,Double Dividend Stocks,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cummins-–-an-oversold-and-undervalued-dividend-stock-125206,125206

132784,354299,CMI,Job Creation  Not Really ,opinion,The back and forth whipsaw remains alive and well as we failed yet again near the top of some short term wedges  The news that drove the market lower Friday came from the world of job creation  and showed fewer than expected  The market was dreaming of a number at 100 000  but it only received 84 000  Not horrible  Not worthy of a stock market annihilation  but worthy enough of a nasty day that saw man leaders get pulverized  It s a worrisome event  When a market is both overbought and flashing negative divergences on its short term 60 minute time frame charts  you can t come in below expectations  If you do you feel the pain The market gapped down pretty hard and fell nearly two hundred points at its low Friday  the Nasdaq 100 near sixty at its worst  The Nasdaq 100 always takes the hardest hit because of valuations on these types of days  There were never any real rally attempts  but in truth  there wasn t any gap and run event  either  when all was said and done  The bears couldn t find any real energy to bring this market to its knees as the day went along  thus  losses were contained mostly to the gap down event which occurred at the open  When all was said and done  it was another nothing day in a nothing market going nowhere for some time to come So what is the market holding up to some degree is what most folks are wondering about  There is just so much bad news from all over the globe  especially in Europe  where everyone else has plenty of exposure  We know most of the big cap companies in the United States have loads of exposure in Europe  There are three reasons why this market refuses to  at this point in time  give it up in a big way The first reason is the big one  Never fight liquidity or better said  the Fed  Mr  Bernanke is pumping like a crazed scientist  refusing to allow the economy to fall apart  thus  has the machine turned on to full throttle  This is allowing the economy to hold up for now The second reason is also related to Fed Bernanke  and his intentional act of keeping interest rates near zero for many more years to come  Yes folks  years to come  This makes the stock market far more attractive to everyone  If rates shoot up  folks will leave the market and take what they can get without risking anything  Can t blame them  So he s protecting Wall Street through low interest rates  Again  years to come before interest rates go up because it ll be years before this crisis pass  maybe more years than we d care to believe The third reason is Europe  They are in awful shape  to put it kindly  We  here at home  are in bad shape  but not in awful shape  and thus  folks are looking for the safest home  and it s sadly right here where things are just plain old bad So  those are the three reasons why the market is holding up far better than the fundamentals would suggest they should  Now  things are bad enough to prevent a blast up and out  but there are enough preventative measures in place to prevent the worst case for now The commodity stocks continue to get hit the hardest as it s clear deflation is the biggest problem  With jobs on the decline and with the ISM Manufacturing Report showing recession  there is less need for materials  thus  the struggle in the world of the commodity stocks  Gold  silver  and just about every commodity area  is taking on the look of bearish patterns in place  It can always change  but that s the real world as we know it in the moment Bear flags continue across the commodity world and if they get enough additional bad news  they ll be ready for yet another down leg  Some areas have already begun just that  The commodity world  however  isn t alone  There have been some very scary moves all across the market Friday from leading stocks in leading sectors  When you get a chance  take a look at some of these from Friday s action Informatica Corporation  INFA   VMware  Inc   VMW   Citrix Systems  Inc   CTXS   Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  CTSH   Priceline com  PCLN   Google Inc   GOOG   MicroStrategy Inc   MSTR   Deckers Outdoor Corp   DECK   Check Point Software Technologies Ltd   CHKP   KLA Tencor Corporation  KLAC   Navistar International Corporation  NAV   Walter Energy  Inc   WLT   SPDR Gold Shares  GLD   iShares Silver Trust  SLV   Caterpillar Inc   CAT  Cummins Inc   CMI   International Business Machines Corp   IBM   F5 Networks  Inc   FFIV   Coach  Inc   COH   Broadcom Corp   BRCM   Lam Research Corporation  LRCX   and Cymer Inc   CYMI   and many more What s troublesome is that many of these looked to have already bottomed  and then had these types of days  Is that a sign for what s coming in time to the whole market  It could be  It is definitely a negative to see so many leaders just get crushed The best place to look technically for what may be a problem is the Nasdaq 100  which is the leader of a healthy stock market  You want to see froth be bought at all costs  If froth is being sold  and thus  key support lost  you have to take notice  The Nasdaq 100 shows this best as there are three major support levels all within seven little points of each other  The 50 day exponential moving average is at 2899  The 20 day exponential moving average is at 2898  The top of the recent gap is at 2905  2905 to 2898 Seven points the bears want to see taken out  and the best way to do that  although not the only way  is on a gap down  We watch 2898 to be sure the market is holding where it needs to on a closing basis  Intraday is not relevant  As long as this level holds we re fine  A strong  clean break below would be bearish on a closing basis  Day to day as this market to nowhere continues to try and usually succeeds to frustrate the masses

132812,354327,CMI,Caterpillar Ignites Fear For Equipment Stocks,opinion,Equipment stocks showed their true colors Wednesday  04 25   failing to keep pace with the major market indices    While Apple s  AAPL  positive earnings announcement sent the bulls into a buying frenzy  the major equipment stocks failed to show up at the party  Bearish action in an otherwise positive environment is definitely a red flag worth digging into  no pun intended     There were two primary catalysts that drove equipment stocks lower  The first quarter earnings report for CAT failed to live up to expectations The durable goods report turned out to be the weakest reading in a number of years First  the earnings announcement from Caterpillar  CAT   On the surface  the report was fairly positive  Q1 EPS rose 29  over last year due to strong domestic sales and healthy demand from mining equipment    Management even raised full year guidance   although not as much as Wall Street was expecting  Instead of focusing on the strong quarter and higher guidance  investors worried about weakening demand in China  Brazil and Europe   and dumped the stock on heavy volume  Via the  Chinese buying of construction equipment has plunged since the middle of last year as higher interest rates  have discouraged spending on machinery and building projects But Caterpillar expects Chinese demand to recover in the next few years Since the real opportunity for equipment makers is heavily weighted towards potential sales from China and India  a disappointing picture for emerging markets is certainly cause for concern    This falls in line with our    as a confluence of bearish macro economic catalysts challenge the Goldilocks growth scenario  Decelerating growth in China and austerity measures in Europe can t help but dampen global demand for capital intensive equipment    But what about domestic sales   This was an area of strength right    Caterpillar may have reported a strong sales of construction equipment in the US  but yesterday s durable goods report was much less optimistic    For the month of March  durable goods orders declined by 4 2    the largest drop since January 2009  And just for good measure  the Commerce Department revised the February report lower   so March s decline was actually worse than the headline number indicated    Once more from the   Wednesday s durable goods report followed a string of weaker regional manufacturing reports as well as industrial production data that showed manufacturing production fell slightly in February  despite strength in several areas including vehicle and parts manufacturing Indeed  while new orders for durable goods slipped over the month  shipments were up  That means the slowdown in manufacturing  if it continues  is likely to take a bite out of second quarter growth  The shipment figures  in fact  prompted economists at Morgan Stanley to boost their forecast for first quarter gross domestic product to annualized growth of 2 9  compared with 2 7  before the report While the CAT may already be out of the bag  ok  that was really bad    we ve got our eye on a number of equipment makers that have bearish or weakening chart patterns along with fundamental vulnerabilities    Cummins Inc   CMI  has a focus on diesel and natural gas engines  and relationships with OEMs who are selling directly to domestic and emerging market end users  The stock broke to a new high in February   but ran into overhead resistance and broke down  CMI pays a 1 4  dividend yield  creating a negative carry short position   but looks technically vulnerable in an industry that is under pressure Deere   Co   DE  manufactures equipment for agricultural as well as construction markets and is expected to grow earnings by 21  this year  A heavy debt load  249  debt to equity  makes for a vulnerable financial situation  and the stock dropped sharply this month after a crop report hit corn prices hard  With significant overhead resistance  DE shares should have difficulty trading higher  and there is plenty of room below before hitting significant support Joy Global  JOY  sports one of the better growth rates  expectations for 30  EPS growth in 2012   but analysts have been revising their models lower as the economic picture deteriorates  The stock has been underperforming its peer group this year  see chart above  and has established a predictable bearish pattern  JOY is set to announce Q2 earnings on May 31  fiscal year end Oct 31   and for now the stock is trading in line with the increasingly bearish industry United Technologies  UTX  has been under pressure due to low revenue and earnings growth  For the first quarter  UTX logged a 2  decline in revenue  but cut costs enough to manufacture a 2  bump over last year  The stock peaked in March and has been trading below the key 50 EMA since the beginning of April  With earnings now out of the way  there are few catalysts that would send this stock higher  and plenty of vulnerability based on economic headline risk and industry trendsDisclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice  ,2012-04-27,Mercenary
