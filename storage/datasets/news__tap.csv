14441,235956,TAP,Should Value Investors Consider Molson Coors  TAP  Stock Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Molson Coors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 3  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 08  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Molson Coors  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Molson Coors has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Molson Coors stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Molson Coors has a P S ratio of about 1 11  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 47 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  TAP is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Molson Coors currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Molson Coors a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Molson Coors is just 2 07  a level that is lower than the industry average of 3 20  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  TAP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though Molson Coors might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives TAP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores     Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to one higher  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen six downward revision compared to no upward in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has declined by 1 1  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has decreased by 7 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and Consensus
 
   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Molson Coors is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 14  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Beverages   Alcohol industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2019-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-molson-coors-tap-stock-now-200495144,200495144
14462,235977,TAP,What A Difference A Year Makes  Last 2019 Fed Mtg  Wraps Up With Stocks Near Highs,opinion," Wednesday Market Open  It was almost a year ago when a Fed meeting helped send stock indices plunging into bear or near bear territory  The Fed s decision back then to raise rates for a fourth time in 2018 put new interest rate fear into an already shaky market  By Christmas Eve  the S P 500 Index  SPX  was down nearly 20  from its September high 
Things couldn t be more different approaching today s Fed meeting conclusion  when the futures market expects no policy changes and the Fed is coming off of three consecutive rate cuts  The SPX is near all time highs  up nearly 25  year to date  That shows you just how closely monetary policy can affect Wall Street  
The major indices appeared to flatline Tuesday  and that carried over into Wednesday s pre market hours in what looks like a typical pre Fed announcement trading atmosphere  It s possible the slow  direction less type of trading could last much of the day  until the Fed makes itself heard early this afternoon 
Things were pretty quiet early Wednesday on the China tariff front  but it s possible any headline on that subject could wake up the market  The Dec  15 tariff deadline is this Sunday and looms large  Some people think a Phase One deal could be announced before that  but speculating on timing hasn t worked too often in this long trade war  
Today s data included the November Consumer Price Index  CPI   which rose 0 3   That was a bit more steep than the 0 2  that analysts had expected  but below the 0 4  in October  Core CPI in November  which strips out volatile food and energy prices  climbed just 0 2  
Watching Beige Paint Dry Ahead Of Fed
So is today s Fed meeting a non event  Quite possibly  The futures market puts chances of a rate move pretty close to zero  so there s not a lot of drama ahead of the 2 p m  ET announcement  After that  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell takes the podium  and it s hard to imagine what he could say that might move the market  
The Fed has done such a good job of telegraphing its intentions this time around that it seems like there s little Powell could say that people don t already know  While there s always the chance something new could come up  it wouldn t be surprising to hear him go with another version of  We re watching the numbers  and that downside economic risk still exists despite recent strong data 
Today s Fed decision comes at an interesting juncture where the economy really seems to be hopping  The question is what Powell and the Fed will say about current events like strong holiday sales  last week s amazing jobs report  and great housing numbers which investors saw confirmed by home builder   Toll Brothers    NYSE TOL  earnings report earlier this week  It might be worth watching for any changes in the statement s wording about the economy compared with what the Fed said after its last meeting 
In the lead up to today s Fed announcement  trading on Tuesday was like watching beige paint dry  Most major indices traded both sides of unchanged most of the day before a late slide  There really wasn t much of a pattern in the sector outcomes  Some of the defensive sectors rose while others fell  and the same goes for cyclicals  Financials  which typically have the most to gain or lose from Fed action  finished right at the flatline  Could that be a sign of the lack of excitement ahead of the Fed meeting  Very possible 
Remember  this meeting brings an updated  dot plot  from Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  members  mapping out where each of them sees rates going in the years ahead  That could be one interesting aspect of the meeting  and it s probably worth a close comparison to the last dot plot to get a sense of where FOMC officials believe the economy might be headed  The Fed turned dovish in mid 2019  The dot plot might help chart whether the people making rate decisions expect that to last  but it s likely going to show some projections for higher rates and some for lower  We ll help you  connect the dots   so to speak  in this afternoon s report 
Stay tuned this afternoon for another Market Update after the Fed decision where we ll discuss the possible market implications  or lack of implications  of the Fed s latest words 
Jets And Pickups
In corporate news  meanwhile  Boeing  NYSE BA  announced November new orders Tuesday and it didn t look particularly good for the jet maker  In fact  the data were pretty disappointing with 24 jets delivered  but the stock fell less than 1   In general  BA shares have held up really well this year considering all the company s been through  While you never want to forget the tragic events that occurred  it s almost like the stock is made of teflon  Earlier this year  some analysts sounded like they thought investors would give up on BA shares  but that just hasn t happened 
One question does come up  Will BA shares continue to avoid a selloff if the company freezes its dividend  A dividend freeze could be on BA s to do list  according to The Wall Street Journal  BA raised its dividend 20  last year  Investors could find out next week what will happen with the payout  the newspaper reported 
Speaking of payouts  Ford  NYSE F  now has a 6  yield  The stock is under  10  but when you look at 6  vs  the 10 year Treasury yield of 1 84  as of late Tuesday  that s pretty dramatic  But keep in mind that a high dividend yield relative to treasuries can sometimes be a signal that a stock is at risk  
That being said  TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers of Ford  F  last month as the company announced plans for an electric F 150 pickup truck  according to the Investor Movement Index   IMXSM   The IMX is TD Ameritrade s proprietary  behavior based index  aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets 
Meanwhile  TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers of Ford competitor Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   which is also in the news with an electric pickup truck  However  TSLA shares have been rolling right along lately with the stock recently hitting  350 a share for the first time in nearly a year  So maybe it s not surprising to see some investors taking profit and perhaps moving a few dollars into a beaten down auto stock like Ford 







CHART OF THE DAY  POUND OUT BOWLING EURO  This three month chart shows the British pound  GBP USD candlestick  has moved up against the dollar recently  while the euro s  EUR USD purple line  generally marched in place  This week brings a European Central Bank  ECB  meeting and a UK parliamentary election that could have Brexit implications  Source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
From Cars to Beer Trade Deal s Potential Beneficiaries  Auto parts makers  Consumer products manufacturers  A railroad  Even a beer company  Those are some of the firms whose stocks might have the most to benefit from an agreement reached between Congress and President Trump on Tuesday to move forward on the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA   Briefing com noted 
The six publicly traded companies with the most exposure to Mexico and Canada include American Axle  AXL   a maker of auto drivetrain and driveline components and systems  railroad company Kansas City Southern  KSU   auto parts manufacturer Magna International  MGA   consumer product maker Colgate Palmolive  NYSE CL    Molson Coors  Brewing Company  NYSE TAP   and agricultural manufacturing firm AGCO  AGCO   according to a list from Briefing com  These companies  exposure to Mexico and Canada range from 24  for AGCO to 53  for AXL  All of their stocks might be worth a close watch for any impact  but looking at their year to date charts  the action is all over the place  They definitely don t move in step  Overall for the market  having a deal in place would probably be positive  in part because it removes a source of uncertainty  Markets tend to dislike uncertainty  
You re All Playing for Second Place Now  In this space we often discuss the market cap race typically about how Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  have been duking it out over the past year to claim the top spot  while Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Amazon  AMZN  nip at their heels in the third and fourth spots  They all dropped one notch this week with the IPO of  Saudi Aramco   SE 2222   In its first day of trading  shares climbed to the trading limit up 10  which puts the oil giant s market cap just south of  1 9 trillion  AAPL and MSFT have market caps in the  1 2 trillion range  and GOOGL and AMZN have current values in the  900 billion range  In other words  the top spot seems to be sewn up for the time being  It s worth noting  however  that Saudi Aramco s valuation does have a bit of an asterisk  in that the small free float only 1 5  of the company was released in the IPO is among the tiniest percentages among all publicly held companies in the world  according to Bloomberg   In contrast  independent shareholders control over 80  of each of the top four U S  firms  Some 98  of MSFT shares are held by the public 
MVP Candidate Slumps  While  FAANGs  still get attention  other buckets of stocks have often stolen their thunder this year  That includes the online payment companies like PayPal  PYPL  and Square  SQ   as well as credit card behemoths  The full name for the payment basket is MVP  which stands for MasterCard  MA   Visa  NYSE V   and PYPL  When consumers feel positive about the economy  they tend to buy more things with credit 
Some MVP names are doing great  but SQ has generally has had a tough time since its August earnings report when the company missed analysts  expectations for gross payments volume for the second straight quarter and delivered lower than expected earnings per share guidance for Q3  Earnings in Q3 looked more solid  with SQ beating expectations  That s helped shares a bit  But they re still down nearly 15  from the 52 week high  SQ remains very popular in some sectors of the economy  Most cab drivers seem to use it  for instance  In this kind of economy where consumers are so healthy  it seems like a time when payment stocks might thrive  However  if SQ can t get off the runway in today s consumer environment  that raises the question of what kind of economy it needs to take flight

14467,235982,TAP,Weak Volumes   Cost Hurt Molson Coors  Growth Efforts On Track,opinion,Molson Coors Beverage Company   NYSE TAP   has been struggling on the bourses owing to persistent softness in volumes and high input cost  Shares of this Denver  CO based company have decreased 10 4  in the past year  underperforming the  s growth of 17 6  Also  the stock s dismal run on the bourses is mainly attributed to its unimpressive earnings and sales performance in recent quarters  Though the company beat earnings estimates in third quarter 2019  both top and bottom lines declined year over year  Additionally  this marked its fourth consecutive quarter of negative sales surprise  The top line was impacted by soft volume across all segments  owing to a challenging industry backdrop This  along with inflation  higher underlying effective tax rate and cycling a favorable resolution of a vendor dispute in the United States hurt earnings  The company s worldwide brand volume declined 2 4  to 24 7 million hectoliters and financial volume fell 5 5  to 25 million hectoliters  In addition to the aforementioned factors  financial volume was hurt by the timing of customer inventory levels in the United States and Canada as well as lower contract brewing volume  Its underlying EBITDA declined 7 1  in the third quarter  with a 5 6  fall in constant currency Additionally  Molson Coors has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time  owing to tough industry conditions  Apparently  U S  brand volume declined 3 9   owing to declines in the Economy and Premium Light segments  offset by rise in the Above Premium portfolio trends  Sales to wholesalers  STWs  volume  excluding contract brewing  declined 6 2  on lower brand volume and quarterly timing of distributor inventories  Going forward  the company expects further contraction of the U S  beer industry volumes Apart from these  the company continues to battle input cost inflation  which has been a hindrance for a while now  Notably  input cost inflation in all segments led earnings to decline in third quarter 2019  Underlying COGS per hectoliter rose 5 9  on a constant currency basis  driven by inflation and global volume deleverage partially offset by cost savings  Further  management expects these hurdles to linger in the quarters ahead  The company estimates mid single digit increase of consolidated underlying COGS per hectoliter  on a constant currency basis  in 2019 Driven by the execution of the revitalization plan  Molson Coors expects 2020 to be a transition year  Consequently  it anticipates net sales to be flat to down low single digits on a constant currency basis  Further  EBITDA is likely to decline in mid single digits in 2020 compared with underlying EBITDA  on a constant currency basis  of  2 289 billion for the trailing 12 months ended Sep 30  2019 Factors Driving GrowthMolson Coors  revitalization plan  aimed at achieving sustainable sales growth by improving efficiency and unlocking resources to reinvest in business opportunities  bodes well  Also  the company is witnessing significant benefits from the execution of its premiumization and cost saving initiatives  With a view to accelerate portfolio premiumization  it has made significant additions to its above premium brands  portfolio In third quarter 2019  Molson Coors  above premium brands continued to improve  with Peroni and Blue Moon growing rapidly in the United States  Further  Belgian Moon witnessed strong growth in Canada  registering 45  increase year to date  Additionally  for 2019 and beyond  the company is encouraged by its innovation pipeline and launch of various innovative brands across regions  Molson Coors is on track to witness continued segment share gains in premium brands  increased volumes in above premium brands  and bring stability to its below premium brands  volumes and market share These apart  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has undertaken restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability  These initiatives include the closure of underperforming breweries  improve efficiencies in finance  administration and human resources  and reduce labor and general overhead costs  In addition  the company has been focusing on initiatives to improve its supply chain network and build on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources and invest in brand building and innovation We expect the company s growth initiatives to help steer through tough industry conditions and the

124460,345975,TAP,Falling Beer Sales Hasten Molson Coors  Transformation,news,"Molson Coors  NYSE TAP  is in the midst of a transition that it hopes will leave it less reliant on beer sales  Management sees the future of the company in a broader based beverage portfolio that includes non alcoholic drinks  which is why  among other things  it replaced  brewing  in its official name to  beverage  last year  took a minority stake in an  emerging beverages  maker  and formed a partnership with marijuana producer HEXO  NYSE HEXO  to produce cannabis infused beverages 
Now  Molson Coors is selling one of its breweries because it no longer needs the capacity it provides  Because it has had a long standing relationship with Pabst Brewing to produce its beer  it entered into an agreement to give Pabst the option to purchase the facility 

Crying in their beer
Although U S  beer dollar sales are expected to finish higher year over year when the final results are tallied for 2019  that s only because that statistic includes sales of things that are not beer  like flavored malt beverages  which includes the high growth hard seltzer segment  Sales for beer alone are on track to be down for the fourth consecutive year 
It s precisely because of the growth of such alternative drinks that Molson Coors was required to announce a  revitalization plan  last year  As CEO Gavin Hattersley noted at the time   our business is at an inflection point   Either the brewer could continue to do things as it had previously    a strategy that saw constant currency net sales drop more than 2  in the third quarter    or it could change direction 
It opted for the latter and has been moving aggressively to realign its operations 
Drinks for a new generation
The joint venture with HEXO was just one manifestation of management s realization that consumers were thinking differently about how and what they drank  The two will introduce half a dozen new cannabis drinks for the Canadian market that contain a mix of cannabidiol  or CBD  and THC  The beverages will be alcohol free 
In that vein  Molson Coors  minority stake in L A  Libations will give it a chance to branch out from beverages that give drinkers a buzz one way or the other 
For example  Molson acquired Clearly Kombucha in 2018  and the emerging drinks maker will help the brewer expand its availability  The president of Molson s emerging brands division said L A  Libations   expertise in creating and nurturing brands is especially valuable at a time when much of the growth in the beverage industry is coming from brands and categories that often were nonexistent five years ago  
L A  Libations  health and wellness focus has allowed it to help established brands such as Zico coconut water  Core Water  and Body Armor expand  while also creating its own brands  like the plant based Gloe 
California dreaming
Shedding a brewery isn t specifically part of the larger realignment Molson is undertaking  but the decline in beer drinking means the company will have sufficient capacity at other facilities to compensate 
The Irwindale brewery produced about 4 8 million barrels of Miller Lite  Coors Light  and Miller 64  as well as several Pabst brands last year  Molson s brewery in Golden  Colorado  which is getting a several hundred million dollar modernization  and its Fort Worth  Texas  facility will pick up that production now 
Although Molson and Pabst have a long history together  in recent years the relationship has been rocky  Pabst even sued Molson over the latter s desire to close the California brewery  They settled their differences in 2018  and Pabst reached an agreement with contract brewer City Brewing in November to produce the majority of its beer under an agreement that runs through 2040 
Beer ain t what it used to be
The beer industry is changing as consumers become more health conscious and their drink preferences evolve  Boston Beer  which has long been the face of the craft beer niche  now makes far more hard seltzer than beer 
Molson Coors is still primarily a brewer  regardless of its name change  but the percentage of its sales that beer represents seems likely to decline markedly over the next few years ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phtvr,2058836
124461,345976,TAP,Tilray Announces Major Executive Changes  Molson Coors Exec as CFO,news,"Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY  made news today after announcing some significant changes to its leadership team  Two new senior executives are joining the company  Jon Levin as Tilray s new Chief Operating Officer  COO  and Michael Kruteck as its Chief Financial Officer  CFO   
Jon Levin previously was an executive at cosmetics giant Revlon  where he was the General Manager for the U S  market and was responsible selling consumer products to major retailers across the country  Michael Kruteck has held finance positions with Molson Coors and was previously CFO of Pharmaca Integrative Pharmacy  a private  nationwide pharmacy chain  

Kruteck will replace Tilray s current CFO  Mark Castaneda  who got started with the cannabis company back in early 2018  Instead  Castaneda will be working in a Strategic Business Development role while helping Kruteck while he transitions into his new role  According to the company s website  Tilray did not have a COO prior to Levin s appointment  
A small win for Tilray
The markets reacted favorably news of the executive changes  with shares jumping by 10  as of writing this article  Over the past 12 months  Tilray has steadily lost most of its market value as cannabis stocks  for the most part  declined substantially in 2019  Back in November  Tilray posted mixed Q3 results  with losses continuing to mount and weak sales in some of its key segments  notably its adult use recreational market 
While Canada s 2 0 legalization opens up new opportunities for cannabis companies  cannabis stocks have a long way to go before they recover to their earlier highs  with Tilray being no exception ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph-ka,2059347
124462,345977,TAP,Banking Giant UBS Favors These 3 High Yield Dividend Stocks,opinion,Dividends are a wonderful thing for investors  These profit sharing payments from companies to stock owners provide a steady income stream which can be reinvested in the shares  diverted to other endeavors  or even just pocketed  Payments are usually small   sometimes just a few cents per share  and provide an incentive for investors to buy up more blocks of stock Dividend stocks are even more attractive in today s climate of low interest rate  The US Federal Reserve dropped its key rate three times in 2019  brining it down to just 1 75   Bond yields are consequently low  in the neighborhood of 1 5  to 2 25   For stock dividends  however  there is no set ceiling  and yields can grow as far as the paying company s profits will allow Swiss banking titan UBS is getting into the January stock recommendations with three interesting dividend picks   each with a dividend yield exceeding 4

million sequentially  EPS  at  5 39  was a half percent ahead of the forecast The key point for this article  however  is the dividend  AVGO raised its payment in December to  3 25 quarterly  or  13

with Canadian cannabis producer HEXO to create marijuana infused beverages  Combining an established beverage marketing and distribution network with a large cannabis grower offers a reasonable path for expansion A sweetener for investors  however  is the company s 12 year history of reliable dividend payments  After holding the quarterly payment steady for years  at 41 cents  TAP made a special payment in August 2019 of 57 cents  The annualized payout   2 28  indicates that this may be the new normal for TAP dividends  And at the current share price  that puts the yield at a strong 4 35

The company reported earnings of  1 52 a share on revenue of  2 95 billion  missing consensus estimates compiled by Investing com for earnings of  1 67 a share on revenue of  3 03 billion 
 Molson Coors   NYSE TAP  shares fell more than 8  and are off about 25  from their 52 week high  reached in August 2018  The shares are off 52  since peaking at  111 25 in October 2016 
The earnings miss comes as the company sold less volume of beer on falling demand  blaming bad weather and a weak industry backdrop 
Worldwide brand volume decreased 5 6  to 24 3 million hectoliters in the quarter from a year earlier  with broad based declines seen across geographies  including the United States  Canada  Europe and other international markets such as South America 
 May and June were challenging reflecting unfavorable weather and weak industry demand across our major geographies  resulting in a disappointing volume performance in the quarter   Hunter said in a statement 
Its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands offered some reason to cheer  however  with a strong showing during the quarter ahead of the ramp up in marketing efforts 
 We also saw strong premium light share growth in the U S  as Miller Lite and Coors Light each gained segment share   Hunter added 
Hunter will retire on Sept  27  and Gavin Hattersley  the leader of the company s U S  business  will become CEO the next day ",2019-07-31,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--molson-coors-brews-up-earnings-miss-shares-slump-1940915,1940915

124529,346044,TAP,Is Molson Coors  TAP  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Molson Coors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 09  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 22  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Molson Coors  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 88  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should also point out that Molson Coors has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 10  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company s share price will likely appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Molson Coors has a P S ratio of about 1 14  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 30 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  TAP is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Molson Coors currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Molson Coors a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Molson Coors is 2 71  a level that is lower than the industry average of 3 13  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 17  which is far better than the industry average of 16 44  Clearly  TAP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Molson Coors might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F  This gives TAP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 4 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMolson Coors is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 26   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best

124530,346045,TAP,Bear Of The Day  Molson Coors  TAP ,opinion,"Extreme volatility makes the stock market a very scary place to navigate  Stocks whipping around like mad  huge spikes and precipitous drops everywhere you look  On a day like Tuesday  where everything is rallying off the lows  it may feel like you can get out there and buy anything  This can work out in the short run  but in the long run can cost investors money  Picking up stocks on sale is smart  buy low and sell high  Sometimes those stocks that are running temporarily off the lows don t have the goods to backup their moves  One way to make sure you find a stock that can talk the talk and walk the walk is by looking at its earnings trend  Stock with strong  positive earnings trends tend to do better across all markets 
Stocks with weaker or negative earnings trends fit into our Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  category  One such stock is today s Bear of the Day  Molson Coors  TAP   Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP  manufactures  markets  and sells beer and other malt beverage products in the United States  Canada  Europe  and internationally  The company sells various products under the Blue Moon  Coors Banquet  Coors Light  Miller Genuine Draft  Miller Lite  Hamm s  Icehouse  Keystone  Mickey s  Miller64  Miller High Life  Milwaukee s Best  Olde English  Steel Reserve  Grolsch  Hop Valley  Leinenkugel s  Peroni Nastro Azurro  Pilsner Urquell  Revolver  Saint Archer  Sol  Terrapin  Crispin  Smith   Forge  Arnold Palmer Spiked  Henry s Hard  Redd s  and Steel Reserve Alloy Series brands 
The reason for the unfavorable rank lies in the series of earnings estimate revisions to the downside coming from analysts  In the last week alone  no fewer than seven analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year while next year s estimates have been cut by six analysts  The bearish sentiment has dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from  4 63 to  4 39 while next year s number has come down from  4 75 to  4 40   
That negativity has put a damper on the stock s price  After trading over  66 in late January of this year  shares have come down to  51 19 as of the close yesterday  Most of the time  TAP has been trading beneath its 200 day moving average  That moving average is also negatively sloped  helping to add to the bearish sentiment

124564,346079,TAP,This Alcohol Stock Is Undervalued And Has A High Dividend Yield,opinion,"Companies that make alcoholic beverages have seen their share prices languish in recent years  Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP  is no exception  The stock peaked at  111 in 2016 but today  trades for just  60  For beer makers in particular  the years long trend of consumers opting for craft brews instead of the large  global brands has taken its toll 
In addition  wine and liquors are increasingly popular among younger consumers  eschewing large  legacy brands like the offerings of Molson Coors  The company has been slow to adapt and has instead opted to grow its size and scale rather than focus on building out niche brands  This has led to weak share price action  but we are optimistic that the low valuation and high dividend yield will lead to strong returns in the years to come 
Indeed  we rate Molson Coors as the strongest among the group of alcohol stocks in terms of total expected returns for the stock  Given that there is a number of high quality names in the group  that is high praise 
Business Overview And Recent Events
Molson Coors was founded in 1873 and in the 146 years since  it has grown into one of the largest brewers of beer in the world  Its brands include Coors Light  Coors Banquet  Molson Canadian  Carling  Blue Moon  Crispin Cider  and Miller Lite  among others  The last brand is the product of a joint venture between the Coors and Miller brands 
On February 12th  Molson Coors reported Q4 earnings  and results were disappointing  Revenue declined 5  against the year ago period in constant currency  missing expectations 
Earnings per share did come in at  0 84 on an adjusted basis  which was in excess of estimates  capping a year of 12  adjusted earnings per share growth  Molson Coors has been on a journey of cutting costs in recent years as it recognized the company s operating model wasn t fit for a world with a sizable and growing craft beer presence  A lower tax rate helped in 2018 as well  but investors haven t been impressed thus far 

Source  Investor presentation  page 8
One of Molson Coors  core operating principals is cutting costs that remain from the merger of Molson and Coors  The company saved  255 million in 2017  another  240 million last year  and expects to save a further  205 million this year  Management is focused on every step in the supply chain to cut costs as well as its brewing operations and back office support costs  The company sees another  450 million in savings from 2020 to 2022  and we see this as a key differentiator among the alcohol stocks group in terms of margin expansion  resulting in earnings growth 
Tariffs passed by the Trump administration  specifically those on aluminum imports from the European Union  Mexico  and Canada  could boost production costs  However  Molson Coors has brands in its portfolio that could pass those costs on to consumers  which should help alleviate any damage to margins that would have resulted from the tariffs  Still  it is something investors should keep an eye on in the coming quarters 
Indeed  the company s suite of successful global brands is its key differentiator and we believe the stock s low valuation means Molson Coors is worth a look for value investors 
Molson Coors trades for 12 2 times 2019 earnings per share estimates of  4 95  which compares very favorably to our estimate of fair value at 15 times earnings  That implies that shareholders could see a boost in annual returns of 4 2  in the coming years as the valuation reflates to our estimate of fair value 
Further  we expect Molson Coors to produce earnings growth of 5  annually and combined with its low valuation and 2 7  dividend yield  we forecast total returns of 12  per year 
Debt Reduction Leads To Dividend Growth
Speaking of the dividend  we see meaningful growth potential there as well  Molson Coors has a payout ratio of just one third of earnings  meaning the dividend is very safe  The company has been focused in recent years on managing its ballooning debt levels  which it has done admirably 
At the time of the merger  pro forma debt was  5 2X EBITDA  which is very high  The company has worked in the years since the merger to lower debt to  4X EBITDA in 2018 and a goal of  3 75X EBITDA in the middle of this year  While there is still more work to do  Molson Coors is significantly reducing its leverage  and over time  that will not only improve its ability to grow earnings  but its ability to support dividend growth as well 
The company s stated goals for cash usage are investing in growth opportunities with the highest returns  strengthening its balance sheet  and returning cash to shareholders via the dividend  While increasing the payout is clearly third on this list of three  we think the journey to reduce leverage is in its later stages  meaning more cash will be available to return to shareholders in the coming years 
The payout has been flat since 2015 and that is because the company is focusing on reducing leverage and is using cash it may otherwise have spent on the dividend to do so  However  that won t last forever and when management is satisfied with its balance sheet leverage  it will almost certainly begin increasing the payout once again 
We see the payout growing at the same rate as earnings in the coming years  creating a payout in excess of  2 per share by 2024  That number may prove to be low if Molson Coors sees better than expected earnings growth and or decides to boost its payout ratio from the current low value of 33   This company has a history of returning lots of cash to shareholders  and we think cost savings  as well as debt reduction are paving the way for future dividend increases 
Molson Coors has an attractive suite of global brands with high levels of market share in their respective geographies  While the company has struggled somewhat in recent years  we think the future is much brighter given that Molson Coors is well into its journey of investing for future growth  reducing debt  and removing waste and excess from its operating model 
We forecast mid single digit earnings growth in the coming years and a resumption of dividend increases after years of stagnant payouts  With expected returns of 12  per year  we rate Molson Coors as the most attractive alcohol stock

    Let s see how things are shaping prior to the earnings announcement Factors at PlayMolson Coors  robust earnings trend in recent quarters indicates that it is reaping benefits of positive global pricing  strength in Europe and International  and cost savings  Further  the company is encouraged by the portfolio premiumization efforts and robust innovation pipeline  Moreover  its restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability bode well  These efforts should help retain the positive earnings trend in the to be reported quarter However  the company s top line in fourth quarter 2018 was plagued by lower volumes in the United States and Canada  which also impacted global brand volume  Though it witnessed volume gains in Europe and International businesses  this was not enough to offset declines in Canada and the United States  The persistence of soft volume in these regions might prove detrimental to first quarter 2019 results Volume in the Canada business segment reflects declines in the West and Ontario while beer volume in the United States has been weak for a while due to tough industry conditions  Consumers  changing preferences  aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages mainly contributed to this decline  Looking at the year ahead  the company expects further contraction of the U S  beer industry volume  While it plans to offset these by accelerating its portfolio premiumization and improving industry volume share trends  uncertainty regarding the execution of these plans still remains  This is likely to pull down sales numbers again in first quarter 2019 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the first quarter for the United States  Europe and Canada stands at  1 656 million   352 million and  268 million  respectively  This reflects sales growth of 0 5  year over year in the United States and declines of 5 9  and 5 6   respectively  in Europe and Canada  Notably  the consensus estimate for overall quarterly sales is pegged at  2 328 million  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter Additionally  Molson Coors continues to battle input cost inflation  which has been a hindrance for a while now particularly due to higher aluminum and freight costs  Management expects these hurdles to linger in 2019  Notably  the United States remains the biggest driver of increased cost of goods sold  COGS  for the company For 2019  it estimates COGS per hectoliter to increase in a mid single digit in the United States  which is similar to the 2018 level  mostly due to higher aluminum and other input costs  Clearly  these hurdles along with increased tariffs on aluminum imports and beverage exports  due to the U S  China trade war  remain a concern for Molson Coors  bottom line in the upcoming results  Furthermore  unfavorable foreign exchange rates are likely to mar top and bottom lines in the first quarter of 2019 What Does Zacks Model Predict  Our proven model does not conclusively predict that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fourth quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Molson Coors  Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an Earnings ESP of  11 82  makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat The Estee Lauder Companies Inc    NYSE EL   has an Earnings ESP of  1 08  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Church   Dwight Co   Inc    NYSE CHD   has an Earnings ESP of  0 30  and a Zacks Rank of 2 Keurig Dr Pepper  Inc   NYSE KDP   has an Earnings ESP of  1 08  and a Zacks Rank  3 Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year Who wouldn t  Our annual Top 10s have beaten the market with amazing regularity  In 2018  while the market dropped  5 2   the portfolio scored well into double digits overall with individual stocks rising as high as  61 5   And from 2012 2017  while the market boomed  126 3  Zacks  Top 10s reached an even more sensational  181 9  ",2019-04-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/molson-coors-tap-to-post-q1-earnings-whats-in-the-offing-200411647,200411647
124567,346082,TAP,3 CBD Stocks Set To Fly High As The Cannabis Sector Heats Up,opinion,"Cannabidiol  referred to as CBD  is a chemical compound found in hemp  a close relative of the cannabis plant  Unlike marijuana  it doesn t have the same psychoactive properties so it won t provide a high for users  Instead  CBD affords a wide range of health benefits  from reducing anxiety to easing pain and improving sleep  About 64 million Americans have already tried CBD  according to Consumer Reports 
As the cannabis sector expands its reach  and with CBD becoming increasingly mainstream  a broad array of beverages  foods and cosmetics companies are diving into the market  The U S  Natural Products Association reports that more than 1 500 CBD related products were released over the last three years 
The result  the CBD industry has the potential to become a  22 billion business by 2022  according to Cannabis focused research firm  Brightfield Group  Three companies from different corners of the CBD market look to be in a position to fly high 
1  GW Pharmaceuticals
Shares of GW Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ GWPH   which currently offers the only FDA approved drug derived from CBD  have skyrocketed almost 83  this year  The stock closed at  177 99 on Wednesday  giving it a market cap of around  5 5 billion 

The biotech firm delivered better than expected first quarter earnings on May 6  as sales of its CBD derived anti epilepsy Epidiolex drug  which gained FDA approval in June 2018  soared past forecasts 
The company brought in revenue of  39 2 million in just the three months ending March 31  rising a whopping 1 200  from  3 million in revenue from the same period a year earlier  Epidiolex   the drug behind the company s revenue surge   had sales totaling  33 5 million in the first quarter  which more than doubled consensus forecasts of  16 million 
GW also reported positive phase three trial results for the drug in treating another rarer form of epilepsy  The company plans to submit a supplemental application for FDA approval in the fourth quarter of 2019 
The U K  based healthcare firm also announced it will launch Epidiolex in five major European markets by the end of the year  a development which could see sales increase significantly in the coming years 
2  Molson Coors
Molson Coors  NYSE TAP   became the first major beverage company to enter the CBD space when it announced plans to develop CBD infused beverages in August 2018 

The Denver based brewer set up a joint venture with Canadian cannabis grower  Hexo  NYSE HEXO    TSX HEXO   to create a partnership  to pursue opportunities to develop non alcoholic  cannabis infused beverages for the Canadian market   The joint venture  known as Truss  sees Molson hold a majority 57 5  stake  while Hexo owns the rest 
That makes the North American beer giant well placed to take a meaningful share of the Canadian CBD soft drink market when edibles and infused beverages become legal there on October 17  The CBD beverage market in Canada is estimated to be worth around  2 2 billion  according to Mark Hunter  president  and CEO of Molson Coors 
The U S  cannabis beverage market  meanwhile  is projected to be worth  1 4 billion by 2024  according to recent estimates  As it stands  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  prohibits adding CBD to foods and beverages  though efforts to reschedule the chemical compound as a legal food supplement have lately been gathering pace 
Shares  which closed at  57 43 last night  are up roughly 3  so far this year 
3  Ulta Beauty
Ulta  NASDAQ ULTA   one of the most popular beauty retailers in the U S   announced plans in mid March to start carrying a variety of CBD infused skin care products for the first time 

The cosmetics giant currently offers five products from Cannuka  which blends CBD with manuka honey  online and in all of its stores except for Nebraska  Idaho  and South Dakota  where CBD is still outlawed  The products are aimed at both men and women 
Shares of the cosmetics giant  which are up around 38  in 2019  ended at  337 48 yesterday  not far from an all time high of  359 69 reached on April 17 
Despite the strong gains racked up since the start of the year  the stock looks set for further appreciation as more consumers turn to CBD infused wellness products  Jefferies analysts estimate that the CBD beauty market could reach  25 billion in the next ten years  accounting for 10 15  of the global skincare market ",2019-06-06,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-set-to-fly-high-as-cbd-goes-mainstream-200428914,200428914

124640,346155,TAP,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Tyson Foods  Newell Brands  Molson Coors  Sysco And Kimberly Clark,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 30  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 2  including Tyson Foods   NYSE TSN    Newell Brands   NYSE NWL    Molson Coors   NYSE TAP    Sysco   NYSE SYY   and Kimberly Clark   NYSE KMB   Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 2Link  Demand for everyday use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn t tend to fluctuate a lot  but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins  As such  the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U S  and global economy improves The outlook for the U S  economy has been favorable for the last several years  with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U S  expansion cycle  In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts  these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation  as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies  That said  Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don t benefit to the same extent from U S  tax law changes as the more domestic companies With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space  Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue boosting initiatives  which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns On that note  let s delve deeper in some of the major growth driving strategies of the space Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances  Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets  Some of these are also forming partnerships  mostly with larger and better known companies  to strengthen their distribution networks  diversify portfolios  expand their reach and enhance market positioning  Notably  leveraging each other s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M A activities Mergers of Tyson Foods with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands  in August 2014   tobacco giants Reynolds American  NYSE RAI  and Lorillard  in June 2015   and consumer goods companies Newell Brands and Jarden  in 2016  were the most talked about deals  Apart from this  Molson Coors acquired SABMiller  LON SAB  plc s 58  stake in MillerCoors  which made the former the third largest brewer in the world  after Anheuser Busch InBev and Heineken Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost reduction initiatives to boost profits  In the latter half of 2017  Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program  with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency  reducing overheads and fueling bottom line performance  Additionally  Sysco s core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy  We also commend Kimberly Clark s 2018 Global Restructuring   Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere  FORCE  programs  which are expected to generate cost savings of more than  2 billion over the next four years Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories  Thus  companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions  Notably  constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated

124700,346215,TAP,Should Value Investors Pick Molson Coors  TAP  Stock  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Molson Coors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 22 7  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Molson Coors  current PE ratio fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 35 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Molson Coors has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Molson Coors has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Molson Coors currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Molson Coors a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Molson Coors is 2 2  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 15 8  which is far better than the industry average of 22 7  Clearly  TAP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Molson Coors might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B  This gives TAP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been showing a bullish trend  First quarter 2018 has seen one estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year 2018 estimate has also seen three up and one down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the first quarter consensus estimate has risen by 7 7  in the past two months  while the 2018 estimate has inched up by 4 6  Despite this bullish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMolson Coors is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 22  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  its industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Molson Coors Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2

124705,346220,TAP,Coors Serves Up Warm Beers For The Chinese,news,"By    Coors Light markets itself as being best at ice cold temperatures  Designed with scenes of Colorado s Rocky Mountains  the can even uses special technology that changes colors from silver to blue  notifying consumers when the beer is at its ideal icy temperature 
But its slogan   the coldest tasting beer in the world   may not fly in other international markets    particularly China 
In China  ice cold drinks are not widely consumed  Conventional wisdom has it that cold liquids are bad for digestion  and instead the Chinese opt for warm or even hot beverages  even with scorching summer temperatures outside  Instead of cold glasses of water  many Chinese drink hot tea  or even hot water  because it aids in breaking down and digesting fats 
Taking this habit into consideration  Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP   has lowered the threshold of coldness of its special thermochromatic ink to change colors at warmer temperatures for cans that will be sold in China 
  We take into account local drinking habits  but brand identity will remain the same   President and CEO of Molson Coors International  Krishnan Anand told Bloomberg 
Peter Swinburn  the CEO of Molson Coors  said  we dropped the temperature for the thermochromatic ink  and it still turns blue  but it s not so cold   Cans and bottles sold in China will turn blue when the beer drops below 44 6 degrees Fahrenheit  or 7 degrees Celsius  while the standard in North America changes colors at 39 2 degrees Fahrenheit  which is roughly 4 degrees Celsius 

China is an ideal market for Molson Coors  With a growing middle class with matching growing wallets  and an affinity for foreign brands  beer consumption in emerging markets like India and China is estimated to increase nearly eight percent in the next five years  Euromonitor International  a research firm  reported 
Molson Coors diversification of markets is a necessary strategy considering the Golden  Colorado based company s main markets    the U S   U K   and Canada    are expected to see sales fall in the same period by 0 7 percent

Molson Coors has been recording negative beer volumes in the U S  and Canada for quite some time  In the U S   the company witnessed declines due to reduced labor participation rates and lower consumer confidence  Though economic conditions improved slightly  competition from outside the beer category remained  In the first quarter  both the U S  domestic sales to retailers volume  STRs  and domestic sales to wholesalers volume  STWs  declined 2  and 4   respectively 
Last month  CNBC also pointed weak EBITDA guidance during investors meeting  Per reports  the company now expects underlying EBITDA margins to grow 30 60 bps per year for the next three to four years  This is weaker than the company s previous expectation of 50 60 bps per year for the next three years  as announced during earnings conference 
In fact  Molson Coors began 2017 on a dismal note and reported lower than expected results for the second time when it posted first quarter 2017 results on May 3  A glimpse at the company s past performance reveals that it has lagged earnings estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average miss of 22 6   Also  sales lagged the same in four of the last seven quarters 
Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 07 for the second quarter declined by a penny over the last 30 days  The stock also holds a VGM score of  D   which makes it unfavorable at the moment Molson Coors Brewing Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Initiatives 
Molson Coors has been undertaking restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability  Moving ahead  management plans to deliver more than  175 million as cost savings in 2017  The company expects to generate  550 million of cost savings by the year 2019  Notably  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company boasts a strong portfolio of well established brands and consistently makes innovations to expand its market share 
Furthermore  the company is expanding global footprint and accelerating its international business through acquisitions  Whether these ongoing initiatives will be able to spark a turnaround in the company s performance  is a wait and watch story 
Stocks to Consider
A better ranked stock in the alcohol industry includes Craft Brew Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ BREW    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has posted a positive earnings surprise of 50  in the last reported quarter  You can see 
Investors interested in the broader Consumer Staples sector can also consider Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ OLLI   and Energizer Holdings  Inc    NYSE ENR    both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
While Ollie s Bargain has a long term earnings growth rate of 18 9   Energizer Holdings has a long term earnings growth rate of 9 8

Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

124718,346233,TAP,TAP Vs  SAM  Which Is The Better Beer Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"According to a recent Gallup poll  beer continues to be the most favored alcoholic beverage in the U S  The poll conducted early this month reveals that 40  of alcohol consumers prefer beer  compared to 30  who prefer wine and 26  who have voted for liquor  These findings come at a time when it is widely being held that millennials prefer to consumer wine over beer 
The Gallup poll findings clearly show that if this is indeed the case  beer is not going to give up its dominance of the alcoholic beverages space in a hurry  This is a consumer staples category for which demand remains steady regardless of the current economic situation  In this context  earnings of beer companies scheduled for release over this week and the next  including Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD   and Diageo  LON DGE  plc   NYSE DEO    assume greater significance 
With The Boston Beer Company  Inc    NYSE SAM   scheduled  to report on Jul 27 and the Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   reporting on Aug 2  this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock  While Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Boston Beer carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
Price Performance
Both Boston Beer and Molson Coors have performed poorly over the last three months  a period during which the Zacks categorized  industry has gained 3 6   However  while Molson Coors has lost 7 5  over this time period  Boston Beer has only declined by 4 5   making it the better choice on this count 

Valuation
The price to sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales  This ratio indicates that market value of each of the company s sales dollars 

Coming to the two stocks under consideration  both are undervalued compared to the wider industry  which has an exorbitant P S ratio of 21 14  However  Boston Beer is the pricier of the two  since it has a P S ratio of 1 99  higher than Molson Coor s reading of 1 69     
Net Margin
Profitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by low margins  Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within the same industry  since they are bound by the same business constraints 

With a net margin value of 9 8   Boston Beer is well behind the industry average of 20 5   However  is better placed on this count compared to Molson Coors  whose value for the metric stands at 8 5 
Debt to Equity Ratio
The debt to equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity  In the context of the beer industry  it is an indicator of the company s long term sustainability  Since Boston Beer utilizes a negligible amount of debt  or no bet to fund its operations  it has a debt to equity ratio of 0  In contrast  Molson Coor s debt to equity ratio of 104 03 is alarmingly high  which means Boston Beer easily wins this round 

Asset Turnover Ratio
Since the beer industry is essentially characterized by low margins and high volumes  activity ratios are extremely important when determining the health of a company  All activity ratios are geared toward gauging a company s ability to convert various heads under its balance sheet into sales or cash  The asset turnover ratio examines the level of efficiency with which a company utilizes its assets to conduct sales 

With an asset turnover ratio of 1 45  Boston Beer is comfortably placed with respect to the broader industry  whose value for this metric stands at 0 52  In this context  Molson Coors has an asset turnover ratio of 0 28  which places it at a disadvantage to both the industry and Boston Beer
Quick Ratio 
Considered to be a conservative measure of liquidity  the quick ratio gauges as to how liquid the current position of a company is  In other words  it measures the extent to which liquid current assets can service current liabilities  The measure is conservative since it does not take into account current assets which are relatively less liquid such as inventory 

With a quick ratio of 1 21  Boston Beer is better placed compared to the broader industry  whose value for this metric stands at 0 65  Molson Coors is poorly placed on this count since its quick ratio stands at 0 43 
Earnings History and ESP
When considering   there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks with both having readings of 0  However  taking into account a more comprehensive earnings history  Molson Coors has delivered a positive surprise in only one of the four preceding quarters and has an average earnings surprise of  22 6   Boston Beer is better on this count  since it has delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the four prior quarters  Further  it has an average earnings surprise of 30 6  
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that Molson Coors holds an edge over Boston Beer when considering price to sales ratio  But on all other counts Boston Beer has a clear edge  Not only does it have a relatively better price performance and superior earnings history  it is better placed when considering net margin  debt to equity  asset turnover and quick ratios  With a better Zacks Rank  2  Boston Beer is clearly placed better than Molson Coors ahead of earnings

124743,346258,TAP,What s In Store For Molson Coors  TAP  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Molson Coors Brewing Co    NYSE TAP   is set to report third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Nov 1  Last quarter  this beverage company posted a negative earnings surprise of 2 63   It should be noted that the company has posted two positive and two negative earnings surprises in the last four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 6 64  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement 
Factors to Consider 
We note that Molson Coors has been struggling with weak volumes in the major markets of Canada  the U S  and Europe over the past several quarters  Despite a modest recovery in the macroeconomic scenario  the company witnessed a year over year decline in earnings and revenues throughout 2015  as well as the first and second quarters of 2016 due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency movements  We expect weak volumes to hinder growth in the to be reported quarter 
Nevertheless  the company s cost savings initiatives  continuous focus on brand building and increased marketing investments should have a positive impact on third quarter results  in our view MOLSON COORS B Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Though US markets closed higher yesterday  this morning the dollar fell and global stocks are mostly down as markets await Fed Chair Janet Yellen s two day Congressional testimony which begins later this morning  The dollar s decline may also be a result of the resignation of US National Security Advisor Michael Flynn  after it became clear that he d lied about discussions he d had with Russia s ambassador to the US prior to President Trump s inauguration  Flynn held the position for less than a month 
Yellen is expected to answer questions about her confidence in the US and global economies  if and when there will be additional interest rate hikes  normalizing the Fed balance sheet  and the possible impact of deregulation and other fiscal policy proposals  Her tone and level of forthrightness could influence the direction markets will take in the coming days

124749,346264,TAP,Is Molson Coors  TAP  Poised For A Beat In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Molson Coors Brewing Co    NYSE TAP   is set to report first quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on May 3  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this beverage company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  The company s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and missed in the remaining two of the trailing four quarters  marking an average miss of 5 70  
Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model shows that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks Earnings ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 76   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 32  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 31  This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Molson Coors currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Molson Coors  Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 76  makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat Molson Coors Brewing Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Which Way Are Estimates Trending 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and 2017 has been declining over the last 30 days  In fact  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 31 per share and  6 30 for the first quarter and full year 2017 reflect a year over year surge of 143 1  and 98 7   respectively 
Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  2 5 billion for the said quarter  up 275 5  from the year ago period  For 2017  Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at  11 2 billion  reflecting a 128 3  year over year increase 
Factors to Consider
We note that Molson Coors has been reporting sluggish results since the past many quarters due to lower volumes and currency headwinds  Though Molson Coors  fourth quarter 2016 earnings increased year over year  it was way behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47 7   Net sales declined 4 2  year over year and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 9  
Sales in the International regions improved  driven by the acquisition of the Miller global brands  However  it declined in the regions of Canada and Europe  Continued difficult economy and competitive pressure  along with lower volumes and significant unfavorable foreign currency also remain company s headwinds 
We observed that the stock has not only underperformed the Zacks categorized Beverages Alcoholic industry but also the broader sector on a year to date basis  Molson Coors  shares fell 1 6  in comparison to the Zacks categorized  industry s growth of 8 6  and sector s growth of 7 3  year to date 
The industry is part of the top 39  of the Zacks Classified industries  104 out of the 265   The broader Consumer Staples sector is placed at the bottom 38  of the Zacks Classified sectors  10 out of 16   We believe the sector s underperformance is impacting the shares of the company in the near term 

The company is therefore focusing on improved marketing strategies for beers and targeting the above premium brands to boost its market share  The company s recent acquisition of 58  stake in MillerCoors  cost savings efforts and marketing investments are encouraging 
In the area of cost savings  the company exceeded its 2016 goal by achieving more than  165 million of in year cost reductions  After the acquisition of the remaining 58  stake in MillerCoors  the company expects to drive substantial cost synergies in the next three years and continues to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations  This will also help the company to drive top line growth  profit  cash generation  debt pay down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead  The company expects cost savings of  550 million over the next three years till 2019 
Stocks to Consider

Energizer Holdings  Inc    NYSE ENR   has an Earnings ESP of  5 88  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Treehouse Foods  Inc    NYSE THS   has an Earnings ESP of  4 62  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   has an Earnings ESP of  1 35  and a Zacks Rank  3

124764,346279,TAP,AB InBev SABMiller Merger OK d In UK  To Close On Oct 10 ,opinion,The mega merger of the Belgian American Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD    alias AB InBev  and the Anglo South African SABMiller  LON SAB  plc   OTC SBMRY   has finally cleared all hurdles  The last in the line was the approval of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales regarding the scheme of arrangement for implementation  which was approved on Oct 4 With the merger now ready to take off  AB InBev revealed that the first step towards the execution of the merger agreement is delisting of SABMiller shares on the London Stock Exchange  effective Oct 5 AB InBev expects to close the acquisition on Oct 10  almost a year after the deal was originally proposed  The new company will retain the AB InBev banner and SABMiller will cease to trade under its current name in the U S   starting Oct 11 The BackgroundAB InBev and SABMiller had reached an agreement to create the  first truly global beer company   back in Oct 2015  After clearing all regulatory hurdles in August  AB InBev and SABMiller received unanimous support from its shareholders for the deal worth at over  100 billion on Sep 28  thus clearing a major roadblock for the big beer merger  The deal gathered votes from a larger than required margin as 95 5  of SABMiller s shareholders supported the takeover  However  approval from only 75  shareholders was needed  excluding the company s two largest stakeholders   U S  tobacco company Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   and Colombia investor group Bevco Altria and Bevco  which together hold a 41  stake in SABMiller  had previously given their nod to the deal against a separate cash and stock offer from AB InBev and as was approved by the U K  Scheme Directions Hearing on Aug 22 What the Mega Brew Merger Has in Store As this massive takeover nears completion  it would be right to evaluate who gains what out of the deal and where the brewing industry is headed from here  The deal is likely to lay foundations to a mega brewing company that will control about one thirds of the global beer market  leaving behind Heineken NV   OTC HEINY    which holds about an 11  market share of the industry  Moreover  it will expand the company s share in the global beer profits and worldwide volumes  growing to nearly 46  and 27   respectively  This means that the new entity s share in global beer profits will grow four folds  and its volumes will double that of Heineken Further  it will fortify AB InBev s presence globally  lowering its reliance on the mature U S  and struggling Brazilian markets  while gaining exposure to 17 African countries and the fast growing Latin American markets  such as Colombia and Peru  The takeover comes at an opportune time for AB InBev as it is struggling to revive its Budweiser brand in the U S    its largest market  and continues to face an economic downturn in Brazil   its second largest market As for the industry  this merger is going to be a one off event as it is probably going to change the face of the beer industry  Apart from being mutually beneficial  the deal should benefit many rival brewers who got their hands on the portions of SABMiller that AB InBev was forced to sell off in order to back regulatory approvals in various countries  For this  the company sold SABMiller brands including Miller Lite  Peroni and Snow  which are among the world s leading beer brands Further  in a bid to please U S  regulators  AB InBev disposed SABMiller s 58  stake in its joint venture MillerCoors LLC to Molson Coors Brewing Co    NYSE TAP   for  12 billion  This will make Molson Coors  which previously held a 42  stake in MillerCoors  the major stakeholder in the joint venture  Additionally  this will lift Molson s ranking amid the world s most profitable brewers from fifth to third  according to analysts  Further  this will make Molson the second largest brewer in the U S  with a 25  market share Thus  this deal is expected to benefit the entire brewing industry as it has bolstered the position of many rivals  making competition tough for AB InBev itself  However  we believe the combined entity will be strong enough to handle competition from these rivals with a portfolio of brands including leading names like Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Castle Lager AB InBev currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while SABMiller carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  ANHEUSER BU ADR Price   Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-10-04,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ab-inbev-sabmiller-merger-ok'd-in-uk,-to-close-on-oct-10-200157294",200157294
124794,346309,TAP,Will Weak Volumes Hurt Molson Coors   TAP  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Molson Coors Brewing Co    NYSE TAP   is set to report second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Aug 2  Last quarter  this beverage company posted a positive earnings surprise of 25 58   It should be noted that the company has posted three positive and one negative earnings surprise in the last four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 8 80  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement 
Factors to Consider 
We note that Molson Coors has been struggling with weak volumes in the major markets of Canada  the U S  and Europe over the past several quarters  Despite modest recovery in the macroeconomic scenario  the company witnessed year over year decline in earnings and revenues throughout 2015 and in the first quarter 2016 due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency movements  We expect weak volumes to hinder growth in the to be reported quarter 
Nevertheless  the company s cost savings initiatives  continuous focus on brand building and increased marketing investments should have a positive impact on the second quarter results  in our view 
Further  the company is pinning its hopes on the Anheuser Busch InBev  BUD  and SABMiller  LON SAB  deal  as only then will Molson Coors be able to get full ownership of MillerCoors MOLSON COORS B Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   Earnings ESP for Molson Coors is  2 66  as the Most Accurate estimate of  1 10 per share is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 
Zacks Rank  Molson Coors  Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a positive surprise 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum

Molson Coors  subsidiary MillerCoors is reportedly hoping to strengthen the marketing campaign for its Coors Banquet beer  one of the best selling brands in the United States  It is to be noted that Coors Banquet has managed to increase its sales for the past nine years  amid a scenario when most major domestic beers are losing sales and share of the market to craft beer 
Per reports  MillerCoors will increased its marketing marketing expenditure by 5  compared with the last year  in order to gain significant market share in the American beer market  The efforts are also directed toward capturing sales from full calorie competitors like Budweiser and Mexican imports 
In addition  the brewery expects to sell its beer at on premises locations  which will also help in creating customer loyalty MOLSON COORS B Price and Consensus   MillerCoors currently is a joint venture of Denver based Molson Coors and London based SABMiller  LON SAB  plc   OTC SBMRY   that sells both companies  products in the U S  Molson Coors will soon complete the  of MillerCoors  after the closing of Anheuser Busch InBev s   NYSE BUD    107 billion takeover of SABMiller  which is expected in the second half of 2016

On May 25  2016  per media sources  the two big global beer companies received approval to merge from the European Union s  EU  competition regulator  the European Commission  Anheuser Busch InBev could receive the EU approval after  in April to sell three of SABMiller s premium European beer brands for 2 55 billion euros  The sale included SABMiller s Peroni  Grolsch and Meantime brands  along with their related businesses in Italy  the Netherlands  U K  and internationally  minus certain U S  rights 
How Molson Coors Stands to Gain 
Denver based Molson Coors owns 42  of MillerCoors  its joint venture with SABMiller  It also  in MillerCoors in November  However  Molson Coors  acquisition of the remaining Millers Coors is conditioned upon the closing of AB InBev s  107 billion takeover of SABMiller  which is expected in the second half of 2016

We note that AB InBev SABMiller merger is a critical one and would draw scrutiny from antitrust regulators  as this would be the biggest beer merger ever and could have wide implications on the worldwide beer market  The merger is bringing together the two largest beer companies in the U S  with combined annual sales of over  70 billion  The concern with giant mergers like this is that the new combined company would wield too much power over pricing and hurt consumers 
AB InBev consequently agreed to divest SABMiller s 58  stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors  in order to satisfy the U S  regulators 
Molson Coors  purchase of SABMiller s stake would allow it to take strategic control of its operations in its biggest market  Molson Coors would also be in a position to gain significant synergies  which would allow the company to cut costs quickly  As the U S  beer market grows slowly  lower costs will help Molson Coors to increase its profits in the coming years

Why Are These Stocks Smoking Hot 

	Since people continue to smoke and drink even during times of recession as well as economic growth  such stocks are sometimes valued at a premium compared to companies that are more sensitive to economic trends  As a result  these stocks always benefit from the addictive nature of their products 

	Let us now have a look at 4 stocks that can be addictive additions to your portfolio 

The 4 Sinful Picks

Altria Group Inc       This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock fares well in the  too  with a Growth score of A  For the long term  Altria is expected to grow by 7 48   Further  the stock had a good run so far this year  gaining around 12 01   Over the past 30 days  analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company  with major estimate revisions moving north for fiscal 2016 earnings 

	The company reported better than expected results in the recently concluded first quarter 2016  Altria s top  and bottom line improved year over year backed by higher shipments and retail share gains by its flagship brand  Marlboro  Supported by lower excise tax  gross profit and operating income increased year over year during the period

Molson Coors Brewing Company      This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has a market cap of  22 1 billion and has the potential of robust 59 4  earnings growth in fiscal 2017 

	Almost all analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company and have moved their estimates northward during the past 60 days  Molson Coors reported better than expected results in first quarter fiscal 2016 owing to worldwide volume growth and lower cost of goods sold  These factors more than offset the negative impact from an unfavorable sales mix  higher brand spending  higher underlying tax rate and currency headwinds

124893,346408,TAP,Top Trade Ideas  ABT  ELLI  EW  FE  TAP,opinion,"Here are the rest of the Top 10 Trade Ideas 
Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT 

Abbott Laboratories  ABT  started a move lower to begin 2016 and continued for a month  It found a bottom at the end of January  down over 20   Since then it started higher  closing a gap from January and then continuing up  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD rising  supporting more upside 
Ellie Mae  NYSE ELLI 

Ellie Mae  ELLI  had a slow grind lower from an August high to a consolidation zone from November to January  A failed push higher saw it fall back to that zone before a quick move higher to the current consolidation  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD resetting lower  Look for a move up out of consolidation to participate 
Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW 

Edwards Lifesciences  EW  ran higher in a series of advances and pullbacks over 2015  In February it started higher again  reaching 90 before the current retracement  Friday saw a strong move higher in the falling channel to the top  The RSI is moving back higher after tagging the mid line and the MACD is turning up  Look for a break of the channel to participate in the upside 
FirstEnergy  NYSE FE 

FirstEnergy  FE  pulled back for almost all of 2015  finding its low in mid November  Since then it has reversed higher through a broad consolidation in December and January  then a bit tighter over February  and even tighter now  Momentum is strong with the RSI in the bullish zone  and the MACD flat and trying to avoid a cross down  Look for a move over resistance to participate to the upside 
Molson Coors Brewing  NYSE TAP 

Molson Coors Brewing  TAP  moved higher from the August low to a high in November  It stalled there and consolidated until starting to fall at the beginning of 2016  It pulled back and recovered before making a lower low  touching the 200 day SMA February 11th  Since then it has moved higher and is back at resistance  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is rising  Look for a break of resistance to the upside to participate 
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday  which heading into the end of the first quarter sees the run up in equities may have exhausted  at least in the short term 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue to pullback in its uptrend while crude oil does the same  but with a possible bounce  The US Dollar Index continues higher in the consolidation range while US treasuries may be breaking their downtrend to the upside  The Shanghai Composite looks better to the upside in the downtrend while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in their uptrend 
Volatility looks to remain low  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts suggest the recent uptrend may be exhausting  though with the SPY lading to the downside followed by the QQQ and the IWM consolidating  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

AB InBev  BUD  Offers to Sell More SABMiller Assets for EU Approval

Anheuser Busch InBev    NYSE BUD    announced Friday that it had offered to sell the Central and Eastern European operations of SABMiller    OTC SBMRY     which could be worth an estimated  8 billion  as it seeks European regulatory approval for company s  100 billion plus takeover of its closest rival 

The SABMiller Anheuser Busch combination would create an enormous company in the beer industry accounting for about 30  of global beer sales  Anheuser Busch has entered into a number of agreements to sell a variety of assets from the combined company in order to appease skepticism and regularity concerns about the merger 

Earlier this month  for example  AB InBev  by Asahi Group Holdings of Japan to buy the beer brands Grolsch  Meantime  and Peroni  as well as some of SABMiller s European operations  for   2 55 billion  or about  2 9 billion 

Anheuser Busch hopes to close the deal for SABMiller in the second half of this year 

 SABMiller s Central and Eastern European businesses have been a core part of our growth story since we first embarked on our international expansion strategy over 20 years ago   Alan Clark  SABMiller s chief executive  said in a  

Mr  Clark added   We are very proud of these businesses  their brands and the people that have made them the successes they are today  and we will continue to grow and support them throughout this process  

In November  Anheuser Busch  SABMiller s 59  stake in MillerCoors in the United States to SABMiller s partner in a joint venture  Molson Coors Brewing    NYSE TAP     for about  12 billion  That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second largest brewer in the United States  behind Anheuser Busch 

According to a  via Reuters  the European Commission  the European Union s antitrust regulator  is set to deliver its verdict on the SABMiller takeover by May 24   If the Commission chose to open an in depth investigation into the SAB deal  it would not receive clearance for up to 90 working days  a delay AB InBev may be keen to avoid  

Anheuser Busch InBev has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Investors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for TAP  as the consensus estimate has been moving downwards in the last 60 days  However  TAP s earnings season was quite a decent one  TAP has delivered positive surprise in three of the last four quarters  with negative surprise in one  making for an average positive surprise of 4 15  
Currently  TAP has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but that could definitely change following Molson Coors  earnings report which was just released  We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just revealed announcement below

Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP     is the world s fifth largest global brewer and it s about to get bigger  The company recently announced that they ll acquire full ownership of MillerCoors  their partnership with SAB Miller  President and CEO Mark Hunter commented on the deal saying   The transaction is a game changing opportunity for Molson Coors and advances our ambition to be the first choice for consumers and customers  MillerCoors is a business we know very well   its strategy  culture  brands and people   and we look forward to meeting and exceeding the needs of our valued distributor partners and consumers across the US  
I like it because it s a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The bullishness comes not only from a recent boost in the current year consensus but also a huge move in next year s numbers  We ve seen the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate jump from  3 19 to  3 29 as three analysts have increased their earnings estimates  Next year s number has gone from  4 05 to  5 38  Looks like the MillerCoors acquisition is likely to be accretive to next year s earnings 
The company is coming off a big beat last quarter with EPS coming in at 54 cents versus our Zacks Consensus Estimate calling for 43 cents  That s coming off the heels of a disappointing quarter where the company missed by 3 cents 

The stock has rallied as a result of the bullish sentiment on Wall Street  After failing to close above  95 into the end of last year  shares retreated with the broad market  testing  80 in mid February  From there  shares caught a strong bid and have been riding that move ever since  Yesterday shares closed just shy of the century mark at  99 94  With the Commodity Channel Index overbought at 138 I d wait for a pullback  I think it s a less risky scenario than trying to play a breakout above  100 ",2016-05-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-of-the-day:-molson-coors-(tap)-200129391,200129391
124919,346434,TAP,Tap Into the Growing Beer Industry,opinion,"As you crack open your favorite brew just before Super Bowl XLIX kicks off next Sunday  you ll probably be more focused on the Seahawks Patriots spread than how much value got sucked out of your long commodity portfolio last year 
But despite the pigskin distraction  the reality is  many of our commodity portfolios suffered over the last half of 2014 
However  the answer to gaining back some of your losses might just be in that fine brew that you re sipping 
Beer isn t a traditional commodity  as there are no futures markets associated with it  but it is considered an alternative investment 
And while there are likely to be some bad drives in the Super Bowl on Sunday  beer stocks are typically good plays  regardless of our economic condition 
Taking Inventory
Like wine  some beers benefit from extended aging  According to Wine Enthusiast  cellaring beer can mellow otherwise intense notes  meld commingling flavors  and ratchet up complexity  thus increasing the beer s value 
The collective period for beer is actually longer than you may think   sometimes over two years 
The best bottles to store are the malty  full bodied beers and those that have higher alcohol content over the more hop heavy brews  Good bets include imperial stouts  lambics  Belgian strong ales  and barleywines 
Unfortunately  not everyone can be a craft brewer like Jim Koch   the Founder of Samuel Adams  which is now the Boston Beer Company Inc  NYSE SAM  with sales exceeding over two million barrels annually 
In fact  it s not all that simple to start and become   Just 200 breweries were in operation in the 1980s  today  the number is around 1 600 
That s a lot of competition if you want to start your own brewery  but a lot to choose from if you re looking to invest 
Craft Brew Alliance Inc  NASDAQ BREW  is a listed craft brewer  However  most names are unlisted  meaning your best bet on the microbrewery side is to go the venture capital or private equity route 
Investors would do well to stick to the lower cost brands  such as InBev products like Budweiser and Stella Artois  which tend to do well during tough economic times  Other names to consider along with the  King of Beers  owner  Anheuser Busch  OTC AHBIF    are SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP   Diageo  is another good investment  as it has strong offerings in both North America and Europe with brands such as Guinness  Harp  Kilkenny  and Red Stripe But you don t have to stay loyal to just one brew 
Make Your Own Six Pack
If you would rather have a diversification of names  you can opt for an index 
The Dow Jones Brewers and the Dow Jones Distillers   Vintners are two to watch  Here s a five year comparative chart 

Investing along the beer supply chain is another good option  Enthusiasts can buy into providers of ingredients and packaging through agriculture  aluminum  and distribution companies 
Furthermore  there are new innovations in beer technology that aim to improve the industry as a whole  however  these are typically far from pure play investments 
So rather than crying over your beer if your team is losing  think about investing instead 
Cheers and good investing ",2015-01-26,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tap-into-the-growing-beer-industry-239645,239645
124920,346435,TAP,Record  108 Billion Bond Offering In Mega Brewer Takeover Of SABMiller,opinion,"Blockbuster Brewery Merger Coming Up
A record  5 trillion jumbo bond offerings hit the books in 2015  Will 2016 be another record year 
Perhaps not  but if the proposed Anheuser Busch Inbev SA  N BUD  takeover of SABMiller  L SAB  goes through  it will be the largest bond offering ever 
The  108 billion jumbo brewery offering will more than double the 2013 previous record bond deal of  49 billion by Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ  
Please consider  
Mega brewer Anheuser Busch InBev has tested investor appetite for a potential blockbuster bond offering later this week  as the group lines up financing for its  108bn takeover of rival SABMiller 
Bankers in New York and London have been gauging investor interest in what could be a record breaking debt offering  potentially eclipsing the watershed  49bn issue completed by telecom provider Verizon in 2013 
The volume of so called jumbo bonds  or more than  10bn in value  surged last year as a mergers and acquisitions boom drove companies to try to lock in cheap financing before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from near zero levels 
Investors have also preferred large bond deals as they increasingly fret about liquidity in the bond market and an inability to sell their portion of smaller issues without dramatically moving the price on offer downwards 

Budweiser  Miller Not Under Same Roof
The LA Times reports  
The world s two biggest beer makers will join forces to create a company that produces almost a third of the world s beer  But in the U S   the deal will not bring arch rivals Budweiser and Miller under the same roof 
To ease concerns the brewing behemoth might get a stranglehold of the U S  market  SABMiller will sell its 58  stake in a venture with fellow brewer Molson Coors Brewing Company  N TAP  for  12 billion  The deal includes rights to the Miller brand name and gives Molson Coors full control of operations 
The combined company   which as yet does not have a name   will also need to address regulatory issues in China  where SABMiller has a leading position with a 49  stake in the Chinese beer Snow  China is the focus of intense interest  as it already drinks a quarter of the world s beer 
The new company will be listed in Belgium  with secondary listings in Johannesburg  Mexico and New York 
The deal gives the new company 29  of the 198 billion liter global beer market   and makes it three times bigger than its nearest rival  Heineken  AS HEIN   with a mere 9   said Jeremy Cunnington  the senior alcoholic drinks analyst at Euromonitor International 
But to make the deal work  savings will need to be made  AB InBev expects to cut costs by  1 4 billion 
 AB InBev are second to none in being able to cut costs   Cunnington said   And they are utterly ruthless

Since it s beer we re talking about  not a 12 year old Scotch  you look for other options  It turns out that Kirin Ichiban  which is also a very good beer  is on sale for  1  That s a bargain  so you buy one 
You just demonstrated a basic economic principle   the law of demand  As prices rise  consumers  demand for a product or service declines  due in part to the substitution effect 
However  the financial markets work in a very different manner 
You see  investors seem to like stocks better when they become more expensive  In economics  this is known as a  Giffen good  
Luckily  human psychology and crowd behavior create an opportunity to profit from being rational and taking a perspective different than that of the masses  In other words  those who are willing to take an objective look at a stock s value  and not be biased by its popularity  are rewarded over time 
Beer stocks are popular nowadays because their underlying businesses are stable and they pay solid dividends  Like many companies in the consumer staples sector  beer stocks have become coveted  driving up their valuations 
But let s see if we can find any value among the brewers that ferment these wonderful libations 
Brewing Industry
When I think of beer stocks  Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE BUD  immediately comes to mind  This behemoth was formed with the merger of Anheuser Busch and InBev in 2008  and is now domiciled in Belgium  The shares that trade under the BUD ticker are American depositary receipts  ADRs  

With a  175 billion market cap and a solid 2 1  dividend yield  net of foreign withholding taxes   the stock certainly appears to live up to the company s  King of Beers  slogan  However  it also seems to be fairly expensive  based on its 3 8x price to sales ratio  In contrast  the median P S ratio of S P 500 constituents is 2 1x 
And although AB InBev has a 21  market share of global beer sales  its iconic Budweiser and Bud Light brands aren t the best selling beers in the world  Instead  Snow has become the world s most popular beer  due to rising beer consumption in China  Snow is produced by CR Snow  a joint venture between China Resource Enterprises and SABMiller plc  OTC SBMRF   It certainly seems like popular beers and popular stocks go hand in hand  as SABMiller trades with a lofty 5 1x price to sales ratio 
Another investor favorite  Boston Beer  NYSE SAM   has benefited from the craft beer craze  The company is growing revenue very quickly  but it s also the most expensive on the list  based on enterprise value to EBITDA  SAM is a glamour stock that not only doesn t pay a dividend  but it s also diluted shareholders with a 1 8  increase in its shares outstanding over the past year 
Similarly  Carlsberg A S  OTC  CABGY  and Heineken NV  OTC  HEINY  both have uninspiring total yields  dividend yield plus net buyback percentage   Molson Coors  NYSE TAP   on the other hand  has a nice total yield  but its P S and EV EBITDA are elevated 
In short  there s not much to like on this list  However  there is a Japanese brewer that warrants our attention 
Fermenting Value
Kirin Holdings  Kirin Holdings  OTC KNBWF  is predominantly a beer maker  but also produces spirits  soft drinks  food products  and pharmaceuticals  With a P S ratio of just 0 6x and an EV EBITDA of 8 2x  Kirin is by far the cheapest global brewer  It also has the highest total yield of the bunch 
In addition  Kirin has a major macro tailwind   Abenomics  is a certified failure  Japanese GDP contracted at an annualized 6 8  rate in the second quarter  due to the consumption tax increase that took effect April 1  Japan s so called  misery index   inflation rate plus unemployment rate  recently hit a 33 year high  I think the Japanese will be drowning a lot of sorrows with beer over the coming years 
Buy Kirin  It s a great beer and a cheap stock

124950,346465,TAP,Can Big Beer Buy Its Way Into The Craft Beer Boom ,opinion,"If you can t beat  em buy  em out   That s the approach Big Beer is taking in combatting the rise of microbrewing  Anheuser Busch Inbev OTC  OTC AHBIF   it would be buying 10 Barrel Brewing Co   a microbrewery based on Bend  Oregon   This follows BUD s move earlier this year to buy Blue Point Brewing Co 

It s easy enough to see BUD s rationale   Americans are drinking less beer than they used to  though they re trading up in the craft beer they do buy  While total beer sales were down 2  last year  craft beer sales rose 17  

Will this strategy work for Big Beer 

Let me answer that question with a question of my own 

Do you remember Killian s Irish Red   I used to love that beer   It was a trendy craft brew about 20 years ago before any of us had ever heard the term  craft brew  

You never really see Killian s any more   When drinking independent craft brews became the defining image of hipsterism  well  that and growing a luxuriant beard   Killian s association with Molson Coors Brewing Company  NYSE TAP  made it distinctly unhip  The brand has slid into irrelevance 

And then there is my favorite go to beer  the Spoetzl Brewery s Shiner Bock   In the late 1990s  no self respecting college boy in Texas would be seen drinking Bud Light   It was Shiner Bock or nothing   Ok  so maybe I went to a snobby school TCU   I can t speak for the unwashed masses at Texas A M or Tech  

The popularly of Shiner led to imitations most notably BUD s Ziegenbock  marketed as  for Texans by Texans  

Ziegenbock isn t a bad beer   But it s always been seen as a cheap imitation and that is marketing death when marketing an upscale product 

This brings me back to the problem facing Big Beer   BUD  TAP and SABMiller    can compete based on quality and variety   Hiring new brewmasters  and letting them experiment like mad scientists could easily create beers that rival Boston Beer     Spoetzl and the legions of brewpub startups across America 

The problem is one of marketing and to a lesser extent economies of scale   Craft beer has become a luxury good subject to the changing whims of fashion  and brand reputations are fragile  When your brand is associated with the common proles  it loses its cachet and it s hard to convince the fashionable to pay up for them   And this doesn t just apply to blue blooded patricians  The bearded hipster wearing  vintage  clothes from a thrift store can t be seen drinking a Bud Lite either   It violates their anti establishment ethos 

Another issue is economies of scale   The beauty of Big Beer operations is their massive and efficient production and distribution   But this goes completely out the window when you buy a locally produced microbrew   Mass producing it and selling it nationally or globally kills the  buy it local  vibe that made it popular to begin with   But keeping it local neutralizes Big Beers marketing and distribution power 

Could BUD and the rest of Big Beer take a play out of  s book  buying a company outright but leaving its management in place and maintaining a low profile  Maybe   But it s hard to see regional microbrews having much of an impact on the bottom lines of companies with tens of billions in annual sales 

So  what are investors to do here   From the tone of this article  you might think I was a Big Beer bear   Nothing could be further from the truth   I m actually a major long term bull in Big Beer because of its exposure to emerging markets   As   BUD gets about half its sales in Latin America  while Sabmiller  LONDON SAB  and Heineken NV  OTC HEINY  get a disproportionate amount of their revenues from emerging Africa 

This year  exposure to emerging markets has been a major negative  particularly since the dollar began to aggressively rise late this past summer   But if you believe  as I do  that emerging markets represent the better long term bet  then Big Beer remains one of best long term investments to make on any significant pullbacks

124984,346499,TAP,Week in Review Part II  Street Bytes,opinion,On Friday  the market celebrated the third anniversary of the historic market lows for all three major indices The Dow Jones closed March 9  2009 at 6547  the S P 500 at 676  and Nasdaq at 1268 Friday  the Dow closed at 12922  up 97  since 3 9 09  the S P finished at 1370  up 103   and Nasdaq closed the week at 2988  up 136  since the lows  I myself didn t call a bottom that week three years ago  but amidst the depths of despair that many felt  I did stick to my 2009 forecast that the Dow and S P would both finish up at least 20  and Nasdaq would gain 30   which proved to be a rather good call Alas  this year I have the three down 10  by Dec  31  But I ll have more to say on this when we finish the first quarter For the week  by the way  stocks finished mixed  with the Dow Jones down 0 4   while the S P gained a point  0 1   and Nasdaq tacked on 0 4   its third straight week with the exact same percentage gain U S

If the Fed is going to do anything extraordinary this year  you d think it would do so by Fourth of July because it doesn t want to be seen interfering in the presidential election thereafter Japan s

Bill Beutel  Apple Inc  unveiled the iPad 3  or what is being called  the new iPad   which will be available starting March 16 in the U S  and a few other countries  If you go for the model that offers cellular connectivity  your speeds could be as much as 10 times faster  4G  rather than the 3G found in the iPad 2  Apple is dropping the price of the iPad 2 to  399 in an effort to broaden the market   Apple shares were unchanged on the week at  545  Meanwhile  tech research firm Gartner projects that the launch of Windows 8  coupled with a new wave of ultrabooks  will power PC sales in

actually added 3 800 jobs rather than losing 1 900  Huh  An analysis of department data by a real estate services firm projects the city added another 31 600 in January  the largest one month gain since 1990 Something doesn t quite add up  though  as the city s unemployment rate hit 9 3  in January  up from 9 1  in December And  New York City s Independent Budget Office now says Wall Street bonuses for 2011 fell a whopping 25  to  17 8 billion  nearly double the earlier projected drop the previous week by New York State s comptroller  It s all about the impact on the city s tax coffers

Texas financier R  Allen Stanford was convicted on 13 of 14 counts of fraud  conspiracy and obstruction of justice for his  7 billion Ponzi scheme  The 61 year old will undoubtedly spend the rest of his time behind bars But as the Wall Street Journal observes  the real crime here is that  the vast majority of investor money was sucked into the Stanford operation after SEC examiners began blowing the whistle  And they blew the whistle not once  but four times  1997  1998  2002 and 2004   Each time  they concluded that the Stanford operation was a probable Ponzi scheme and urged SEC action  Each time  the enforcement staff failed to act  The payoff was the guy sitting on the investigation  Spencer Barasch  left the SEC to work for Stanford Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim tops Forbes magazine

5 million in 2011 owing to stock option gains  after he was paid  26 5 million in 2010  so he has been rewarded rather handsomely for Ford s turnaround  perhaps a bit too much so  as UAW President Bob King said Mulally s pay was  morally wrong  According to the Economic Policy Institute  as reported by the Journal s James R  Hagerty   the average inflation adjusted hourly wage for male college graduates aged 23 to 29 dropped 11  over the past decade to  21 68 in 2011  For female college graduates of the same age  the average wage is down 7 6  to  18 80  Yup  kids  You might do better just

history  according to the trade group The number of airline fatalities dropped from 786 in 2010 to 486 in 2011  Africa only had 8 accidents vs  18 in 2010  This is good And this is also good California s unemployment rate in January hit 10 9     In January 2011 it was 12 1   It s a start My portfolio  I haven t said anything about my main China holding recently because the company has gone radio silent until the last week in March  Yes  I m incredibly frustrated  as I know those of you still playing along with me are Carnival Cruise Lines reported a fiscal first quarter loss  Dec

as a broker  David S  Walker  was meeting with a woman accused of running an Upper East Side brothel  supposedly offering advice on how to expand her business  He hasn t been accused of any wrongdoing  but it made for great fun in the tabloids in these parts And last weekend  it was Morgan Stanley investment banker W  Bryan Jennings   a  2 million a year fat cat   who made the news for threatening a cab driver who had taken him from Midtown Manhattan to his home in Darien  Conn    The cabbie asked for the  204 fare and was then allegedly threatened and slashed with a knife by Jennings  who was drunk and refused to pay Oh  there is far more to this story that I m leaving out  some real ugly stuff I just found it rather amusing on balance  not having a lot of sympathy for fat cats these days   The driver needed six stitches and is OK  In the final week of February sweeps  ABC s  Good Morning America  came within 164 000 viewers of NBC s  Today   Ann Curry isn t cutting it  Bring back perky
