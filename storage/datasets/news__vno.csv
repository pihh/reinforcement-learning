What s Next for Vornado 
While Vornado has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Vornado was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

123792,345307,VNO,Best CEF Soared 466   Yields 6 4   Here s How ,opinion,"How the heck do you fund your retirement today  with regular stocks yielding a pathetic 1 8  
Today I m going to show you exactly how and we re going to use my favorite tool   to do it  In fact  we re going to zero in on a particular CEF that s the poster child for how these high yielding funds can deliver the retirement you want on a modest nest egg far less than that million bucks many advisors say you need 
To start  this solid fund pays a steady 6 4  dividend now nearly four times the payout you d get from a  regular  stock  Even better for retirees  it pays you that dividend monthly  in line with your bills 
There s more  too 
CEFs Disprove the Myth That You Can t Beat the Index

I ve also picked out this particular fund the Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  NYSE RQI  because it dispels one of the biggest myths you ll hear in investing  that active managers simply can t beat the market 
But the truth is  CEFs beat their indexes all the time 

RQI  which invests in high yielding real estate investment trusts  REITs   is the perfect example  it s handed its shareholders a massive 466  total return in the past decade  the highest of any CEF  RQI nearly doubled the return on the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   in blue below  and more than doubled the return on the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF  NYSE RWR   in red 
Destroying the Indexes






And no  I m not cherry picking here  When you go beyond stocks  to high yield  and too often ignored  areas like REITs and preferred stocks  you ll find that almost all CEFs beat the corresponding index fund 
That s the first thing I want to get across to you today  if you re holding a REIT index fund like RWR  you are leaving money on the table guaranteed 
How a Little Known Fund Pulled Off a 466  Gain 
But exactly how can top notch CEFs and RQI in particular deliver index beating returns while sustaining monstrous 6 4  income streams  To answer that  we first need to take a deeper dive into the asset class RQI focuses on 
REITs are a kind of tax advantaged corporation that collects capital from investors and then uses that capital to buy  improve and rent out real estate  There are all kinds of REITs  some specialize in strip malls  others in apartments and others in office space 
Their biggest attraction  High yields  Even if you were to simply buy RWR today  you d get a 3 3  yield  far ahead of the S P 500 average 
Those high payouts are the first step in RQI s strong return 
Step 2  Outperformance  over the long term  REITs simply outrun stocks by a lot 
REITs Crush Stocks






If we go back to the beginning of the 2000s  when the index ETFs were first launched  we see that REITs about doubled the S P 500 s performance  even taking into account the implosion in real estate that was the 2007 09 Great Recession  That REITs survived this shock and still crushed stocks is a testament to just how powerful this asset class is 
But this isn t all that s up RQI s sleeve 
Top Notch Management Makes the Difference
As you can tell from its name  RQI is managed by Cohen   Steers  a multi billion dollar asset manager based in New York that s known in financial circles for understanding real estate better than just about everyone else and it shows in the performance of their funds 

It s no surprise that RQI and another Cohen   Steers fund  the REIT   Preferred Income Fund  NYSE RNP   are the best performing CEFs of the last decade  Cohen   Steers s other REIT funds are also top performers  and  yes  all of their funds beat their indexes  which again shows you that managed funds are more than capable of outperforming 
And in the case of RQI  the value of savvy management couldn t be any clearer 
RQI s Top Picks Soar







A quick look at RQI s three biggest holdings warehouse REIT  Prologis   NYSE PLD   in red above  and cell tower owners Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI   in blue  and American Tower  NYSE AMT   in orange shows that these picks have averaged a shocking 29 3  return over the last year  while the REIT index has returned 11 4  over the same period  RQI s net asset value  NAV  or the market value of its overall portfolio  has risen nearly twice as much as the index  thanks to the management team s careful stock selection 
RQI s Portfolio Crushes the REIT Sector






Despite the focus on REITs in both funds  RQI is able to sweep the floor with the index because management knows what REITs to avoid  The index  by definition  cannot  which is why it couldn t avoid poor performing REITs 
Duds Pull the Index Down







Above  you can see three major components of the REIT index  healthcare landlord Ventas  NYSE VTR   office REIT   Vornado Realty  Trust  NYSE VNO  and shopping mall owner  Federal Realty Investment Trust   NYSE FRT   All three have had an awful 12 months  delivering a negative total return  on average  in a period when stocks and REITs are up double digits 
This kind of lackluster performance from the worst REITs out there is hard to uncover before the fact if you aren t spending a lot of time analyzing the hundreds of properties each REIT invests in  This is exactly the kind of careful due diligence that s the backbone of Cohen   Steers  monstrous gains over the long haul  And it s why RQI looks set to keep building on its 466  return over the last decade 
My Top 5 Picks Now  8  Dividends  20  Upside in 2020
The only problem  As I write this  RQI trades at a slight premium to NAV  meaning that investors are paying just a bit more than the portfolio s worth 
That s not a huge problem in and of itself I still see upside for this very well managed fund  especially over the long haul  But there s no doubt that this premium will be a drag on the fund s gains in 2020  So while RQI deserves a place on your watch list  there s no compelling reason to jump in right now 
That s far from the case with 5 other funds I ve uncovered  Unlike RQI  these new picks trade at ridiculously deep  and totally unusual  discounts so much so that I m predicting 20   price upside from each of them in 2020 
That s not all  either 
They also pay far higher dividends I m talking an 8  payout  on average  Drop  500K into this 5 fund  mini portfolio  and you re looking at a smooth  40 000 in yearly dividends  
How s that for a retirement income stream  And on way less than a million bucks  too

shoppremiumoutlets com  these strategic investments are aimed at complementing Simon Property s core real estate by bringing together new experiential businesses to markets across the country The retail REIT also has a solid and improving balance sheet with ample liquidity  This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well Nevertheless  shift in consumers  preferences toward online channels for purchases  bankruptcies and store closures have emerged as pressing concerns for retail REITs and Simon Property is not immune to such choppy environment  In addition  though the

123805,345320,VNO,Property REITs now dirt cheap Green Street,news,"By Ilaina Jonas
 NEW YORK  March 3  Reuters    U S  real estate investment
trusts  publicly traded real estate companies  are dirt cheap
when measured against privately held real estate  bonds or
stocks  Green Street Advisors said in a report 
  I don t think they re table pounding cheap   Green Street
Chairman Mike Kirby said in the report  released to clients on
Monday 
  I think they finally crossed through the threshold where
we re willing to call them cheap  It s amazing what a 50 plus
decline in stock prices will do for valuations  
 But the sector is not exactly a bargain  The companies in
it need to reduce their debt by about as much as they are worth
in the stock market  said Green Street  an independent
research  trading  and consulting firm 
 Since REIT shares peaked in February 2007  the sector is
down 75 percent  as measured by the benchmark MSCI U S  REIT
Index  and 64 percent since last September 
 Industry leaders have all seen their stocks battered  These
include Simon Property Group  Vornado Realty Trust  Taubman
Centers Inc  Macerich Co  Developers Diversified Realty Corp 
Kimco Realty Corp  Equity Residential  Boston Properties Inc 
SL Green Realty Corp  AMB Property Corp and Host Hotels  
Resorts Inc 
 REITs are the cheapest they have been since the 1998 1999
REIT bear market  relative to other investments  Green Street
said in the report 
 Relative to privately held real estate  REITs are trading
at a 45 3 percent discount to the value of property held in
private hands and their cheapest since 1993  the start of the
modern REIT era 
 Green Street estimated that private market values are off
about 30 percent  without factoring in leverage  from the peak 
Kirby said 
 REITs as measured against cooperate bonds are also their
cheapest since 1993  Green Street said 
 When seen against U S  large cap stocks  REITs trade at
about 7 9 times their earnings  as measured by adjusted funds
from operations  compared with 10 6 for the S P 500 
Still  REITs suffer from debt piled on over the past few
years and need to raise about  100 billion of equity to bring
them back to their norms  Kirby said 
  That this figure roughly approximates the existing equity
market capitalization of the REIT industry   105 billion 
highlights the enormity of the task   Kirby wrote in a separate
report 
 A secondary offering of stock to the general market could
dilute the holdings of current shareholders  Rights offerings
could be a less painful way to help fix the problem  Kirby
said  Under a rights offering  companies offer current
shareholders the right to buy more stock at a discounted
price 
  This is a cheap market  but they could stay cheap for two
years   Kirby said   For someone with a long term perspective
would do fine buying REITs at these levels

123807,345322,VNO,Rising REITs back bets on stronger economy,news,By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors puzzled over whether U S  interest rates are rising due to a stronger economy or because of fears about inflation might want to look at the recent gains in REITs for some useful guidance  Real estate investment trusts typically perform poorly in an environment of rising interest rates  as they are used by some investors as a proxy for bonds when fixed income returns pale  Thus  when yields turn higher  REITs are sold among other reasons on expectations of a higher cost for financing real estate acquisitions  and as their dividend yield becomes less competitive against the risk free return of Treasuries  In the period between the bottoming of the 10 year Treasury note yield near 1 3 percent in early July and the U S  election four months later  the vanguard REIT exchange traded fund  P VNQ     a popular way for investors to get exposure to the sector    fell nearly 10 percent  The benchmark S P 500 index gained almost 2 percent during the same time period  But since the Nov  8 election of President elect Donald Trump  and despite a rapid increase in the 10 year yield from about 1 8 percent to near 2 4 percent  the REITs ETF has gained 4 8 percent and the S P added 6 5 percent   REITs are a derivative of credit and the economy so as long as one of those is doing well  REITs will do well   said Alex Goldfarb  the senior REIT analyst at Sandler O Neill Partners in New York   If there s a view that rents will improve  as long as the move in interest rates is not too significant REITs will still perform   Stocks on Wall Street have rallied since Trump s surprise victory as economic indicators have improved and on bets that the incoming administration will lower taxes  slash regulations and introduce a fiscal stimulus in the form of a massive infrastructure plan  Trump s policies are also seen as likely to boost inflation  however  which could force the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster clip this year than previously expected  On Friday U S  Treasury debt yields rallied after data showed a rebound in U S  wages last month  That may put more pressure on the Fed to consider raising interest rates as early as the first quarter  Among the REITs that have performed the worst through the election rally are those specializing in retail  as the sector continues to struggle against online stores  Earlier this week Kohl s  N KSS  and Macy s  N M  reported lower than expected holiday sales and cut their yearly forecasts   Kimco Realty   N KIM  and Kite realty  N KRG   both retail oriented REITs  are negative since Trump s election  The backdrop of rising rates could make it ideal for stock pickers within REITs  said Art Hogan  chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York   Vornado Realty  Trust  N VNO   with office and rental exposure in the high end markets of New York and Washington  has gained more than 20 percent since Nov  8  Said Hogan   To say REITs are going to do poorly in a rising rate environment is true simplistically  but if the economy is improving that s going to be cash flow generating for REITs in the right place  ,2017-01-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rising-reits-back-bets-on-stronger-economy-451699,451699
123808,345323,VNO,Trump economic plans may benefit New York real estate  Vornado,news,"By Herbert Lash NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump s plans to cut financial services regulation  repatriate overseas corporate profits and increase infrastructure spending bode well for New York commercial real estate  a leading owner of city office space said on Tuesday  Business sentiment has risen since Trump s election in November  but it may take time to be seen in financial services employment  traditionally the biggest driver of office jobs in New York City  executives of  Vornado Realty  Trust  N VNO  said  The city is the largest magnet for foreign investment in U S  commercial real estate and regarded as the most solid long term holding in the sector New York City office sector employment grew by 5 000 jobs in 2016 to a record 1 37 million  said Dave Greenbaum  president of the New York division of Vornado  a real estate investment trust   However  the rate is below the blistering pace of 35 000 that were added annually in recent years  he said  speaking during a conference call to discuss the company s results  Jobs growth in Manhattan until last year surpassed the U S  average  Employment in media and tech companies has driven the city s employment so far this decade  while the number of jobs in financial services has barely surpassed the previous peek prior to the financial crisis   While Trump related jobs growth may take time to be seen   there is reason to believe that we may once again see increases in financial services employment here in New York with important implications for the real estate market   Greenbaum said   All of this has been validated by the capital markets  with New York the absolute No  1 market where investors want to put capital   he said  The New York office market posted a healthy 2016 with leasing activity exceeding 35 million square feet  on par with a 10 year average  according to Vornado  Ultimately  it will be the strength of  animal spirits  at play in the market that will drive New York commercial real estate  said Steven Roth  founder and chief execute of Vornado  
 Financial services companies are innovating and growing  there is an enormous amount of liquidity in the world that needs to be invested  and so we believe that New York is at the epicenter of all this activity in many different industries   he said ",2017-02-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-economic-plans-may-benefit-new-york-real-estate:-vornado-459870,459870
123809,345324,VNO,Vornado  VNO  Lags Q2 FFO And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Vornado  VNO  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  0 91 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 94 per share  This compares to FFO of  1 10 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  3 19   A quarter ago  it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of  0 91 per share when it actually produced FFO of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  13 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has not been able to surpass consensus FFO estimates 
Vornado  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  463 10 million for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 36   This compares to year ago revenues of  541 82 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Vornado shares have added about 3 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 7  
What s Next for Vornado 
While Vornado has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Vornado was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  0 94 on  528 02 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 61 on  2 14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  REIT and Equity Trust   Other is currently in the top 32  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vornado-vno-lags-q2-ffo-and-revenue-estimates-200446710,200446710

Buy rankedConocoPhillips  shares are up  21 6  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks U S  Integrated Oil industry  which has increased  4 1  over the same period  In terms of production and proved reserves  ConocoPhillips is the largest oil and gas exploration and production  E P  player in the world 
The Zacks analyst thinks there are significant opportunities for the upstream energy player in the Eagle Ford where it owns about 3 400 undrilled locations  In fact  strong focus on two other prospective resources like Delaware basin and Bakken shale is expected to help ConocoPhillips achieve its target of more than 25  CAGR of production through 2017 to 2019 
The upstream energy player is strongly committed toward returning cash to shareholders as is evident from its  3 billion planned buyback program in 2019  ConocoPhillips is also planning to increase its dividend in 2019 after raising the same by 15  in 2018  On top of that  the balance sheet of ConocoPhillips is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to 
Shares of Dominion Energy have gained  6 2  over the past six months  underperforming the Zacks Electric Power industry  which has increased  10 3  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Dominion Energy is benefiting from its regulated growth projects and synergies from acquisition 
The company s expansion of electric transmission  natural gas facilities and midstream assets are strong positives  The company completed its merger with SCANA and it is likely to be immediately accretive to earnings  However  Dominion Energy s future earnings may get affected due to increase in pension expenses and share dilution 
The company and its gas unit s dependency upon third party producers for natural gas supply increases risk  Any delay in the ongoing capital projects may impact Dominion Energy s profitability 
Buy rankedSchwab s shares have marginally outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past year  declining  21 4  vs  23 1   It has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters

While continuously rising operating expenses and the company s significant dependence on fee based revenues remain major concerns  its efficient capital deployment activities reflect a strong balance sheet position

123866,345381,VNO,Vornado  VNO  Misses Q4 FFO And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Vornado  VNO  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  0 90 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 97 per share  This compares to FFO of  0 98 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  7 22   A quarter ago  it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of  0 99 per share when it actually produced FFO of  0 97  delivering a surprise of  2 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times 
Vornado  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  543 42 million for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 25   This compares to year ago revenues of  536 23 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Vornado shares have added about 12 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8  
What s Next for Vornado 
While Vornado has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions

The Zacks analyst thinks there are significant opportunities for the upstream energy player in the Eagle Ford where it owns about 3 400 undrilled locations  In fact  strong focus on two other prospective resources like Delaware basin and Bakken shale is expected to help ConocoPhillips achieve its target of more than 25  CAGR of production through 2017 to 2019  
The upstream energy player is strongly committed toward returning cash to shareholders as is evident from its  3 billion planned buyback program in 2019  ConocoPhillips is also planning to increase its dividend in 2019 after raising the same by 15  in 2018  On top of that  the balance sheet of ConocoPhillips is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to

The company s expansion of electric transmission  natural gas facilities and midstream assets are strong positives  The company completed its merger with SCANA and it is likely to be immediately accretive to earnings  However  Dominion Energy s future earnings may get affected due to increase in pension expenses and share dilution 
The company and its gas unit s dependency upon third party producers for natural gas supply increases risk  Any delay in the ongoing capital projects may impact Dominion Energy s profitability

While continuously rising operating expenses and the company s significant dependence on fee based revenues remain major concerns  its efficient capital deployment activities reflect a strong balance sheet position

123901,345416,VNO,What s In Store For Vornado  VNO  Stock In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Vornado Realty Trust   NYSE VNO   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 30  after the closing bell  Revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share are expected to decline year over year In the prior quarter  this NY based real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 5 4  in terms of FFO per share  The results reflected growth in occupancy and same store net operating income  NOI  in the New York portfolio Over the trailing four quarters  Vornado surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in one  witnessing an average negative surprise of 0 22   This is depicted in the graph below Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise   Shares of Vornado have underperformed the  in the last three months  While the company s shares have lost 9 6   the industry has witnessed a decline of 7 3  Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderVornado boasts a concentration of high quality assets and a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail  In addition  the company owns 555 California Street in the heart of San Francisco s Financial District as well as the MART in Chicago s River North District  which are iconic assets in signature cities  This focus on having assets in such a few select high rent  high barrier to entry geographic markets  as well as a diversified tenant base that includes several industry bellwethers  are expected to drive steady cash flows and fuel growth engine in the to be reported quarter Vornado has been actively repositioning its portfolio  In line with this  it has been involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures along with business spin offs  Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable  the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be avoided in the near term Moreover  the company announced that the first quarter 2018 financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 37 cents on its total FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions  However  this amount will be excluded from its corresponding adjusted figure Vornado will be recording  34 7 million worth of expenses  relating to the change in fair value of marketable securities as a result of new GAAP accounting standard effective Jan 1  2018   Earlier  the same was recognized through  accumulated other comprehensive income  on the company s consolidated balance sheets and did not impact its consolidated statements of income Moreover  Vornado will be recording  23 5 million of expenses that are linked to its share of possible additional New York City real property transfer taxes The company will also record expenses of  14 5 million  relating to the write off of issuance costs of Series G and Series I  which were redeemed in January 2018 Vornado will also report net loss from other items  amounting to  6 5 million The company stated that the aforementioned figures are preliminary estimates and are conditioned on the completion of the financial closing procedures  Hence  it does not assure any consistency between these estimates and the final results We also anticipate a fall in the company s total revenues in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the first quarter is pegged at  533 million  This reflects a decline of 14 1  as compared with the prior year quarter Further  the company s management and leasing fees are expected to remain flat  sequentially  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 71 million indicates no change from the prior quarter Prior to the first quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share  which is now 88 cents  witnessed a decline of 1 1  over the past month  Also  this indicates a year over year decline of 18 5  In addition  over the past month  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2018 FFO per share  stands at 88 cents decreased 1 1   reflecting analysts  bearish sentiments Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict FFO beat for Vornado this time around  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Vornado is  10 63  Zacks Rank  Vornado has a favorable Zacks Rank  3  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive surprise Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right

	Chicago  IL   August 11  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog  Communications Sales   Leasing  Inc      Care Capital Properties  Inc      Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated     Prologis  Inc       and Vornado Realty Trust  NYSE VNO     

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

REITs to Watch for Q2 Earnings Thursday

	Though the current reporting cycle is drawing to a close  results are still pouring in from the real estate investment trust  REIT  industry  In fact  on Thursday  Aug 11  Communications Sales   Leasing  Inc      Care Capital Properties  Inc     and Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated     are slated to release their quarterly figures 

	Per the  report  for the Finance Sector  of which REITs are part  total Q2 earnings are projected to be down 5 3  on 0 4  lower revenues  This will follow the 6 9  decrease in the sector s earnings in the previous quarter 
	However  the REIT industry has witnessed a mixed earnings season thus far  Though the industry benefited from a sustained low rate environment in the second quarter  the economic environment and individual market dynamics equally played a crucial role in their performances 
	While REITs like Prologis  Inc     reported better than expected numbers  others like Vornado Realty Trust    failed to surpass expectations in the quarter 
	Since  neither do all REITs cater to the same asset class  nor are they equally poised to surpass analyst s expectations  we relied on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive   to predict the chance of a beat this quarter 
	Our proprietary methodology   Earnings ESP   shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  for the stocks 
	Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
	Let s now check how the above mentioned companies are expected to perform  when they report their second quarter results on Aug 11  2016 
	Communications Sales   Leasing is involved in the acquisition and construction of mission critical communications infrastructure and provides wireless infrastructure solutions for the communications industry  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  Though Communications Sales   Leasing enjoys a favorable Zacks rank  its chances of a beat is lowered for a 0 00  ESP 

   

	Care Capital Properties is a healthcare REIT with a diversified portfolio of skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare assets operated by private regional and local care providers  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  Despite a favorable rank  surprise prediction becomes difficult due to its 0 00  ESP 

   

	Community Healthcare Trust is engaged in the acquisition and ownership of properties which are leased to hospitals  doctors  healthcare systems or other healthcare service providers  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  4  Surprise prediction here too becomes inconclusive  with the company not having the right combination of ESP and rank

many malls and office complexes  Due to the inability to obtain mortgages to buy a home one area of growth remains in multi family housing Rising on the back of multi family housing many REITs performed quite well in the first quarter of 2012  Retail investors and financial advisors are quite yield driven in their hunt for assets in the income oriented category  REITs offer good yields and

extremely well but some are suggesting owning versus renting is now becoming the more attractive alternative  It remains to be seen if this bears out over time  Remember many REIT structures allow for return of principal which may have negative tax consequences to unaware investors New ETFs from highly regarded and substantial new providers are also being issued  These may include Charles Schwab s ETFs and Scottrade s Focus Shares which both are issuing new ETFs with low expense ratios and commission free trading at their respective firms  These may also become popular as they become seasoned  As stated with other sectors  remember ETF sponsors must issue and their interests aren t aligned with yours  They have a business interest and wish to have a competitive presence in any popular
