197646,419162,ORCL,Cisco Earnings Preview  Buybacks Support EPS As Business Model Transitions,opinion,"When Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  nearly hit  60 per share in July  2019  the 19  EPS growth generated in fiscal 2019 by the networking giant was mostly buyback supported  Between October  18 and August 1  2019   or the end of Cisco s 2019 fiscal year   nearly  21 billion of Cisco s cash balance was spent repurchasing shares or for those who like to do the quick math  a per quarter average of  5 0 to  5 2 bl in common stock was repurchased 
Since August  19  or after one quarter of fiscal 2020  just  780 million of shares were repurchased 
It s not necessarily a negative  but Cisco  is one of the classic 1990s  growth babies  that is  caught in the middle   to use a Michael Porter  Competitive Strategy term  as management is transforming the Cisco model from a data networking and communications model to a Security  Applications and subscription model that moves away from routing and switching  to the extent it can  
It s not an easy job and Chuck Robbins is doing a decent job to reshape the company for the next 20 years 
When Cisco  reports after the closing bell on Wednesday  February 12  2020  Street consensus is looking for  0 76 in EPS on  11 76 billion in revenue for expected year over year growth in EPS of  4  on a 4  decline in revenue  Fiscal 2020 consensus is expecting just 1  revenue growth and 5  EPS growth  a far cry from last year s 18  EPS growth on 5  revenue growth 
Last quarter  fiscal Q1  20  Cisco s revenue guide for this Q2  20 was worse than expected  which sent the stock down 7  post earnings  but that is now in the stock price and expectations are subdued for the networking giant 
Really  fiscal 2020 is a transition year as some of the  macro  from slowing trade and emerging market service provider weakness has reigned in expectations 
How do EPS and revenue estimate revisions look  

Source  IBES by Refinitiv

Data source  IBES by Refinitiv
Readers can see that EPS and revenue estimates for this fiscal year and beyond pretty much track or correlate with the progress on U S    China trade and tariff issues  not to mention friction over Huawei  so as Cisco  puts distance between that macro situation and it s business model  the stock should reflect that 
Although it s  not shown  if readers did the math  the  average  annual revenue growth expected by the Street for Cisco  from 2020 through 2022 is 2  and expected EPS growth is 5  
What s the worry  
Unlike MSFT  Oracle  IBM  Apple  long all to some degree  and others from the late 1990s  transforming a business model on the fly is a tough task  I felt like former CEO John Chambers in a lot of ways stayed mired in the past to a large degree  thus the task facing Chuck Robbins is even more urgent and pressing  Apple did it in a remarkable fashion  transforming a tech hardware model into a higher margin services model on the fly without missing a beat in terms of growth 
Cisco s got a far tougher transition ahead of it 
Before the share repurchase  bulge  in fiscal  19  Cisco  was generating about  2 5 bl in free cash flow per quarter  Since tax reform was passed in December  17  Cisco s cash balance has fallen from  74 billion in January  18 to  23 billion as of November  19 
The Kid is spending a lot of cash to keep investors interested in the stock 







Valuation Metrics

Fwd  div  yield  2 8 

Cisco  has found a bid in the low  40s twice in late 2018 and then again November  2019  which is probably close to a 3  dividend yield We don t yet know what the new Cisco dividend will be for 2020  but it will be interesting to see how the board responds  The last four dividend increases  per quarter  have been  0 05 a quarter  calendar 2016    0 03 a quarter  calendar 2017    0 04 a quarter  calendar 2018  and  0 02 a quarter  calendar  19  If the pattern holds   0 03 a quarter or  0 12 a year would be calendar 2020 s dividend followed by a  0 01 in calendar 2021  But that s a guess  
Summary Conclusion
Cisco  hit an all time high of  82 per share in March of 2000 and has never looked back  The next highest print was  35 and change in December  07  which wasn t really broken above until 10 years later  December  17   So the last two years have really seen Cisco work to retake the all time high although 1  revenue growth wont get you there in a hurry 
The issue remains that  infrastructure platforms  is still 57  of Cisco s revenue and is growing just low single digits at that  Applications and security is 17  of Cisco s revenue  up from just 15  two years ago and while it s growing at a faster rate than the old switching and routing business  it s not fast enough to really move the needle for Cisco   yet  
Investors need a quarter or two were applications  11   and security  6   really see robust growth that the Street thinks is sustainable 







Clients currently hold a 1 6  position in Cisco  and as a portfolio manager for individuals  The Kid is the perfect stock for a client accounts  The above chart shows Cisco vs  the S P 500 since 1 1 2010 or the last decade  it s under performance isn t too onerous  certainly nowhere near as bad as IBM s   you get a decent dividend and investors can be patient with Cisco 
Cisco s     10  after Wednesday night s call won t matter much  The stock is a long term hold and what I m really interested in is whether security and applications can start to boost growth at a faster clip and reduce company s dependence on switching and routing ",2020-02-11,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cisco-earnings-preview-buybacks-support-eps-as-business-model-transitions-200506549,200506549

197667,419183,ORCL,Avoiding The 3 Pitfalls Of  Buy   Hold  Investing,opinion,Stocks have done exceptionally well lately  with 2019 on track to be the best performing market since 2013  But many investors remain wary of the stock market  anxious with late cycle worries and ever fearful of a replay of the 2008 crash  This shows up in strong money flows into cash funds  which remain significantly above the year earlier level despite the market s impressive gains this year Many investors seem to be questioning their long held beliefs  including the virtues of  buy   hold  investing  On top of this are claims from purveyors of market timing who never tire of reminding us that this investment strategy was no longer relevant to the current uncertain environment It is important to remember that long term investing  particularly a  buy   hold  approach  remains as relevant today as it has ever been  And notwithstanding naysayers  claims to the contrary  empirical evidence continues to show the long term superiority of a  buy   hold  strategy over any other investing approach But to adequately benefit from this tested and proven strategy  investors need to guard against three major pitfalls  Here they are 1   Buy   Hold  Doesn t Mean  Buy   Forget Staying engaged with your portfolio is a must  Investing for the long run doesn t mean that you lose sight of developments in your portfolio  The  buy   forget  mantra is a simplified take on the typically long holding horizons of investment icons such as Warren Buffett Buffett may be in the habit of keeping his investments for the long term  but he stays fully tuned into what s happening in each of his holdings  While the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha is no doubt one of the most successful and famous exponents of the  buy   hold  investing approach  he is by no means the only one  All of the successful practitioners of this approach stay well informed of what is going on with each of their holdings More                                                                                                            Get a jump on 2020 profits with our most powerful long term recommendations handpicked for outperformance  Director of Research Sheraz Mian applies 5 factors to build the portfolio which is how it has beaten the market since inception in January 2012 with an impressive return of  303 3  versus the S P 500 s  160 5  through November 2019  Be among the first to see the new stocks when they re released on January 2                                                                                                        2  Don t Fall for the  Buy What You Know  Mantra Guard against the simplistic beauty of the  buy what you know  mantra  another one of those skin deep lessons learned from Warren Buffett s investment style Adherents of this  philosophy  load up on stocks from a bunch of companies whose products they use  And then they keep those stocks forever  a la Buffett who has famously hung onto his investment holdings for years Being familiar with a company s product s  is a useful  but not necessary  starting point to  knowing  the stock as an investment opportunity  The decision to buy the company s stock should follow a thorough  due diligence process that gives you a solid appreciation of the company s prospects  competitive position and the proper value of its stock In fact  studies show that people have a crippling blind spot when it comes to stocks that they think they know  Too often they will overlook the negatives of the firm because they have fallen in love with the stock  Love is nice in your personal life  but there is no place for passion and emotions while evaluating stocks 3  Stick with a Plan Avoid haphazardly or randomly filling your portfolio with stocks you like  Always build your portfolio around an investment outlook and stay ready to make adjustments should that outlook change I am not suggesting that you need to have an elaborate and explicit outlook for GDP growth in the next quarter or year  but you absolutely need to have a base case sense for the economy and the market If you expect a major economic downturn in the coming 12   18 months  your choice of investments would be very different from someone looking forward to a goldilocks type scenario And you must stay nimble and flexible enough to adjust your positions should your outlook change Putting It All Together  Please keep each of these pitfalls in mind while putting together your stock portfolio to increase your odds of success  Note that we here at Zacks have been successfully managing an annual  buy   hold  portfolio for many years  We call it Zacks Top 10 Stocks  a portfolio featuring 10 stocks that I personally select and then actively monitor on your behalf  We are about to come out with  We construct this portfolio by first taking a look at the economic and earnings outlook  Then we narrow in on the industries that we believe will outperform and stay away from the others  From there  we use our proprietary stock rating system to help select the best stocks in those favorable groups  In 2019  we had gains as high as  97 7  and matched the market s impressive performance through the end of November  The portfolio returned  13 95  in 2018 when the market as a whole was down The New Year brings a host of challenges and opportunities for the investing public  But rest assured that the stocks we have picked for 2020 fully take into account what lies ahead You re invited to be among the first investors to see Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020 when the portfolio is released on Thursday  January 2  But please note  the best way to tap into this long term investing opportunity is to get in on the ground floor  These

197706,419222,ORCL,Grand Slams will be up for grabs as big three wane  says Courier,news,"By Rory Carroll
NEW YORK  Reuters    The Grand Slam dominance by a handful of elite men over the last decade and a half has come at the expense of the rest of the field  but the sport will see a return to  normal  when the era ends  American great Jim Courier said 
Roger Federer  Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic have won the last 11 Grand Slams between them and an incredible 54 since 2003 
The smart money is on that number rising further after the 33 year old Spaniard Nadal reached the U S  Open semi finals in New York on Wednesday 
Former world number one Courier won four majors between 1991 and 1993 but none of his male compatriots has lifted a slam trophy since the now retired Andy Roddick won the U S Open in 2003 
Yet Father Time defeats all and when the game s current greats hang up their rackets it will open the door for a wider number of competitors  making tournaments harder to predict  Courier said 
 Sure  it has been difficult for American men to win majors but it has been difficult for anyone outside of the top four or five players to win in the last 15 years   Courier told Reuters at the U S  Open 
 It has been more of a question of era in many ways as opposed to a singular American problem   he said 
 I think there is going to be a lot of open road for our players in the next five years or so when these incredible legends eventually leave the game  
Courier said he expects the sport to change in the not too distant future 
 I think we ll get a little more of a return to normalcy where players are going to win six or seven majors but not 16  17  18  19  20    where they are just hoarding all of them  
Courier said that American tennis fans had still been spoiled by 23 times Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams  NYSE WMB   her seven times slam champion sister Venus and 2017 U S  Open winner Sloane Stephens 
Yet he is also doing all he can to help more Americans achieve Grand Slam glory 
Technology company Oracle  NYSE ORCL  announced on Wednesday that it was partnering with Courier s InsideOut Sports   Entertainment to launch a new lower tier tennis circuit of men s and women s tournaments in the U S 
The circuit is designed to cut down travel costs and provide more opportunities for burgeoning American players to reach the next level 
 This is a big day for American tennis   he said of the ATP and WTA Tour events that will begin stateside next month 
 It levels the playing field for our players here to their European counterparts  who can stay near or at home and play tournaments around the clock as they try to get to the next level  ",2019-09-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/grand-slams-will-be-up-for-grabs-as-big-three-wane-says-courier-1971516,1971516

197752,419268,ORCL,Insurance ETF Poised For An Elliott Wave Correction,opinion,"The SPDR Insurance ETF  KIE  reached a new all time high in September  helped by a solid job market  increasing wages and rising consumer confidence  The price is up 630  since the Financial Crisis low at  4 77 in March 2009  The question is  can investors trust the uptrend to continue 
Regardless of what pundits say  we don t believe the market cycle has been tamed for good  The Fed will not be able to prolong the expansion forever  When the next recession begins  the above mentioned fundamental factors which have been fueling the insurance sector for the past decade are going to take a turn for the worse 
Insurance Investors Need a Healthy Economy 
With numerous recession red flags already in place  there is probably not much left of the Insurance ETF s bull market  Let s see if the Elliott Wave principle can help us confirm this assumption on the chart below 




The weekly chart reveals that the entire uptrend since 2009 looks like a complete five wave impulse  The pattern is labeled  1   2   3   4   5   where the sub waves of wave  3  are also visible  The guideline of alternation has been taken into account  too  Wave  2  is an expanding flat correction  while wave  4  is a sharp zigzag 
According to the theory  a three wave correction in the opposite direction follows every impulse  If this count is correct  a  30  decline to the support of wave  4  can soon be expected  The RSI indicator backs the negative outlook with a bearish divergence between waves  3  and  5

197777,419293,ORCL,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   It s clear that tomorrow is all about the Fed  with expectations that the FOMC won t blink under pressure from President Donald Trump just yet  but will send all the right signals that a cut is coming 
One thing that may warrant more discussion is just how much it could cut  A standard quarter point cut is still the prediction but there is a case to made that the FOMC could cut by 50 basis points when it does move 
The is now a 17 9  chance that rates will be a half point lower after the July meeting  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor  A larger than usual easing could give the Fed breathing room for a few more meetings  or the whole year  and also keep Trump tweets to a minimum 
Here s the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  It s Fed Day 
The Federal Reserve will wrap up its two day meeting on Wednesday  with many expecting the central bank to stand pat on rates  but tee up a rate cut for as soon as July  About 80  of traders expect the Fed to keep interest rates on hold in the 2 25  to 2 50  range on Wednesday  More than 85  expect a rate cut in July 
Calls for a rate cut have grown louder as the Fed s 2  inflation goal has proved elusive  As well as stuttering inflation  escalating U S China trade tensions  which have kept global growth on the backfoot  have also bolstered the chorus for a cut 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell s presser will also be parsed for clues about the central bank s future monetary policy intentions 
Powell and his colleagues have made it clear that they will cut rates preemptively   ahead of a recession   to shore up confidence and offset some of the headwinds tied to an increase in tariffs  said Diane Swonk  chief economist at Grant Thornton 
2  Crude Oil to Stage Another Surprise Build 
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  petroleum report is due Wednesday  with analysts keen to see whether domestic crude stockpiles will stage an unexpected build for the third straight week 
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 1 08 million barrels for the week ended June 14 
Crude oil futures rose 3 8  to settle at  52 90 a barrel after President Donald Trump said he and China s President Xi Jinping will have  an extended meeting  at next week s G 20 summit 
Signs of easing U S  China trade tensions  would be positive of course for global growth and then commodities demand and oil demand in particular   Julius Baer said 
Ahead of the EIA report  the American Petroleum Institute released data  which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels  which showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 0 812 million barrels last week

197800,419316,ORCL,HubSpot  HUBS  Lining Up As A Buy,opinion,"One of my favorite enterprise cloud stocks is lining up as a buy  HubSpot  HUBS  is trading at its lowest levels since the end of January and there has been nothing but good news surrounding this company  Full year EPS guidance and estimates have been risen as the firm demonstrates strong top and bottom line beats in its Q2 earnings release back in early August 
Analyst Day
The 23 4  breakdown in price seemed to originate from HubSpot s Analyst Day on September 4th  Investors came away concerned about price increases that would sizably impact its larger customers 
Hubspot unveiled its new cost structures during Analyst Day  which illustrated tiers of price increases for its Marketing Hub  The smallest customers would experience no change while its largest customers would see as much as a 668  subscription rate increase  The Sales Hub is going to see a 25  increase across the board  These rate changes are going to take effect on November 1st  which will impact Q4 earnings 
The Marketing Hub is the company s bread   butter and investors are concerned that this price hike is going to hurt the company s growth outlook  I don t see these hikes negatively impacting the topline as much as investors are pricing in and neither do most of my sell side cohorts  I believe that this dip has created a buying opportunity for those of us that missed out on HUBS 2019 gains  and those that want to double down on this compelling company 
Reason to Buy
HubSpot has been building out its product offering and improving functionality in its Marketing and Sales Hubs  as well as its continuing to expand the relatively new Service Hub  which was launched back in 2017  Today almost 40  of HubSpot s 65 000 customers use at least 2 of its 3 Hubs  Below is a chart taken from the illustrating the multi Hub growth 

Customers are becoming intertwined into the company s Hubs and integrating into the platform s compelling product offering  The rate escalation shouldn t impact HubSpot s growth and customer retention levels due to the necessity of the company s unique services  The price increase is in line with the company s growth trajectory 
Sell side analysts remain optimistic about the future of this company with the average target share price being just north of  200  HUBS was trading around the  200 level before Analysts Day  circled in red   but has since traded down to the  150 level  creating the buying opportunity that we are seeing today 

The Business
HubSpot provides cloud based marketing  sales  and service management software along with free CRM  The company has positioned their platform to cater to growing small and mid sized businesses  SMBs   This niche has made HUBS a leader in the SMB enterprise cloud space 
The firm s top competitors are Salesforce  CRM  and Oracle  ORCL   HUBS focus on smaller growth companies has given it the upper hand in the SMB market  which isn t even scratching the surface of full penetration  Its dynamic pricing makes it affordable for businesses of any size 
Over 300 third party apps are available in its App Marketplace  with over 700 000 cumulative integrations  This ability to integrate such a wide variety of applications further increases the attractiveness of the firm s product offering 
Take Away
HubSpot is the market leader in its category and continues to impress customers and analysts alike  The company s Analyst Day in early September excited analysts  but made investors anxious about its ability to successfully push higher prices on customers 
HubSpot is a company of the future and its dip to  150 has created a great buying opportunity  I put a small position on this morning and am planning on adding to it incrementally if the share price continues to fall

DeepMichaels has an impressive surprise history  which continued in second quarter fiscal 2019  This marked the company s fifth earnings beat in the trailing six quarters  with a positive sales surprise in three of the last four quarters  The bottom line also improved year over year in the fiscal second quarter  backed by efficient expense management and higher margins  Although sales fell year over year due to the impacts of the Pat Catan s store closures in fiscal 2018  the metric gained from comparable store sales  comps  growth and sales from the operation of 11 net additional flagship stores in the quarter Notably  the company returned to positive comps in the quarter under review  benefiting from strategic efforts and rise in average ticket  partly offset by a decline in customer transactions  Moreover  Michaels delivered strong e commerce sales fueled by higher traffic and conversion rates  After five straight quarters of gross margin decline and six consecutive quarters of operating margin contraction  the company witnessed margin improvement  The upside was driven by pricing and sourcing efforts coupled with occupancy expense leverage despite adverse impacts of tariffs on goods sourced from China  and rise in promotional activity and change in sales mix In fiscal 2019  gross margin is likely to gain from ongoing sourcing initiatives and improved promotions management  Further  the company expects SG A expense to leverage due to the absence of restructuring charges and investment spending of  16 million incurred last fiscal  Also  higher cost savings realized in the previous quarter will aid margins  As a result  adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 are now envisioned to be  2 31  2 42  up from  2 29  2 41 anticipated earlier

boost the top line  Michaels focuses on integrating the e commerce and in store operations  The company is steadily gaining from capabilities like  Buy Online Pick Up in Store   BOPIS   which is a cost effective way of fulfilling online orders as it eliminates shipping costs  In the fiscal second quarter  BOPIS contributed nearly 44  to online sales and was about two thirds of online orders Moreover  the company exited third party fulfillment providers for online orders  As a result  all orders from Michaels com are now fulfilled by its stores or own distribution centers Apart from store expansion and remodeling efforts  the company remains focused on expanding assortments in key growth driving areas besides de emphasizing on slower moving categories  As part of its first category expansion in all stores  Michaels doubled the space for assortments of tools and technology with recognized brands such as Cricut  Caesar and Oracle  NYSE ORCL   Further  the company remains on track to expand assortments in craft storage  jewelry and art categories  Meanwhile  it expects to downsize categories like bakeware  ready made frames and more traditional paper crafting supplies However  the company is not immune to tariff related woes as it is likely to witness an uncertain tariff environment  Moreover  management expects to incur applicable direct import product costs of  400  500 million  when the List 4 China tariffs are fully implemented  Also  it projects lower sales in the back half of the fiscal year  and the metric is likely to come in the range of  5 16  5 19 billion

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from ORCL as it approaches its next earnings report date  In that report  analysts expect ORCL to post earnings of  0 81 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 14 08   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  9 29 billion  up 0 96  from the prior year quarter

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for ORCL  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

197896,419412,ORCL,Will Oracle  ORCL  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Oracle  ORCL   which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Software industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This software maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 99  
For the most recent quarter  Oracle was expected to post earnings of  1 07 per share  but it reported  1 16 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 41   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 84 per share  while it actually produced  0 87 per share  a surprise of 3 57  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Oracle lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Oracle has an Earnings ESP of  0 10  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-09-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-oracle-orcl-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200460815,200460815

Whenever an ADX reading is below 25  it s better to use Oscillators as a guide on the likely price action to come  We need to watch closely the OB  Over Bought  signal triggered by the RSI and or Stochastics indicator  Price will likely make a correction or head south whenever RSI and or the Stochastics indicator hit the OB level  and lean under this OB level  From the weekly chart of ORCL  we can also observe MACD just started to cross over downward with its histogram moving below the zero line  which further indicates the price action making a corrective move  It should be noted that MACD is a lagging indicator and the signal given is usually not as fast as the RSI or the Stochastic 
The current price action as of the end of this week would potentially lead to a bounce  as it just touched the Fibo 38 2  level at  53 63  This is may be supported by the recent recovery of the Dow and the S P 500  Using the Ichimoku cloud analysis  the overall price action of ORCL may suggest the corrective move  as the price still sits above the cloud and the future cloud still being bullish  
As a sample trading strategy  buy above  54 75  the high of the candle on Aug 8  with a stop just below  52 97  the low of the candle on Aug 7  risking  1 78  Place a long target with at least reward risk ratio of 2 1 at  58 31 ",2019-08-09,Mukhriz Mangsor,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-oracles-south-move-a-sign-of-correction-200453688,200453688

Consensus Estimate by a cent  The figure surged 19  from the year ago quarter Net sales of  2 15 billion increased 2 2  year over year  This was driven by the company s solid momentum across all end markets  However  sales growth was below management s guided range of 3 6  However  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 18 billion  Sales was impacted by lower growth than expected in the United States  which did offset the company s strong growth in Canada  and solid momentum across utility and datacom fields during the reported quarter The company s organic sales in the reported quarter improved 1 9  from the prior year quarter  Favorable pricing and robust growth in Canada in the second quarter remained positive The company has lowered guidance for sales growth for the full year as it expects end market softness to prevail in the second half of the year  which would result in slowdown in sales growth across the markets We note that shares of the company have

this market accounted for 33  of total sales  The company s growing momentum across construction contractors and customers drove the top line in this market  Additionally  strong backlog and project activity levels remained positive for the company However  U S  sales were down 1  year over year in the second quarter  This can be attributed to weak momentum across industrial oriented contractors  which offset sales growth to commercial construction contractors in the United States Utility Market  Sales from this market contributed 16  to WESCO sales  The company experienced year over year sales growth of 3 3  in this market  This was driven by 6  growth in U S  in local currency  Growing traction among investor owned utility  public power and utility customers remained positive throughout the reported quarter  Further  growing construction market and rising demand for renewable energy continued to be tailwinds However  the company witnessed a decline of 28  in sales during the reported quarter owing to non renewal of a contract CIG Market  The company witnessed year over year improvement of 1 4  in organic sales in this market  driven by strong performance in Canada and the United States where sales grew 10  and 1   respectively  This was attributed to its robust supply chain solutions  which aided performance in data center and cloud technology projects  Further

197925,419441,ORCL,ORCL Or PEGA  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Computer   Software sector have probably already heard of Oracle  ORCL  and Pegasystems  PEGA   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Oracle is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Pegasystems has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ORCL is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ORCL currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 67  while PEGA has a forward P E of 691  We also note that ORCL has a PEG ratio of 1 39  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  PEGA currently has a PEG ratio of 86 38 
Another notable valuation metric for ORCL is its P B ratio of 7 96  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PEGA has a P B of 9 27 
Based on these metrics and many more  ORCL holds a Value grade of B  while PEGA has a Value grade of F 
ORCL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ORCL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-08-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/orcl-or-pega-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200452945,200452945

197954,419470,ORCL,Oracle  ORCL  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Oracle  ORCL   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Oracle currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if ORCL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this software maker holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ORCL  shares are up 1 51  over the past week while the Zacks Computer   Software industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 12 98  compares favorably with the industry s 2 4  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Oracle have increased 9 06  over the past quarter  and have gained 31 62  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 4 79  and 12 47   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ORCL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ORCL is currently averaging 20 742 732 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ORCL 
Over the past two months  11 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ORCL s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 79 to  3 91 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ORCL is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Oracle on your short list ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oracle-orcl-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200437041,200437041

The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan both left rates unchanged on Thursday with Japan indicating its key policy rate could stay at its current level until spring 2020  Expectations for lower rates remained the biggest driver in the equity and bond markets  The 10 yr note yield and the 2 yr note yield declined three basis points each to 1 72  and 2 00   respectively  The lower yields put some pressure on the U S  dollar  96 65   0 47   0 5   and continued to favor risk assets  Leading equities higher were the energy stocks  as oil prices   57 12 bbl    3 13   5 8   climbed amid the weaker dollar and escalated tensions in the Middle East  Iran shot down a U S  military drone  which President Trump said was a  very big mistake   Geopolitical tensions briefly unnerved the market before the influence of the Fed pushed stocks higher during the afternoon The S P 500 energy sector led all sectors higher with a gain of 2 2   The other ten sectors finished with gains between 0 4   health care  and 1 6   industrials   The turnaround in the S P 500 financials sector   0 5    which was down as much as 0 6  during the day  contributed to the strong finish in the broader market  In corporate news  Slack Technologies  NYSE WORK   WORK 38 62   12 62   48 5   made its public debut  opening at  38 50 per share after the NYSE set its reference price at  26 per share  Oracle  NYSE ORCL   56 99   4 31   8 2   pleased investors with solid earnings results  while Carnival  NYSE CCL   48 80   4 04   7 7   disappointed investors with weak full year guidance  Separately  gold futures also made a big move  settling 3 4  higher at  1393 95 oz on expectations that interest rates will continue to decline

Discounted PEG Stocks that Value Investors Love
Going by the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha s success story  value investment is one of the most tempting strategies to bet on even amid uncertain market conditions  Per data provided by a Forbes article  shares of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   owned by Warren Buffett  increased 20  in 2016  boosting the Oracle of Omaha s personal fortune by  12 3 billion  more than any other billionaire in the U S   to  74 2 billion 
While searching for a suitable value investment option  investors are unlikely to consider price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio among a number of other popular value metrics like price earnings  P E   price sales  P S  or price book value  P B   This is because they often find this ratio complicated  considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock 
However  at a time when volatility strikes every second day  it is pointless to ponder on methods  which do not consider a stock s future growth rate while calculating its intrinsic merit  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B are most commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount 
However  these ratios  while not taking into account the future growth potential of a stock  may end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show  This may often lead to  value traps    a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once drove the share price down  turn out to be persistent 
In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  And here comes the importance of this not so popular but crucial value investing metric  the PEG ratio 
The PEG ratio is defined as  Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth Rate
A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors 
While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock 
There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term 
Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration

What s Next for Oracle

198002,419518,ORCL,Oracle  ORCL  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Oracle  ORCL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 1  
Revenues are expected to be  10 96 billion  down 2 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oracle 
For Oracle  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oracle will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oracle would post earnings of  0 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 87  delivering a surprise of  3 57  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oracle doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oracle-orcl-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200430903,200430903

He also offered three reasons why digital currencies provide significant value to the financial markets  According to him  digital assets provide intrinsic value in that they allow investors and users to obtain a share of a large distributed ledger technology  DLT  platform with exceptional computing power worldwide 
Cryptocurrencies also bring exchange value to the table given the proven track record of the space to grow and their expanding adoption in a wide range of transactions  both in exchange for fiat money and for goods or services 
Thirdly  certain cryptocurrencies could provide the foundation for a digital monetary system boasting greater stability and improved resistance to government manipulation 
Buffett  Charlie Munger rip into cryptos
During Berkshire Hathaway s 2018 stockholders meeting  Buffett was joined by Charlie Munger and the duo  with their criticisms on digital currencies  Buffett compared cryptocurrencies to collecting stamps  where value is determined at the individual level 
 The check is a wonderful idea  but it does not make the check intrinsically valuable   he stated  adding he does not see any real commercial use of cryptocurrencies as an exchange of value 
Buffett also prophesied a grim future for the cryptocurrency space 

 Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad ending because nothing is being produced in the way of value from an asset  There is also a problem that it draws in a lot of charlatans who are trying to create exchanges or whatever it may be  It is something where people of less than stellar character see an opportunity to clip people who are trying to get rich because their neighbors are getting rich buying this stuff that neither of them understands  It will come to a bad end

198037,419553,ORCL, EXCLUSIVE  Q A with Ross Zhang  GM of Huobi Canada ,news," 
Huobi is a multilingual international cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform  It is headquartered in Singapore with global offices in Hong Kong  Japan  United States  and Korea  At EDCON 2018  Huobi officially announced the launch of its first Canadian office  located in Toronto  with Ross Zhang at the helm in the role of General Manager  Ross has an extensive background in IT and Finance as he previously worked at Oracle  NYSE ORCL   CIBC  OTPP  and CPP all in the Toronto area   
CV  Hi  I m here at EDCON 2018 with Ross  GM of Huobi Canada  Ross  how are you doing today 
Ross Zhang  Good  Hello everyone  This is Ross Zhang  General Manager of Huobi  Canada 
CV  Okay  so Ross  why don t you tell us a bit about your background  how you got involved with Huobi  and how you ended up in the role of GM 
Ross Zhang  Yeah  so I started my career as a developer  as many of the developers here at EDCON  have   Then after I got my Master s Degree in Computer Science  I worked for different companies in the financial industry  from development to business and from sell side to buy side  So that gave me tons of exposure  not only on the technology side but also on the financial business side  I saw tons of innovation in the financial industry and in the technology area as well  for example how financial engineering enables the capital  to  flow to capital markets and how technology improves the efficiency for those applications 
However  none of them look ed  disruptive to me  Then I look at the blockchain and I think  this is it  I think this is the disruptive force not only for the financial industry but for other industries as well  Actually  I d already seen some applications in other industries so that s why I decided to join Huobi and to promote their Canadian business and of course I have worked in Toronto for almost ten years and I have strong feelings about Canada 
I think  the Huobi Group is a fantastic company to work for  It s not only the exchange  but  Huobi is  also expanding globally and expanding to different areas of business  That s why I think this is perfect timing in terms of the industry  the company  and the geolocation  that s why I decided to join Huobi 
CV  So why don t you tell me a bit about what Huobi has planned for the rest of 2018 and what sort of challenges are you facing 
Ross Zhang  Right  So this industry is changing every day  We have lots of revisions in our plans but our strategic goal is the same  We are doing the global expansion right now and the Canadian market is a serious business that we want to put long term investment in  So for the rest of the year  we will work with top law firms  accounting firms  and also the regulators to make it compliant for the Huobi business in Canada 
CV  That s good  so what s one of the major challenges you are facing with the expansion 
Ross Zhang  Well  it s almost the same as other international companies  right  You have the group and you have many teams around the globe  like in Singapore  Hong Kong  South Korea  Japan   the United  States  and of course Canada  so that s a challenge  To run an international business where you have people standing on different perspectives  that s one of the challenges I deal with and I spend a lot of effort on communicating with the headquarters  communicating with them on how the Canadian market looks and the strengths for the Canadian market  like the strong community  and  strong ecosystem  It is not only a financial hub but also the tech hub as well  So the communication is definitely a challenge 
Another challenge is definitely how Huobi perceives this business  It s a sustainable business  That s why we want to work with regulators  lawyers  and accounting firms to be compliant  not like other companies or like other exchanges that you may know  where  they kind of go the other direction  What we think is it s a sustainable business and it s a very exciting industry that needs the regulations  I m from the investment background  I know how regulations play a role in the investment or financial industry and I have some deep background with the institutional investors as well  I know their concern is the regulation  That is why we want to build a stronger and more robust ecosystem  not only in Canada but around the globe  That s why we think regulation is very important 
CV  Since you feel regulation is important  do you see Huobi ever doing fiat to crypto exchanges instead of just crypto to crypto 
Ross Zhang  That s definitely in our plan but that requires a lot of effort so I don t have a set timeline for it  but it s definitely in our roadmap 
CV  So one thing I wanted to ask you was with the influx of decentralized exchanges now  Omise is working on a DEX project  Kyber Network just came out with a DEX  how do you think that centralized exchanges like Huobi will be able to compete with decentralized exchanges 
Ross Zhang  I think decentralized is a relative term  so I think at a certain point it needs to     well it probably  will  have a center that I may not be aware of  I mean decentralized right now is still in the initial phase so I cannot tell how it goes and how it will compete with the existing exchange but that s something  to think about   We re actually looking at different technologies or products or industries  I think we may consider putting a prototype or something for a decentralized exchange but I don t have specific details  so when it comes down to how DEX will compete with a centralized exchange  I think both of the business models have pros and cons  for example the central exchange it has the pros that it s more regulation friendly and it s more risk friendly   the risk control and risk governance is easier to do on the central exchange but for a decentralized one  I don t know the details so I cannot comment on that 
CV  What s one piece of advice that you would give to  whether it would be a trader  a developer  a coder  somebody who s trying to get involved in this space  Just based on your own past successes and failures  what s one piece of advice that you would give them before they start exploring 
Ross Zhang  Okay  I think one  piece of  advice is like don t be evil   don t be speculative  it depends on who you talk to  right  For developers  you can probably start with something like a small contract prototype  just  to  get a sense of what it looks like  And for traders  they want to do the trade  but don t put like too much in the first trade  don t leverage too much  I think this market needs more long term investment and probably you can put a small amount of money by just go to Huobi and do some trades and see how it goes  and then you can decide whether you want to put more money in it or  if  you want to know more about the underlying blockchain technologies before you make any investment decisions  That s my personal experience 
CV  I mean it s obvious that a lot of the people in this space all have their own crypto portfolios  so what s a few of the top holdings in your own portfolio or a few projects that you are really high on 
Ross Zhang  Right  Personally  my portfolio  I cannot tell you the exact asset allocation but I do have allocations in Bitcoin and also Ethereum  Of course a small portion of my asset allocation will be in some other tokens but for the details I cannot  tell you      I don t think that s relevant to the public  so I ll pass on that 
CV  I want to thank you for taking the time to talk to Cryptovest and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day at EDCON 
Ross Zhang  Thank you for the interview ",2018-05-16,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/exclusive-qa-with-ross-zhang-gm-of-huobi-canada-1450341,1450341

198041,419557,ORCL,ORCL Vs  BLKB  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Computer   Software sector have probably already heard of Oracle  ORCL  and Blackbaud  BLKB   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Oracle is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Blackbaud has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ORCL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than BLKB has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
ORCL currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 74  while BLKB has a forward P E of 35 74  We also note that ORCL has a PEG ratio of 1 61  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  BLKB currently has a PEG ratio of 4 26 
Another notable valuation metric for ORCL is its P B ratio of 9 24  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BLKB has a P B of 10 49 
Based on these metrics and many more  ORCL holds a Value grade of B  while BLKB has a Value grade of F 
ORCL sticks out from BLKB in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that ORCL is the better option right now ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/orcl-vs-blkb-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200421632,200421632

Oracle is one of 638 companies in the Computer and Technology group  The Computer and Technology group currently sits at  8 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst

Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL s full year earnings has moved 0 39  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Our latest available data shows that ORCL has returned about 19 89  since the start of the calendar year  At the same time  Computer and Technology stocks have gained an average of 16 49   This shows that Oracle is outperforming its peers so far this year 
Looking more specifically  ORCL belongs to the Computer   Software industry  a group that includes 47 individual stocks and currently sits at  56 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  this group has gained an average of 23  so far this year  meaning that ORCL is slightly underperforming its industry in terms of year to date returns

198050,419566,ORCL, Bitcoin Advocate Takes on the Oracle  Makes Solid Points in Crypto s Defense ,news,"You ve likely heard by now the Bitcoin comments made by Warren Buffett  Charles Munger and Bill Gates  Well  one of cryptocurrencies  staunchest advocates is hitting back  and his logic is pretty good 
Brian Kelly  founder   CEO  BKCM LLC  said on CNBC last evening that the famous finance players may need more education when it comes to cryptos 
He also talked about the catalysts that could move Bitcoin higher this week 
The Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha and His Sidekick
Known as the Oracle of Omaha  Buffett has referred to Bitcoin as being  probably rat poison squared   He also  it was a tool for  charlatans   predicted a  bad ending  for Bitcoin  and dubbed it a  mirage  and a  bubble  that would soon burst in spectacular fashion 
Munger s has been just as brutal with his comments  saying the following 

 Bitcoin is worthless  artificial gold  which if it succeeded in being sold  it would have a lot of illicit activity  Now  it is not something I think the world needs  

In response to Munger s statement  Kelly said this 

 This is your classic castigation before investigation  Bitcoin is a ledger  and gold is just a rock  That s not to disown gold  but gold doesn t do anything  I think Charles needs to do a little bit more investigation 

Potential big tech disruptor
Bitcoin is simply a big electronic ledger that we can all see  and has the potential to disrupt a 600  year old accounting entry process  Kelly said 

Essentially what we re doing is taking out of that double entry accounting  process  and putting it on the Blockchain and putting it on the internet and making it software  That s all these things are  they re software with a token attached  It s a disruptive technology  and that s why I want to be invested in it 

Tiptoeing into changing an industry
Just like the intranet was how companies  tiptoed  into the internet  enterprise blockchains and private blockchains are companies  ways  I think  to eventually push into public blockchains  or the decentralized internet  or what we call the D net  he said 
For that to happen  the blockchains must be paired to a token 

 And that s the powerful economic model that all three of these billionaires are missing  

When could Bitcoin be  10 000 again 
While some observers chalk up this week s retreat of Bitcoin s price from  10 000 to the comments from Buffett and the like  Kelly said disagreed He even said that these three talking about cryptos probably added to Bitcoin illuminatis  content  because they would not want Buffett and Munger to be in the space anyway 
As far as moving back above  10 000  it s still in the cards   and soon 
While the space saw Bitcoin s price around  6 000  as recently as Easter Weekend  Kelly noted that we ve seen a huge run up 
A major catalyst to Bitcoin s price moving above  10 000 soon is the Blockchain conference being held in New York next week  The Consensus 2018 Conference runs from May 14 through May 16 ",2018-05-08,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-advocate-takes-on-the-oracle-makes-solid-points-in-cryptos-defense-1436519,1436519
198051,419567,ORCL, DeVere Group CEO Criticizes Buffett s Bitcoin Comments ,news,"DeVere Group CEO Nigel Green does not agree with Warren Buffett s comments of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies  He  that the financial guru had to be educated on this particular matter  On Monday  at the Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  annual meeting conference  Buffett  his view that Bitcoin had no intrinsic value and would end badly  However  Green noted that the largest cryptocurrency had gained over  2 500 in the last month alone  representing a price surge of almost 38  

 It comes as little surprise that Mr  Buffett and his 94 year old business partner  Charlie Munger  criticized cryptocurrencies at their annual meeting   Green said 
 They have done so consistently  But what I do find monumentally baffling is that two of the world s most successful investors cannot see the intrinsic value of some form of cryptocurrency  Do they honestly believe that there is no place for  and no value of  digital  global currencies in an increasingly digitalized and globalized world  Do they not see many of the world s major tech companies  established banking groups and household name investors investing in  using and or beginning to adopt cryptocurrencies   DeVere chief asked 

He added that many governments  central banks  and regulators around the world are all recognizing the scale and potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies  and are searching for regulatory frameworks given that the Bitcoin phenomenon has become so big 
Green believes that Warren Buffett doesn t have enough knowledge on cryptocurrencies  even though he admits that the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  as Buffett is nicknamed  is a true financial guru  In fact  the billionaire himself  in an interview with CNBC that he didn t know about Bitcoin 

 I believe his recent comments on cryptocurrencies illustrate his lack of understanding in this area and how he perhaps needs to be educated on what is likely to be the future of money   Green concluded 

DeVere is an independent international financial consultancy firm that offers advice to expatriate clients and investors worldwide  Nigel Green founded the company in 2002 
Other executives have also criticized Buffett s stance on cryptocurrencies  CrowdfundX CEO Darren Marble  that even if Buffett had a great reputation as an investor  he was dead wrong on Bitcoin because he had no idea on how the technology works 

 How could someone who doesn t use email possibly appreciate Bitcoin   Darren asked ",2018-05-08,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/devere-group-ceo-criticizes-buffetts-bitcoin-comments-1436987,1436987

198058,419574,ORCL, Warren Buffett Dismisses Bitcoin as Gambling ,news,"Buying Bitcoin is like gambling with your money and has nothing to do with proper investing  according to Warren Buffett 
Buffett  dubbed the  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  for his investment acumen   Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance 

 There are two kinds of items that people buy and think they re investing  One really is investing  and the other isn t  Bitcoin is not 

The billionaire investor added 

 If you buy something like a farm  an apartment house  or an interest in a business  You can do that on a private basis  And it s a perfectly satisfactory investment  You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you  Now  if you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency  you don t really have anything that has produced anything  You re just hoping the next guy pays more  

According to the founder and head of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   buying cryptocurrency is essentially speculating  He said there was nothing wrong with doing it  but it certainly did not constitute investing 
Bitcoin s value is a joke
Buffett s latest dismissal of Bitcoin mirrors his previous statements about the digital currency  Hosting a casual event for business students in November last year  the billionaire said you   a value on Bitcoin  because it s not a value producing asset  
Just because Bitcoin is an effective way of transmitting money  it does not mean anything when all things are considered  he said 

 A check is a way of transmitting money  too  Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money     The idea that  it  has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke  in my view  

Collapse of cryptos
In addition to his distaste for Bitcoin  Buffett has also  the demise of cryptocurrencies  stating in January 

 In terms of cryptocurrencies  generally  I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending  ",2018-04-30,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/warren-buffett-dismisses-bitcoin-as-gambling-1422306,1422306

198104,419620,ORCL,Theranos and its founder settle U S  fraud charges  SEC,news,"By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters    Embattled blood testing company Theranos Inc and its Chief Executive Elizabeth Holmes agreed to settle  massive fraud  charges in a deal that strips her of majority control among other penalties  U S  regulators said on Wednesday  Theranos was once hailed as a Silicon Valley star  with a  9 billion valuation based on its promise to disrupt the staid laboratory testing business with new technology the company claimed could analyze a single drop of blood  Founded in 2003  its fortunes began to wane in 2015 after Wall Street Journal reports suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate  As part of the settlement  the Securities and Exchange Commission said company founder Holmes must also return millions of shares to the privately held company  pay a  500 000 fine and cannot serve as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years  The SEC s complaint alleged that the company  Holmes and Theranos  former president  Ramesh  Sunny  Balwani   made numerous false and misleading statements in investor presentations  product demonstrations  and media articles  about its key product   Balwani did not agree to a settlement  the agency said  Theranos raised more than  750 million from investors including well known venture capital firm DFJ  Walgreens  media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  co founder Larry Ellison  Many investors have already sold their stakes  The SEC  describing the case as involving  massive fraud   said Theranos  Holmes and Balwani were charged  with raising more than  700 million from investors through an elaborate  years long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company s technology  business and financial performance    The SEC s co director of enforcement  Steven Peikin  said on a conference call with reporters that the move to remove control of the company from Holmes was very rare for the agency   It s a pretty unique set of remedies   he said   And I think it s a particularly meaningful one   particularly in Silicon Valley where the founders of startup companies like this obviously value the concept of control   Peikin said the SEC intends to pursue litigation against Balwani  The regulator pursued charges against Holmes and Balwani to deter executive wrongdoing elsewhere and out of concern that imposing stiff penalties on the company itself could make it even more difficult for defrauded investors to recoup any funds   Really this company was a company that was a two person operation  where Holmes and Balwani exclusively controlled Theranos  They were responsible for all of the misconduct alleged in this complaint   he said  Peikin did not comment on whether the civil charges preclude future criminal charges or whether other agencies were engaged in ongoing criminal investigations against the company  Jina Choi  the head of SEC s San Francisco Regional Office  said the company s troubles offered  an important lesson for Silicon Valley

The key to this performance is a process of analysis and selection that is both complicated and straightforward  I have a checklist of 52 points I go through to choose the right fund  I apply these one by one  first using some of the broader points to screen funds  then zooming in closer  using more complex analysis to bring you my very best buys 
While it d take a long time to go through that entire checklist  I want to share with you a five point system that I use as a springboard for picking winning CEFs for CEF Insider 
Before I get to that  let me first answer this important question  why is it important to have a good system in the first place 
Because if you don t  you could find yourself holding a very empty bag like investors who bought the MFS Intermediate High Income Closed Fund  NYSE CIF  at the start of 2018 because they were seduced by its 9 7  dividend yield 
Sadly  that move resulted in a 21 8  loss by the end of 2018  even with dividend payouts

What s even sadder is that there are plenty of funds that invest in the same assets as CIF that have done far better  Take the PIMCO High Income Fund  NYSE PHK   which also plays in the high yield bond world and is up a whopping 18  for 2018 
A Far More Desirable Pick
This is one of many instances where blindly buying a CEF would have cost real money  And what makes things even more frustrating is that CIF was actually a better pick at the start of 2017 until it became a too crowded trade by the start of 2018 
And CEF investors who aren t diligent and bought CIF when it was good and held it when it became a disaster are facing massive losses  leading us to a really important question  how do you avoid this trap 
My 5 Point System
When choosing CEFs  I look at five crucial points that drive each buy call I make  And they can help guide you  too  They are 
Management  How good is the team at the top  and has the fund changed horses lately  frequent management changes are an obvious red flag  
Discount  What s the fund s discount to its net asset value  NAV  or the value of its underlying assets   and what has that markdown been historically  We want a current discount well below the long term average to drive our upside 
Portfolio  What does the fund hold now  are there any big changes to the portfolio  what s the rationale behind those changes  and how are those assets going to perform in the future 
Dividend  How sustainable is the payout  what are the chances of a dividend cut  and how low can the payouts go   Key here is to look at yield on price  yield on NAV  changes in NAV and total net investment income  or NII 
Current Climate  How does the fund s investment strategy fit within your broader portfolio and view of changes in the broader economy 
In other words  I combine a variety of bottom up questions about the fund s portfolio  strategy and management with top down questions about the asset class and economy as a whole 
The System in Action
To show how this works  let s look at an example  the PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund  NYSE PCI  
Back in early 2016  my colleague and Contrarian Outlook Chief Investment Strategist  Brett Owens  and I worked together to figure out what the future held for PCI  You can read his original buy recommendation right here 
The first step was to look at the fund s management 
In early 2016  the fund was changing its strategy away from high yield corporate bonds to mortgage backed securities  The complexity of these investments scared some  but we saw this as a positive for PCI  We also saw it as a sign that the fund was in the process of a transformation that would be good for its returns and shrink its discount to NAV 
We were right 
In July 2016  PIMCO announced that it would change the fund s name  it used to be called the PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund  to reflect its new mandate  Fund manager Daniel J  Ivascyn  who has become a legend in finance  was largely behind the change as he took a more active role at the fund 
He had good reason to  At the time  PCI was the most discounted of PIMCO funds 
And while mortgage backed securities sound scary to a lot of people because of their role in the Great Recession  PIMCO saw things differently  and so did we   Mortgage defaults were going down and the housing market was a lot stronger  which made the heavily discounted mortgage backed securities a steal 
So PCI s change in strategy  driven by top notch management  and its portfolio quality indicated that its deep discount was a buy signal  It also showed that the fund s 11 9  dividend yield was sustainable 
What s happened since  A 33 7  total return  even after the recent market madness 
A Quick Ride Up
3 CEFs I m Watching Now
Nowadays  I m looking at a couple dozen CEFs that I think are getting to that perfect place where the fundamentals and the broader economic climate are combining to create a perfect storm for massive upside and sustainable high yields 
The first is the BlackRock Science   Technology  NYSE BST   a tech fund with a 7 2  yield that has crushed the Nasdaq 100 since its inception and has held its own even during recent market struggles  It s an example of a well managed portfolio with a great management team but while the bottom up is good for BST  we re not quite there from a macro standpoint yet  But we re getting closer 
In the utilities world  there s the 7 7  yielding Gabelli Global Utility   Income Tr  NYSE GLU  which is diversified and has the added bonus of going beyond the US to take advantage of currency fluctuations  I haven t added it to the CEF Insider portfolio yet  for a simple reason  with the recent strength in the US dollar  buying abroad isn t what we want to do quite yet at least not until the US dollar has reached its peak  which may be just around the corner if the Fed makes it clear their rate hiking is going to slow down or stop   Click here to get access to my complete CEF Insider portfolio  including a utilities pick that has actually gone up since I recommended it  despite the broader market being down  
Finally  another interesting fund on my watch list is the Boulder Growth and Income Closed Fund  NYSE BIF  which has a massive discount despite its very strong portfolio of value stocks and focus on Warren Buffett favorites and Buffett s own Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   which is a third of the fund s portfolio 
In addition to the quality of the fund s value investing focus  its 4  dividend yield squeezes income out of a Buffett portfolio  despite the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha s refusal to pay dividends  making it an income investor s dream  The only problem  Its relatively low yield  many equity funds pay over 7  in the CEF universe  means a lot of investors give it a pass  which is why its 18   discount to NAV has persisted over the years 
Recent market volatility may drag CEF investors toward quality income options  which could result in capital gains for BIF shareholders  That brings BIF closer to being a buy  but we need to see the market itself strengthen a bit first

198151,419667,ORCL,Oracle  ORCL  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Oracle  ORCL  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 13  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 4  
Revenues are expected to be  9 53 billion  down 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oracle 
For Oracle  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oracle will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oracle would post earnings of  0 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 71  delivering a surprise of  4 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oracle doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oracle-orcl-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200365734,200365734

198163,419679,ORCL,African rulers  weapon against web based dissent  the off switch,news,"By Edward McAllister DAKAR  Reuters    Rapidly expanding access to the internet across Africa is helping grassroots opposition movements take on once invulnerable regimes  Many entrenched rulers have a simple response  pulling the plug   While countries in the Middle East and China employ firewalls and block virtual private networks to control web access  leaders in Africa increasingly prefer the blunter instrument of outright outages  Critics say that infringes not just the rights of individuals but also undermines the burgeoning economies of some of the world s poorest countries  Since the start of 2016  governments in 13 African nations have intentionally shut down the internet on 21 occasions  mainly during elections and protests  according to a database run by online rights group Access Now  That compares to seven shutdowns in the previous two years   Earlier this month  tech entrepreneur Sama Tanya saw Cameroonian police fire teargas into a residential building during protests by the country s English speaking minority  As choking women and children poured onto the street  he considered documenting the crackdown to share on social media  only to realize the internet connection had been cut    I couldn t even reach my family to tell them  I was worried  but I couldn t share a thing   he said by telephone from the city of Buea  the epicenter of the demonstrations   Rights group Internet Without Borders says cutting access is a violation of international law and defies a July 2016 U N  resolution affirming that  the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online    Internet freedom declined worldwide for the sixth straight year in 2016  according to an annual report from Freedom House   Africa is becoming a new testing ground for authoritarian practices online   said Francois Patuel  West Africa researcher at Amnesty International   We have seen disruptions in Togo and in other countries but also arrests for what people are saying online  Often what people say online can be used against them in court     PROTECT THE POPULATION  Internet cuts in Africa date back to the 2011 Arab Spring when rulers in Egypt  Tunisia and Libya sought to control the spread of information   Today  the intent is the same  but the methods have evolved   Governments slow internet speed by reducing bandwidth  or  throttling   and target and shut down certain URLs like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter and WhatsApp  a process known as filtering  Although free apps like VPN Monster and Turbo VPN can circumvent filtering using VPNs which mask the location of a computer or phone  even a VPN won t help you if you don t have an internet connection in the first place  When Gabon shut down internet access for several days last year as violent street protests erupted against President Ali Bongo s contested re election  it likely only required flipping a virtual switch at state run Gabon Telecom   Gabon Communications Minister Bilie By Nze acknowledged in a Reuters interview that internet access had been disrupted  but declined to comment further  During elections in Gambia in December  the government ordered the shutdown of the internet s  landing point   the central point from which service is supplied to the whole country  according to two people with knowledge of the decision  In Togo  authorities appeared to have organized a mobile data shutdown during opposition protests against President Faure Gnassingbe last month  according to people who were there who said fixed internet lines remained available   Certain people post images to amplify the situation or publish photos of horror   Togo s Security Minister Colonel Damehame Yark told reporters earlier this month   The government decided to cut the internet because we have to protect the population    Democratic Republic of Congo asked telecommunications companies to block social media networks in December  Providers declined to comment at the time on whether they would comply  but one industry executive said all companies had signed an agreement to respect national security injunctions    When a sovereign government gives licenses to telecoms companies  those companies have little choice but to comply with the government s demands   said Doug Madory  director of internet analysis at Oracle  NYSE ORCL  Dyn  which monitors international internet traffic flows  Orange and Airtel  which provide service in countries where there have been shutdowns  did not respond to requests for comment for this story  MTN  the continent s top mobile phone operator  provided a link to a company statement outlining its dedication to internet freedom but declined to comment further  BAD FOR BUSINESS  Outages may be aimed at political opponents or social disruptors but businesses crucial to Africa s economic growth can get also caught up in the crackdown  Sub Saharan Africa s internet shutdowns have cost the region up to  237 million in economic losses since 2015  according to a recent report by the UK government funded Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa   Shutdowns are  adversely affecting the livelihoods of citizens  undermining the profitability of business enterprises  and reducing the GDP and competitiveness of countries that implement them   the report said  Etta Ayuk s small tech start up Skylabase  which provides software to banks  lost three major clients and  20 000 worth of business when the internet was shut down from January to April in Anglophone Cameroon  forcing him to fire nearly half his employees  During the outage  Ayuk and his remaining staff crammed onto buses every morning for the 70 km  44 mile  drive to Francophone Cameroon s commercial capital  Douala  to use the internet there  Gridlock often made it a three hour trip each way  Cameroon s government declined repeated requests for comment   Ayuk is considering rebasing to Gambia  which has not had a government shutdown since Adama Barrow became president in January 2017  Barrow is encouraging internet start ups

198165,419681,ORCL,China backed buyout fund founder charged in U S  insider trading case,news,"By Liana B  Baker SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The founder of a private equity firm with Chinese state backing has been charged with insider trading related to the attempted acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp  O LSCC   U S  authorities said on Monday  The charges against Benjamin Chow represent a major blow to the buyout firm he created just last year  Canyon Bridge Capital Partners  with capital from China Reform Holdings  a Chinese state back fund  Chow denies wrongdoing  his attorney said  The indictment comes as Chow s fund Canyon Bridge seeks to close its 550 million pound   737 million  acquisition of British chipmaker  Imagination Technologies  Group Plc  L IMG   after its  1 3 billion takeover of Lattice was blocked by U S  President Donald Trump last month over national security concerns  The Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Monday that Chow had conspired to commit securities fraud by sending material nonpublic information regarding the Lattice deal to an unnamed friend and former colleague  A separate indictment by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission in February against that former colleague of Chow identified him as Michael Yin  a former Hong Kong based private equity executive who had become a hedge fund manager  Chow  a U S  citizen born in China  is accused in the new indictment of tipping off Yin  who allegedly reaped  5 million of profit thanks to knowledge that the deal was in the works  Yin and China Reform Holdings could not be reached for comment  The prosecutors say that Chow  46  passed along information to Yin at in person coffee meetings in Beijing  voice messages and text exchanges ahead of the announcement of CanyonBridge s deal to buy Lattice   Benjamin Chow is a true American success story  and the charges against him are baseless and unprecedented  He is not alleged to have made a dime from the scheme  and he had no possible motive to enrich those who traded  He stood to lose enormous amounts if traders purchased the stock and drove up the company s share price in the midst of his own negotiations   Chow s attorney George Canellos  a partner at law firm Milbank  Tweed  Hadley   McCloy LLP  said in a statement  A Canyon Bridge spokesman said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment and that it is focused on completing its planned acquisition of Imagination  The fund added that it is not itself subject to any investigation  Imagination did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Lattice declined to comment  The indictment also said that Chow lied to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in response to inquiries in April about possible insider trading  The charges against Chow carry a potential prison sentence and maximum fines of  5 million  Canyon Bridge s funding can be traced back to China s State Council  the top decision making body of the government  Reuters has previously reported  For a graphic  click  Canyon Bridge has been trying this year to attract investors from outside China  The indictment against its founder could represent a hurdle to these efforts

198166,419682,ORCL,Warren Buffett Would Buy Precious Metals Again   If He Could,opinion,"Warren Buffett is famous for many things  one of which is his general dislike for precious metals as an investment  But maybe you re old enough to remember when  just over 20 years ago  he backed up the truck and bought a ton of silver   over 3 000 tons  to be more precise  From the 1997 Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  letter to shareholders 

Our second non traditional commitment is in silver  Last year  we purchased 111 2 million ounces  Marked to market  that position produced a pre tax gain of  97 4 million for us in 1997  In a way  this is a return to the past for me  Thirty years ago  I bought silver because I anticipated its demonetization by the U S  Government  Ever since  I have followed the metal s fundamentals but not owned it  In recent years  bullion inventories have fallen materially  and last summer Charlie and I concluded that a higher price would be needed to establish equilibrium between supply and demand 


Maybe you re even old enough to remember that earlier time  just about 50 years ago  when the Oracle  of Omaha amassed a position in silver  Either way  it s interesting to look back at why he did so   Demonetization by the U S  Government   was his thesis back in 1967  Essentially  he made a bet on the devaluation of the dollar against the gold price and chose silver as his trade vehicle  And there are some interesting parallels between then and today 

The dollar is no longer convertible into gold as it was back then but the dynamics that forced the discontinuation of this convertibility are still at work  Wikipedia discusses the  Nixon shock  by explaining that   from 1950 to 1969  as Germany and Japan recovered  the US share of the world s economic output dropped significantly  from 35  to 27    The very same situation is happening again today  only it is China taking share of the world s economic output even as the dollar remains the world s reserve currency 
The story continues   furthermore  a negative balance of payments  growing public debt incurred by the Vietnam War  and monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued in the 1960s   The negative balance of payments is far greater today even when normalized for the relative size of the economy  again thanks to our relationship with China  as is the rapidly growing pile of public debt 
And if you haven t noticed the monetary inflation created by the Fed over the past decade you must have been living under a rock  The currency component of M1 is currently growing at an annual rate of 7   a growth rate it first hit in May of 1966  It s no longer the president s purview to demonetize the dollar  it s the market s  And I ll leave you decide whether the market should do so today based upon the aforementioned dynamics 
But it s also important to look at his later thesis for buying silver   In recent years  bullion inventories have fallen materially  and last summer Charlie and I concluded that a higher price would be needed to establish equilibrium between supply and demand   Currently  we have a very similar situation in gold  As my friend  Luke Gromen  recently pointed out on twitter  registered gold stocks are currently testing their lowest levels on record  Thus it appears that a higher price is   needed to establish equilibrium between supply and demand  


All in all  it looks like buying gold today fits neatly into the Warren Buffett way of investing in precious metals  He may not be buying precious metals today   with all of the Comex registered gold stocks totaling just  165 million  he could buy it all and still not commit 1  of the total cash on hand at Berkshire Hathaway   but that doesn t mean investors who understand the simple dynamics of supply and demand shouldn t be doing so using the very same thesis he has used successfully in the past ",2018-11-14,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-warren-buffett-would-be-buying-precious-again--if-he-could-200359277,200359277

Cloud concern Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  is slated to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the close tomorrow  Oracle stock is down 0 4  at  46 11  at last check  after last week suffering an analyst related bear gap back below the 320 day moving average  What s more  ORCL shares have a history of negative earnings reactions  and below we will take a look at what the options market is pricing in for the stock s next post earnings move 
Digging into earnings history  ORCL has closed lower in the session following each of the company s last three reports  including a 9 4  loss in March  Widening the scope  the stock has averaged a one day post earnings swing of 5 9  over the past two years  regardless of direction  However  the options market is pricing in a slightly larger than usual 8 3  move this time around  per data from Trade Alert 
As mentioned earlier  the stock gapped back below its 320 moving average last Thursday  and has since danced just below its year to date breakeven level  From a longer term perspective  ORCL notched an all time high of  53 47 in mid March  shortly before the aforementioned earnings gap lower  and since hitting a low of  44 04 in early April  has been in a channel of higher lows and highs 

Aside from last week s bearish brokerage notes  attention has been mostly optimistic on Oracle stock  Of the 25 analysts covering the tech concern  14 sport  buy  or  strong buy  recommendations  At the same time  ORCL s average 12 month price target of  55 15 prices in a 19  premium to current levels 
In the options pits  sentiment has also been leaning quite bullish  Data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  currently shows the stock with a 10 day call put volume ratio of 3 44  This lofty ratio means that more than triple the amounts of calls have been purchased over puts during the past two weeks of trading 
Should Oracle once again miss earnings expectations tomorrow night  the stock could be vulnerable to an additional round of negative analyst attention  In the same vein  a mass exodus of option bulls could translate into added headwinds for ORCL ",2018-06-18,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/option-buyers-pick-up-oracle-calls-before-earnings-200325878,200325878

198194,419710,ORCL,iFOREX Daily Analysis   June 21 2018,opinion,"The Dollar continued to see an upside against other major currencies  with the US Dollar Index  USDX   which represents the Dollar against a basket of other major currencies gaining 0 13  on Wednesday and extending gains in early trading on Thursday  The Chinese Yuan  offshore    CNH further declined against the Dollar  trading above 6 5 USD CNH for the first time in over 5 months  Analysts attribute this to further likely rate hikes by the US Fed and an escalation in the US China trade conflict 
Gold extended its losses to a 6 months low on Thursday over expectations of further rate hikes in the US and a strong Dollar  Oil traded higher  following data from the EIA indicating a draw of 5 9 million barrels on US stockpiles 
Equity indices mostly recovered in trading on Wednesday  while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  US 30  declined as there are concerns that China will especially target large US corporations as part of its retaliatory measures 
Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to recover on Wednesday despite the news that the Bithumb exchange announced that it was hacked and crypto coins were stolen  Analysts attribute the lack of significant drawdown in cryptocurrencies to the fast action of the exchange and promise to pay back investor losses 
On Thursday the Swiss National Bank  SNB  is set to announce whether it intends any changes to its monetary policy  Later the Bank of England  BoE  is set to announce its highly anticipated decision on interest rates and monetary policy ahead of Brexit  In Canada data on Wholesale Trade is due to be released  In the Asian Pacific trading session Japan will publish its Consumer Price Index  CPI  data

Gold
Gold prices continued to slide lower  reaching a 6 months low early on Thursday  Analysts see the strong Dollar and higher interest rates putting pressure on the precious metal  This was especially supported by a statement from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell saying  that the case for continuing to raise interest rates is strong due to solid economic growth and the unemployment rate at the lowest level since 1969 in the United States   A strong Dollar makes gold more expensive in countries  where the US currency is not used for normal transactions  while higher interest rates especially on other safe haven assets  such as US Treasury Notes  make it harder for gold to compete for investors  favor  since it does not bear any interest

WTI Oil
Oil settled higher on Wednesday with data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  indicating  that stockpiles for crude oil in the US decreased by 5 9 million barrels in the previous week  which was a considerably higher draw on supplies than expected   Meanwhile it appears that the OPEC cartel might find a consensus to moderately increase oil production quota at their meeting on Friday and Saturday  with Iran now seemingly available for a compromise to increase production targets and Ecuador s Minister for Hydrocarbons expecting the increase to be at around 0 6 million barrels per day  lower than the 1 5 million barrels per day  that were proposed by Russia   On Friday the US Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count is going to be released and will show the amount of operating oil rigs in the US  The statistic was never negative for the previous 11 consecutive reporting weeks

US 30
US equity indices traded mostly higher  with some analysts commenting that the lack of new threats from President Trump on tariffs  gave hope that an actual trade war might still be averted  However futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average  US 30  continued to fall  as some expect that as countermeasure to US actions  the Chinese side could especially go after the biggest US companies doing business in China as there was also an article detailing such possible action in the Chinese state controlled  Global Times  paper   Some losses were seen in basic materials  US Basic Materials ETF  0 39   stocks  while gains were seen in biotech  US Biotech ETF  1 62   and real estate  US Real Estate ETF  1 00   stocks   Micron   0 42   traded higher in after hours trading  as the company s quarterly earnings narrowly exceeded investors  expectations due to  healthy industry conditions   Oracle  NYSE ORCL    7 54   plunged to its lowest level in over 15 months as investors were concerned about the company not publishing numbers about its cloud business in its latest earnings  fearing that this might be due to slowing growth in that segment   On Thursday in the US the Philadelphia Fed General Business Conditions level statistic  Jobless New Claims and the FHFA House Price Index are set to be released

198204,419720,ORCL,New Zealand s Burling  blown away  by America s Cup win,news,"By Alexander Smith HAMILTON  Bermuda  Reuters    Peter Burling is looking forward to  a pretty cool few weeks  sharing his America s Cup win with the rest of New Zealand after celebrating the conclusion of a grueling campaign with his opponent Jimmy Spithill in Bermuda  The 26 year old calmly steered his way into yachting history on Monday  demolishing Spithill s Oracle  NYSE ORCL  Team USA to win the trophy which is a national obsession in New Zealand and in the process become the youngest ever sailor to do so   It was our goal and dream to come here and win the America s Cup and to have it sitting there and have it in the morning meeting when we all got together after a bit of recovery from last night  we re just blown away   Burling told Reuters  Burling  an Olympic gold and silver medalist  was helmsman on Emirates Team New Zealand and the face of the crew during the campaign to wrest the  Auld Mug  from its U S  holders  The celebrations following the win in the New Zealand team s  shed  where they have kept their space age 50 foot catamaran and  wing  sail were  pretty low key   with the crew only realizing how drained they were once the adrenaline wore off   We finally realized how tired we were and how most of us didn t really have that much energy to carry on   Burling said on Tuesday at his headquarters in Bermuda s historic Dockyard  Burling said the losing U S  team led by his  good friend  Spithill  who until the Kiwi victory had been the youngest ever helmsman to win the oldest trophy in international sport  had joined the New Zealanders in their celebration   They came over and said congrats last night and we invited them in  It was pretty cool to be able to share it with them   And any antagonism between the two during the competition on Bermuda s Great Sound was  a bit of friendly banter   A beaming Burling  with the normally closely guarded silver trophy standing behind him  said it was  impossible to compare  the victory with the gold medal he and fellow crew member Blair Tuke won in Rio de Janeiro last year in the 49er skiff class    To be able to lift that and bring it home to New Zealand  it s going to be a pretty cool few weeks sharing it with all our fans and friends and family back home   Burling said  adding he had received a lot of messages from supporters at home   We definitely had a bit of a bumpy road at times  we faced a bit of adversity at times   Burling said  adding that the spectacular capsize which nearly ended the Kiwi campaign during the semi final did not haunt him  at all    These boats are incredibly complicated and fast and incredibly technical  The harder you push it the more likely you are to have a crash   the tall sailor  with his trademark reddish stubble  added

 Reuters    A real estate brokerage controlled by Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc on Monday announced a marketing agreement with Juwai com  China s largest international property website  to attract wealthy Chinese citizens hoping to buy homes in the United States 
Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices believes the agreement will make it  much easier  for the 2 million monthly users of Juwai com and  to browse franchisees  residential listings  Chief Executive Gino Blefari said in a statement 
The Chinese surpassed Canadians as the largest foreign purchasers of U S  residential property in 2013  according to the National Association of Realtors 
Including buyers from Hong Kong and Taiwan  the Chinese accounted for  27 3 billion  or 26 7 percent  of international sales in the year ended March 2016  the trade group said 
 The United States is a safe  attractive investment opportunity for foreigners  especially the Chinese   Peter Turtzo  who is spearheading Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices  foreign push as senior vice president of international operations  said in an interview 
Turtzo said Chinese buyers spend in the  mid  900 000s  on average for U S  homes  triple what U S  buyers spend  often using them as second homes or to house children attending U S  colleges and universities 
Berkshire s HomeServices of America Inc  the second largest U S  residential real estate brokerage  is the majority owner of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices  It has expanded rapidly and now accounts for about 1 percent of its parent s overall profit 
Juwai com  which is analogous to U S  portals such as Realtor com and Trulia  hosts sites on both sides of China s internet censorship mechanism known as the Great Firewall  making it easier to browse

198309,419825,ORCL,Revisiting Warren Buffett s Bet On The S P 500 ,opinion,"The Oracle of Omaha made a very public bet with Prot g  Partners on December 19  2007 that over the following 10 years  an unmanaged S P 500 index fund would outperform a collection of five high profile fund of funds 
Buffett won the bet  and it wasn t even close  The S P 500 returned a cumulative 125 8   or 8 5  per year   The hedge funds delivered cumulative returns ranging from just 2 8  to 87 7   0 3  to 6 5  per year   And remember  this time period includes the 2008 meltdown 
As Buffett writes in his  

The five funds of funds got off to a fast start  each beating the index fund in 2008  Then the roof fell in  In every one of the nine years that followed  the funds of funds as a whole trailed the index fund 
Let me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock market behavior over the ten year stretch  If a poll of investment  experts  had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long term common stock returns  their guesses would have likely averaged close to the 8 5  actually delivered by the S P 500  Making money in that environment should have been easy  Indeed  Wall Street  helpers  earned staggering sums  While this group prospered  however  many of their investors experienced a lost decade 
Performance comes  performance goes  Fees never falter 

On this count  I can t argue with the Oracle  NYSE ORCL   One fund delivered annualized returns of 6 5   which might be considered competitive with the 8 5  annualized return of the S P 500 on a risk adjusted basis  I say  might  because I don t have enough information to say definitively either way  But I can say with confidence that the performance of four out of the five fund of funds was pathetic 
Investors paid a lot of money in fees and got virtually nothing in return 
I m not  however  willing to throw out the baby with the bath water and eschew all hedge funds  Depending on your time horizon and objectives  certain funds and certain strategies put into practice by funds might be worth a place in your portfolio  Over the past decade  I ve placed many of my accredited investor clients in a variety of absolute return funds invested in everything from medical accounts receivables to option writing strategies  And the funds did exactly what I wanted them to do  They reduced portfolio volatility without sacrificing much in the way of returns  They avoided major drawdowns  And importantly  they gave my clients the piece of mind they needed 
I can t  in good faith  invest 100  of the portfolio of a retirement aged client in an S P 500 index fund  That would be irresponsible on a level that should be considered criminal  But I also can t  in good faith  invest a significant portion of their portfolio in bonds at today s yields  Alternative investments  which would include hedge funds  can   if done right   act as a substitute for traditional bonds 
But the key here is  done right   When evaluating a hedge fund  I ask myself the following questions 

Does the hedge fund actually hedge  in that they manage risk  Or is  hedge fund  merely code for  aggressive equity trading   Most of the high profile managers you see on TV      etc   fall into the latter category  I have no interest in those kinds of managers 
How large is the fund  There is a sweet spot here  Ideally  you like to see at least  100 million under management  You know that the manager can keep the lights on with the fees generated from a portfolio that size  But when a fund gets to be several billion dollars  it can be too big to operate in their area of expertise  Just about any strategy becomes unmanageable at a large enough asset size  Buffett himself has complained that he can t invest the way he wants to at Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  because it s simply too big at its current size 
Is their strategy   and any hedges they have in place   going to survive a period of significant market turmoil  You generally can t know with 100  certainty  but it s useful to know how the fund performed in past periods of volatility  such as the 2008 meltdown or the 2010 or 2015 flash crashes  Or for that matter  the recent spate of volatility we saw in February 
Is the fund illiquid  And if so  why  If the fund invests in traded stocks or options  it should offer monthly or at least quarterly liquidity  There s just no reason why it wouldn t  But if the fund invests in illiquid notes or real estate  then a lockup might be 100  warranted 
Is the fund minimally correlated to the stock market  and to the other alternatives in my portfolio  This is an important one  There is literally no point in investing in an alternative strategy if it s just going to follow the rest of your portfolio lower in a bear market 

Buffett is right that most hedge fund managers don t earn their fees  But I ll never begrudge a manager for charging a high fee if they re delivering something I can t get elsewhere for cheaper

The deal will allow AppDynamics investors to exit their holdings completely  compared with a roughly 10 percent exit if the company listed its shares 
The M A route may be more attractive not only for tech startups whose valuations have taken a hit over the past year  but also for traditional tech companies such as Cisco  which are looking to boost revenue through deals as they struggle to grow organically 
 I think this does reflect that the valuations are still relatively conservative   said Richard Truesdell  co head of global capital markets at law firm Davis Polk   Wardwell 
 Certainly  AppDynamics  seems to have hit the jackpot     this is the most dramatic disparity in valuation between the two markets that I can think of seeing recently  
Cisco s announcement comes a week after  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co   N HPE  said it would buy cloud startup SimpliVity for  650 million in cash 
This is not to say that 2017 will be a disappointing year for IPOs 
In fact  social media company Snap Inc is all set to debut this year and several smaller tech companies have pinned their hopes on a rebounding U S IPO market  coming off a forgettable 2016 marred by political and economic uncertainty 
Only 20 technology companies went public in 2016  the fewest since 2008  according to Thomson Reuters data 
 Decacorns    companies valued at tens of billions of dollars   including Uber and Airbnb are also expected to file to list their shares this year  allowing high profile backers including BlackRock and Sequoia Capital to cash in their investments 
For now  startups are likely to be sweet on buyouts 
 I expect that the U S  IPO market will have more activity this year than last  but very few tech companies will go public because companies such as Cisco Systems and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  are willing to pay top dollar   said Jay Ritter  IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida ",2017-01-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/appdynamics-deal-shows-buyouts-more-lucrative-in-anemic-ipo-market-455675,455675

198336,419852,ORCL,Avoiding The 3 Pitfalls Of  Buy   Hold  Investing,opinion,"Rumors of the demise of  buy   hold  investing are greatly exaggerated  to say the least 
Purveyors of market timing would like us to believe that this investment strategy is no longer relevant to the current uncertain environment 
Sentiment remains high  with many expecting the market s strong showing in 2017 to continue into the New Year and beyond  But many individual investors remain hesitant to get back in the fray  with memories of the last market crash making them question their long held beliefs  including the virtues of  buy   hold  strategies  This shows up in weak money flows into equity mutual funds  which have yet to fully reverse despite the market s strong recent gains 
But long term investing  particularly a  buy   hold  approach  remains as relevant today as it ever has been  And notwithstanding naysayers  claims to the contrary  empirical evidence continues to show the long term superiority of a  buy   hold  strategy over any other investing approach 
But to adequately benefit from this tested and proven strategy  investors need to guard against three major pitfalls  Here they are 
1   Buy   Hold  Doesn t Mean  Buy   Forget  
Staying engaged with your portfolio is a must  Investing for the long run doesn t mean that you lose sight of developments in your portfolio  The  buy   forget  mantra is a simplified take on the typically long holding horizons of investment icons such as Warren Buffett 
Buffett may be in the habit of keeping his investments for the long term  but he stays fully tuned into what s happening in each of his holdings  While the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha is no doubt one of the most successful and famous exponents of the  buy   hold  investing approach  he is by no means the only one  All of the successful practitioners of this approach stay well informed of what is going on with each of their holdings 
More      
                                                                                                      

From a universe of more than 4 000 stocks we handpick the 10 best of the best fundamentally sound stocks to buy and hold for the year  Investors who get in early will position their portfolios for outperformance 
Don t be left behind  Be among the first wave to see this coveted list when it s released on January 2 

                                                                                                      
2  Don t Fall for the  Buy What You Know  Mantra 
Guard against the simplistic beauty of the  buy what you know  mantra  another one of those skin deep lessons learned from Warren Buffett s investment style 
Adherents of this  philosophy  load up on stocks from a bunch of companies whose products they use  And then they keep those stocks forever  a la Buffett who has famously hung onto his investment holdings for years 
Being familiar with a company s product s  is a useful  but not necessary  starting point to  knowing  the stock as an investment opportunity  The decision to buy the company s stock should follow a thorough  due diligence process that gives you a solid appreciation of the company s prospects  competitive position and the proper value of its stock 
In fact  studies show that people have a crippling blind spot when it comes to stocks that they think they know  Too often they will overlook the negatives of the firm because they have fallen in love with the stock  Love is nice in your personal life  but there is no place for passion and emotions while evaluating stocks 
3  Stick With a Plan
Avoid haphazardly or randomly filling your portfolio with stocks you like  Always build your portfolio around an investment outlook and stay ready to make adjustments should that outlook change 
I am not suggesting that you need to have an elaborate and explicit outlook for GDP growth in the next quarter or year  but you absolutely need to have a base case sense for the economy and the market 
If you expect a major economic downturn in the coming 12   18 months  your choice of investments would be very different from someone looking forward to a goldilocks type scenario 
And you must stay nimble and flexible enough to adjust your positions should your outlook change 
Putting It All Together
Please keep each of these pitfalls in mind while putting together your stock portfolio to increase your odds of success  Note that we here at Zacks have been successfully managing an annual  buy   hold  portfolio for many years  We call it  a portfolio featuring 10 stocks I personally select and then actively monitor on your behalf  We are about to come out with Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 
We construct this portfolio by first taking a look at the economic and earnings outlook  Then we narrow in on the industries that we believe will outperform and stay away from the others  From there  we use our proprietary Zacks Rank system to help select the best stocks in those favorable groups  Since 1988  this stock rating tool has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year 
The New Year brings a host of challenges and opportunities for the investing public  But Zacks Top 10 members can rest assured that the stocks we have picked for 2018 fully take into account what lies ahead 
You re invited to be among the first investors to see Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 when they release on Tuesday  January 2  But please note  the best way to tap into this long term investing opportunity is to get in on the ground floor  These picks are time sensitive and the sooner you invest the more you figure to gain 

Happy Investing

198347,419863,ORCL,Oracle Corp  Shares Sell Off On Earnings Beat,opinion,"Oracle Corporation  NYSE  NYSE ORCL 
Oracle  the software behemoth and tech giant  reported their fiscal second quarter earnings for 2018 on Thursday December 14th  2017 after the market closed for trading  As soon as the news came out shares began to fall on heavy volume 
In the much anticipated earnings release  even though Oracle beat on the top and bottom line  it was their cloud related sales figures which missed estimates that sent the shares heading lower in the aftermarket session 
Shares which closed the day at  50 19  wound up closing down 6 63  or  3 33 at  46 86  The chart below illustrates how it now will have broken some key levels of support when it opens for trading in the morning 
The Numbers
Oracle reported earnings of  0 70 a share which beat the analysts estimates of 0 68 cents per share  They also blew out revenues estimates coming in at  9 62 billion vs  9 57 billion estimated by analysts 
One silver lining to the reaction and sell off of the shares in the after market  is that the company does pay a decent  of 1 57  annually 
Analysts Comments
Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian Write 

 We believe the new innovations announced at Oracle OpenWorld in early October can take Oracle s cloud portfolio to a whole new level  and we believe the stock can continue to move in an upward trajectory over the next year   

Patrick Walravens  an analyst at JMP Securities 

 They re late to that whole cloud battle  A lot of people already have a solution they are happy with  The question is what does Oracle bring the table

The above price chart shows the daily action going back a few months  The red oval area is where shares will likely open in the morning and that area is well below most recent support levels

198372,419888,ORCL,U S  stocks trade lower in an oil dominated session after OPEC inaction,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded lower in a session where all eyes were on oil and data revealed a firming labor market ahead of Friday s nonfarm payrolls  while financial markets reduced expectations for a summer rate hike from the Federal Reserve  Fed  
At 16 19GMT or 12 19ET  the Dow 30 lost 24 points  or 0 14   the S P 500 fell 4 points  or 0 20   while the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite traded down 10 points  or 0 20  
Oil was the star of Thursday s session as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  gathered for their biannual ordinary meeting in Vienna 
Not surprisingly  the oil cartel made no policy changes and came to no agreement to place a ceiling on oil production  However  crude initially  hit intraday lows on reports that members planned to take no action 
However  the U S  Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report on Thursday that crude oil inventories fell by 1 366 million barrels  contradicting the prior day s report from American Petroleum Institute s that saw a 2 35 million barrel build  Also of note  both gasoline inventories and distillate stockpiles fell much more than expected 
The data caused oil prices to turn around and U S  crude futures gained 0 47  to  49 24 by 16 22GMT  or 12 22ET  while Brent oil traded up 0 84  to  50 14 
On the economic front  both ADP jobs report for May and weekly jobless claims data came out essentially in line with expectations and showed a firming labor market that could tilt the Fed closer to an eventual tightening of monetary policy 
These last bits of data come before the Friday s U S  nonfarm payrolls report 
Still  financial markets slightly decreased expectations of a summer rate hike with bets for a June increase slipping to 19  and odds for July to 59  
Fed governors Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell spoke on the need to increase bank capital requirements for the U S  central bank s stress tests and avoided speaking on monetary policy

198376,419892,ORCL,Is Oracle Corporation  ORCL  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Oracle Corporation   NYSE ORCL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Oracle Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 7  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Oracle Corporation s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 15 3  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Oracle Corporation s P CF ratio of 17 1 is slightly lower than the industry average of 20 5  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Oracle Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ORCL a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 15 7  which is considerably better than the industry average of 24 2  Clearly  ORCL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Oracle Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives ORCL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter consensus estimate has not seen any earnings momentum in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Oracle Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineOracle Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 41  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-11-12,Zacks Investment

198426,419942,ORCL,Does Buffett Believe The Stock Market Crash ,opinion,"The entire market is waiting to see the looming crash in the US equity market  Lots of signs indicate the overbought condition  which is an indicator of possible recession 
One of the most watched indictors is P E  price to earning  ratio for overall market  Current S P 500 P E ratio is 24 33  meanwhile the Mean is 15 66 and the Median is 14 66  It means that the stock prices are overvalued  and this is far beyond from the historic average levels 
The next very popular indicator is Tobin s Q  This is calculated by dividing the value of the stock market by total corporate net worth  If the ratio is greater than the  0 7 mean  the market is in overbought condition  Today Tobin s Q is 1 038 which is another sign of overvaluation 
Billionaire Warren Buffett has often said that the ratio of market capitalization to gross domestic product  GDP  is a great measure of where valuations stand in the stock market  When the metric stands at greater than 100  of GDP  the Oracle  NYSE NYSE NYSE ORCL  of Omaha believes that investors should be wary about holding common stocks  since they may be overdue for a correction  Now US Total Market Capitalization is 131 7  of GDP  which is another signal of potential stock crash 
On the other hand  there are a lot of events which can stand as the headline for the possible sell off  The political disagreement between Republican party members and the president cast doubts whether the government would increase the debt ceiling or not  or if the tax reforms and tax cuts are realistic or not  There are also some foreign conflicts  which can be escalated into greater threats  such as US North Korean sharpening relationship 
The easing of Fed balance sheet  which is expected to be announced in the Fed September meeting can hurt the stock market as well  The increase of safe havens in the market can easily urge the riskier asset owners to sell their shares to buy safe Treasuries 
Last but not least  it would be very useful to explore the behavior of the most successful investor of the world during this uncertain period  In May when the  had accumulated 90 billion in cash  he mentioned that he hates the cash  and he said that they were searching an opportunity to make a large scale acquisition but they hadn t had anything on their radar then 
That meant that any huge purchase was coming in some months  meanwhile after the second quarter Berkshire Hathaway announced that it held about 100 billion dollars in cash 
Why is Berkshire Hathaway increasing Its cash stockpiles so rapidly  Many analysts try to find the answer to this question  but probably we need to pay attention mostly on the fact that the increase is coincided with the predicted sell off period in the stock market  So even the chairman of the greatest investing behemoth is cautious about the possible market slip 
 Therefore  we need to answer just one question here   Can we find any indicator that is more reliable that the reaction of the world s most successful investor  ",2017-08-28,Narek Zakaryan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-buffett-believe-the-stock-market-crash-200209840,200209840
198427,419943,ORCL,North Korea Warns Of Gift Packages For US  And Debt Ceiling Turmoil Sets ,opinion,"Yesterday  after the early rally on Globex  the S P 500 futures  ESU17 CME  traded up to 2471 40 just after the 8 30 futures open  From there  the ES dropped below the vwap  down to 2465 50  made a lower high at 2470 50  pulled back below the vwap again  and then rallied back up to 2471 00  The ES did not act all that great  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  was weak  and that seemed to be putting pressure on the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQU17 CME  
At 9 50 the ES sold off down to new lows at 2462 25  traded up a few handles  then got hit by a 10 30 CT sell program that pulled the futures down to 2460 75  During the next sell program  the ES traded down to 2453 50  rallied up to 2456 75  and then came crashing down to 2448 75 as North Korea warned the U S  of  gift packages   I find it amazing that the Chinese and Russians have not stepped in  but maybe they just want to sit back and watch  There was a story floating around that the reason the VIX rallied and the ES sold off wasn t just because of North Korea s gift package warning  but that some big Wall Street trading desks were passing around a  worst case  scenario analysis  A military confrontation with North Korea now appears almost inevitable should North Korea launch its ICBM 
The ES made its low for the day at 2445 50  at 12 15 CT  and by 1 45 had rallied all the way up to 2458 50  Going into 2 00  the MiM started to show over  400 million to buy  and the ES pulled back down to 2451 75 before rallying back up to 2455 50  Lets face it  the markets got spooked  and in came the sell programs  After making the high the ES sold back to 2453 75  just as the 2 45 cash imbalance came out showing  390 million to buy  and then started going back up heading into the 3 00 cash close  and then up to 2460 50 on the 3 15 futures close 
As hurricane Irma heads north  the big question is  will it hit south Florida or head to the west coast and inflict more damage to already water soaked New Orleans and Texas  It s a funny thing  some people do not believe in climate change or global warming  but when over 50 inches of rain falls in Texas  and two more hurricanes are on track to hit the U S   it s hard to believe that  something  isn t changing 
Entire ice shelves are cracking off  and the oceans are warming  I am not a weatherman  but you don t have to be see the effects  As Irma makes it way to Puerto Rico and Cuba  there is little doubt that it will hit Florida  The question is  how bad will it be  If you live in Florida  I suggest you turn off the weather channel  Do not keep looking at it  and start preparing  I am not saying not to keep up with the latest news  what I am saying is  do not look at it all day  It s time to start getting ready for what could be a terrible situation  The link above is from the Miami Herald  I sure hope things do not end up like it did 25 years ago

198442,419958,ORCL,The ECB s Guide To The Market  Oracle Of Delphi,opinion,"In June  the European Central Bank published a must read working paper entitled  Communication of monetary policy in unconventional times      We highly recommend this 46 page working paper for any serious investor  academic  student  or other person interested in interest rates and central bank driven monetary policy 
Eight coauthors and five additional contributors have collaborated to offer readers extensive analysis of central bankers  forward guidance  FG   They have produced evidence with statistical support and included coverage of major and diverse national central banks  not just the ECB  We believe their findings offer insights for every reader and can be particularly helpful to every central banker  everywhere 
The authors divide central banks  forward guidance  FG  into two forms  Delphic and Odyssean  Readers know the Delphic Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and the epic hero Odysseus from their studies of ancient Greek history and literature  but ECB s use of these terms in the context of central bank FG merits further explanation below  The authors then measure the results obtained by these two types of FG in terms of market based pricing references  think interest rates  
They dissect further into time dependency  short term  medium term  etc    For open ended time  the authors find little value in FG  The Fed may wish to take notice of weakening market dependency on their dot plots 
There is deep work done in the paper on state dependency and the  trade off between simplicity and accuracy   For example  the authors discuss the Fed s simplistic references to the unemployment rate and how that rate proves possibly misleading  such that the Fed may have had to  renege  
The reduction in the unemployment rate has actually resulted mostly from a falling labor participation rate  not from a robustly increasing percentage of the population being employed  Readers are invited to note that Bob Brusca s statistical information indicates that over 90  of the supposed improvement in the unemployment rate is attributable to the decline in labor participation  see     Were participation held constant since the financial crisis began 10 years ago  the unemployment rate today would be close to 9   not the present rate near 4 5  
Let s return to the authors  calling upon antiquity to characterize the two key types of forward guidance 
Delphic refers to the pronouncements or predictions of the famous Oracle at Delphi  For some history and an easy discussion of this subject  see
  Readers may note how pronouncements about the future  such as those proffered by the Oracle  are merely assertions or opinions  which may have some basis or not  Just as in antiquity  believers who follow opinions do so at their peril  That s true enough that central bankers would do well to take notice 
In contrast to the Oracle s prophecies  the epic adventure recounted in Homer s Odyssey represents an active  commitment  as to time and purpose as the epic hero Odysseus pits his wits and strength against all obstacles to reach his targeted goal  his home on Ithaca  his wife  and his son  The goal remains clear  and Homer s undaunted hero eventually achieves it  The lesson for central bankers is that markets will respect clarity in the data target  inflation  balance sheet size  employment statistic  if that target is articulated unambiguously  Central bankers  markets want to know where you are going  how you will measure your progress  and what your ETA is 
Buried in the ECB paper is thoughtful analysis of the events that occur when there is disagreement between central bankers and market agents  The authors find that different types of FG result in different market reactions  Any central banker worth her his salt is invited to study this section and reflect on the positive or negative outcomes of FG in which she he participated or voted 
We will close with a full quote of the paragraph about  removing monetary accommodation  

 The ECB has resorted to FG  which has evolved over time  and placed increasing emphasis on its state contingent nature  Following its meeting on 4 July 2013  the Governing Council of the ECB initially communicated that it  expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time   The expectation was based on the overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term  given the broad based weakness in the real economy and subdued monetary dynamics prevailing at that time  Following its meeting on 10 March 2016  and complementing the announcement of a comprehensive package of measures  including the expansion of the ECB s monthly asset purchases  the Governing Council clarified its qualitative FG on future policy rates  stating that it  expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time  and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases   Thus  a new interconnected element in the ECB s FG was introduced linking the future path of policy rates to the ECB s APP  which  at that time  was  intended to run until the end of March 2017  or beyond  if necessary  and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim   i e  was subject to a mix of time dependent and state dependent FG itself  Finally  a third leg of the ECB s FG has been introduced in December 2015  when it was announced that the principal payments on the securities purchased under the APP will be reinvested as they mature   for as long as necessary   constituting a case of open ended FG  

The eight dedicated professionals and their five additional colleagues who crafted the ECB paper have tackled a critically important subject and delivered valuable assistance to those of us whose role is to guide clients  portfolios during this extraordinary period of monetary policy evolution 
We applaud the brilliance exhibited in this working paper  We will leave it to serious readers to take the time needed to fully absorb this valuable research  Don t skip the appendices  as they cover major OECD countries and their respective national central banks 
At this moment we at Cumberland find value in certain bond market sectors  munis  for reasons my colleagues and I have written about  Similarly  we have selected stock markets and sectors using ETFs to capture opportunities 
We are not the Oracle of Delphi  Instead  we strive to be Odyssean  as we would wish central banks to be  and our choices of state dependencies are data driven and continuously reviewed  Our path  growth or income  resembles Odysseus s epic adventure in that events may intervene at any time  Thus our portfolio constructions may change

198453,419969,ORCL,Time In The Market  Or Is It Not Timing The Market  ,opinion,"There is a reason why Warren Buffett regarded market cap to GDP as   the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment   The reason  Its relationship with 10 year forward returns for stock prices  And right now  stock market capitalization as it relates to the U S  economy is projecting negative returns for U S  stock prices 

It is also true that Mr  Buffett has  in recent years  distanced himself from the valuation approach called the     Is it because he stopped believing that valuations matter  Probably not  In fact  the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha is holding onto more cash than at any other quarter in the last decade 

If market cap to GDP is no longer in Warren Buffett s good graces  do other valuation measures explain why he is holding onto record levels of cash in Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   BRK B   Hard to say  With the exception of tech bubble euphoria  U S  stocks have never been more expensive on price to sales ratios  P S   price to earnings ratios  P E   dividend yield or Tobin s Q 
Indeed  market cap to GDP merely confirms what Mr  Buffett knows to be true  The higher the price one pays  the lower one s return over time  Similarly  the lower the price one pays  the higher one s return over time 

 But Gary   you protest   Nobody can time the market  Even Warren Buffett thinks people should buy n hold  
In truth  Mr  Buffett is a market timer  He buys  sells  rebalances  increases his stakes  decreases his stakes and even completely divests from particular companies according to his discipline  He just does not think that others can time the market effectively 
Maybe he s right  Maybe they can t 
On the other hand   market timing  with nothing more than a 10 month simple moving average and the 10 year Treasury has outperformed buy n hold with less risk 
This is worth repeating  Market timing with the 10 month simple moving average has outperformed buy n hold over the last 90 years  It has done so on a head to head basis  And more importantly for risk managers  it has done so on a risk adjusted basis via standard deviation and the  

To the untrained eye  the head to head result for compounded growth might steal the spotlight  It shouldn t  The real payoff is that the trend following discipline minimizes portfolio volatility and reduces portfolio drawdown 
In other words  wouldn t you sleep better at night if the exposure you have to stocks does not suffer as much as the market might suffer in a bearish turn of events  Believe it or not  you could have avoided the bulk of stock market losses from the 2000 2002 tech bubble and the 2008 2009 financial collapse   Note  My counseling on how to lose less before the 2000  tech balloon  let me leave the firm that I had been working for to create my own  in the early 2000s   Equally compelling for risk managers  you could have sidestepped 1998 s Asia currency crisis as well as 2011 s Eurozone sovereign debt crisis 

Granted   trend following technique served up a few  whipsaws  in 1999 and 2004  No investing discipline is flawless  Yet even limiting one s exposure to equities throughout 2015 and during a chunk of 2016 proved more sensible than holding n hoping stocks would recover 
Trend following has always been a big part of how I have managed assets  Being mindful of the 200 day moving average  for example  played an important role in my advising others to lighten up on stocks prior the tech wreck in 2000 2002 and the subprime disaster in 2008 
In the opposite vein  it has played a large role in my maintaining at least a 50  allocation to stocks for my moderate growth n income client base  Granted  I lowered that allocation from 65  70  to 50  on a weakening economic backdrop  a shift in Fed monetary policy toward tightening as well as fundamental overvaluation hitting   Nevertheless  the technical picture is undeniably favorable such that  according to my discipline  50  equity exposure is still warranted 
The gods know  I have taken a great deal of heat from several anonymous content providers for a tactical asset allocation shift toward slightly less equity exposure  Even though my clients are primarily retirees and near retirees  Even though job growth as well as GDP has been slowing  Even though Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo   Company  GMO  researched 40 bubbles and discovered that asset prices reverted back to long term averages in EVERY  two standard deviation  occurrence  a k a   bubble    Even though a two sigma extreme exists right now  and it exists across nearly every valuation measure one can conjure up 
Like  sheeples   detractors consistently battle my observations on three fronts   a  market timing is  stupid    b  low rates justify endless price appreciation  and  c  current prices at record highs prove that different opinions are worthless  In this article  I demonstrated how market timing has been effective for disciplined trend followers  Meanwhile  in countless previous commentary  I demonstrated how  did not prevent four painful bear markets   49 1    23 3    40 4   and  23 2    And traditional valuation metrics in that period were HALF what they are today 
Do record highs for the primary benchmarks at this moment invalidate my opinions on managing risk  I will say it once more  the higher the price one pays for an investment today  the lower the long term future return  There are 150 years of data to back that up 
More critically  the massive amount of debt accumulation does little more than rob future investment gains to bring them into the present  The future is certain to see a reversion toward economic growth itself 

Perhaps obviously  there are a number of ways that asset prices and GDP can get back in sync  Stocks could grow at a slower pace than GDP  allowing GDP to  catch up  over a long period of time  Or stocks could stagnate for many years without a big downturn while GDP chugs along 
More likely  however  stock prices would have to fall somewhat precipitously to come into contact with GDP growth  And if there s a recession with GDP data  that would imply a more dramatic fall for stock prices to realign with the long term GDP trend 
I am not saying that everything in the world must go to pieces or that a crash is inevitable  A bear market is inevitable  but a crash is not 
I am saying that people are taking far too much risk in relation to their reward prospects  That may work for awhile  That may appear beneficial for months or a few more years  Still  a running tally of political dysfunction  peak credit slowdown in bank lending  terrible fundamentals  slowing economic trends across job growth and GDP and the possibility of central bank tightening do not scream   Buy  buy  buy  
What does tell one to buy more  Or at least hold onto what they ve got  Favorable technicals  As long as those remain  it is likely that I will remain committed to a 50  stock allocation  25  investment grade income allocation and a 25  cash equivalent allocation  Some of those cash equivalents yield near 1 5  right now 
What might cause me to reduce stock exposure further  If the S P 500 fell below its 200 day MA and or 10 month SMA  In the same vein  a breakdown in market internals such as the NYSE Advance Decline Line  NYAD  would require my attention

198464,419980,ORCL,CEOs Earned Billions More Than Disclosed After Crisis,news,"By   

Top U S  executives have received billions more in compensation than previously reported  a Reuters analysis shows  Though company filings originally had a group of around 300 CEOs pulling in a combined  16 billion between 2009 and 2013  bull markets have pushed that total to  22 billion 
Every year  publicly traded companies are required to report how much their executives receive in base pay  bonuses and company shares  These filings generally calculate stock options at then current stock prices  But as share values rise  the overall compensation from previous years balloons  The calculations do not include pensions and perks such as corporate jets 
As a result  CEOs have earned far more than initially reported    about 38 percent more  according to Reuters  Over the same period  median wages for American workers increased just 6 7 percent  The 331 fold difference in income between CEOs and the average worker in 2013  as reported by the AFL CIO  likely underestimates the real gap 
The discrepancy between the executive pay that companies disclose and how much CEOs actually end up taking home highlights the increasingly important role of stock based pay in executive portfolios  Even when CEOs underwhelm in their performance  galloping markets can boost their overall compensation 
The highest paid CEO  John Martin of the biotechnology firm Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   netted  400 million between 2009 and 2013  far more than the  75 million the company had originally estimated  Gilead s soaring share prices account for the difference 
Some company leaders weren t lifted by the rising tide  however  Jeff Immelt of General Electric and Larry Ellison of Oracle  NYSE ORCL  both made less than originally reported  due to stock price underperformance and slow profit growth  respectively 
On one hand  the  6 billion discrepancy in executive pay reflects good news  The stock market roared ahead in the years after the crisis  benefiting not just titans of industry but public sector workers invested in pension funds and anyone with a 401 k  
Less than half of Americans  however  actually own stock  either directly or indirectly  The market exuberance that has inflated CEO pay beyond corporate expectations in the past five years hasn t yet touched millions of ordinary Americans ",2015-03-25,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ceos-earned-billions-more-than-disclosed-after-crisis-334125,334125

198493,420009,ORCL,Oracle Sues Oregon Over Botched Health Exchange,news,"By    Just as Oregon attorneys were preparing to sue Oracle Corp  NYSE ORCL over the state s faulty Obamacare exchange  the tech giant fired the first shot  In a federal complaint this week  the company alleged a breach of contract and accused Gov  John Kitzhaber of leading a  smear campaign  against it 
The state hired Oracle in 2011 to develop the Web portal for Cover Oregon  the place where Oregonians could browse and shop for health insurance plans under the Obama administration s Affordable Care Act  But last year  when open enrollment began on Oct  1  the site flopped  It never went live  and residents had to file paper applications to apply for health insurance subsidies  the Los Angeles Times noted Saturday 
After plenty of public finger pointing  Cover Oregon officials decided in April to abandon the insurance portal  despite spending  248 million on it  and instead transitioned to the federal system  In May  Kitzhaber publicly urged the state s attorney general to sue Oracle 
In Oracle s 21 page lawsuit  the company contends that Cover Oregon privately sought Oracle s help in the early months of this year while publicly slandering the tech firm  Oracle s legal complaint points out First Data  a company hired by Oregon to analyze what went wrong with the insurance portal   attributed a large part of the problems to Cover Oregon s mismanagement of the project   The Oregonian reported 
 While flogging Oracle publicly  Cover Oregon continued privately to ask for Oracle s help   Indeed it continues to this day to seek Oracle s technical help with the project    the complaint said   Oracle gave that help for many months  in spite of the public excoriation  because it was committed to helping Cover Oregon complete the project and because Cover Oregon repeatedly promised to pay Oracle for its services  In the end  though  Cover Oregon reneged on its promises  thus prompting this lawsuit  

The complaint also claims Cover Oregon still owes Oracle  23 million under the original contract  In all  the company was paid about  130 million  The Oregonian said 
Cover Oregon did not respond to the Los Angeles  Times request for comment though Kitzhaber s office provided a statement 
 The governor is aware of the lawsuit and isn t surprised by it  the state fully expected to end up in litigation over Oracle s failure to deliver   Kitzhaber spokeswoman Melissa Navas said   The attorney general s office will review the complaint filed by Oracle and continue to pursue legal remedies on behalf of the state  ",2014-08-09,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/oracle-sues-oregon-over-botched-health-exchange-302360,302360

198495,420011,ORCL,With co CEOs  Oracle sets challenging course,news,"By Sarah McBride SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    By promoting its two presidents to serve as co chief executives instead of founder and CEO Larry Ellison  database and software behemoth Oracle  N ORCL  is setting itself a course that has confounded other big companies 
The move seemingly marries the product oversight of Mark Hurd  former chief executive of Hewlett Packard  with the legal and financial expertise of Safra Catz  a 15 year Oracle veteran 
With Ellison remaining executive chairman and in a position to call the final shots  the company may be able to avoid some of the challenges that have mired other co CEOs  who often end up in an unhappy  two s a crowd  situation  analysts say 
At Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia  for example  Wenda Harris Millard was supposed to oversee media  while co CEO Robin Marino held responsibility for marketing  That lasted just 10 months  with Millard quitting in early 2009 after frequent clashes with Marino and company founder Stewart 
At Citigroup  a co CEO arrangement between John Reed and Sandy Weill  two strong personalities who publicly jousted  fell apart when Reed left in 2000 
 Co CEO structures are typically not ideal   said Bill Kreher  an analyst at Edward Jones  who says most companies need the decisiveness that a single strong willed leader offers 
But at Oracle  because the duo has already worked together for years   we don t see the day to day changing   Kreher said 
Catz  trained in finance and law  was a Wall Street banker from 1986 until she joined Oracle in 1999 and has been a central figure in Oracle s many acquisitions  Sales oriented Hurd spent 25 years at computer and ATM pioneer NCR Corp before joining Hewlett Packard  where he was CEO from 2005 until 2010 
Still  many analysts believe a single CEO will eventually replace Ellison  be it Catz  Hurd  or perhaps another executive such as Oracle software head Thomas Kurian 
Reverting to a single CEO would bring Oracle in line with other software companies that have tried the dual track but subsequently abandoned it 
Enterprise software company Workday said in May that co founder and co CEO David Duffield would step down as co CEO  leaving the role to Aneel Bhusri  Also in May  German software giant SAP  a key competitor of Oracle  ended a co CEO arrangement when Jim Hagemann Snabe stepped down 
 It has to be executed right  and you have to have the right working relationship to make it work   Derrick Wood  an analyst at Susquehanna  said of the dual CEO track 
Cases where it succeeds often include a founder who acts as the visionary alongside a co CEO who serves as the operations head  such as at retailer Whole Foods Market and fast food restaurant Chipotle Mexican Grill  That almost fits the situation at Oracle  except operations will be run by two people 
Having three  including Ellison  at the top makes Oracle analogous to Korea s Samsung Electronics  Last year  Samsung gave consumer electronics head Yoon Boo Keun and mobile chief J K  Shiin co CEO titles  joining existing CEO Kwon Oh hyun 
The co CEO arrangement is more common in Europe  notes Harvard Business School professor emeritus Joseph Bower  Deutsche Bank and its co CEOs Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen are a prominent example 
 The downside in terms of confusion is obvious   said Bower  But  if they work well together  essentially you ve vastly expanded the bandwidth of the CEO

 Perhaps he did not feel comfortable in the role as a front man  although he does do a solid job in his presentations   said Bill Kreher  an analyst at Edward Jones   He s a few years younger  than Catz and Hurd   so perhaps his time will come      Additional reporting by Sarah McBride in San Francisco and Bill Rigby in Seattle  Editing by Ken Wills ",2014-09-19,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/when-music-stops-for-oracle-ceo-dance,-catz-may-grab-ellison's-chair-:-analysts-310169",310169

198503,420019,ORCL,Another Forecasting Lesson After The UK s Surprising Election,opinion,"UK Prime Minister Theresa May s gamble to call an early general election has backfired  dealing Britain an unexpected outcome that s dealt another blow to the so called experts who anticipated that the Conservatives would gain seats in Parliament  Instead  the electorate confounded the polls and forecasting models and delivered a major setback to May s government  Once again  there are lessons to be learned about the hazards of forecasting  although assuming that all efforts at diving the future are wrong isn t one of them 
If every prediction is reliably wrong  managing risk would be easy since dependably wrong is effectively the equivalent of dependably right  Imagine that a stock market seer issued a new forecast every Saturday for the week ahead  Further  assume that this forecast always got it wrong  Whenever Mr  Oracle ORCL told you the market would rise in the following week  it fell  and vice versa  Embarrassing for the analyst  but a gold mine for everyone else 
If you knew in advance that a given forecast was destined to be wrong  you would simply take the opposite side of the trade  Mr  Oracle tells you to buy  That s a signal to sell  The next time he predicts that the market will slide  it s time to buy 
Forecasts are equally valuable if they re reliably wrong or right  In reality  of course  forecasting   like the world around us   is messy  Forecasts can be wrong   spectacularly so in some instances  But assuming that forecasts are always wrong is no less dangerous than assuming that every forecast is right 
Instead  there s a gray area in the dark art science of prognosticating  Many if not most forecasts are worthless  but some forecasts are better than others  But even the failed forecasts may turn out be useful  Indeed  some investors have successfully turned forecasts and theories upside down in a bid to exploit the stock market in surprising ways 
Perhaps the most famous example is bound up with the risk metric known as beta  which is a core component of the capital asset pricing model  CAPM   Initially  it was widely assumed that beta was a reliable predictor of return  stocks with higher betas are expected to have higher returns  But in the 1970s  researchers began to find evidence that beta wasn t a reliable predictor after all   the slope of the line between risk and return tended to be flatter than expected  which is to say that higher betas don t necessarily lead to higher returns  or at least not as high as CAPM predicts 
Some researchers soon decided that CAPM was worthless  beta in particular  But Fisher Black famously observed in  Beta and Return   a 1993 essay in The Journal of Portfolio Management  that  Beta is a valuable investment tool if the line is as steep as CAPM predicts  It is even more valuable if the line is flat  
Fast forward a quarter century and we find that investing in low volatility stock   a k a  low beta stocks   is all the rage  ETFdb com lists dozens of low beta ETFs in existence  holding billions of dollars under management  The underlying logic is the assumption that CAPM is wrong and that low beta stocks outperform high beta stocks   with less volatility 
Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner  in their book Superforecasting  The Art and Science of Prediction  lay out the evidence for why you should be wary of forecasts  But they also advise against dismissing all forecasting as hogwash   an extreme view that isn t especially wise or productive  The authors report that a careful study of predictions through the years shows that  foresight is real   It s not common and in some cases the insight comes from surprising sources  The larger point is that if you have a small edge it can make a big difference 

Foresight isn t a mysterious gift bestowed at birth  It is the product of particular ways of thinking  of gathering information  of updating beliefs  These habits of thought can be learned and cultivated by any intelligent  thoughtful  determined person  And never forget that even modest improvements in foresight maintained over time add up  I spoke about that with Aaron Brown  an author  a Wall Street veteran  and the chief risk manager at AQR Capital Management  a hedge fund with over  100 billion in assets   It s so hard to see because it s not dramatic   he said  but if it is sustained  it s the difference between a consistent winner who s making a living  or the guy who s going broke all the time   A world class poker player we will meet soon could not agree more  The difference between heavyweights and amateurs  she said  is that the heavyweights know the difference between a 60 40 bet and a 40 60 bet  

Forecasts aren t always right  but they re not always wrong either  The challenge is separating the wheat from the chaff  which starts by recognizing that demonizing all forecasts as worthless is the intellectual equivalent of arguing that all forecasts are right  As usual  the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes ",2017-06-09,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/another-forecasting-lesson-after-the-uk’s-surprising-election-200194214,200194214

  Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank climb on merger talks
  Mitsubishi Electric jumps on report of solar plans
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  June 25  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average rose
1 6 percent on Thursday  with Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank
rallying on news that they were in merger talks and tech shares
tracking their U S  peers higher 
 Mitsubishi Electric Corp surged 7 2 percent after the Nikkei
business daily said the company plans to build plants in the
United States and Europe to assemble solar power generation
systems using solar panels shipped from Japan 
  Shares such as Tokyo Electron rose after their U S  tech
peers drew strength in the wake of stronger than expected
quarterly results from software maker Oracle Corp 
 The U S  Federal Reserve kept interest rates at nearly zero
as widely expected on Wednesday  and gave no hint on an imminent
exit from bold policy easing 
 There were no major surprises from the Fed s policy meeting 
said Nagayuki Yamagishi  strategist for Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities 
But the conclusion of the event removed an element of
uncertainty  helping to spur some short covering in Tokyo shares 
Yamagishi said 
 Investors had been keenly awaiting the Fed s policy
statement  nervous about the risk that the Fed could hint at
interest rate hikes 
 The Nikkei rose 151 55 points to 9741 87  edging up above its
25 day moving average  which now lies right around  9 700 
 The 25 day moving average is a closely watched technical
level among Japanese equities traders  and had acted as support
for the Nikkei over the course of its three month rally since
March 
 But the Nikkei had fallen below the average earlier this
week  turning it into a resistance level 
 The broader Topix rose 1 5 percent to 916 34 
 Mitsubishi Corp and other trading houses gained after prices
of metals climbed overnight  with copper rising 3 percent after
U S  durable goods orders for May were better than expected 
raising hopes the U S  economy may be on the mend 
 Mitsubishi Corp gained 4 1 percent to 1 811 yen and Mitsui  
Co rose 4 0 percent to 1 159 yen 
 Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank  hurt by soured investments and
exposure to subprime loans  said on Thursday they are in talks to
merge  in a deal that would create Japan s sixth largest bank 
 It was the first time the two money losing lenders have
confirmed the talks  after sources told Reuters last month that
the banks were discussing a merger 
 Aozora Bank climbed 5 8 percent to 147 yen and Shinsei Bank

   U S  Treasuries extend losses as Fed keeps purchases

  Repeats to more subscribers without changes in text 
 By Eric Burroughs
 HONG KONG  June 25  Reuters    Asian stocks rallied for a
second day on Thursday after the Federal Reserve reinforced
that interest rates will be kept at a record low for a while 
but Treasuries extended losses as the Fed shied away from
boosting its debt purchases 
 The Fed left interest rates near zero percent but tweaked
its statement to say that financial markets had improved and
signalled less concern about deflation  even while repeating
the economy will remain weak   ID nN24163547 
 But the Fed did nothing to ramp up its hefty buying of U S 
Treasuries and mortgage related bonds  disappointing some
market players hoping for more action to stem the jump in
Treasury yields that has threatened the economy s recovery 
 The dollar gave up some of its gains scored on relief the
Fed was not doing more to monetise debt  surrendering some
ground to higher yielding currencies  such as the Australian
dollar  on the rise in stocks 
  There was little surprise in both the Federal Open Market
Committee s comments and in its rate decision  and it comes as
a relief as it removes uncertainties   said Lee Sun yeop  a
market analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities in Seoul 
 Merger activity in Asia also gave a boost to shares 
 Sinopec  0386 HK   600028 SS   China s largest oil refiner 
agreed to buy Swiss oil explorer Addax Petroleum Corp for  7 24
billion in what would be China s biggest overseas acquisition 
Sinopec s Hong Kong listed shares trimmed initial gains but
were up 0 4 percent   ID nBNG477261 
 In Japan  shares of Aozora Bank  8304 T  and Shinsei Bank
 8303 T  both jumped on news they were in merger talks  Japan s
Nikkei average  climbed 1 6 percent   ID nT239838 
 Asia s technology shares were lifted by gains in the U S 
Nasdaq the previous day after software maker Oracle Corp
 posted better than expected quarterly results 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
 rose 1 percent  pulling further away from a
one month low struck earlier in the week 
 Technology  material and financial shares posted the
biggest gains by sector 
 TREASURIES FALL
 U S  Treasuries fell further after the Fed refrained from
increasing its  300 billion of purchases that it had announced
in March and is poised to complete in the next few months 
 Benchmark 10 year notes  shed 4 32 in price to
yield 3 703 percent  up a basis point from late U S  trade and
about 8 basis points higher in the past two days 
 The drop in Treasuries hurt government bonds across the
board  The benchmark 10 year Japanese yield 
edged up half a basis point to 1 385 percent  but had touched a
three month low of 1 375 percent at one point 
 The dollar slipped in Asia  But it climbed on Wednesday
after the Fed stood pat on its debt buying  even as the
European Central Bank conducted a record one year funding
operation of 442 billion euros to help spur bank lending 
 ID nLO80921 
 The dollar index  a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies  slipped 0 1 percent to 80 456  
 Against the yen  the dollar edged up 0 4 percent to 96 10
yen   The euro was up 0 2 percent at  1 3960  
 The dollar showed little reaction to comments from a
Chinese Communist Party researcher that China should buy more
gold because the U S  currency is poised for a fall and the
metal is needed to support a greater international role for the
yuan   ID nPEK31815 
 Gold was up  4 an ounce at  935   while U S  crude
oil dipped 7 cents to  68 60 a barrel

   Oracle failed to win U S  fast track approval in June
   Oracle lawyer has said expects deal to close by Aug  31
 
   Adds background 
 By Foo Yun Chee
 BRUSSELS  July 3  Reuters    Oracle Corp s plan to buy
computer maker Sun Microsystems will be notified to European
Union antitrust authorities this month  a source familiar with
the deal said on Friday 
 Oracle  the world s No  3 software maker  announced in April
a  7 billion deal to buy Sun  the world s fourth largest maker
of server computers and also the developer of Java and Solaris
software  
  The deal will be notified to the European Commission this
month   the source told Reuters 
 Oracle failed last month to win fast track approval from
U S  antitrust regulators  who wanted more information on Java
licensing rights 
  Information on Java licensing rights will be included in
the EU notification   the source said 
 Sun s Java software is one of the world s most widely used
computer languages  Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has said he wants
to tweak Java software so that it is easier to use on
smartphones and netbook computers 
 A lawyer for Oracle said last month he expected the company
soon to win U S  antitrust approval and to close its purchase of
Sun by Aug  31 
 The European Commission  which monitors mergers and
takeovers in the 27 country European Union  has 25 working days
to review such plans in the first phase  This can be extended to
90 working days if an in depth investigation is required 
 It can either approve the deal as it stands  order
modifications  or block the transaction 
 Antitrust experts have said they saw no serious antitrust
objections to the deal as there was little overlap in the
companies  products  
 The Commission cleared Oracle s takeover of software rival
PeopleSoft in 2004  The U S  Justice Department had sought to
block the purchase but the move was rejected by a U S  District
Court

 PARIS  Sept 17  Reuters    European stocks were up 0 6
percent around midday on Thursday  trading at 11 month highs
with banks such as UBS pacing the gains  driven by mounting
optimism over a quick global economic recovery 
 But the gains were limited by weaker than expected quarterly
software sales from U S  firm Oracle Corp  which dragged down
tech shares such as Germany s SAP and France s Dassault Systemes
 1 7 percent and 3 2 percent respectively 
 At 1110 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0 6 percent at 1 011 67 points  rising for the
ninth time in 10 sessions 
 The benchmark index  which is up 22 percent so far this
year  has jumped 57 percent since hitting a record low last
March  It is on track to record a 19 percent gain for the
quarter  which would be the index s strongest quarterly
performance in almost a decade  but is still down 38 percent
from a near seven year high touched in mid 2007 
  We ve seen panic selling last winter  now we re seeing
panic buying  Investors who have been  underweight  on equities
now worry about missing the big rally   said Jean Marie
Mercadal  CIO of OFI Asset Management  in Paris 
  But the easy part of the rebound is done  Stocks still have
room to grow  probably 20 percent over the next six months  but
it s not going to be automatic  People will have to do stock
picking  
 Banks    which have shot up 174 percent since early March

 NEW YORK  June 24  Reuters    U S  stock index futures
pointed to a higher open on Wednesday with the Federal Reserve
expected to soothe recent concerns that it could hike interest
rates later this year as the economy shows signs of
stabilizing 
 At the end of its two day meeting  the Fed is widely
expected by economists to leave the benchmark federal funds
rate at almost zero and emphasize it will stay in this range
for some time 
 Investors will watch for any economic outlook from the
central bank and changes in its  300 billion program of
Treasury purchases  though the Fed is not expected to ramp up
asset purchases  A Fed statement is due at 2 15 p m  EDT 
  We know they re not going to do anything on changing
interest rates  so it s a matter of their statement and how
bullish they are in terms of the economy and whether they say
anything about increasing purchases of Treasuries and
mortgaged backed securities   said Paul Mendelsohn  chief
investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte  Vermont 
 Before the Fed s statement  investors will take in reports
on durable goods orders and new home sales  both for May

 Adding to optimism about the prospects of a budding
recovery  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said the economic outlook has improved for the
first time in two years 
 However  soaring unemployment and ballooning budget
deficits could knock a weak recovery off track  the group said 
referring to its 30 member countries 
 Highlighting the inherent difficulty of predicting a
turnaround  the World Bank earlier this week said prospects for
the global economy remained  unusually uncertain  and cut its

 TOKYO  June 25  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average rose
1 3 percent on Thursday  with Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank
rallying on news that they were in merger talks and tech shares
tracking their U S  peers higher 
 Mitsubishi Electric Corp climbed 6 5 percent to 606 yen after
the Nikkei business daily said the company plans to build plants
in the United States and Europe to assemble solar power
generation systems using solar panels shipped from Japan 
 Shares such as Tokyo Electron rose after their U S  tech
peers drew strength in the wake of stronger than expected
quarterly results from software maker Oracle Corp

removed a element of uncertainty that was likely helping to spur
some short covering in the Nikkei  which had slid 2 8 percent two
days ago  said Nagayuki Yamagishi  strategist for Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities 
 Investors had been keenly awaiting the Fed s policy
statement  and had been nervous about the risk that the Fed could
hint at interest rate hikes

 The broader Topix rose 1 1 percent to 912 00 
 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates at
nearly zero  and gave no hint on an imminent exit from bold
policy easing 
 The Fed also stuck to its huge programme of buying government

recession was easing 
 Aozora Bank and Shinsei Bank  hurt by soured investments and
exposure to subprime loans  said on Thursday they are in talks to
merge  in a deal that would create Japan s sixth largest bank 
 It was the first time the two money losing lenders have
confirmed the talks  after sources told Reuters last month that
the banks were discussing a merger 
 Aozora Bank climbed 5 0 percent to 146 yen and Shinsei Bank

198552,420068,ORCL,March Madness And Investing,opinion," I had a buddy who picked a perfect bracket two years in a row  He went back and looked at the players  high school stats and everything  
I was on a college trip with our investing club with that guy  You know the kind  the dreaded  One Upper  
   If you had a friend who got a perfect score on a college entrance exam  Mr  One Upper had done it himself   in middle school 
   If you went on a helicopter ride on a family trip to Hawaii  his uncle had invented the helicopter   and then used it to discover Hawaii 
   And as I had just found out  if you had once correctly picked 15 of the first 16 games of the NCAA basketball tournament  he had a buddy who put your  accomplishment  to shame 
He was  of course  either lying or badly misinformed  But his assertion gets at the most fundamental reason that its possible  though far from easy  for some traders and investors to earn market beating returns 
For those who are not familiar  the NCAA college basketball tournament  colloquially dubbed  March Madness   has resumed its annual tradition of taking over the computer screens and attentions spans of Americans  According to a  the act of filling out the brackets  checking scores  watching the games at work costs US employers upward of  4 Billion in lost productivity each year 
And if you ve ever created your own bracket  you know that there s one emotion that quickly comes to dominate all others  regret  If only you had done a bit more research into the free throw shooting percentages of that team or the propensity for this team to struggle against zone defense  then you would have seen that upset coming 
And it s a fool s errand  At some point  the relationship between the sophistication of your analysis and the likelihood of success breaks down  The role of luck and randomness takes over 
The world s most renowned investor  Warren Buffett  famously offered a cool  1B to anyone who filled out a perfect bracket  The oft cited odds of correctly picking 63 consecutive games is 1 in 9 200 000 000 000 000 000  though  that the actual odds are  only  1 in about 1 500 000 000 most years  The point is that  even if you deeply researched the players  high school stats  as Mr  One Upper s friend ostensibly did  there are too many random variables to correctly predict every game   much less to do it consecutively 
The best you can hope for is a bracket that identifies potentially vulnerable favorites  underseeded upsets and correctly selects the champion  This is the same exact type of attitude that you should adopt with your trading  With all the economic  political  and technical crosscurrents that buffet the market every day  it s impossible to design a trading or investing strategy that wins 100  of its trades   even if you research the CEO s high school math grades 
James O Shaughnessy  who quite literally wrote the book on investing strategy  What Works on Wall Street   recently opined on a similar topic  He studied the historic probability of Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   which we know in hindsight has been one of the greatest stocks of all time  outperforming the overall stock market over different time periods 

Source  O Shaughnessy Asset Management
Obviously  Buffett s track record is stellar  but even  The Oracle  of Omaha  has had a greater than 1 in four shot of underperforming the overall stock market in any given year  Indeed  Berkshire has trailed the stock market over a five year basis nearly 10  of the time 
Imagine where you were five years ago  Now imagine that your favorite investment had underperformed a simple  stupid S P 500 index fund over those last five years  Would you have the confidence and temerity to stick with that investment  Or would you start to wonder whether The Oracle had lost his touch  Chances are many of Buffett s  long term  investors jumped ship during these periods of underperformance  which was in hindsight  one of the worst things they could do 
Don t fall into Mr  One Upper s trap of thinking you can pick the perfect bracket or the perfect trading investing strategy  The best you can hope for is a consistent process that identifies higher probability outcomes for your timeframe  limits risk in the  inevitable  event that the market moves against you  and the discipline to stick to your strategy even when it temporarily underperforms  
We might not have quite as long of a track record as Warren Buffett  but that s exactly what we at Faraday Research have been doing for years   just don t ask us for help with your bracket ",2017-03-17,Matthew Weller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-biggest-lesson-march-madness-can-teach-us-about-trading-and-investin-200179309,200179309
198559,420075,ORCL,Bull Market s Health Depends More On Congress Than Trump,opinion,"In a bull market  many investors come to believe that risk is synonymous with reward   You ve got to be in it to win it  or  If you don t take chances  your wallet will forever remain empty  
In a bear market  the truth about risk is revealed  Specifically  steep financial losses are neither rewarding nor easily recovered  The average descent  30   And the average time to recover  Approximately three and one quarter years 
So  if an average bearish downtrend occurred right now  the S P 500 would trade in and around the 1670 level  the Dow would trade near 14 700   Note  The last two bear markets produced 50  price declines  If recent history came to pass  the S P 500 would trade near 1200 and the Dow would trade near 10 500  

All things considered  watching one s portfolio revert to a value last seen in October of 2013 might not be so bad  The buy n holder with  500 000 who insisted he she would keep the all stock portfolio through thin and thick would still have  350 000  And  based on the averages  it would only take until June of 2020 to get back to the  500 000 break even point 

On the flip side  might there be a different approach to managing the real risk of financial loss during one of the most overvalued stock markets ever  If one avoids over committing to stocks when the asset class resides at exorbitant valuations as well as all time price peaks  either by trimming positions to raise cash or pocketing cash from outside resources  might one be better situated for buying bargains  Indeed  where one begins his her ownership journey ultimately determines the total return outcome 
For example  based on the cyclically adjusted P E ratio  a k a   PE10  or  CAPE    forward 20 year annual stock returns are odious  Robert Shiller s data dating back to 1870 find that buying and holding for the next 20 years might only offer 0  1  annualized gains 

Keep in mind  these sub par results are nominal  There are zero instances where investors experienced inflation adjusted gains over 20 years  going back to 1870  when the PE10 surpassed 22  We are currently sitting at a PE10 of 29 
Shiller s PE10  CAPE  has its detractors  Yet  12 14 other widely regarded valuation measures regard current stock prices as the 1st  2nd or 3rd most elevated in history  Only the infamous crash in 1929 and dot com mania in 2000 serve as competition 
Valuation naysayers are doing everything in their power to explain why this time is different  Even Warren Buffett downplayed his comments from 2001 on the importance of market cap to GDP as a valuation methodology   Note  Market capitalization to GDP  often called the  Buffett Indicator   places February of 2017 as the 2nd priciest on record   What s more  the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha recently claimed that ultra low interest rates put 2017 stocks on the  cheaper side  
I wish this were true  In the two decade span between 1935 and 1954  however  investors enjoyed similar ultra low interest rates  Yet valuations were one quarter to one half more reasonable in those two decades than they are here in 2017  Additionally  between 1935 and 1954  stocks still experienced four bear markets   1937 1938   49    1938 1939   23    1939 1942   40    1946 1947   23   
Yet this time is different  right 
Maybe not  The current equity risk premium  ERP    the excess return for investing in stocks over risk free ultra low yielding treasuries   is a frighteningly skimpy 1 55    This takes into account the GAAP E P at 4 0  and the 10 year yield at 2 45    Stocks tend to perform far better in periods when the ERP is greater than 3 0   By way of comparison  an investor s equity risk premium for choosing stocks over the risk free rate of 10 year U S  treasuries was closer to 4 5  in 2010 
Entering 2000  the financial media  analysts and gurus completely disregarded traditional valuation measures for stocks because we were living in a  New Economy   Internet stocks were unique and the investing public needed to value them differently in the 21st century  That proved to be a monstrous mistake for hold n hopers of NASDAQ darlings  Entering 2008  the financial media  analysts and gurus showed disgust for traditional real estate valuation because the asset class had never gone down in value on a national basis  That too proved to be a monumental misstep with respect to understanding bubbles 
Here in 2017  the rationale for buying more stocks right now goes something like this   1  Stable  low interest rates cannot be beat   2  Even if rates should gradually move higher  President Trump s fiscal stimulus  e g   tax cuts  defense spending  infrastructure improvement  etc   will make up for any borrowing cost challenges   3  Even if Trump s plans fall short  the Federal Reserve will do whatever is necessary to support stock prices  preserve the wealth effect  and guard against a severe sell off 
So  then  what could possibly go wrong 
For starters  ultra cheap borrowing costs that do not continuously move lower eventually meet the law of diminishing returns  According to the National Association of Realtors  record high home prices and slightly higher mortgage rates here in 2017 are keeping potential home buyers on the sidelines  as pending home sales dropped to the lowest level in a year  down 2 8    Equally worthy of note  the S P 500 made no progress for nearly two years between mid December of 2014  when the Fed s last asset purchase from  QE3  settled  and early November of 2016  Borrowing costs remained subdued throughout the period with the 10 year yield between 1 5  2 5   yet the mere possibility of Federal Reserve tightening gave investors fits and starts 

Perhaps obviously  stable interest rates  even those that remain historically low  had been meeting resistance  Then came the wild card    President Trump  From the first day of trading after the election to the last day of trading in February  the S P 500 has closed every session above its 50 day moving average  The 14  plus surge has been utterly jaw dropping 

Fortunately or unfortunately  presidents have far less control over an economy than people think  The power to spend  Congress  The power to cut taxes  Congress  The notion that Republicans in Congress will agree with one another across the board  let alone agree with President Trump on everything from a debt ceiling increase by mid March to a domestic infrastructure overhaul to a comprehensive tax revamping  is far fetched 
Should an investor simply rely on faith  Even when interest rate stimulus meets the law of diminishing returns  Even when expectations for massive fiscal stimulus from Congress Trump is overdone  Historically  faith in ever increasing asset prices  e g   stocks  real estate  etc   during periods of valuation extremes has been misguided as well as financially devastating 
Bulls are betting that any and all pullbacks will continue to be buying opportunities  They re betting on the Federal Reserve to act as a backstop should Congress Trump fail to launch an economic mega boom  Indeed  if the Fed aborts its pledge to hike overnight lending rates three times in 2017   buy the dip  may work swimmingly 
On the flip side  there s no way around nearly 150 years of data  Extreme stock valuations imply paltry forward returns  While the Fed could create more electronic money to buy bonds and other assets   revise quantitative easing activity to preserve the wealth effect that the institution stoked   central bank voting members are unlikely to act aggressively in the absence of a bearish  20   downturn 
It follows that exercising some restraint in the face of injudicious exhilaration is warranted  Even with the Federal Reserve acting as a  backstop   extraordinary confidence in Congress Trump could shift unexpectedly  particularly when asset valuations push extremes  I continue to hold as much as 25  of my moderate growth and income client portfolios in cash equivalents ",2017-03-01,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-market’s-health-depends-more-on-congress-than-trump-200177464,200177464
198560,420076,ORCL,Why Warren Buffett Is So Reluctant To Call Stocks A  Bubble ,opinion,"I can only imagine what it might be like to be Warren Buffett  When your every word moves the global financial markets you carry tremendous responsibility  Few carry greater weight in this regard than the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha 
This must be why he has mellowed in recent years  As his popularity has grown  witness the rise in attendance at the Woodstock for Capitalists  along with his influence on investors and markets  his rhetoric has softened 
For example  in 2001 he wrote for  

On a macro basis  quantification doesn t have to be complicated at all  Below is a chart  starting almost 80 years ago and really quite fundamental in what it says  The chart shows the market value of all publicly traded securities as a percentage of the country s business that is  as a percentage of GNP  The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know  Still  it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment  And as you can see  nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level  That should have been a very strong warning signal 

Today  this measure is very nearly as high as it was at the peak of the dotcom mania  So you would think that this would naturally serve  in the words of Mr  Buffett  as yet another  very strong warning signal  

What you need to know about Mr  Buffett  though  is that he was eager to share this warning signal with investors only well after stocks had peaked  In fact  the Nasdaq Composite had already crashed by more than 70  before the words above were published 
It s true that he did make an  in Fortune but both articles were the products of the enterprising  or kindhearted   I ll let you choose  reporter Carol Loomis who learned of Buffett s private worries about the stock market and convinced him to make them public 
And it seems he has had very similar private concerns again recently which differ greatly from what he has been saying in public 

I think the simple reason for this is that Mr  Buffett doesn t want to go down in history as they guy who burst the  everything bubble   He clearly has much more concern for his own legacy  Still  I had greater admiration for the man who saw more value in promoting the truth in finance than protecting his image as a stock market Santa Claus ",2017-03-02,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-warren-buffett-is-so-reluctant-to-call-stocks-a-‘bubble’-200177497,200177497

198565,420081,ORCL,Can Oracle Shine Above The Clouds ,opinion,"Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 62 cents on  9 18 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million on the top
After a long back and forth with investors  Larry Ellison got his way and closed the deal to purchase Netsuite for  9 2 billion
Strong growth in SaaS and PaaS will help offset weakness in Oracle s legacy licensing business
Oracle  NYSE ORCL  is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings today after the closing bell  The tech giant is typically one of the earlier reports in the season that doesn t officially kick off until Alcoa s report on January 9  Oracle is coming off a weak first quarter  failing to meet analysts estimates on both the top and bottom line  The expected rollout of new products and the integration of Netsuite should help reverse the persisting weakness over the past few quarters 
Analysts aren t optimistic that Oracle s strategic initiatives will pay off this quarter  The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 62 cents  down 2  from a year earlier  That estimate has ratcheted down 8  likely in response to the Netsuite deal valued at  9 2 billion  Revenue for the period is forecasted to jump 2  to  9 17 billion  reflecting the progress being made in shifting to a subscription based model 

Oracle s transition to cloud computing in its Saas  PaaS and Big Data divisions has been encouraging  While the company enjoys a leading position in enterprise and database management systems  they are also gaining ground in the rapidly growing cloud sector  New products and the acquisition of NetSuite should help capture greater market share in spite of falling licensing revenue  Further strategic acquisitions will also play a significant role in expanding the company s product portfolio 
Most of the upside this quarter will come from sales growth in SaaS and PaaS services which management predicts will climb 78  to 82   Revenue from software  cloud  includes SaaS and PaaS  net software licenses and software supports is forecasted in the range of 3  to 5  
Despite a dedicated focus on cloud computing  it won t be all smoothing sailing  The software provider is operating in a top heavy industry  facing competition from the likes of Google  Salesforce and Amazon ",2016-12-14,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-oracle-shine-above-the-clouds-(orcl)-200169777,200169777
198566,420082,ORCL,S P 500 Picks Up Steam Again,opinion,"I have heard you loud and clear  it is time to part ways with the T2108 brand 
 is a daily technical indicator provided by   a stock charting program created by Worden Brothers  Inc  T2108 represents the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   My former trading mentor  TraderMike  now of    introduced me to T2108 around 2001 as a way of measuring oversold and overbought trading conditions in the stock market 
Starting on May 10  2011 I started writing the  T2108 Update  to formalize my approach to using T2108 and to create a specific space in the financial blogosphere for traders to learn about and track my favorite technical indicator  Lately  I have heard feedback that  essentially  the term is too mysterious and even confusing  This feedback is timely as for several years I have considered overhauling the branding  The time is now 
So  going forward  I will give my posts about T2108 the title  Above the 40   My objective is clarity  The number 40 refers directly to the essence of the indicator  the 40DMA   Above  refers to the direction of the measurement  In parallel  I will greatly reduce my use of the term T2108  While I will still use the term for continuity with my archives and tagging  I will mainly refer to T2108 as  AT40   Above The 40  
Similarly  I will rename T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  as  AT200   I realize this may look like I am exchanging one set of arcane numbers and letters for another set  but I still need to be brief with these symbols 
I also like  Above the 40  as an allusion to the 40th parallel north  Eureka  California  in the U S A   sits directly above the 40th parallel north at latitude 40 8 degrees north  Eureka means  I found it   The word refers to the excitement of a discovery or invention  This definition perfectly expresses my feeling when I began the journey of formalizing the analysis of T2108  now AT40  Coincidently and conveniently  Omaha  Nebraska also sits just above the 40th parallel north at latitude 41 3 degrees north  Omaha of course is the home of the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of the financial world  Warren Buffett 

Tucked away comfortably on the far northwestern coast of California is Eureka 
To kick off  this rebranding  I am posting the latest charts for AT40  T2108  and AT200  T2107  below 
T2108  AT40  closed at a 2 1 2 month low as a bearish divergence with the S P 500 picks up steam again 

AT200  T2107  closed right on top of its uptrend  A breakdown from here would confirm the bearish divergence and brighten the red bearish flags ",2017-02-02,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-t2108-update”-becomes-“above-the-40-200174441,200174441

Yesterday s we said   On November 2 the TRIN closed at 1 27 and the TICK closed at  606 which is a bullish combination  Ideally one would like to see more panic in the TRIN close above 1 50 to suggest a longer term bottom as the higher panic in the TRIN and TICK closes produce stronger bottoms in the market   Therefore the TRIN and TICK closes of 11 2 16 suggests just a mild bullish condition  In general the VIX trades opposite of the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  and also usually leads the way for the SPY  Today the VIX closed above yesterday s low and the SPY closed above yesterday s high which is a bearish divergence suggesting SPY may pull back short term  Also a large gap opening occurred Monday and the larger the gap the more likely it will get filled sooner rather then later  Also probability studies show market is usually up going into election and down up to five days after  Expecting a pull back to test gap near 210 range and a possible bullish setup   Timer Digest has moved up The Ord Oracle  NYSE ORCL  to 7Th in nation on performance the last 12 months on SPX  

The middle window is the McClellan Oscillator VIX ratio  When this ratio trades below  7 5 a bottom is usually not far off  This ratio traded below  10 Last Friday  What may transpire in the coming days may look similar to the March period where the McClellan Oscillator VIX ratio had a double dip before heading higher  With the probabilities favor a pull back after the election and a large open gap below current prices  a pull back to fill gap near 210 on the SPY is possible 

In general when the daily RSI of the GDX GLD ratio stays below 50  GDX is considered in a downtrend and when above 50  an uptrend  When the RSI of the GDX GLD ratio finds resistance near 50 and turns down  like now  then a short term pull back in GDX is probable  The RSI of the GDX GLD ratio bounce against the 50 range late last week suggesting GDX was at resistance  Since then  GDX has pulled back some  As of now there is still a possibility GDX may test the 22 00 to 21 00 range before the next uptrend starts  Once the next low is found  the next major impulse wave up should break to new highs  Short GDX on 11 2 16 at 24 78 ",2016-11-09,Tim Ord,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/technicals:-gold,-gld,-gdx,-spx,-vix-200163657",200163657

	The market is not pricing in a September rate hike based on interpretations following the Fed meeting yesterday  The Fed has continually said it will remain data dependent regarding raising interest rates  currently  there is not even a 50  chance the Fed will raise by December of this year

198640,420156,ORCL,Head To Head  Donald Trump And Warren Buffett,opinion,"On Monday afternoon  universally recognized investor  chairman  and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   Warren Buffett issued a direct challenge to Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump  He wants Trump to meet with him  bring his tax returns  and let the public inquire about the filings 
For some time now  Trump has resisted releasing his returns  citing that he is  being audited by the IRS   However  Buffett responded by stating that he too is being audited  and that it is not a reason to avoid disclosing his returns  For the last 40 years  every major party presidential candidate has released their tax returns  so it is fishy to some that Trump remains hesitant in doing so 
The so called  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  and the Donald have differing ideologies on quite a few things  Both also stand in different positions socially  as well as in terms of net worth  and influence  although some of these can be a bit subjective  Let s break down just how unlike each other these two are 
The Battle for Attention
For years now  Donald Trump has found some way to stay in the spotlight  With interviews spanning back to the 80s to his controversial show  The Apprentice  which he was on from 2004 until 2015  Trump has done much to stay relevant in the public domain 
He has filmography spanning back to 1985  and as recently as 2015 hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live  Trump also owned part or all of the Miss Universe  Miss USA  and Miss Teen USA pageants  which has had its own share of controversy as well 
In this regard  there is a stark difference between Trump and Buffett  who according to his biographer used to throw up before public speaking  and  arranged my life so that I never had to get up in front of anybody  
Given his recent speech introducing Hillary Clinton and calling out Trump on his taxes  we know Buffett is no longer the stranger to public speaking that he once was 
Overall  Buffett has never done much to bring himself into the spotlight  Although making public appearances here and there  to speak about the market  endorse a candidate  or serve as an economic adviser  Buffett is not as hungry for attention as his counterpart 
Path to Wealth
In 1975  Donald Trump inherited a real estate business from his father  Fred Trump  At the time of inheritance  the business was worth  40 million  He claims his current net worth to stand at around  10 billion  although there is  over that number 
Between then and now  Trump has grown his business through building his brand name hotels and towers across different parts of the U S  First  he concentrated entirely on New York  which was quite the gamble  but has since built properties on both coasts of the U S  and in between  Canada  Panama  Mumbai  the Philippines  and other countries as well 
Trump has also concentrated on building his brand through his dedication to remaining in view of the public  as discussed above  
The son of a Republican Congressman  Warren Buffett s life as an entrepreneur began quite early  when as a child he sold chewing gum  soda bottles  and weekly magazines door to door  The world knows him for purchasing Berkshire Hathaway  He gained control of the company in 1964 as a textile business  which he soon cut and expanded into the insurance industry 
In the years since  Berkshire Hathaway has acquired and holds stakes in many major companies  Much of Buffett s estimated  63 3 billion net worth comes from his holdings in Berkshire Hathaway  which manages a portfolio worth over  132 billion  His company has grown over  since Buffett took over  yet another testament to his legendary reputation 
What Kind of Influence Do Each Have 
On the topic of influence  both that of Trump and Buffett are massive in their own regard  Over the years  Buffett has been the subject of countless studies  books  and a shift in the way that many approach investing  His  value investing  methodology has gained many supporters  followers  and practitioners 
Buffett has also pledged to donate 99  of his worth to charity  an impact that is currently immeasurable due to the vast amount of uses that money can have in the future  Furthermore  the market responds to Buffett s movements  When Buffett announces a stake in a company  its stocks soar  which goes to show how much people value his expertise 
Donald Trump has had a monstrous amount of influence as well  Between making his catchphrase  you re fired  resonate in households across the nation to now becoming the Republican presidential nominee  Trump has become quite well known  The ethicality of his influence is not for me to comment on  but he has done much to bring disgruntled Americans out of the woodwork and onboard to support his message 
Bottom Line
Warren Buffett and Donald Trump are very different people  in just about every way  Both have made names for themselves  are some of the wealthiest on Earth  and are influential enough to have articles written about them 
One thing s for sure  and that is that both names will show up in history books  although under different pretenses ",2016-08-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/head-to-head:-donald-trump-and-warren-buffett-200145848,200145848

As we close the door on first quarter earnings another opens  when Oracle reports its FQ4 2016 on Thursday  one of the first reports of the season  Oracle is coming off a better than expected third quarter in which they beat on the bottom line but missed sales estimates 
The continued transition from licensing  where revenues are booked upfront  to a cloud subscription model  where it is realized month to month  will hurt top line growth  as witnessed this past quarter 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of of 82 cents on  10 49 billion in revenue   30 million higher than Wall Street on the top line  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 5  increase in earnings and 2  loss in sales  Fortunately the stock typically doesn t move during earnings season  so meager growth won t do too much harm  
Oracle s transition to cloud computing in its Saas  PaaS and Big Data divisions has been nothing but promising  While the company enjoys a leading position in enterprise and database management systems  they are also gaining ground in the rapidly growing cloud sector 
Cloud computing continues to be one of the fastest growing sectors in technology and that has benefitted Oracle  Since the beginning of the year  Oracle has made significant advancements in the cloud business and most recently launched its Oracle PartnerNetwork Cloud program  which has already received rave reviews

198662,420178,ORCL,5 Best PEG Stocks Value Investors Will Love Right Now,opinion,"Not a single investor this era can casually overlook any of the investment picks and market tips of the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  If we delve deeper into how Warren Buffet became the most successful value investor of the 21st century    it is not difficult to realize the huge significance of the  intrinsic value  of the stock that does most of the tricks   
One wonders how this single term has managed to successfully continue as the fundamental value investing mantra for so long despite all kinds of vagaries of the market  The answer is apparently simple   pick the stocks which the market is currently undervaluing  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings or to book value are the most common forms of intrinsic value calculation  which can easily single out whether a stock is trading at a discount 
But will this alone ensure success  What if there is a dearth of catalysts to propel growth even though the stock is cheap  In such a case  if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  To avoid such value traps  Buffet has advised investors to keep a focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  And here comes the importance of a not so popular value investing metric  the PEG ratio 
The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth Rate
A lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors 
While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps finding the intrinsic value of a stock 
Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock 
There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term 
Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration 
Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy 
PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median
 P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose   
Zacks Rank of 1 Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have a proven history of success   
Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  
Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  
Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  
Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  
Here are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening

198674,420190,ORCL,S P 500  Re Testing Overhead Resistance,opinion,"Current Position of the Market
SPX Long term trend  A lengthy correction is most likely underway 
SPX Intermediate trend  The H S pattern has been invalidated and the index is re testing the upper portion of its trading range 
Analysis of the short term trend is done on a daily basis with the help of hourly charts  It is an important adjunct to the analysis of daily and weekly charts which discuss longer market trends 
Market Overview
SPX has been trading within a resistance belt which extends from 2040 to 2135 for about a year and a half  except for a couple of severe forays below it  Two serious breaks below it occurred in August 2015 and in January 2016 which reached down to about 1810  followed by a less severe penetration to the 2026 level  recently  All these gave birth to a rally which rose to challenge the top of the band unsuccessfully  Are we repeating the pattern once again  or will we go through and make a new high this time 
Since October 2014  we have traded within an even wider range extending to the lower 1800s  Consequently  it is inappropriate to say that the SPX is in a bear market  It is more correct to say that the bull market which started in 2009 has been undergoing a massive correction which will not be over until we surpass the 5 15 high of 2135  Is this what we are attempting to do currently  or is it still months away with much lower prices in store first  We should soon find out 
Nadeem Walayat  founder of The Market Oracle  NYSE ORCL  financial site  is one of the market bulls which expects oil prices to continue to increase for a while and take the SPX to a new high  He could be right  but my overview of various market leaders  which appears a little later on  suggests otherwise although I suppose that SPX could make a marginal new high and then retrace immediately  It would put an end to the long standing debate between EW followers about whether or not the bull market has already evolved in 5 waves  or if the 5th wave is currently underway 
My argument against a new high is that the level of distribution which occurred at the market top produced a count on the P F chart which has not been filled in its entirety  Moreover  the rally in oil is  most likely  nearly over  see USO  NYSE USO  below  and will be followed by a base building process which could take some time to complete  Of course  when analyzing the market  we can only arrive at probableoutcomes  not certainties  Eventually  the market itself will have to prove whether or not the analysis is correct 
SPX Chart Analysis
Daily chart  This chart  and others below  are courtesy of QCharts com  
The daily chart of SPX shows why the index could have a tough slog trying to move much higher  But first  let s see why it made a short term low where it did  First of all  although it dipped below 2040 on a daily basis  it could not close below but rallied to close right on it at the end of that day and pushed higher on the following day  Next  at the low  it touched the lower channel line of the uptrend from 1810  This created support that was reinforced by a parallel trend line to the intermediate blue channel  going back to 10 11  which was drawn across the October 2015 low  and which happened to cross precisely at the same level  Finally  there was a short term projection to 2025  All these conspired to create a good support level around which the bulls rallied 
Now for the resistance  On Friday  after two days of moving sideways  the index finally crawled out of a small consolidation level and closed at 2098 63  There are several former short term peaks just above which could put an end to the rally  the first one being at 2089 89  and the others at 2104 27  2011 05  2116 46  Finally  there are the three higher peaks which formed the highest points reached thus far by the bull market  In addition  there are a couple of short term projections which stand at 2109 and 2122  that should also be instrumental in capping the move over the short term  As you can see on the chart  there are also green and blue parallels which intersect in the area 
The indicators are mixed with the SRSI overbought  and the MACD and the A D oscillator showing significant divergence    but still in an uptrend  We will not get a sell signal until they turn down and the minor trend line from 2026 has been broken  A longer term sell signal would have to see a close outside of the black channel line  and eventually below 2026 

Hourly chart
Buyers were not very aggressive for the past couple of days  barely turning prices out of the small congestion area by Friday s close  But the trend remains up until we start to break the trend lines that are defining it  The first critical one will be the bottom one of the steeper black channel  That could quickly bring us close to challenging the larger black channel line which connects with 1810 
The heavy dashed line was not discussed in the daily chart analysis  It is a parallel of the larger channel line which runs at about one third of the channel width  Such a trend line often provides support to prices declining within the channel  and resistance to rising prices  This one appears to be doing just that along its course from the bottom and could be a factor in stopping the rally around this level  On the other hand  if prices move through it smartly  it would signify a resurgence of buying 
And it would take some good buying to turn the indicators more positive  Right now  they are in various states of divergence  but also may be turning up 

SPX et al   weekly 
   and SMH showed some good strength  What happens over the next week will undoubtedly be meaningful  
It s not the first time that the semis have led the market up or down and that s exactly what VanEck Vectors Semiconductor  NYSE SMH  did last Friday  It started the whole rally but  since the others looked lethargic  I did not take the cue seriously  If it keeps going   as well as the rest   we should take notice  but SMH is the only one which showed some good buying last week  The others have pretty much underperformed SPX  especially those in the lower tier which are among the weakest on a longer term basis  True to form  the TRAN had the worst rally for the week  Let s see how they shape up next week 

UUP  Dollar ETF 
PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish  NYSE UUP  appears to have made a significant low  It has not only broken its short term downtrend line  but it has risen above the previous short term low  and now is attempting to move out of the corrective channel entirely  A move completely out of the channel would suggest that the index is in the process of resuming its primary trend to the upside  but this will include consolidations along the way 

GLD  Gold ETF  NYSE GLD  
After breaking its daily trend line  GLD has continued to decline and will probably find some support a little lower at 115  but it is making an ominous pattern above that level which  if it is broken  couldlead to a re test of the December lows 

USO  US Oil Trust 
United States Oil  NYSE USO  looks intent on closing the gap which was created when it broke support at 12 50  on its way to its 8 projection  Whether this gap is filled completely or only partially is moot since the index is nearing very important overhead resistance which is most likely going to end its oversold rally and start a retracement into the base  At the same time  the indicators are showing strong negative divergence  adding to the probability that a short term reversal is about to occur 

Summary
There is  very  important support for the SPX between 2040 and 2043  It will have to be broken decisively in order for the index to resume its long term downtrend 
After finding support at the bottom of a major trading range  SPX is again approaching the top of the resistance band where all rallies have failed and reversed course for the past one and a half years  Already some deceleration is taking place in the uptrend from 1226  but will it lead to another important reversal  or simply a consolidation followed by another challenge of the highs  This is what the market will tell us over the next couple of weeks ",2016-05-31,Andre Gratian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/re-testing-overhead-resistance-200133054,200133054
198681,420197,ORCL,Today s Trading Plan  Cinco De Petr leo,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
S P 500 sold off for the fourth time in the last five days and closed yesterday below the lows from last week 
There was almost a test of the 50 day moving average yesterday but the dip buyers stepped in before that could take place 
Again yesterday afternoon we saw the dip buyers come in during afternoon trading and lift price off of the lows of the day 
In essence the  are unable to get even one clean  solid sell off that doesn t get eventually bought up 
There is plenty of talk about a market rally today  and that is very much possible considering that oil is up quite a bit in overnight trading and futures up slightly as well 
The 30 minute chart of S P 500 has a solid series of lower highs and lower lows in place 
SPY  NYSE SPY  volume was slightly below recent averages and dropped off some from the day prior 
VIX is really struggling to find some momentum here and push through the 16 40 level as it has been rejected at that price point for four straight days 
T2108    of stocks trading above their 40 day moving average  continues to deteriorate  dropping another 5 2  down to 62   As stated yesterday  it has clearly broken out of its recent range 
The objective for the bulls here should be to get price back over 2073  while the  should be attempting a move to get back below 2040 
Historically the May through October time frame is much weaker than the rest of the year 
Yellen s dovish outlook as it pertains to rate hikes has been  in large part  the reason for the massive rally off of the February lows

198682,420198,ORCL,Follow Warren Buffet With These ETF Strategies,opinion,"Everybody dreams of becoming rich and famous like Warren Buffett  Carl Icahn  Daniel Loeb and David Tepper  After all  these Wall Street gurus have successfully put their money in the right place and continue to reap huge returns 
Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa     has enjoyed an average growth rate of about 20  annually  Furthermore  Berkshire Hathaway has added more than 80  over the last five years  as of May 5  2016  that is better than the gain of over 69  from the broader market ETF SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY     during the same timeframe 
Thanks to this feat  following billionaires  investment strategies is a fad  While investing in Berkshire is always a good way of following Buffett  who is commonly known as The Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  there are numerous other ways to reproduce this stock market veteran s investment theme and add a spark to one s portfolio 
Normally  Buffett takes interest in companies trading below what he believes is their intrinsic value  He aims long term outperformance and apparently ignores short term travails  Since there is a huge craze of Buffett style investing  we analyze below a few key investing strategies derived from  meeting  We also highlight the related ETFs for investors who want to follow this investment veteran Excuse Yourself from IPOs
The global IPO market has been on a tear lately and people churned out enough money from it  A rock bottom interest rate environment and an even more impressive performance by the U S  stock indices charged up the IPO market 
IPO ETF First Trust US IPO Index Fund    returned about 94  in the last five years  as of May 4  2016   but the wining trend seem to be waning lately  The fund was off about 5 8  in the last one year and is down 1 9  so far this year  as of May 4  2016   read    
But Buffet seems to be no fan of  and finds them risky bets  As investors get to know very little about the company s past or   this technique does not go well with value investing Berkshire on Acquisition Spree  Time for M A ETF 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc  acquired Precision Castparts  NYSE PCP   one of the leading manufacturers of aerospace components in a  37 2 billion deal  in the first quarter of 2016  Also  Buffett indicated that Berkshire Hathaway will continue to chase large acquisitions  going forward  This means that big acquisitions will likely be in the cards and investors can play IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF    to cash in on the likely booming trend  read    Buffett s Confusion with Negative Rates  Where to Find Yield  
As several central banks are now practicing negative rates right from the ECB to BoJ  income from government bonds have declined considerably  Even in the U S   interest rates have been at very low levels  But these hurt several corners of the business world like the financial sector  In fact  retirees also find it hard to earn interest income  Buffett is  this policy as  anything that reduces the value of having money is going to affect Berkshire   read       
Keeping these issues in mind  investors can go for some safe but high yielding products like PowerShares S P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF     The fund yields 3 33  annually  as of May 5  2016   For European market  investors can play with First Trust STOXX European Select Dividend Index Fund     FDD yields 4 09  annually  as of May 5  2016  Warren Buffett is long on Euro  Should you Really Follow this One 
Don t get shocked  Yes  Buffett  who is a benevolent promoter of the value investing  has said that Berkshire Hathaway owns Euros  In this case  think twice before copying him because Berkshire Hathaway has huge business exposure in Europe and  as payments for its operations there 
But we warn investors not to be outright bullish on euro as the ECB is on a super easing mode  Though the currency lately gained strength on a weaker greenback and certain improvement in the Euro zone  the rally can lose momentum anytime  So  better be watchful before betting on Euro ETF CurrencyShares Euro ETF  NYSE FXE      read    Have Faith in U S  GDP  What to Play 
Buffett admits that the U S  GDP growth is certainly sluggish    Though Q1 GDP was lackluster  the momentum can pick up in Q2  Plus  dollar has moderated lately on a dovish Fed  which in turn can boost exports 
We suggest playing mid cap value ETFs which offer the best of both the worlds   small and large  These have limited foreign exposure and are thus expected to gain from a falling U S  dollar  Thus  a softer dollar and a slowly improving U S  economy make a winning combination for mid cap ETFs  Mid caps are less volatile than small cap stocks  Vanguard Mid Cap Value ETF    is an example among many that can be tapped to play the trend ",2016-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/follow-warren-buffet-with-these-etf-strategies-200128514,200128514

Volume was slightly less than the day prior on SPY  but still above average 
While we may be seeing a short term reprieve from the market  overall  the it remains very bearish  and bounces should be treated as a  dead cat  unless proven otherwise

198701,420217,ORCL,After Fed Balks At Rate Change  It s Back To  Disaster Planning 101 ,opinion,"September has come and gone  The Fed was supposed to rock the world with a massive 25 basis point rate increase  but Ms  Yellen blinked  and financial markets breathed a sigh of relief  Cheap money was still available to bloat stock values and fund the global banking casino of government bonds  What ever will the Press write about today  China has receded into the back pages  Mario Draghi  the omnipresent chairman of the ECB  has chosen to avoid the spotlight  strange behavior for him  for sure  The G20 confab was a non event  but  as the dust settles and markets tread calmer waters  the maddening throngs are back to screaming that the sky is about to fall 
Yes  the doomsday pundits have grabbed the podium  Nature may abhor a vacuum  but I suspect that every  Little Boy Blue  in the world has regained new strength to shout from the rooftops that Armageddon is near  In the olden days  we would have mounted a mission to the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  at Delphi in quest of answers  In the modern era  we prefer to approach academia and its Nobel Prize winners in economics to pontificate where we are headed 
Robert Shiller s famous CAPE Index chart could start a rush for the exits 

The famous oracle of Delphi had to inhale noxious gases  go into a trance  and then speak gibberish that only the local priests could interpret  Fast forward to today  and we observe interviews of respected icons speaking noxious gibberish that defy interpretation at any level  Finding correct and timely answers is the objective  the same as thousands of years ago  but such masters of the nether world are difficult to locate  There is one individual  however  that is willing to risk his reputation by making dire forecasts that could cause strong men to tremble and weak men to sell off their portfolios in a flash  That man is none other than Robert Shiller 
Financial markets form valuation bubbles over time  That is what they do  but  when the bubbles deflate  it is usually followed by financial catastrophes of the worst kind  Trying to prepare ahead of time in order to withstand the impending consequences is what drives the need for accurate forecasts  The forecaster may also be looking for a lifetime of glory and the opportunity to leverage his correct guess into substantial cash  but such is not the case with Shiller  He is a Yale economist in his late sixties that spends his days studying a multitude of charts and analyses  searching for truth for the next edition of his classic book   Irrational Exuberance  
Bubbles are all about over valuations  and the best indicator of this phenomenon is to follow Price Earning ratios of the participants in the S P 500 Index  The only problem was that companies have a way of playing games with their earnings figures  such that a reliable measure using P E ratios was lacking  until Shiller made one modification  He took a 10 year average of earnings and used that figure for the denominator  thereby smoothing out most of the distortions caused by creative accounting  The result was his now famous  Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings   CAPE  ratio  as depicted above 
Current concerns are that today s  24 5  index figure is just below the three highest values in history  which also happen to coincide with three major bubble deflations in the historical record   1929  2000  and 2007  Are your hairs standing on end  Did a ripple of fear suddenly pass through your consciousness  Yes  the past does seem to be repeating itself right before our very eyes  but is it correct to assume that a crash is imminent 
When asked why the index was tracking where it is  even the Nobel Prize winner was unable to interpret his own chart with understandable economic gibberish  He once remarked to a reporter that   I suspect the real answers lie largely in the realm of sociology and social psychology   in phenomena like irrational exuberance  which  eventually  has always faded before  If the mood changes again  stock market investments may disappoint us  
Yes  the wise professor did couch his words with  may   not  will  or some other more demonstrative word  We do live in unusual times  Central bankers around the world have been manipulating market forces for nearly a decade with low interest rate policies that stretch credulity beyond even the most conservative of levels  The addition of the Red line to the above chart reflects how long term interest rates have trended over the entire period  Interest rates can definitely impact earnings  as well as market valuations  but to what degree  Like everyone else  Shiller and we must wait for the outcome to unfold 
Who is Robert Shiller  and why is he so credible 
One biographical source states that   Robert James  Bob  Shiller  born March 29  1946  is a 2013 American Nobel Laureate  economist  academic  and best selling author  He currently serves as a Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University and is a fellow at the Yale School of Management s International Center for Finance  Shiller is ranked among the 100 most influential economists of the world  His work  relating to the dynamics of asset prices  such as fixed income  equities  and real estate  and their metrics  has been influential in the development of the theory  as well as its implications for practice and policy making  
Shiller is definitely a man to be trusted  He is often interviewed for his opinions on the economy  especially in the areas of stock market valuations and the housing sector  Here are a few more reasons why reporters are so eager to kneel before him 

Shiller is widely known for his CAPE Index  but he is actively followed by the housing industry where the focus is always on another of his collaborative creations  the multiple Case Shiller home price indices  A national home price index  a 20 city composite index  a 10 city composite index  and twenty individual metro area indices 
He published his book   Irrational Exuberance  in March 2000  which described the formation of market bubbles  He is widely given credit for predicting the Tech Crash in 2000  although many pundits claim that to be wrongfully so  Timing can be everything  as was the date of his book s release 
He revised his book in 2006 to include the bubble forming in the housing market  and  once again  his timing was impeccable  Did he predict the disaster in the housing industry and in financial markets to follow  Whether he did or not is up for conjecture  but it is often said that perception is more important than reality  His adoring throngs give him credit in both cases 
The 3rd edition is now in print  which includes not only his previous thoughts on the tech and housing bubbles  but also on the high valuations that are occurring now in equity markets 

What do Shiller s critics have to say about his forecasting prowess 
Success does attract followers  but also critics  Many critics complain that Shiller gets far too much credit for market realities that he never predicted in the short term  They applaud him for his long term analyses  but they become sanguine when they question whether his forecasts are both correct and timely  Other critics try to improve upon his CAPE chart or pick it apart as not being accurate enough  These analysts look to the last recession and point out that the earnings  trough  was so deep and lengthy that one must ignore its impact in the CAPE chart  If you use higher numbers  then the current figures do not look so bad 
Shiller has received this type of query many times over  but his response is more than plausible  When asked about the more recent distortion of earnings  he has noted in his research that in previous deep recessions  companies are more prone to making big write offs to clean up their balance sheets when most people are looking for direct actions from management teams to improve future earnings  The recession  trough  may look deep  but if you acknowledge that the write offs represented prior spending mistakes  then simple averaging should fix the issue  Per Shiller   If I average over 10 years I don t see that as a problem  
What chart has Shiller seriously worried these days 
Bob Shiller  being the excellent economist that he is  does not rely on a single chart to give him valuable insights  He is constantly looking for repeating patterns  as would any trader in the forex market  to gain his edge on forecasting the future of market behavior and  more importantly  the evolution of  bubbles   his specific forte  as perceived by analysts the world over  What chart is troubling Mr  Shiller today  He does not like what he sees in surveys taken of Investor confidence that measure valuation sentiments  Here is the chart that he presented in a recent interview with the  Financial Times  

Shiller stated that this index reflects that Investor worries are at their greatest level since 2000  The recent 10  correction that occurred during one week in August produced global shockwaves  Per Shiller   It looks to me a bit like a bubble again with essentially a tripling of stock prices since 2009 in just six years and at the same time people losing confidence in the valuation of the market  It suggests to me that many people are re evaluating their exposure to the stock market  And we could see aftershocks of the correction  
What else is bothering analysts out there  One analyst noted that   At the end of August 2015 the 50 day moving average of the S P 500 crossed its 200 day moving average to the downside   the 33rd occurrence of a  Death Cross  since 1950  During the last 65 years there were ten recessions  A Death Cross preceded six recessions and occurred early in four recessions   According to this analysis  we have from one to eighteen months to prepare for the worst  Is the past really a good indicator of future upheavals 
Concluding Remarks
Whom are we left to believe  Even Shiller is not convinced about what to do going forward   I ve been very wary about advising people to pull out of the market even though my CAPE ratio is at one of the highest levels ever in history  Something funny is going on  History is always coming up with new puzzles   Puzzle or not  what goes up must eventually come down  at least in forex markets  No one likes surprises  but to be forewarned is to be forearmed

198715,420231,ORCL,Earnings  What Will Oracle Say About Cloud Traction ,opinion,"At the close of markets today  investors will likely turn a keen eye to the Californian based software company Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  as they deliver their quarterly report after the bell  The Estimize community and Wall Street are both projecting earnings figures to come in below company guidance  Estimize and Wall Street analysts are predicting EPS figures of  0 91 and  0 87  respectively  for the FQ4  15  This is compared to company guidance of  0 93 

Similar to earnings  Estimize has a higher revenue target than Wall Street with an estimate of  11 145B for the quarter compared to the  10 913B Wall Street is predicting  Both of these projections fall short of Oracle s actual revenue numbers reported in FQ4  14 of  11 326B  Importantly  the stronger US currency is expected to have contributed to lower revenue estimates for this quarter relative to the previous twelve months 

The company has underperformed recently  disappointing investors with a year to date  YTD  return of negative 0 76  relative to the S P 500  which has delivered a 2 13  capital gain  Investors and market commentary have focused on the deterioration in the company s new software license s sales  which have been weakening total revenues  However  this is not Oracle s only issue  New software license s sales lead to ongoing sales in software updates and support  their main revenue driver  This is a continuing trend for Oracle and will be closely watched by market participants this afternoon 
With the likely continuation of falling revenues from new software licenses  management is relying on a pick up in cloud computing sales to offset that decline  Management has persisted in acquiring businesses operating in the cloud based product service industries as well as companies controlling content and data 
Historically  FQ4 has represented a seasonally strong period for the company  The stock did however disappoint twelve months ago when the company missed its guidance  delivering a  0 92 EPS figure compared to guidance of  0 96 
The upcoming result will be the first to fully reflect the benefits from both the MICROS Systems and Datalogix acquisitions  which were finalized in September 2014 and January 2015  respectively  Investors will be eager to see the benefits associated with these acquisitions  The importance of the acquisition of Datalogix is significant as Oracle attempts to further scale its enterprise level marketing services 
This will be an earnings announcement to watch  Expect the market to pay special attention to Oracle s comments regarding the traction of their cloud offerings experienced over the quarter ",2015-06-17,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-will-oracle-say-about-their-cloud-traction-in-tonight’s-report-255399,255399

198726,420242,ORCL,5 Things To Ponder  Margin Of Safety,opinion,"In   I very briefly discussed  recency bias  as it related to sentiment based economic surveys  I spent much of last evening pondering the issue of  recently bias  as it relates to the overall macro market environment  Carl Richards  back in 2012  commented 

 We rely on habit to help us make things easier because few people want to reinvent their lives every day  But this habit of forming habits also does something else  In academic circles  it s called the recency bias  and it can trick us into making decisions we might not make otherwise  



 The recency bias is pretty simple  Because it s easier  we re inclined to use our recent experience as the baseline for what will happen in the future  In many situations  this bias works just fine  but when it comes to investing and money it can cause problems 
When we re watching a bull market run along  it s understandable that people forget about the cycles where it didn t  As far as recent memory tells us  the market should keep going up  so we keep buying  and then it doesn t  And unless we ve prepared for that moment  we re shocked and wondered how we missed the bubble 
When the market is down  we become convinced that it will never climb out so we cash out our portfolios and stick the money in a mattress  We know the market isn t going back up because the recency bias tells us so  But then one day it does  and we re left sitting on a really expensive mattress that s earning nothing  

The point Carl makes is important  The longer a bull market runs  the more inclined we become to believe  it will never end   
It is during these long  and seemingly unending runs  that we begin to dismiss the most simplistic rules of investing and opt for  buy and hold  strategies that are historically responsible for cataclysmic losses of investment capital 
What is most interesting about  buy and hold  investing is that the group that generally promotes it receive a direct benefit  i e  fees  for keeping investors invested in the market  Secondly  why is it that every great investor in history from Benjamin Graham to Paul Tudor Jones to Bob Farrell all adhered to basic investment disciplines of buying low and selling high 
This week s reading list is a view on investing  the markets and potential outcomes to try and limit the potential for  recency bias  by focusing on the potential for outcomes  In other words  what is the  margin of safety  for investors now 
1  When In Doubt  Stay Out by Ivanhoff via Ivanhoff Capital

 When an event repeats frequently  it becomes a pattern  A pattern  in which a lot of people wholeheartedly believe in and act upon  Buying oversold dips in the major indexes has been very lucrative in the past few quarters  Even more so  in the past few months  which have been a poster child of range bound markets  Will the current dip be any different  No one really knows  There are some good reasons to believe so 
seasonality 
poor reaction to decent earnings reports 
lack of great long setups 
I truly believe that knowing when to be out of the market is the single most valuable trading skill anyone could develop  Why do I think so  Because  when markets are trending most setups work  most breakouts work and have a decent follow through  it is a lot easier to make money  When markets are choppy  everything turns upside down and it is becomes difficult not to lose money  Be aggressive when it pays to be aggressive  Make sure you don t give back most of your gains when the market environment worsens for your approach  For better of for worse  financial markets are one of those business fields  where working smart always trumps working hard

2  Yellen Says Stocks Might Be Overvalued by Matt O Brien via The Washington Post

 Now  stocks have cooled off since the start of the year  but not that much  So does that mean stock prices are  quite high   Well  that depends on how you look at it  Take Robert Shiller s cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio  or CAPE  which looks at the past ten years of earnings to figure out how pricey stocks are today  The idea here is that it smooths out any big ups or downs  and shows us how fairly valued or not stocks are  And by this measure  as you can see below  stocks really are getting expensive

4  What 118 Fed Rate Increases Since 1948 Show by Simon Kennedy via Bloomberg Business

 Since 1948  the Fed has increased its benchmark on 118 occasions against a quarterly backdrop in which the average growth in nominal GDP was an average 8 6 percent  Deutsche Bank s  XETRA DBKGn  strategists wrote in a report published Wednesday Only in the third quarters of 1958 and 1982 did the Fed shift when nominal growth was undershooting 4 5 percent and the latter action was even reversed a month later 
So for virtually every rate increase since Harry S  Truman was in the White House  nominal GDP was growing 4 5 percent or faster  with 112 occurring when it was above 5 5 percent

198749,420265,ORCL,Top Tech Cycle Play With Even More Legs,opinion,"Oracle Corp   NYSE ORCL  reports on Thursday and it s one of the first large corporations to do so this reporting season  Second quarter earnings season is just about here  and it s exactly what the stock market needs now 
The lull between earning seasons can make for some wacky trading action  Often trading volume diminishes and from a business perspective  what you want from a company you re thinking about investing in  or divesting  is its most recent numbers 
I thought that first quarter earnings season was pretty decent  and I think companies will surprise the marketplace again for the second quarter 
A couple of trends that emerged in the first quarter was that European operations of large multinationals showed improvement comparatively  and that s important for these super big companies that do business in developed markets 
The other trend was that currency instability held back corporate earnings  In many cases I read reports where the bottom line would ve been one to three percent higher if it weren t for major devaluations in developing economies with large populations  Of course  this is an ongoing investment risk that any multinational is going to face and as an investor  there really isn t anything you can do about it 
It will be worthwhile perusing Oracle s upcoming earnings report  it s the company s fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 
Oracle is a company that I ve liked for a number of years as an investment grade equity security for long term investors  But the business does experience periods of stagnant growth  
I was enthusiastic about this position early last year as a long term cycle play  with government and corporate customers   but competition from the cloud was taking its toll on its quarterlies and the company just couldn t generate the kind of near term growth that the marketplace was looking for 
The stock dropped from  35 00 to  30 00  and it traded within that range for all of 2013 
But the great monetary expansion continues and now  Oracle is back above  40 00 a share in a near term uptrend 
Last quarter  its fiscal third quarter of 2014   the company was able to grow its GAAP earnings per share by eight percent comparatively 
It would have been up 10  comparatively and non GAAP earnings per share would have been up seven percent  instead of five  if it weren t for the strengthening of the U S  dollar 
Larry Ellison has been pushing hard into the cloud and the company s fiscal third quarter produced solid double digit growth in this area 
The company s fiscal fourth quarter should show the same  and it s what Wall Street is looking for 
I think this stock has more legs and is a cycle play  Top line growth is difficult  but investors will still bid the position if earnings come through 
Wall Street is looking for low single digit growth in revenues this fiscal year  accelerating to about five percent for fiscal 2015  Annual earnings for 2014 and 2015 are expected to be in the high single digit area and the company offers a dividend  which currently yields around one percent 
Oracle is a benchmark stock in technology  which is why its earnings report is worth reading for economic intelligence 
The great thing about this position is that it is not expensively priced  and an upside earnings surprise could easily see this stock break  45 00 a share 
If the company doesn t meet or beat the Street  then I d take profits in this position  If it does have a good quarter  this stock would be a near term buy  due to it currently being fairly priced

198750,420266,ORCL,Here s What To Look For From Oracle On Thursday,opinion,"Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  is set to report FQ4 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday  June 19th  Oracle is a technology company known for selling enterprise software  cloud services  and computer hardware systems  The fourth fiscal quarter is normally the strongest of the year for Oracle  and Wall Street has set the bar high this period  The Street is expecting Oracle to increase its FQ4 EPS by 8c per share compared to last year while revenue grows by 5  on a year over year basis  In other news  Oracle is rumored to be getting close to announcing an acquisition of Micros Systems  a maker of software and point of sale devices for restaurants  hotels  and retailers in a deal valued over  5 billion  Although Wall Street has considerable quarterly growth expectations  investors are signaling they may be willing to give Oracle a pass this quarter for missing the high target as long as they can come close 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Oracle to report 95c EPS and  11 469B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 41 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 94c EPS and  11 449B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Oracle to miss the Wall Street consensus by a thin margin 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly  it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a smaller than usual differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 88c to  1 00 per share and from  11 234B to  11 800B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wider range of estimates on Oracle s earnings 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months the Wall Street consensus has remained flat at 95c while the Estimize consensus dipped before inching higher from 93c to 94c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast shot up right before the report from a low of   11 460B to  11 469B while the Estimize sales consensus fell before increasing from  11 440B to  11 449B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions at the end of the period are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is TechStockRadar who projects 95c EPS and  11 470B in revenue  TechStockRadar self identifies as an independent financial research professional and is  overall among over 4 500 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years TechStockRadar has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 66  and 64  of the time respectively throughout 552 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case TechStockRadar is expecting Oracle beat the Estimize consensus and report right in line with the Wall Street consensus 
Oracle has been reeling to compete with several smaller competitors in cloud based data analytic software and HR programs while simultaneously trying to turn around its hardware business  which showed more revenue growth than expected last quarter  At the same time Oracle may be eyeing a move into point of sale hardware and looking to expand its enterprise solutions through a high profile acquisition of Micros Systems  Contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are signaling that on Thursday Oracle doesn t need a blowquarter quarter to keep them satisfied  earnings in line with the Wall Street consensus will probably be enough to keep shareholders happy

198807,420323,ORCL,A True Investor s Most Important Performance Measurement ,opinion,Although most people either fail to realize it  or simply refused to accept it  every stock portfolio has two separate and distinct performances  The first  and in my opinion  the least important  is stock price movement  If you buy a stock at  10 a share and it goes to  15 a share it s a good stock  In contrast  if you buy a stock at  15 a share and it goes to 10 a share it s a bad stock  Meanwhile  the operating performance  earnings results  is mostly ignored while often irrational price gyrations are excessively fixated upon  Of course  I understand why people behave this way  but I still can t help but be very frustrated by this behavior    Early in my career  I had the good fortune to study the philosophies and investing strategies of many of the greatest investors of all time  Perhaps the most important thing I learned by doing this  was how much common ground that the great investors all shared  But even more importantly  was their willingness to share their principles and axioms with the rest of us  at least the rest of us that were willing to listen  The following is a series of axioms and quotes from some of my favorite great investors of all time  with some clarification interjected by me to support the thesis of this article    Peter Lynch   Here Peter is telling us that price movement is not the true indication of a company s True Worth     Just because you buy a stock and it goes up does not mean you are right  Just because you buy a stock and it goes down does not mean you are wrong   Peter Lynch  One Up On Wall Street    With this quote  Peter is validating my thesis that the success of the business is more important than short term gyrations in stock price     What makes stocks valuable in the long run isn t the market  It s the profitability of the shares in the companies you own  As corporate profits increase  corporations become more valuable and sooner or later  their shares will sell for a higher price   Peter Lynch  Worth Magazine  September 1995      Warren Buffett   This first Warren Buffett quote shows that he recognizes that stock prices do not always reflect a company s true value  Sometimes  and more often than we like to admit  the market gets price wrong     Great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised  It s only when the tide goes out that you learn who s been swimming naked  Warren Buffett    Warren buys the business  not the stock  therefore  he doesn t even care if they close the market  His focus is on how well the business is performing     I never attempt to make money on the stock market  I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years  Warren Buffett    Ben Graham   Ben believes that true investors can take advantage of market pricing errors by focusing on the company s dividends and business success     Basically  price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor  They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal  At other times he will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies  Ben Graham    Here Mr  Graham tells us that true investors base their buy and sell decisions on the value of the business behind the stock  Moreover  he suggests that investors recognize the miss appraisals of the market when they occur  and are therefore empowered to behave accordingly     The most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stock market movements  The speculator s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations  The investor s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices  Market movements are important to him in a practical sense  because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell  Ben Graham    Philip Fisher   The great Philip Fisher clearly understood that the value of the business was more important than its current price  This article is based on focusing on the value of the business  instead of only thinking about the price of the stock     The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything  but the value of nothing    Philip Fisher    Philip Fischer believed in owning fine businesses that he thoroughly researched over very long periods of time  Therefore  he was willing to accept the occasional short term erroneous pricing behavior of the marketplace     If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased  the time to sell it is almost never     Philip Fisher    Bernard Baruch   Here Mr  Baruch is warning us that timing the market is impossible     Don t try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top  It can t be done except by liars   Bernard Baruch   I believe that with this quip Baruch is pointing out that there is a difference between being a shareholder in a business and a trader of stocks     I made my money by selling too soon    Bernard Baruch  Martin J  Whitman   I will end my sharing of the wisdom of investing greats with one final tidbit from the venerable Marty J  Whitman  To paraphrase Marty s wisdom in more everyday terms  he is saying that it s easier to value a business based on analyzing its fundamentals than it is to try and guess where the price of the stock may go over the short to intermediate term     I remain impressed with how much easier it is for us  and everybody else who has modicum of training  to determine what a business is worth  and what the dynamics of the business might be  compared with estimating the prices at which a non arbitrage security will sell in near term markets   Martin J  Whitman  Chairman of the Board  Third Avenue Value Fund   The Price versus Value Conundrum   To illustrate the validity of the thesis behind this article  I offer five well known companies and list them in the following table by order of price performance highest to the lowest since calendar year 2006  Note that this time frame includes the great recession of 2008  Following the table I provide an expanded view of each of these companies  performance based on price movement and dividend income since 2006 An Expanded View of Total Return Price Performance Plus Dividend IncomeNike Inc   NKE  Oracle Corp  ORCL TEVA Pharmaceutical  TEVA Hewlett Packard Co   HPQ The Best Five Business ResultsWith this next table I list the same five companies  only this time I list them by order of best business results  earnings growth  from highest to lowest  Notice how this reverses the order dramatically as Nike goes from first place to last place  With this next set of graphs I am focusing on what I consider to be the most important performance measurement  the business results of each company Earnings Growth the True Measure of Business Performance These next  plot the earnings performance of each of our sample companies listed in order of best performance to worst   I ve highlighted each year s earnings to include the rate of change of earnings growth between each year at the bottom of each graph  Oracle Corp  ORCL TEVA Pharmaceutical  TEVA Hewlett Packard Co   HPQ Nike Inc   NKE  The Earnings and Price Correlation as a Measurement of ValuationWith this final set of graphics I bring in monthly closing stock prices and correlate them to earnings  As I stated earlier  one of the primary reasons I chose these specific examples was because all of them were more or less reasonably valued at the beginning of calendar year 2007  Therefore  there was very little overvaluation bias built into their stock price performance  Moreover  at the end of this time period three of our four examples are undervalued  with only Nike currently being valued above its earnings justified valuation level by Mr  Market The illogical nature of this anomalous pricing should be clearly evident  Nike had the worst operating performance  yet the best total return Common sense dictates that the better a business does  the better rewarded their shareholders should be  However  since Nike s business results are clearly the lowest of this group  it should logically follow that they had the weakest stock market results  Since this did not happen  it validates the position that stock price behavior cannot be trusted  Yet unfortunately  price behavior is what most stockholders focus upon Oracle Corp  ORCL TEVA Pharmaceutical  TEVA Hewlett Packard Co   HPQ Nike Inc   NKE  Summary and Conclusions   The real purpose behind this article was to illustrate as clearly as I possibly could how the market can often mislead investors  When the market is pricing a stock for more than it s worth  investors emboldened by their good fortune tend to become overconfident in both their holding and their investing acumen  Consequently  they fail and or even refuse to acknowledge the impending danger of continuing to hold onto an overvalued stock  Even worse  the more overvalued it gets  the more arrogant they become    In contrast  when the market is pricing a stock for far less than it is worth  investors will typically panic and sell what they should be buying more of  The problem is  as Phil Fischer s quote so aptly put it      The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything  but the value of nothing    Philip Fisher    Consequently  I believe in investing in high quality  well run  profitable and growing businesses in contrast to playing the stock market  Over many years of doing this  I learned that the market will often place the wrong value on a business based on the emotional responses of so called investors  Of course  we all know these emotions as either fear or greed  In my opinion  there is no place for the emotional response when dealing with something as important as your financial future    As a business perspective investor  I am prepared to ignore the often irrational volatility of Mr  Market  I focus much more on the actual business results of the companies I own  and much less on whether the price is rising or falling in a wacky market  To be clear  if I am not intending to sell my stock today  then today s price means very little to me  I like stocks because of the liquidity they provide  However  the price for liquidity is volatility    Furthermore  there s an interesting aside to all of this that I find fascinating and even curious  Whenever I see market pundits debating the merits of owning or selling a specific stock  they re almost universally offering up their beliefs about why the business is going to be strong or weak in the future  Quite often  their views will be in total contradiction to the actual facts  However  when you read between the lines  their biases are always a function of recent price movement  If the price is rising they are very pro the business  if prices are falling they will posit about how and why the business is going to falter    Finally  I would like to point out that what I ve written here is all about being a long term investor in quality businesses  To paraphrase what Ben Graham once said  investing is most intelligent when it is most business like  I only see the  stock market  as the place in which I shop to buy the great businesses that I m interested in being an owner of  But most importantly  as long as the business remains strong  I worry very little about short term market behavior  My policy is that it is never a good idea to sell a valuable asset for less than it s worth just because someone offered me a ridiculously low price  Therefore  I spend most of my time and effort attempting to determine the value of my business regardless of its current price
