consensus estimate of growth of 1 5   Higher productivity will enable producers to raise workers  pay without hiking the price of finished products  Consequently  higher wage will benefit workers

123876,345391,DVA,5 Stocks With Amazingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios To Own Now,opinion,Price to earnings  P E   given its apparent simplicity  is the most commonly used metric in the value investing world  The ratio enjoys greater popularity among valuation metrics in the investment toolkit and is preferred while uncovering stocks trading at attractive prices  But even this straightforward  easy to calculate equity valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Choice While P E is by far the most popular valuation metric  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA does a better job in working out the fair market value of a firm  Often viewed as a better substitute to P E  this ratio offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and its earnings potential Also dubbed as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other component of the ratio  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates P E also can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements As such  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome  But you can club it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since

123879,345394,DVA,5 Buffett Style Value Picks Boasting Impressive PEG Ratio,opinion,Value investing is gaining popularity by the day  The success of value investors like Warren Buffett further underscores this  According to an article by Rajiv Bhuva  Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger managed to drive 20 9  compound annual growth in the market value of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  from 1965 to 2017  Book value per share rose at a CAGR of 19 1   from  19 to  211 750  in these 53 years However  this apparently simple to understand investing discipline has its own share of pitfalls  Value investors often miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  In their quest for cheaper stocks  they often end up picking stocks that have weak prospects Buffett believes that proper understanding of the  intrinsic value  of a stock may ease out many problems with regard to value investment  According to him  going by the fundamentals of value investing  while picking undervalued stocks  investors need to focus on the stocks  earnings growth potential While yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings  sales or book value are the most common value investing metrics that can single out stocks trading at a discount  these ratios fail to consider the potential of a stock  PEG is the ratio with the earnings growth component in it The PEG ratio is defined as   Price Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth  followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than M Industry Median  for more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five out of the 26 stocks that qualified the screening Guess   Inc    NYSE GES    This famous global lifestyle brand designs  markets  distributes and licenses a lifestyle collection of contemporary apparel  denim  handbags  watches  eyewear  footwear and other related consumer products  The stock can be an impressive value

123910,345425,DVA,5 Stocks To Buy On A Possible Second Rate Cut In September,opinion,The trade war between the United States and China took an ugly turn on Aug 1  with President Donald Trump s tweet signaling the next round of tariff on  300 billion Chinese goods  effective Sep 1 On Aug 5  China retaliated with a double whammy  First  China is taking steps to stop purchasing agricultural products from the United States  Second  the world s second largest economy allowed its currency yuan to drop below a key psychological barrier Trump s Tariff and China s Answer  Effect on U S  EconomyThe United Sates has already levied 25  tariff on  250 billion Chinese exports while China has reciprocated with 25  tariff on  110 billion U S  goods  So far  the U S  government has imposed tariff on intermediary goods to be used by the country s corporates to develop high tech products However  68  of the new set of  300 billion Chinese goods  which will face 10  tariff  will be either on consumer goods or auto parts  This is likely to severely dent consumer confidence besides gradually dampening business confidence  Trump further stated that tariff rate could increase to 25  later Meanwhile  on Aug 5  China s state run media Xinhua reported that The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council may impose tariffs on U S  agricultural products purchased after Aug 3  Consequently  Chinese companies are halting purchase of U S  agricultural goods  Notably  one of the major issues that the United States raised during trade negotiations was that China must substantially increase imports of U S  farm products Finally and most importantly  China allowed its currency yuan to fell below 7 to a U S  dollar for the first time since 2008  Notably  the U S  dollar   yuan exchange rate of 7 is considered as a psychological barrier  On Aug 5  offshore yuan fell to 7 10 while onshore yuan plunged to 7 05 The People s Bank of China has already signaled that it may reduce yuan s price further if the U S  government increases tariff rate  Lowering yuan s price  China will make its goods attractive in the United States  enabling it to make up for some tariff related revenue losses Following the development  the U S  Treasury Department called China a currency manipulator  For investors  knowledge  the last time China made a similar move was in 1994 during Bill Clinton s presidency As a result   the U S  government will now move to the IMF to make a formal complaint against China s currency manipulation  However  whether IMF will impose a penalty on China is not clear Will Fed Adopt a More Dovish Stance On Jul 31  the Fed reduced the benchmark lending rate by a quarter basis point for the first time since September 2008  However  Fed Chair Jerome Powell s statement that this rate cut is to  insure against downside risks   and is no signal that this is the start of a lengthy rate cut cycle  sent shock waves through Wall Street Meanwhile  the situation has changed drastically over the last five days after the U S  China trade conflict heightened  In its last FOMC meeting  Fed cited three concerns     U S  China trade spat  global economic slowdown and muted inflation     for lowering interest rate The U S  China trade war is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon  Levying more tariffs  especially on consumer goods  will directly put the burden on U S  consumers  affecting their purchasing power  The U S  economy  though still growing for the 11th year  has slowed down  Hurting consumers  spending power may result in economic recession later this year or early next year   Moreover  trade conflict is also affecting the global economy  especially the European Union and Japan  which suffering from a severe manufacturing sector downturn  Across the world  investors are opting for safe haven government bonds from risky equities  resulting in falling yields to a historically low level As signs of deterioration emerge  the central bank may feel compelled to cut rate for the second time in September in line with its commitment to act as appropriate to sustain U S  economic expansion  The devaluation of yuan has already strengthened the cause for a rate cut On Jul 31  in his lecture on the FOMC decision  the Fed Chair reiterated his earlier commitment  Powell said   It s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts   while adding   I didn t say it s just one  move  Once again  an indication of more cuts is not ruled out if the central bank thinks it is genuinely needed   Our Top PicksUnder these

123912,345427,DVA,Is DaVita  DVA  A Profitable Stock For Value Investors Now  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DaVita has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 11  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 78  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DaVita s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 51  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that DaVita has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 19  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  DaVita has a P S ratio of about 0 86  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  DVA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  DaVita currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DaVita a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too     For example  the PEG ratio for DaVita is just 0 56  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 24  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio comes in at 7 95  which is lower than the industry average of 10 83  Clearly  DVA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall    Though DaVita might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives DVA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen seven upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period      This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 12 9  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched up by 12 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DaVita Inc  Price and Consensus

123965,345480,DVA,Trump s Kidney Disease Executive Order May Boost This Health Stock  Tank Others,opinion,"President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that will encourage an increase in kidney transplants  This is a move to address a critical issue in the 2020 election cycle  astronomical healthcare costs 
Kidney disease currently costs the U S  government about  110 billion per year through Medicaid and Medicare  The major problem is that a large portion of patients with kidney disease chose to undergo dialysis at costly treatment centers  instead of opting for at home care or  ideally  a transplant 
The goal of this order is a 25  reduction in end stage kidney disease by 2030  It directs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop policies to reduce the number of Americans developing kidney failure  reduce the number of patients requiring dialysis  and increase the number of kidneys available for transplant 
Trump s new executive order creates new payment models that make transplants more attractive and pushes for further development of artificial kidneys  Analysts project that this order will fuel 12 15  annual growth in the number of completed kidney transplants 
Which Companies will Benefit 
CareDx   NASDAQ CDNA   sells a post transplant diagnostic service for heart and kidney transplants  This diagnostic tool measures the level of cell free DNA  DNA fragments from dead cells  in the bloodstream to predict whether the organ is being actively rejected  Therefore  doctors can decide on an appropriate course of treatment to maximize the chances of a successful transplant  CareDx s tool is better than traditional methods as it is non invasive and more accurate  It is also FDA cleared and covered by Medicare 
The new executive order benefits CareDx by increasing its products addressable market  If more people are getting kidney transplants  more people will need post transplant care  The total market for heart and kidney transplant care is currently  2 6 billion annually  with CareDx already a major player  CDNA has already captured 30  of the market for post heart transplant diagnostics and 5  of the market for post kidney transplant diagnostics  And the firm s kidney testing technology is still fairly new  so its market share is expected to grow quickly 
CareDx has already performed well in 2019  with growth of 62 8  YTD  much higher than the broader medical care market  Our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for current year earnings growth of 160   with 2020 s earnings projected to jump 577  above our 2019 estimate 
CDNA is currently a Zack Rank  3  Hold   But this ranking may change if and when analysts update their estimates following Trump s new kidney focused executive order  CDNA has also met or beaten our consensus earnings estimate in all of the past five quarters 
CDNA s stock price jumped 2 20  to  39 43 Wednesday  in reaction to the executive order  The stock is now up 11 5  over the last five days 

Dialysis Downside
On the other side of this executive order are the companies that provide dialysis to patients who have kidney disease and do not undergo a transplant  If transplant rates increase  dialysis providers will lose patients and therefore revenue

123991,345506,DVA,Should Value Investors Consider DaVita  DVA  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DaVita has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 4  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DaVita s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18 7 over the past five years  with the metric facing significant instability over the past few months  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical Care sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that DaVita has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for DVA stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  DaVita has a P S ratio of about 0 8  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  DVA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DaVita currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DaVita a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for DaVita is just 0 5  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DVA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DaVita might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives DVA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen four estimates go down in the past sixty days compared no movement in the other direction  The full year estimate has seen five down and one up over the same time period This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 8 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has slumped 5 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DaVita Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineDaVita is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 36  of more than 250 industries  boosts our confidence  However  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  wouldn t you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year From more than 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market

124017,345532,DVA,Humana Kindred Deal Keeps Shakeout Alive In Healthcare Space,opinion,"Health insurer Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   has signed an agreement to acquire Kindred at Home  a unit of Kindred Healthcare Inc Details of the DealTPG Capital and Welsh  Carson  Anderson   Stowe and Humana have formed a joint venture to buy Kindred for nearly  4 1 billion including the acquired company s debt  Humana will occupy a 40  stake for  800 million in Kindred at Home  which will be separated from the rest of the company after the deal  The transaction will see light by the summer of 2018 and will be slightly accretive to the company s earnings per share in 2019 and beyond Essence of the Deal for HumanaThe deal will provide a vertical integration for Humana and aligns with the company s strategy to grow in the home healthcare arena  The deal will allow the company to provide an improved care to patients at low cost This transaction will provide Humana with an extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65  overlap with Humana s individual Medicare Advantage membership  The company will also have full access to extensive clinical capabilities to better serve its members A deal of this kind comes as no surprise to us given that the company had kept its eyes wide open for such attractive acquisitions after its failed merger with Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   earlier in the year  The company s balance sheet with strong financial flexibility also provides enough support for capital deployment activities Last week  the company s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program to buy back its common stock worth up to  3 billion Share Price PerformanceYear to date  the stock has rallied 21   significantly underperforming the  s growth of 43   Nonetheless  the recent announcement  a well poised Medicare business as its solid balance sheet should drive the shares higher 
Industry Trend
A spate of similar deals is witnessed in the industry of late  driven by the increasing trend of health insurers foraying into patient care business  The mega merger of CVS Health Corp    NYSE CVS   with Aetna aims to dispense affordable cure to patients at their convenience closer home or at an outpatient location 
Further competition is lent by UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics  urgent care facilities and surgery centers  Recently  UnitedHealth Group s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly  5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc  s   NYSE DVA   Medical Group along with its clinics and urgent care centers 
The central tenet for all these deals is to cut costs and improve care  These developments mark the coming forward of health insurers to play a more direct role in providing actual medical services and move beyond offering insurance 
These deals seeking to reduce hospitalizations  lower emergency room visits and allowing physicians and clinicians to extend their care all the way to a patient s home are  however  detrimental to hospital companies  business and survival 
Going Forward
The ripple of shakeup in the health care industry started by CVS Aetna deal continues to trend higher  One after another player continues to join the bandwagon of consolidation  Given the urgent need  in the rapidly transforming health care industry  for increase in heft and size  restraint of sky high medical costs plus diversification of business  we won t be surprised if we hear more of deals along similar lines going forward

124018,345533,DVA,Can Walgreens  Retail Pharmacy USA Segment Drive Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc  s   NASDAQ WBA   Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market  Several planned developments  early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters  We expect this momentum to get reflected in fiscal first quarter 2018 results  which are scheduled for release on Jan 4 Moreover  rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board expects this trend to continue  Per the report  prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7  between 2018 and 2019 Challenges in the Retail Pharmacy USAPer management  the pharmacy business is affected by reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix toward 90 day at retail  one prescription that is equivalent of three 30 day prescriptions  and Medicare Part D prescriptions  Moreover  the company expects these factors to affect first quarter fiscal 2018 results Moreover  collaborations among generic producers and a rise in generic dispensing rate  the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed  raise caution The speculated entry of Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   in the retail pharmacy market has aggravated matters  To counter competition  Walgreens Boots will have to add more digital and customer friendly programs Intensifying competition owing to mergers and acquisitions is also a matter of concern  In this regard  CVS Health   NYSE CVS   announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna   NYSE AET    Following the announcement of the CVS Aetna deal  another leading health service company   Optum  part of the UnitedHealth Group   NYSE UNH     announced plans to acquire DaVita Medical Group  a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA    Moreover  it is being speculated that Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT   might soon announce the acquisition of health and well being company  Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   to fend off competition Steps to Counter ObstacleWalgreens Boots has been leaving no stone unturned to counter challenges In this regard  the company has been developing and expanding relationships with commercial third party payers to permit new and enhanced market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks  Notably  CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30 000 store performance based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots  as well as up to 10 000 community based independently owned pharmacies in the United States Per management  the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time  The company s 90 day at retail prescription drug offering is a lower margin one in comparison to 30 day prescriptions  However  it helps the company tap into opportunities pertaining to patients with chronic prescription needs  It also offers increased convenience and cost efficiency  The company s U S  loyalty program  Balance Rewards  also bodes well  Notably  as of Aug 31  2017  the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88 2 million Rite Aid Deal a PositiveWe currently look forward to the company s agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid Corporation  RAD  stores  While the transition process of these stores is underway  the company expects this phased acquisition to be completed by spring 2018  Notably  Walgreens Boots has purchased 1 932 stores  three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of  4 375 billion Although the deal is not going to impact the yet to be reported quarter s results  a number of aspects of it should prove beneficial in 2018  In this regard  the final Rite Aid deal agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots  affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens Boots  for about 10 years  Also  Rite Aid will provide Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post deal closure This apart  the deal s financial value is quite attractive  Post the transaction s initial closing  synergies of  300 million are expected to be realized within four years  This will be derived primarily from procurement  cost savings and other operational matters Per Walgreens Boots  this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational plus financial benefits  It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U S  markets  including the Northeast  Notably  the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States  while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville  CT  Philadelphia  PA and Spartanburg  S C  However  to achieve the desired results  the company will have to incur huge expenditures to fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores Here is what our quantitative model

124046,345561,DVA,UnitedHealth Continues Healthcare Shakeup With DaVita Deal,opinion,"On Wednesday  only a few days after the CVS   NYSE CVS   and Aetna   NYSE AET   deal helped shine a light on the quickly changing healthcare industry  UnitedHealth Group   NYSE UNH   announced that it will buy a unit of DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA   for nearly  5 billion 
UnitedHealth  the country s biggest health insurer  announced that its Optum division reached an agreement to acquire DaVita Medical Group for roughly  4 9 billion in cash  This deal  which is expected to close in 2018  is aimed to help expand UnitedHealth s primary and urgent care services 
UnitedHealth hopes to pair DaVita Medical Group s 300 medical clinics  35 urgent care centers  and six outpatient surgery centers which reach around 1 7 million patients a year with Optum s massive insurance division 
 Combining DaVita Medical Group and Optum advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways while working with more than 300 health care payers across Optum in ways that better meet the needs of their members   Optum CEO Larry C  Renfro said in a statement 
Optum also runs its own primary and urgent care centers  surgery centers  and senior and advanced care centers  Officials at both companies noted that the deal aims to help improve and streamline the ability to treat patients 
This move is part of a growing shift for health insurers to play a more direct role in actual medical services  Many health insurers now want to be able to provide their own patient care as often as possible  The deal will hopefully  and improve care  given the proximity and number of care centers especially for people with non life threatening  chronic conditions 
The move comes after CVS announced its acquisition of healthcare benefits giant Aetna on Sunday  The  69 billion deal will allow the companies to offer more  at CVS stores 
UnitedHealth s latest deal is its second acquisition in 2017 aimed at bolstering its offerings beyond insurance  In March  UnitedHealth  Surgical Care Affiliates for  2 3 billion

124056,345571,DVA,PBM Industry Shows Strength  3 Stocks In Focus,opinion,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers  PBM  in the U S  healthcare sector has been evolving  From being just third party administrators of prescription drug programs  PBMs have come a long way  PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end users 
Notably  PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies  discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts  These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims 
As per Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimates  PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30  in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing  data published in  The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers  by Orszag and Green  
Undoubtedly  the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend  Per a report by Market Research Reports biz  the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7 16  between 2014 and 2019 
Factors Driving PBM
Historically  there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market  Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system 
We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U S  healthcare spending  Per the report  the U S  healthcare spending is projected to rise to around  5 5 trillion by 2025  representing 19 9  of Gross Domestic Product  based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025  
The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans  Per a report by Technavio  nearly 14 4  of the U S  population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism 
Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend  Per the report  prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7  between 2018 and 2019 
Per a 2017 Economic Report on U S  Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers  specialty drugs accounted for about one third of the pharmacy industry s revenues in 2016 
Mergers   Acquisitions Change PBM Landscape
The PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players  In 2007  CVS  merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark  now CVS Health   NYSE CVS    had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs  Again  CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna   NYSE AET   
People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health s PBM business  Notably  a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market 
Following the announcement of the CVS Aetna deal  another leading health service company   Optum  part of the UnitedHealth Group   NYSE UNH     announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group  a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA   
Moreover  it is being speculated that Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT   might soon announce the acquisition of health and well being company  Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   to counter competition 
3 Stocks to Scoop Up
As the PBM industry is constantly expanding  this industry is worth keeping an eye on  Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects 
CVS Health  Headquartered in Woonsocket  RI  CVS Health  with its subsidiaries  provides integrated pharmacy health care services  This leading PBM company has a market cap of about  73 8 billion  Its earnings are estimated to grow 9 1  in the next three to five years 
Apart from the Aetna deal earlier  CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30 000 store performance based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ WBA    as well as up to 10 000 community based independently owned pharmacies across the United States  Through this initiative  the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS  PBM customers 
CVS Health Corporation Price
   Express Scripts   NASDAQ ESRX    Headquartered in Saint Louis  MO  Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States  Canada and Europe  The company has a market cap of about  38 83 billion  Its earnings are estimated to grow 9 7  in the next three to five years 
Notably  the company s PBM segment offers clinical solutions  specialized pharmacy care  home delivery and specialty pharmacy  retail network pharmacy administration  benefit design consultation  drug utilization review  drug formulary management  administration of a group purchasing organization  and consumer health and drug information services  Moreover  this segment provides Medicare  Medicaid  and health insurance marketplace products 
The company recently announced plans to acquire privately held and evidence based medical benefit management services provider   eviCore healthcare  Notably  by integrating eviCore s medical benefits management  MBM  platform with its PBM offering  Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs 
Express Scripts Holding Company Price
   Rite Aid Corporation   NYSE RAD    Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments  Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States  The company has a market cap of about  1 91 billion Notably  the company s Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy related services  This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs  offers integrated mail order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services  and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program 
Rite Aid Corporation Price
   Bottom Line
Although these companies have solid prospects  they are exposed to challenges like legal regulations  reimbursement pressure and the speculated entry of Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   in the PBM market Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

124070,345585,DVA,Is DaVita A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DaVita has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DaVita s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having fallen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Medical   Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that DaVita has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 18 6  which is higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  DaVita s P CF ratio of 6 5 is significantly lower than the Zacks classified Medical   Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry average of 11 3  which indicates that the stock is hugely undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DaVita currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DaVita a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P S ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 0 9  which is far better than the industry average of 1 1  Clearly  DVA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DaVita might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives DVA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and seven down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock has a long term expected earnings growth of 9 8  and sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   These mixed expectations indicate that while the stock s growth story might be good over the long term  analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDaVita is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a better industry rank  top 38  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you

performing government business will mainly influence the earnings of the players  Most insurers incurred losses from the public exchange business in the first half of the year and the trend is unlikely to reverse this quarter  Although insurance companies had expected better profitability in 2016 after making meager profits in 2015  the individual exchange business disappointed the firms Nevertheless  HMO industry players are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium from the government businesses   Medicare  Medicare Advantage and Medicaid  A surge in the baby boomer population led to higher demand for these policies In addition  a higher number of enrollees in the Medicare  Medicaid and Medicare Advantage businesses is expected to have driven membership growth in the third quarter  However  this upside might have been partly offset by a decline in membership on the public exchange business Moreover  strong balance sheets with low leverage and attractive organic cash flow generation  along with excess capital in the form of statutory reserves and parent cash continue to make this sector attractive Another subsector providing clinical research and laboratory services is expected to see top line growth as pharmaceutical companies continue to increasingly outsource clinical development and commercialization support activities  Moreover  increased use of technology and data assets will drive the performance of the players in this sub segment Here  we take a sneak peek at four healthcare stocks scheduled to report their third quarter figures on Nov 2
