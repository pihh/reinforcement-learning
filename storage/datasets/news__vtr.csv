133766,355281,VTR,Exposed  How I m Grabbing Monthly 7 9  Dividends As Rates Plunge,opinion,"If you ever want to retire  or stay retired    you ve got a big problem  Bonds don t pay much now  and they re likely to pay less and less in the months and years ahead 
I probably don t have to tell you that the yield on the 10 year Treasury note has crashed to 1 6   In other words  a  500K investment would get you a pathetic  4 000 in interest income every six months  as Treasuries only pay semiannually  unlike the three strong monthly dividend payers I ll show you shortly  
Then there s the specter of negative interest rates  something folks in many countries already know  today   15 trillion of government bonds around the world are sloshing around with yields below zero 
Imagine that  you put your cash in a  safe  Treasury and a decade later get back less than you invested 
Wall Street is already dialed in to this threat  Bob Michele  CIO and head of global fixed income at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Asset Management  recently said he sees the yield on the 10 year going to zero  Former Fed chief Alan Greenspan said this   There is no barrier for US Treasury yields going below zero  Zero has no meaning  beside a certain level  
Your Retirement Lifeboat  Safe Dividends Paid Monthly
With negative rates a real possibility  we need to move your income stream from this  
Treasuries  Shrinking Payout




  to steady 5   payouts like this one  from pick No  3 below  
A Retiree s Dream




Unlike Treasuries and S P 500 stocks  the three 5   dividends I ll show you today drop cash into your account monthly  giving you a payment stream that nicely lines up with your bills 
So let s dive in  starting with 
Monthly Dividend Pick No  1  LTC Properties  LTC 
Healthcare  LTC invests in 204 facilities in 28 states  Fifty percent are assisted living  which help seniors live independently for as long as possible  and 50  are skilled nursing  for more frequent care  

So  you can see right away that LTC is in the path of a wave of retiring baby boomers  Even so  it s trailed the REIT benchmark Vanguard Real Estate ETF  VNQ  this year 
LTC s Lag Gives Us Our In




That s because LTC is dealing with three troubled operators  including one that filed for bankruptcy protection 
However  LTC has already moved six buildings run by one of these operators to others  it expects to sell most of the 11 run by another by the end of 2019  and it has other takers waiting to grab the 11 run by the third troubled operator  As a result  management feels it can now focus more on growth 
Meantime  management kept per share funds from operations  FFO  a better REIT metric than earnings  steady  between  0 75 and 0 77 in each of the last four quarters  That leaves the dividend at 75  of the last 12 months of FFO low in REIT land  where ratios of 85  and up are common 
And here s something else that makes LTC even more stable  the stock boasts a  beta  rating of 0 44  so it s less than half as volatile as the S P 500  And thanks to its domestic focus  it doesn t give a hoot about the trade war  which is why it s gained since August 1  while the S P 500 faltered 
Your Rx for Trade War Worries





Finally  LTC trades at 15 8 times FFO  a discount to industry leader  and quarterly payer  Ventas  VTR   at 18 3 times 
Monthly Dividend Pick No  2  Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund  THQ 
For a more diversified healthcare play  look to THQ  a  boasting an outsized 7 9  monthly dividend 
And how s this for a steady payout 
A Retirement Friendly 7 9  Dividend




THQ is young  launched in early 2014  But don t let that stop you  because this fund is run by a biotech all star team 

That would be Tekla Capital Management  a Boston firm boasting a team of medical doctors  researchers and investment pros  Dr  Daniel R  Olmstead runs Tekla  which he joined nearly 20 years ago  His researchers come from big players  like Merck   Co   MRK B   as well as tiny biotech firms 
With pharma stocks  success is all about the drug pipeline  And THQ s savvy crew gives us the closest thing to inside knowledge of these firms  pipelines we can get 

Their approach has paid off  THQ has pummeled the iShares US Pharmaceuticals ETF  IHE   including its huge 7 9  dividend  since the CEF s launch 
The Power of Expert Management




These days  THQ is honing in on the biggest companies in the space  with the most robust pipelines  like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  and  Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   THQ also holds healthcare picks beyond pharma  like insurer Anthem  NYSE ANTM  
The kicker  THQ is a bargain  at a 9  discount to net asset value  NAV  or the value of the stocks in RNP s portfolio   That s way too cheap for a  megatrend  fund yielding 7 9  and dropping that payout monthly 
Monthly Dividend Pick No  3  Cohen   Steers REIT and Preferred and Income Fund  RNP 
RNP owns the steady monthly dividend I showed you before we talked about LTC  a  0 124 per share  or  1 49 a year  payout that hits your account every 30  or 31  days  The fund yields 6 6  today 
RNP gives you a ton of diversification in just one buy  it splits its portfolio 48  to REITs and 52  toward preferred shares issued by banks  insurance companies  utilities and REITs themselves 
If you re not familiar with preferreds  they re hybrids offering aspects of both stocks and bonds  They can trade on an exchange  but they trade around a par value and dole out a set regular payment  like a bond 
And those payouts can be huge  many preferreds yield in the 6  to 7  range 
Here s something else I love about RNP  it zeroes in on sectors tied to megatrends like infrastructure spending  data demand and  yes  the aging population  Meantime  it downplays trade war losers like industrials  3  of the portfolio  and shopping malls  3   




This savvy management has driven RNP  in blue below  ahead of both the S P 500  in orange  and VNQ  in red  since inception in 2004 
A High Yield Market Beater




Let s talk valuation  you can grab RNP at a 5 5  discount to NAV today 
That s not as cheap as it was early this year  but we still have plenty of upside here  especially as lower rates cut the borrowing costs of both RNP like many CEFs  the fund uses a modest amount of leverage to boost returns and the REITs it holds

133768,355283,VTR,What s In The Cards For SL Green Realty  SLG  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,SL Green Realty Corp    NYSE SLG   is slated to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 16  after the market closes  The company s quarterly results will likely reflect year over year growth funds from operations  FFO  per share  while revenues are anticipated to have declined In the last reported quarter  this New York office landlord reported FFO of  1 82 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 73  The tally included promote income from the sale of 521 Fifth Avenue of  3 4 million or 4 cents per share  The company also witnessed revenue growth Over the preceding four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion  met in the other and missed in another two  It reported an average negative surprise of 0 88  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Factors to ConsiderOffice landlords have been battling with slow leasing velocity as supply growth remains at cycle highs  In fact  per a  by the Newmark Knight Frank  the third quarter office leasing at Manhattan reached 10 6 million square feet  declining 26 3  from the quarter ago tally of 14 4 million square feet of space  Further  net absorption was negative 219 434 square feet  These declines can be attributed to the addition of 14 large blocks of space in the market during the September end quarter Further  in Midtown Manhattan  5 1 million square feet of space was leased during the quarter  indicating the lowest leasing velocity since third quarter 2015 Particularly  as of Jun 30  2019  the company witnessed an 80 basis point drop in its Manhattan s same store occupancy  inclusive of leases signed but not yet commenced   Given the uninspiring leasing fundamentals of the Manhattan market  this trend will likely have continued in the third quarter as well  given SL Green s predominant presence in Manhattan and New York Metropolitan area Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter 2019 revenues is pinned at  215 6 million  reflecting a year over year decline of 2 8  Also  prior to the to be reported quarter s earnings release  there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at  1 73  over the past 30 days  Encouragingly  it indicated year over year growth of 2 4  Also  in July  the company signed a lease with Ulta Beauty  Inc    NASDAQ ULTA    the largest national beauty retailer  renting out 12 040 square feet of space at 2 Herald Square  NYSE SQ   With this lease  the property s retail space is now 100  leased  The strategic location of the property at one of Manhattan s coveted retail submarkets and high foot traffic in the region has likely enabled the company to execute this deal  This is expected to have supported SL Green s retail leasing velocity in the September end quarter Key Developments in Q3 In September  SL Green Realtyannounced that its trophy office tower in East Midtown in New York City   One Vanderbilt   has topped out at 1 401 feet  With this  the building s construction is ahead of its schedule by more than three months and  100 million under budget Given the development project s scale and infrastructural complexity  this is a notable foot  In fact  by reaching the full height  it is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in New York City  and Midtown s tallest office building Furthermore  the tower has witnessed active leasing and is currently 59  leased  The property is anticipated to open in August 2020 Earnings

133805,355320,VTR,SL Green  SLG  Gears Up For Q2 Earnings  A Beat In Store ,opinion,SL Green Realty Corp    NYSE SLG   is slated to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 17  after the market closes  The company s quarterly results will likely reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this New York office landlord reported FFO of  1 68 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 72  This tally was net of a non cash charge of  2 million  related to a tenant bankruptcy at 625 Madison Avenue  Nonetheless  the reported figure compared favorably with the first quarter 2018 tally of  1 66 Over the preceding four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions  met in the other and missed in another  It delivered an average negative surprise of 2 03  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Ventas  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Factors to ConsiderSL Green s office and retail platforms have dominant market share in the large  and high barrier to entry New York real estate market  making the company a preeminent leader in the region Per a  by the Newmark Knight Frank  the second quarter office leasing at Midtown Manhattan reached 8 1 million  surpassing the record set in fourth quarter 2018  However  with the addition of numerous large blocks of space being added in the market during the June end quarter  availability remained flat  while average asking rents shrunk to  82 27 per square foot Hence  reaping benefits of the active leasing market  in April  the company entered into a contract to acquire a majority and controlling stake in the property at 460 West 34th Street  Further  it bagged First Republic Bank as anchor tenant at the building  The bank is set to occupy 211 521 square feet of space for corporate offices for a period of 15 years Additionally  making progress with leasing at One Vanderbilt office tower  the company signed a new lease with KPS Capital Partners LP for 28 024 square feet of space and rented out an additional 14 276 square feet of space to McDermott Will   Emery LLP These deals indicate the company to have enjoyed decent demand for its office properties amid decent economy and a steady job market  Particularly  as the economy revives  existing business grows and therefore  corporate sectors seek expansion  renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce  Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter 2019 revenues is pinned at  213 5 million

133806,355321,VTR,What s In Store For Blackstone Mortgage s  BXMT  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  Inc    NYSE BXMT    formerly known as Capital Trust  Inc   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 earnings on Jul 23  after the closing bell  The company s quarterly earnings per share  EPS  and net interest income  NII  are expected to decline year over year In the last reported quarter  this real estate finance company reported core earnings of 71 cents that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents  Further  its book value per share as of Mar 31  2019 was  27 32 Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all four occasions  It delivered an average positive surprise of 13 3  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Capital Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayBlackstone Mortgage s investment programs focus on loans and securities backed by commercial real estate assets  The company enjoys a top notch portfolio with specific focus on senior loans that is secured by institutional quality real estate  This will help the company generate attractive returns on equity  ROE  and enable it to maintain dividend growth In the quarter under review  the company raised around  307 million by issuing 8 6 million shares of common stock  These funds will likely be used to originate desirable commercial real estate mortgage loans  Further  the transaction is expected to be accretive to the company s book value per share This April  the company closed a  500 million senior secured term loan facility  carrying an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2 50   The loan matures in April 2026  This provides the company with higher funds and improves its financial flexibility  While the company originated or acquired  698 7 million of loans in first quarter 2019  we anticipate the momentum to continue in the second quarter as well However  the company s business model is such that declining interest rates will depress its net income  Furthermore  majority of the company s loan portfolio earns a floating rate of interest  This makes Blackstone Mortgage s core earnings sensitive to changes in interest rate  particularly LIBOR The decline in LIBOR rates during the quarter might affect the company s portfolio yields and bottom line  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s June end quarter NII is pegged at  101 2 million  This suggests a decline of 2 4  year over year In addition  prior to the second quarter earnings release  the company is witnessing downward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of EPS for the quarter has been revised marginally downward to 66 cents over the past month  reflecting analyst bearish sentiment  Also  it calls for a year over year decline of 20 5  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Blackstone Mortgage is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earning ESP  Blackstone Mortgage s Earnings ESP is  1 89  Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4  Sell   which decreases the predictive power of ESP It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings

133852,355367,VTR,3 Simple Steps To 73  Gains And 6  Dividends  Starting Now ,opinion,"What if I told you I d found a way for you to bank 7   in cash  often paid monthly  no less  from real estate 
And no  we re not going to send you out on the streets  pounding the pavement with your real estate agent  trooping through one disappointing house after another  And you won t have to deal with deadbeat tenants  plugged toilets or noise complaints  either 
You ll have just one job  collect your dividends 
One more thing  we ll run our  one click  property play from the safety of our brokerage account  which we can do thanks to a high yielding investment called a real estate investment trust  REIT  
Safety  Upside and 7   Dividends   in One Buy
REITs pools investors  money  then use that cash to buy  or build  a portfolio of properties that they then rent out to tenants  They then pass the vast majority  usually 90  or more  of the rental income over to us as dividends 
With just a handful of REITs  you get instant exposure to dozens  or even hundreds  of different properties  from cell towers to seniors  homes  Plus  with REITs  you get a team of professional property managers to handle all the tenant problems for you 
Today I m going to show you how the top experts pick the best  and safest  of these trusts  I ll also reveal 2 closed end funds  CEFs  that have been doing just that for years  handing their investors outsized 432   gains in the process 
A Bull Market of 6   Dividends 
The best thing about REITs as I hinted above is obvious  the dividends  Yields of 6  or more are common in this space  of the 189 REITs in America with market capitalizations of  500 million or more  62 have yields over 6   with the average yield among all REITs being 5 5  
Source  Author  Bloomberg  KPMG
Compare that to the skinflints of the S P 500  whose average yield is a pathetic 1 8  today  And speaking of  regular  stocks  consider this  over the long haul  REITs crush other stocks on a total return basis  with dividends included  
REITs Double Stocks  Gain and Then Some
Here you can see the REIT index fund  the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF  NYSE RWR   has demolished the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  since RWR launched in mid 2001  That means REITs beat the index even when you account for the housing driven crash of 2008 09 
And bear in mind that RWR owners got this return just from picking the  dumb  index fund 
We can do way better when we employ a seasoned real estate professional to manage our REITs for us and that s where the 2 REIT funds I have for you today come in 
2 REIT Focused CEFs With 7  Dividends Paid Monthly
Those 2 funds would be the Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  RQI  and Cohen   Steers REIT   Preferred Income Fund  RNP   
Never heard of them  That s not surprising  both are closed end funds  CEFs   another corner of the market investors often overlook in their quest for high  safe yields 
The key takeaway is that buying our REITs through a CEF gives us two distinct advantages 
 One click  diversification  Both RQI and RNP hold a wide range of REITs  from cell tower owners like Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI  to self storage plays like Extra Space Storage  NYSE EXR  
Bigger dividends  As I write  both RQI and RNP yield 7 1   far higher than the 5 5  the typical REIT pays 
And yes  both funds have demolished RWR  check out their performance over the last decade  and bear in mind that our RQI and RNP owners got more of their return in cash  thanks to these funds  far bigger dividends  
Crushing the Index by a Mile
You could easily just sock some cash in these two funds as your REIT investment  enjoy their 7  yields and call it a day 
But if you want to discover how to pick the best individual REITs for your portfolio  let me show you how the pros who run funds like RNP and RQI do it 
3 Steps to Picking the Best REITs Now
To pick the best REITs  start by looking at their adjusted funds from operations  AFFO   That s really just the REIT equivalent of earnings per share  EPS  
While all companies have FFO  REITs adjust this measure to account for incoming rents and maintenance costs on owned properties  making it a more accurate measurement of a real estate manager s true earnings 
Fortunately  almost all REITs publicly disclose their AFFO every quarter  Then all you have to do is add up the AFFO for the last four quarters  as well as the dividends paid over that time  Divide the yearly payout into AFFO and you ve got the most important metric in REITs  dividend coverage 
A Picture Starts to EmergeSource  Author  Bloomberg
Above  we can see that Ashford Hospitality Trust  NYSE AHT  boasts a dividend coverage ratio almost twice as healthy as that of Armada Hoffler Properties  NYSE AHH   despite the fact that AHT s massive dividend yield  at 10 1   is much bigger than AHH s 5  yield 
But that s only the first step 
Step 2  Put Debt in Perspective
Nearly all REITs use debt to fuel their growth  The key  of course  is for management to use debt prudently when buying new properties  while also freeing up cash by selling real estate that underperforms 
Fund managers measure this by comparing debt to equity ratios to revenue growth 
The idea here is simple  if revenue growth is strong  it can counteract a seemingly high debt load  If debts are low and revenue growth is still strong  then we ve got a strong REIT with more room to expand 
Let s look at how this plays out with AHT and AHH 
A Massive Difference Appears
Now things look really different  While AHT s dividend coverage ratio and yield look great  the company s not really growing at all  But AHH s lower dividend coverage is matched with a higher growth rate  while its debt load is over three times smaller than that of AHT 
AHT may have gotten an early start in the race  but AHH is now looking like the clear winner 
Step 3  Valuation
The last step is to see whether the market has already priced in these different factors  If you skip this step  you could simply say AHH s fundamentals look better than those of AHT and buy that REIT  We need to go further and see if the market has already priced this in 
This is easily done in one step  compare revenue growth to the REIT s price to AFFO ratio 
Remember  AFFO is like EPS but for REITs  so price to AFFO is like the P E ratio you d use when judging stocks  Higher growth stocks get higher P E ratios  lower growth stocks get lower ones 
Let s see how that works out with these two REITs 

AHH s bigger revenue growth also means it s gotten a higher price to AFFO ratio  while AHT s lower growth means it has a lower P AFFO ratio  If we look at the relationship between revenue growth and the P AFFO ratio  we can then see if the market has fully priced in the growth difference between AHH and AHT 
If so  both numbers would be about the same  telling us that the market has priced in AHH s growth relative to AHT s slower revenue growth through a higher P AFFO ratio 

And that s exactly what we see 
With a 0 5 and a 0 4  both AHH and AHT s prices reflect their current growth about equally well  which means AHH is not the better buy you would assume by just looking at revenue growth on its own  In fact  both are equally attractive from this valuation standard 
Back at the start of 2019  the story was different  AHH s revenue growth and AFFO metrics were pretty much the same as they are now  but its P AFFO ratio was much lower  which would have suggested AHH was a better buy  That s why AHH shareholders have had a 20  total return since the start of 2019  above the index s 17 2  and better than AHT s 14 8  over the same period 
NEW  My Top REIT Buy for Fast 28  Gains  and 8  dividends 
If you re looking to boost your income stream  and who isn t    you really should look at my top pick in REITs now 
It s totally different than AHH and AHT  In fact  it s not an individual REIT at all 
It s a REIT focused CEF  so it s along the lines of the two funds I mentioned earlier  but it has one critical difference especially if you re looking to your portfolio for income 
And that is this  my No  1 REIT pick now pays an even bigger dividend  I m talking a reliable 8  here 
Here s the best news  with most high yield stocks  you have to give up a significant amount of price gains in order to get a high dividend  It s the  deal with the devil  every income investor must live with 
But you can forget about that with this fund  Check out the huge 73  return it s handed shareholders since it launched in 2012 
Top REIT Pick Dials Up a Huge Gain
How does my pick do it 
By investing in one of the fastest growing megatrends of our time  the need for more and better infrastructure 
A  94 Trillion Megatrend
When you consider that  according to Oxford Economics   94 trillion will need to be spent on global infrastructure by 2040  you can get a glimpse of the size of the opportunity here 
And that s far from the only reason why this fund tops my list 
Because the team at the top has carefully calibrated its top holdings to focus on the infrastructure that will be in the highest demand as the 21st century continues to unfold 
Top holdings include senior care center operator Ventas  NYSE VTR  which sits right in the tracks of the aging boomer trend  warehouse play STAG Industrial  NYSE STAG  a clear winner from the explosion of online shopping  and utilities like WEC Energy  NYSE WEC   a renewable energy leader 
And now is a terrific time to buy  because this fund trades at a big discount from its  true  value  That discount comes from the gap between this CEF s market price and the current value of all the holdings in its portfolio a figure called the discount to NAV 
And as you can see  this stout 8  payer trades at a ridiculous 12  discount to NAV 
A Bargain on Borrowed Time
That s despite this fund s outsized dividend  strong performance and class leading management team 
But as you can see above  that markdown has already started to narrow  pulling my pick s market price higher as it does  So if you want to grab the biggest upside  you need to act fast

133934,355449,VTR,Liberty Property  LPT  Q4 FFO Tops  Gives Sears Impact Update,opinion,Liberty Property Trust   NYSE LPT   reported fourth quarter 2018 NAREIT funds from operations  FFO  per share of 74 cents  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents  Total quarterly operating revenues of around  180 3 million also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  162 2 million The company s FFO per share improved year over year from the 68 cents per share recorded in the comparable period last year  Total operating revenues marginally climbed from the prior year figure Per management  the fourth quarter marked a notable period from a strategic perspective  The company accomplished the sale of bulk of its suburban office properties  streamlined the business by expanding and recapitalizing its U K  industrial platform  as well as resorted to monetization of the rights to a U K  mixed use land holding for a substantial gain It plans an aggressive push toward concluding its repositioning efforts and issued the Sears bankruptcy impact  The company also expects to complete the disposition of its entire wholly owned office assets within the next 18 months   Moreover  the company expects same store property level operating income for industrial properties to be up 2 5 3 5  on a GAAP basis and 3 75 4 75  on a cash basis in the current year  However  this projection reflects continued occupancy of one property leased to Sears that is bankrupt If the lease in terminated by Sears  and the space vacated by first quarter end  and if Liberty Property is unable to release the space in the current year  the company estimates that this could impact same store NOI by as much as 1  and the FFO per share by around 3 cents per share As such  shares of Liberty Property hit a 52 week high of  47 83 on Feb 5  but crawled back to  47 13 at the close of the trading session  denoting a 0 23  decline from the previous day Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter  Liberty Property accomplished lease deals for 5 4 million square feet of space  As of Dec 31  2018  occupancy at the company s in service portfolio  spanning 106 1 million square feet  shrunk 30 basis points  bps  sequentially to 96 3  Liberty Property s industrial portfolio  spanning 100 9 million square feet of area  had occupancy of 96 3  at the end of the fourth quarter  marking a contraction of 20 bps from the previous quarter  Industrial rents escalated 13 1  on a U S  GAAP basis on retention and replacement leases commenced during the quarter   Same store operating income for the industrial portfolio increased 3  on a cash and 2 2   on a GAAP basis from the prior year quarter Portfolio ActivityDuring the December quarter  Liberty acquired nine industrial properties  aggregating 1 6 million square feet  for  204 8 million At the same time  the company also sold nine operating properties totaling around 905 000 square feet and development rights to a 500 acre mixed use site in the U K  for  284 2 million The company brought into service five industrial properties  spreading 1 7 million square feet of space and 65 6  occupied as of the end of the quarter  for a total investment of  133 8 million  Liberty Property commenced development on six industrial properties during the quarter  aggregating 1 3 million square feet of space at an estimated investment of  141 5 million Balance Sheet PositionLiberty Property exited 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of around  84 9 million  up from  11 9 million recorded at the end of December 2017 OutlookFor 2019  Liberty Property guides FFO per share of  2 53  2 65  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pinned at  2 58  Notably  for FFO purposes  the company made the Sears related assumption and reduced FFO by about 3 cents per share relating to that assumed move out as of Apr 1  2019 The company projects asset sales of  600  650 million and acquisitions of  300  350 million  Further  it expects to commence development of  475  550 million in wholly owned properties The company expects same store property level operating income for industrial properties to grow by 2 5 3 5  on a GAAP basis and 3 75 4 75  on a cash basis  assuming continued occupancy of the Sears space  The company has guided for industrial rental growth of 13 15  on a GAAP basis  and 3  5  on a cash basis Our TakeThe better than expected performance of Liberty Property in the fourth quarter is encouraging  Banking on the strong fundamentals of the industrial real estate market  the company is focusing to expand its industrial portfolio through strategic acquisitions and development projects  Furthermore  it is disposing non core office properties to pursue such expansion opportunities  Such efforts to refine portfolio and capitalize on value creation opportunities are expected to drive the company s long term growth Nonetheless  large scale dispositions will likely have a dilutive impact on the company s earnings in the near term  In addition  with rising supply of industrial real estate space  there is lesser scope for robust rent and occupancy growth  Also  concerns remain regarding the course of action taken by Sears  which is presently in bankruptcy  toward occupying of space in Liberty Property s asset Currently  Liberty Property carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell      You can see  Liberty Property Trust Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    We now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Medical Properties Trust  Inc    NYSE MPW    Macerich Co    NYSE MAC   and

Before I show you my top 3  buy now  indicators which are all blaring green and a bargain 7 5  yielder to jump on now  let me first say that we ve been here before 
In mid February  with the market again on its back  I urged readers not to panic  This has happened since 
A Quick Recovery
While a 1 6  total return in 8 months isn t much to write home about  it s not the massive loss a lot of investors are terrified of today  Plus  an 8 month period is so short to be almost meaningless  Check out how investors who bought during the big correction in early 2016 have done 
You Can Choose Contrarian Outperformance  
But if you d waited until the market started recovering fully in April 2016  you d have a far smaller return 
  Or Diminished Profits
We are now in a similar position with stocks  But given the wild swings we ve seen in the last few weeks  I understand if you re still skeptical  That s why I ve written up the 3 rock solid  buy now  indicators I ll show you next 
Buy Indicator No  1  Third Quarter Profits Are Soaring
In both the first and second quarters of this year  S P 500 firms reported earnings that demolished expectations and delivered record growth 
That trend isn t stopping 
While it s early for third quarter reports  so far the news is good  Net profit margins across the S P 500 are 11 6   which is where they were in the first quarter  That s far ahead of what we ve seen in the last 5 years 
Q3 Brings  Levitating  Profits
When all is said and done  analysts expect 19 2  earnings growth on a year over year basis for the third quarter  which is miles ahead of the 3 5  annualized growth in the last decade  It also means stocks are the cheapest in years the S P 500 s forward P E ratio is at 15 7  way below its historical average 
Stocks Getting Cheap
With higher earnings and lower stock prices  this is a rare buying opportunity 
Buy Indicator No  2  Fatter Paychecks  Higher Spending
The good news isn t just limited to companies that would be a bad thing  Average Americans are doing better  too 
Since March of this year  average weekly earnings have risen more than 3   the fastest growth since 2010  The trend has lasted longer this time than back then  when we saw wages rise above 3  for just 2 months in a 5 month period 
Salaries Swell  Retailers Rejoice
Note that the line is both staying above 3  and is in an uptrend  That rise has broken a resistance level wages saw throughout 2014 and most of 2017 
Wage Gains Break Out
The wage news is incredibly good and keeps getting better  When Americans have more money in their pockets  they go shopping  That s helped corporate revenue  all told  S P 500 companies  sales are up nearly 5   the highest year over year growth in nearly a decade 
Buy Indicator No  3  Hitting  Snooze  on the Recession Alarm
The final good piece of news is something I covered in depth in my October 15 article 
Earlier in 2018  many financial analysts and journalists fretted that the flattening trend in the yield curve  or the spread between the yields on the 2 year and 10 year Treasury notes  would usher in a recession in the next year or so  This was reasonable  an inverted yield curve has preceded every modern recession on record 
But the trend toward a flatter yield curve suddenly stopped in September 
A Dangerous Sign Fades Away
This remains one of the greatest indicators of financial health in the United States  so we need to keep a close eye on it  But for now  the odds of a 2019 recession are vanishing 
1 Fund  Paying 7 5  in Cash  to Buy Now
If the economy is booming and earnings are still rising  now may be the worst time to sell especially since everyone else is  So you could buy the S P 500 ETF  SPY  NYSE SPY   and get a strong return over the next few months 
But you could get a stronger return with a fund like the John Hancock Tax Advantaged Dividend Income Closed Fund  NYSE HTD  
Why  For one  HTD has crushed the S P 500  despite its focus on large cap value companies 
Dusting the Benchmark
With a 405  total return in the last decade versus 274  for the S P 500 index fund  HTD has a proven track record  And it notches gains like that while delivering a 7 5  dividend  giving us a serious income stream we can use however we like 
The market hasn t rewarded HTD  however  despite its solid track record  the fund trades at a 7 9  discount to net asset value  NAV  or what it s underlying portfolio is worth   far lower than where it traded in late 2017 
HTD Goes on Sale
When the market recovers  I expect HTD s NAV to rise  helping it deliver capital gains 
But I also think other investors will realize HTD s solid performance when its NAV rises  causing more bidding pressure to result in a smaller discount  compounding HTD s return  Investors who buy now can enjoy the fund s 7 5  dividend while they wait for that to happen 
Your Best Selloff Buy Now  8 4  Dividends and Big 2019 Gains
Here s something else I need to tell you  the selloff knocked one of my top 4 CEF buys to an amazing 14  discount to NAV 
In plain English  that means we re getting this standout fund s portfolio top notch high yielders like Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR  and Enbridge Inc  NYSE ENB  for just 86 cents on the dollar 
This bargain fund then takes these stocks  massive dividends  plus the upside its veteran managers squeeze from its rock solid portfolio  and hands them to you in the form of a huge 8 4  dividend paid monthly 
Your Monthly  Paychecks  Await
This is the perfect investment for today s churned up markets  Because thanks to this fund s huge discount  my team and I have it pegged for easy 20  price upside in 2019 
And that s on top of its incredible 8 4  CASH dividend 
Plus  you get some invaluable downside protection  because even if we get hit with an unexpected market collapse  we re still covered  thanks to this fund s big markdown  it will just trade flat and we ll still pocket its massive 8 4  payout 
This is the ultimate  sleep well at night  buy  and I can t wait to show it to you  Click here and I ll give you full details name  buy under price  ticker and more on this fund and 3 other ridiculously cheap high yielders that must be on your buy list now  Don t miss out

revenues for the full year came in at  1 52 billion  up nearly 0 4  from  1 51 billion reported in 2016 Quarter in DetailBillboard revenues of  276 4 million in the quarter indicated a marginal year over year decrease of  0 1 million  Results were primarily affected by a drop in average revenue per day  yield  and the net impact of new and lost billboards in the period  However  these were partially offset by an increase in revenues from the conversion of digital billboards and acquisition of digital billboards in Canada Transit and other revenues of  124 9 million increased 3 3  from the prior year quarter  This was due to the net impact of franchises that were won and lost in the period  partly offset by a decrease in yield Operating expenses of  217 4 million inched up 1  year over year  mainly due to higher transit franchise expenses relating to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority transit contract  impact from the acquisition of digital billboards in Canada and elevated expenses associated with the Sports Marketing operating segment  These were offset to some extent by lower transit franchise expenses under the terms of the new transit franchise agreement with New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority  MTA  Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization inched up 3 3  year over year to  121 1 million Net cash flow resulting from operating activities for the year ending Dec 31  2017  came in at  249 3 million  down from  287 1 million recorded in the comparable period last year  Results were affected primarily due to the lower net income as adjusted for non cash items and the timing of payments made under the MTA agreement As of Dec 31  2017  Outfront Media s liquidity position comprised cash of  48 3 million  as well as  341 4 million of availability under its  430 0 revolving credit facility  net of  88 6 million of issued letters of credit against the revolving credit facility Our TakeOutfront Media is making diligent efforts to expand its digital display portfolio  It has resorted to acquisitions  swaps and conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays to focus on this low cost out of home  OOH  platform  These strategic efforts bode well for its long term growth  Also  the company is strengthening its technology platform to grow its client base and leverage on the fragmented OOH industry  Further  its huge diversity  both industry and geographical wise  makes its revenues less volatile However  the dreary environment in the national advertising market remains a risk  Also  seasonality of business and dependence on the prospects of advertisers are the challenges for the company  Interest rate hikes add to its woes Performance of Other REITsHere are a few

For those of us who have been waiting for the stock market s landlords to carve out a bottom before buying anything new  we may be back in business 
REITs Finally Rising with Rates 
Regular readers know that the best REITs do just fine as rates rise  That s been the case historically  and they ll rally again this time around 
Why  Because elite landlords simply keep raising their rents  These higher cash flows translate to higher dividends  and higher stock prices  regardless of what the Fed is up to 
Let s consider the case of Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR   which kept on hiking its payout as Uncle Sam s 10 year IOU rallied from 2003 to 2006  Its investors were rewarded with total returns  including dividends  of 174  as the 10 year rate rose above 5  
Ventas Outran the Long Bond
Also as you can see above  it didn t take Ventas much time to start scaling the rate induced wall of worry  We re starting to see the same scenario unfold with the top REITs today 
But what exactly are  the best  REITs  Certainly not retail  where even reliable anchor tenants like grocers are seeing their business models threatened 
Heck  even Ventas is having a rough go of things today  Its dividend growth has slowed considerably in recent years 
We re better off looking elsewhere  So let s consider the early leaders   the sectors sparking this budding REIT rally  If it proves to have legs  these are the stocks likely to continue paving the way 
REIT Leader  1  Industrial Space
This asset class is growing just as fast as Amazon  Yet it s much cheaper and   if you buy right   you can bank a soaring stream of dividends to boot 
 First level investors    the basic types who buy and sell of headlines without deeper thought   believe they must purchase Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  itself to profit from the e commerce boom 
We instead consider what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  and other e commerce entrepreneurs  will need to gobble up themselves to keep their firms growing  By purchasing ahead of their curve  we can then  lease  our asset back to them  at higher and higher rates  of course  
Mark Twain presciently advised readers to invest in land because new supply would be limited  If Twain were advising us today  he d probably buy warehouses   because they are quickly becoming the most valuable beachfront property in America 
Think about the number of deliveries you receive every week these days  Each package starts in a warehouse somewhere 
The Economist reports that online sellers  including Amazon  will need 2 3 billion square feet of new warehousing to fulfill their increasing order volume  And these firms want their warehouses to be close to big cities  where most of the online orders must be shipped to  
Which landlords is Wall Street buying aggressively  Here s the rally leaderboard for stocks with momentum  dividends and payout growth 

REIT Leader  2  Self Storage
As Americans acquire more and more  stuff  while they downsize their homes and move into cities  they look for places to put everything  Enter self storage units  which save you from having to actually purge any of your worldly possessions  For a modest monthly fee  when compared with rent or mortgage payments   you get a slab of space and unlimited visitation rights 
Self storage is a difficult business to get into   Not in my backyard   NIMBY  sentiments often make it difficult to land permits for a new facility 
But once you re in the business  it s highly profitable  Operators simply need to divide up the space  hand out unit keys  and make sure the facility doesn t get too dusty while they cash their monthly rent checks 
Occupancy levels in self storage facilities are above 90   Owners don t have much of a problem renting their facilities  and they are usually able to raise the rent each year   by 3  or more 
It s traditionally been a fragmented business  with storage facilities run by independent operators  More recently  real estate investment trusts  REITs  have begun to consolidate the space 
The REIT structure is well suited to self storage  These firms are able to tap the public markets for capital  which they use to buy more facilities  More storage space generates more rent  the bulk of which gets sent to investors in the form of ever increasing dividend checks 
Recently the stocks in this sector have come under pressure as some markets creep towards saturation  But  storing stuff  is a local phenomenon  and investors are finally sorting and rewarding these stocks accordingly  Here are current REIT rally leaders  which also boast current yield with yearly dividend growth to boot 

REIT Leader  3  Recession and Rate Proof Landlords for 7 5   Yields with 25  Upside
My two favorite REITs today are comfortably positioned in recession proof industries  They ll have no problem continuing to raise their rents   and reward their shareholders   no matter what the Fed decides at its next meeting  what Trump tweets or when the stock market finally takes a breather 
My favorite commercial real estate lender lets us play Monopoly from the convenience of our brokerage accounts  They do all the legwork  building a secure  diversified loan portfolio featuring offices  retail space  hotels and multifamily units 
Management then collects the monthly payments  deposits the checks   and then it sends most of the profits our way as dividends  a requirement of its REIT status  
The stock s current dividend  a 7 7  yield today  is covered by earnings per share  EPS  today  And don t be fooled by the stagnant dividend  not that stability is bad   The firm continues to originate an increasing number of loans 
37  Loan Growth Today Tees Up Dividend Growth Tomorrow
This firm is a conservative lender with perfect loan performance  100    Its growing portfolio will drive higher profits  which in turn will inspire the next dividend hike  The best time to buy the stock is right now  as it makes the investments which will drive its payout and share price higher from here 
Plus this firm has also smartly eliminated interest rate risk because it uses floating rates  In fact  it s actually set up to make more money as interest rates move higher 
More Income as Interest Rates Rise
Same for another REIT favorite of mine  a 7 5  payer backed by an unstoppable demographic trend that will deliver growing dividends for the next 30 years  Interest rates are no problem for this landlord because it will simply continue raising the rents on its  must have  facilities 
Its founder Ed admitted that  fourteen years ago  he had  zero assets  a dream  and a business plan  
Well his dream and plan were plenty   the visionary entrepreneur parlayed them into  6 7  billion in assets 
And right now is the best time yet to  bet on Ed  because his growing base of assets is generating higher and higher cash flows  powering an accelerating dividend 

I love dividend increases because they are proof that management is actually making more money  so can afford to pay us shareholders more  And an accelerating payout is a flat out cry for help 
Any management team that raises its dividend faster and faster is clearly making more money than it knows what to do with  This usually happens when it achieves a tipping point where its machine no longer requires as much reinvestment to continue growing  So leadership says   Please  take a bigger raise  shareholders  
Meanwhile investors and money managers who spot dividend accelerators lose their minds because  in theory  there is no valuation too high for a company that is increasing its dividend at an accelerating rate  Their spreadsheets literally break  and they buy the stock in a frenzy 
Ed s stock should be owned by any serious dividend investor for three simple reasons 

It s recession proof 
It yields a fat  and secure  7 5  
Its dividend increases are actually accelerating 

These two REITs are both  best buys  in my 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio   an 8  dividend paying portfolio that lets retirees live on secure payouts alone 

And they can even enjoy price upside to boot  thanks to the bargain prices they re buying at  Now  as active recommendations for my premium subscribers  it wouldn t be fair to reveal their names here

133982,355497,VTR,Ventas  VTR  Up 11 8  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Ventas  Inc    NYSE VTR    Shares have added about 11 8  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is VTR due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Ventas  Q1 FFO Misses Estimates  Revenues SurpassVentas reported first quarter 2018 FFO of 96 cents  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 01  The figure came in lower than the year ago quarter tally of  1 03 Results reflected an increase in property level operating expenses However  the company posted revenues of  943 7 million in the first quarter  comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  850 6 million  Further  it compared favorably with the year ago number of  883 4 million For the first quarter  same store cash net operating income  NOI  growth for the total portfolio  1 049 assets  was 2 6  year over year  Segment wise  same store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 4 4   seniors housing operating portfolio witnessed rise of 0 7  and the same for medical office building portfolio increased 2 2  Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter  Ventas signed a mutually beneficial agreement with Brookdale Senior living  which currently operates the company s 128 wholly owned senior housing communities  It combines all of the company s leases with Brookdale into a single Master lease  with an initial term through December 2025  Brookdale has two 10 year extension options as well Moreover  Brookdale and Ventas plan to sell a few properties from the Brookdale portfolio  totaling  30 million in cash rent LiquidityVentas exited first quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of  92 5 million  up from  81 4 million as of Dec 31  2017 2018 OutlookThe company expects the FFO to be in the band of  3 76  3 84 from the previous guidance of  3 80  3 89  Further  Ventas updated 2018 normalized FFO per share outlook to  3 99  4 07 from the previous range of  3 95  4 05 The company updated same store cash NOI growth to 0 5 1 5  in 2018 from 0 5 2  issued earlier 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates  There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower 
Ventas  Inc  Price and Consensus   VGM Scores
At this time  VTR has a subpar Growth Score of D  however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a C  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
The company s stock is suitable solely for momentum based on our styles scores 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  Notably  VTR has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ventas-vtr-up-118-since-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200319777,200319777
133983,355498,VTR,These 3 Dividends  Up To 12 4    Are Traps Set To Spring,opinion,"Cash payouts of 8  and more  often paid monthly   plus price upside of 10   20   sometimes even higher 
That s what you get with closed end funds and you can often get it in just one buy 
But as terrific as these off the radar funds are  you still need to be careful  of the 500 or so CEFs available to us  only a handful are worth your attention  Others give you mediocre returns  at best  And some can drain away your cash fast 
And in a year that s been challenging for just about all asset classes  the worst CEFs are showing their stripes  with the real laggards down double digits  and for good reason their portfolios  as measured by net asset value  or NAV  can t generate the performance they need to push their share prices higher 
Today we re going to pull back the curtain on some of these losers and look at why they are performing so poorly  When you see the reasons behind their money losing ways  you ll know how to avoid funds like these in the future 
CEF Laggard  1  High Fees  Low Returns
The RMR Real Estate IF  NYSE RIF  holds a portfolio of real estate investment trusts  REITs  and often attracts attention because of its massive discount  at a market price 19 8  below its NAV  RIF looks like a bargain 
That also makes its 8  dividend yield seem more attractive because it means RIF only needs to earn a 6 6  return to maintain its payouts and that s easy to do in today s REIT market 
But RIF is far from providing such a return 
Weak Returns Over the Long Haul
While RIF  orange line above  is up a pathetic 3 3  annualized over the last decade  the REIT index fund SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF  NYSE RWR  is up over twice that 
Oh  and if you re buying RIF for a wide discount that you expect to close soon  think again 
RIF Is Cheap but It Has Been Cheaper
While RIF s discount has been a little wider in the past than it is now  it s stayed below 10  for most of the decade and has fallen as low as 40   So those capital gains from a shrinking discount are far from guaranteed 
And if you re wondering why RIF is priced so cheaply and is such a big underperformer  it comes from two problems  the first is the portfolio  RIF has made a big bet on some REITs that have massively underperformed  like Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR   a top 10 holding that is down nearly 20  in the last year 
Plus  you ll have to pay management 2 2  to run this portfolio of underperforming REITs for you  while RWR has a fee of just 0 25   High fees are okay if you get high returns  but RIF has high fees and low returns 
Skip this one 
CEF Laggard  2  Missing Out on the Oil Bounce
Energy has had a bit of a rebound in 2018  with WTI oil futures up 9  year to date  That s helped boost a lot of energy funds  NAVs  but not that of the First Trust New Opp  MLP   Energy  NYSE FPL   an energy  and MLP focused fund that has sunk like a rock in 2018 
Plunging Portfolio Drags Down FPL
The market has clearly seen the underperformance here  driving FPL s price down double digits alongside the fund s NAV  And although it s tempting to be a contrarian bargain hunter  it s important to realize that FPL is trading at a 2 4  premium to NAV  far above its long term average of a 3 5  discount 
Overpriced for Low Performance
While energy is popular for people looking to diversify  FPL gets you exposure with a history of massive losses  where other CEFs have had positive returns  Since its IPO  FPL s market price is down 26 8   And you ll pay 2 7  fees for them to lose your money 
So why does anyone bother to buy this loser  Its 12 4  dividend is probably a big reason  but big yields are often big danger signs  and FPL is no exception  Because while that cash stream may make you feel rich  the fund s NAV is down far more than its market price  a 48  loss  since inception due to very poor asset choices while still paying out a big and unsustainable dividend  so in reality  FPL is making you poorer 
CEF Laggard  3  A Bad Muni Fund in a Good Muni Market
It s time to get more excited about municipal bond CEFs  for one simple reason  they re absurdly oversold 
Take  for instance  the PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund II  NYSE PCK   which is trading at a rare 1 6  discount to NAV  PIMCO muni funds usually trade at a premium   Just look at how PCK s NAV has performed versus its market price since the beginning of the year 
A Solid Muni Bond Opportunity
With a 16 6  decline in market price and a near flat NAV return  PCK s usually silly premium has turned into a rare discount  And it s far from alone  thanks to investors  overblown panic about the muni market  a panic  by the way  that has been proven wrong  since munis are still up over the last couple of years  
But some bond funds have done worse while posting discounts that aren t nearly as attractive  because their NAV declines have been similar but their price declines have been much more modest  bringing the gap between NAV and price performance much closer to each other than what we see with PCK 
That s why you should avoid buying the Eaton Vance New Jersey MBF  NYSE EMJ   which has seen its NAV return fall by nearly 2  in 2018  and its price decline  while bigger  is nowhere near as dramatic as that of PCK 
A Declining NAV Without a Radically Bigger Discount
That amounts to a 16 1  discount to NAV  which  while still wide  is there for a reason  this fund s annualized return is just 3 5  over the last decade  which is unacceptable considering EMJ s 1 9  management fee 
It may take years or even a decade for EMJ s market return to improve there s just no indication that this low returning fund will turn around anytime soon  And that s why it s worth avoiding

133984,355499,VTR,These 146 REITs Have 50   Upside From Here,opinion,"It s a good time to be a virtual landlord  REIT  real estate investment trust  dividends just got a tax break  their stock prices are kicking off a rally and their yields are still on the generous side 
Let s start with those yields  because that s why we buy REITs  These firms get a pass from Uncle Sam if they dish most of their profits to us investors as dividends   This generosity  by the way  has helped REITs outperform the broader stock market for much of their history  
Current yields are higher than usual today 
REIT Yields are Higher Than Usual 
Generally this means that REIT prices are too low  and should be bought   Let s look at Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR   which is usually a slam dunk buy when it pays 6  or more   as it did earlier this year 
Bigger Dividends and Upside When Ventas Pays 6  
Kicking yourself for missing Ventas  recent sale  Don t worry  I ll share an even better buy   one that pays 9     in a moment 
We re talking REITs today because the current rally appears to have legs  Two weeks before the major bottom  I told readers to buy REITs  My reasoning was simple  REITs would soon  decouple  from the long bond  On January 25 I wrote 

In the short run  the  rates up  REITs down  theory puts on quite the show  When the 10 Year Treasury s yield rises  REITs usually fall  And when its yield drops  REITs usually rally  This inverse relationship tends to hold up over multiple days  weeks and even months 
However the  long view  shows that many of these short term moves are merely noise  It is possible for REITs and higher rates to coexist in profitable harmony

Over the previous 25 months  REITs had indeed moved down whenever rates moved up  and vice versa  
Rates Up  REITs Down Was a Rule  
Then  a funny thing happened  REIT prices indeed  decoupled  from long term rates  on February 8 to be specific   Their stocks started to rally while the long bond chopped sideways 
  Until REIT Prices Rallied  
As regular readers know  I m a bit of a  REIT addict   I constantly comb the sector for timely deals  looking for big yields and bargains  I like to watch the movers and shakers   the stocks heading up as well as down 
Earlier in the year  out of the 257 or so REITs I follow  only five had stocks in uptrends  Five out of 257 moving higher 
Today  I count 146 with positive momentum  What changed  The  first level  investors   those who buy and sell on headlines and cheesy maxims   began to realize that REITs can  and often do  move higher in the face of rising interest rates 
Also Mr  Market began to express doubt in Mr  Jerome Powell s view of the financial world  While Fed Chair Powell says he needs to hike rates another 0 5  this year  the  long end  of the rate curve   set by the free market   appears to be saying  enough already   The 10 year Treasury sits exactly where it did five months ago  and that s been enough to kickoff a party for our favorite one click landlords 
7 Rate Proof And Recession Proof REITs  Averaging 7 6  Yields  with 20   Upside  
Of the 146 stocks I m watching  seven in particular stand out as best buys right now 
The first pays 9 2  today and its stock has 20   upside from here  The firm s senior leadership team   led by its founder of 35 years   is  all in  on their stock and its near 10  yield  Their collective ownership tops 30   This is a level of skin in the game rarely seen any more on Wall Street 
Which means  when the team decided to raise their payout for the sixth time in the last eight quarters  they were quite confident in their ability to fund  1 per share in dividends  This is particularly interesting to income investors like us because shares trade for less than  11 as I write  Which means we can buy shares to day to bank a 9 6  current yield that has management s personal guarantee 
The next six are no slouches either  All seven REITs in my 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio check one of the two  dividend growth  or  high current yield  boxes for rising rate environments  with most actually checking both  
As a group  they pay an impressive 7 6  average yield today  That s outstanding in a 2  to 3  world 
Combine 5  to 10   dividend growth with these high single digit current yields  and we have a formula for safe 15  to 20   annual gains from REITs  With a significant portion of that coming as cash dividends 
And thanks to the new tax plan  there s never been a better time to buy REITs and live off their dividends 
 REIT investors will benefit from the tax breaks that  pass through  businesses will receive in the new code  Investors will be allowed deduct 20  of their REIT dividend income  which means the 37  tax bill will drop to 29 6   
But it s important to choose your REITs wisely 
Don t buy low yielding static payer  Don t buy a retail REIT  either  with that entire industry is in a death spiral  future rent checks will be dicey for years to come  
Instead  focus on recession proof firms  such as those that rent hospitals  business lodging and warehouses filled with Amazon packages  Landlords that own properties that will be in high demand no matter what happens to interest rates or the economy from here  in other words 
I d love to share my seven favorite recession and rate proof REITs with you   including specific stock names  tickers and buy prices  Click here and I ll send my full 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio research you to right now

134002,355517,VTR,How To Pick REITs With 160  Upside As Rates Rise ,opinion,"Let s assume that higher long term rates  3    are here to stay  Can REITs  real estate investment trusts  and high rates co exist  Or must there be just one winner in this suddenly one sided tug of war 
After all  as the 10 year Treasury s yield has rallied  REITs have suspiciously suffered 
REITs and Rates  Oil and Water 
And the headline arguments against REITs during rising rate periods seem to make sense 
REITs need cheap money to grow  and
When risk free assets pay more  income investors will buy them instead of REITs 
These knocks may apply to low yielding shares  especially static payers  but they historically haven t applied to firms  REIT or otherwise  that have been able to grow their payouts meaningfully as rates have risen  REITs that have been able to raise their rents have done quite well in rising rate environments   banking their investors up to 160  in total returns in just three years 
How 3 Blue Chip REITs Returned 33  to 160  as Rates Rose
Let s review the three year period starting in May 2003 when the 10 year rate climbed a full two hundred basis points   from 3 2  to 5 2   I don t think rates will actually get that high this cycle   but let s consider the possibility 
Back then  familiar rent raisers like Realty Income  NYSE O   Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  and Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR  climbed higher right alongside long term rates  Their secret  Their payouts simply outran the steady   but slow   bond market 
Dividend Growth Drives Big Returns  June 2003 06 
Will this rising rate cycle be any different  Only in name   of the REITs leading the charge  that is  The winning strategies remain the same for this rate hike cycle  Buy the stocks of the companies that are 
Growing their payouts the fastest  or
Paying the most today 
High Current Yield Can Work  Too
But what if a REIT isn t raising its rents  How much current yield is enough to buffer the stock against competition from bonds 
In recent years I ve described  meaningful yield  as 6  or better  But we re no longer in a 2  world   so we need to adjust our payout standards higher 
For static payers  we should now require a 7  to 8  current yield  This gives us a sufficient margin of safety if long term rates do indeed run to 5   
Let s consider static payers HCP  NYSE HCP  and Welltower Inc  NYSE HCN   which rang up anemic 2  and 9  dividend growth over our 2003 06 rate hike cycle  They still clocked impressive returns near 50  
High Current Yield Drives Big Returns  June 2003 06 
Their secret  High initial yields  of 8 8  and 7 9   which investors actually bid lower  to 7 3  each  as rates rose  In other words  investors paid more for the same dividend three years later   even as the risk free rate rose to 5 2  
Investors Bid Yields Down as Rates Rose
7 Rate Proof   Recession Proof REITs  Averaging 8 5  Yields  with Upside  
All seven REITs in my  check one of the two  dividend growth  or  high current yield  boxes for rising rate environments  with most actually checking both  
As a group  they pay an impressive 8 5  average yield today  That s outstanding in a 3  world 
Combine 5  to 10   dividend growth with these high single digit current yields  and we have a formula for safe 15  to 20   annual gains from REITs  With a significant portion of that coming as cash dividends 
And thanks to the new tax plan  there s never been a better time to buy REITs and live off their dividends 
 REIT investors will benefit from the tax breaks that  pass through  businesses will receive in the new code  Investors will be allowed deduct 20  of their REIT dividend income  which means the 37  tax bill will drop to 29 6   
But it s important to choose your REITs wisely 
Don t buy low yielding static payer  Don t buy a retail REIT  either  with that entire industry is in a death spiral  future rent checks will be dicey for years to come  
Instead  focus on recession proof firms  such as those that rent hospitals  business lodging and warehouses filled with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  packages  Landlords that own properties that will be in high demand no matter what happens to interest rates or the economy from here  in other words

134006,355521,VTR,Four 6   Dividends With 15  to 20   Upside,opinion,"Most of your friends are going to struggle to make any money in U S  stocks for the next five to seven years  They re battling not one  not two  but three major headwinds 

Low yields 
High valuations  and
Rising interest rates 

Historically  half of the stock market s returns  or more  depending on the study you believe  have come from dividends  With the S P 500 paying just 1 8   the math isn t promising 
An expensive market is also problematic because it makes rising multiples unlikely  The S P 500 index trades for 25 times earnings today   where can it really go from here but down 
Finally  rising interest rates are a concern for many income investors  Will their current strategies work when today s cheap money gets a bit pricier 
The outlook is so grim that respected investment firm GMO predicts negative 3  annual returns for U S  stocks for the next seven years  Meanwhile  altogether 
I don t disagree with GMO  Gundlach or other bears  Most American investors will struggle in the years ahead 
But you and I have the ability and know how to do better  Much better  Twelve percent per year or better  to be specific 
With one simple strategy  we can tackle these three headwinds head on and earn 12   annual returns while our friends and peers lament about the tough investing environment  Here s how 
Our 12   Investing Strategy for Rising Rates
When interest rates rise  the best defense is a good offense  Research from Nuveen and Ned Davis shows that dividend growth stocks outperform everyone else in the 36 months after a Fed rate increase 
Stocks After the Fed Increases Rates
Everyone loves dividends  but dividend hikes are often underappreciated  Not only do they increase the yield on your initial capital  but they often are reflected in a price increase for the stock 
The solution is simple  Find higher yielders with strong growth prospects  and we ll easily beat the market  After all  a 6  dividend plus 6  annual dividend growth equals 12  total returns 
Of course we   We have to delve where fewer analysts delve   boring  businesses  real estate plays and even international stocks 
So let s review a four pack of stocks that not only look like potential growth sources for the coming years  but that also yield at least 6  today  with 6   yearly dividend  and price  upside likely tomorrow 

Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB De CV  NYSE PAC 

Dividend Yield  6 1 
Investors of just about every stripe are familiar with the idea of investing in airline stocks  such as Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  or Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  
But what about owning the terminals and runways that service them 
Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico is not an airline operator  but an airport operator  and in fact the largest one in Mexico  It operates 12 airports in total  including 5 of the 10 most important airports by passenger traffic  Its portfolio includes two majors in Guadalajara and Tijuana  mid size airports in places such as Mexicali and Los Mochis  and tourist focused outlets such as La Paz and Puerto Vallarta  It also has a presence in Jamaica  operating Montego Bay Airport and owning Desarrollo de Concesiones Aeroportuarias  which controls a majority stake in the operator of Sangster International Airport 
All told  last year  GAP was responsible for servicing a quarter of Mexico s total terminal passengers and nearly three quarters of Jamaica s 
Air travel is rapidly growing in Mexico  Volaris reported that CAGR for air travel was 9 8  between 2012 2016  That s an enormous opportunity here  as well as in Jamaica  where PAC is going to bid for Kingston International Airport 
Grupo Aeroportuario s dividend has grown like a weed as a result 

No  this is not as consistent a dividend as you ll find in traditional U S  domiciled companies  But Grupo Aeroportuario clearly is comfortable with sharing the wealth  which means that as Mexican and Jamaican air traffic grow  so shall the income of anyone holding onto PAC shares 

Ventas  NYSE VTR 
Dividend Yield  6 3 
Ventas is one of the biggest names in healthcare real estate  but it has had a rough go of things for several months  dropping nearly a quarter of its value since the middle of 2017 
Let s start with the basics  Ventas is a diversified REIT that s most loaded up on senior housing communities  674   but also sports 358 medical office buildings  as well as a handful of life science and innovation centers  skilled nursing facilities and even three international hospitals  among other properties  Just less than half of those senior housing properties are  triple net   too  which translates into more predictable net operating income  VTR used to feature more skilled nursing facility exposure  but it spun most of that off in 2015 to Kindred Healthcare  NYSE KND  
Much of the recent selling can be chalked up to interest rate fears  but that has the market throwing babies out with the bathwater  Ventas is an excellently managed REIT that s projecting 0 5  to 2  positive same store NOI growth this year  while also planning to reduce its leverage  The company recently announced it will try to refinance  1 billion in debt to get out ahead of the Federal Reserve s anticipated rate hikes 
One smudge I have to point out  The company did increase its dividend in December    but only by 2  to 79 cents per share  which isn t particularly generous  Nonetheless  a roughly 75  FFO payout ratio and a 13x valuation on its funds from operation   both reasonable bordering on attractive  especially for a REIT that has so gracefully navigated its space for so long 

Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM 
Dividend Yield  6 7 
Digital storage REITs such as Digital Realty  NYSE DLR  and CoreSite Realty  NYSE COR  have been the rage for some time  However  Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM  stand out because it s far from your typical datacenter play 
Yes  Iron Mountain does have that   its digital services range from cloud storage and data centers to imaging and restoration migration  But IRM also has its hands in brick and mortar  Or perhaps  more accurately  ink and paper 
Iron Mountain s operations include secure storage and destruction services for physical documents  This includes everything from securely storing media tapes and file folders  with industry tailored solutions for areas such as libraries  film and sound  and even the federal government 
Yes  the world is going digital  but this two pronged approach helps IRM achieve diversification that similar REITs can t achieve 
The proof is in the pudding  Iron Mountain recently reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 results  and it enjoyed growth on both the top and bottom lines  Revenues grew 9  year over year to  3 85 billion  and adjusted FFO jumped 12  to  752 million  Months before those results came out  Evercore ISI s analysts initiated IRM shares at  Outperform  with a  46 price target   another 40  upside from current prices   lauding Iron Mountain s high yield and one two storage punch 
Iron Mountain s  IRM  Steady Business Is Starting to Pick Up

Park Hotels   Resorts Inc  NYSE PK 
Dividend Yield  6 7 
The Park Hotels  was playing out beautifully at the end of last year  but January and February happened  and you can guess what happened to shares  That said  a quick haircut has given investors another chance to jump into this fantastic play on the  experience economy  
This is a relatively new real estate investment trust that was spun off by Hilton Worldwide  NYSE HLT  at the beginning of 2017 as part of a reorganization that also saw the hotel chain spin off its timeshare business  Hilton Grand Vacations  NYSE HGV 
Park hit the ground as one of the largest hotel focused REITs you can buy  and currently boasts more than 35 000 rooms across 66 properties  They re a diverse group  at that  The company s U S  properties are split into resorts  11   prime city center  9   convention center  7  and strategic airport   other  26   and it boasts another 13 properties internationally 
Park s also laser focused on serving the cr me de la cr me  boasting that  Over 85  of our portfolio is in the luxury or upper upscale segment and nearly 90  is located in the U S   including locations in 14 of the top 25 markets  Over 70  of our portfolio is located in the central business districts of major cities or resort or conference destinations  
The REIT had a solid third quarter report back in November in which adjusted FFO improved by 7  year over year  and that s amid marginal continued impact from Hurricanes Irma and Maria 
Still  PK has pulled back by about 10  since peaking in January  and as a result  it s trading less than 10 times its annualized FFO from 2017 s first three quarters  That  and a slightly more generous dividend  are plenty of reason to buy in

134046,355561,VTR,Top 5 Big Dividend Healthcare REITs,opinion,"Health Care  NYSE XLV  have gained 14 5  over the last year  thereby keeping pace with the overall market as measured by the SPY  NYSE SPY  which gained 15 0  over the same time period  However  there are a variety of reasons why healthcare REITs have significantly underperformed  many of them delivering negative returns  as shown in the following table 

One reason investors have spurned healthcare REITs has to do with uncertainty surrounding many of their troubled operator tenants dealing with intense medical expense reimbursement pressures basically putting them in dire straits in some cases  for example  publicly traded operator tenants like Brookdale  NYSE BKD  and Genesis  NYSE GEN  have experience dramatic stock price declines and consistent negative net income  while other operator tenants are filing for bankruptcy such as Adeptus  OTC ADPTQ  
Another reason healthcare REITs have underperformed is because they are REITs  a sector that has been out of favor since the post election  Trump Rally   and as fears of rising interest rate expectations are presumed to soon wreak increasing havoc on REITs because they rely heavily on borrowing to fund growth  as interest rates increase  the cost of borrowing increases  
With that backdrop in mind  and considering we are contrarian income focused investors  we decided to highlight a few healthcare REIT opportunities that may be worth considering within the constructs of a diversified investment portfolio 
5  Medical Properties Trust  MPW   Yield  7 2 

Medical Properties Trust Inc  NYSE MPW  provides capital to hospitals and other acute care facilities  It has basically carved a unique niche for itself in the healthcare REIT space by allowing hospitals to tap into the value of their real estate so they can focus on what they do best  providing healthcare   MPW essentially bridges the gap between the growing demand for high quality healthcare  this is a positive demographic theme we ll cover more later  and the need to deliver it in an increasingly efficient and cost effective manner  this is another theme we cover  the increasing pressure on healthcare reimbursement rates  
If you are a contrarian income focused investor  there is lots to like about Medical Properties Trust  For starters  it offers an attractive 7 2  dividend yield  and its share price has declined  contrarians like this   Also  the dividend is well covered and the company s valuation is very low considering the stock trades at only 9 9 times its 2017 Normalized Funds from Operations   FFO   guidance of  1 29 to  1 31 per share  Regarding dividend safety  the payout ratio is only 71 5    0 96  1 30   The company is also attractive because of the growing demographic need for healthcare that we mentioned above  and we ll cover in more detail later   And as MPW s CEO  Ed Aldag  put it during their most recent earnings  

As many of you have heard me say many times  you cannot imagine in our lifetime any developed country without hospitals  We are confident that we have some of the world s very best operators 

Basically  MPW has a high degree of confidence in the business it is in 
However  MPW faces a variety of risks that investors should consider  For starters  healthcare laws are subject to change  and this could negatively impact MPW  During the most recent earnings conference call  CEO Ed Aldag explained 

We have all watched in frustration  the inability of Congress to bring certainly the healthcare issues  our basic investment thesis at MPT has not changed  There are three things that we re absolutely sure of  Reimbursement will change and reimbursement in some form will always be here and hospitals are not going away 

The possibility of healthcare law changes is a big risk factor facing MPW  and it s part of the reason the current short interest on this stock is 7 16  

Another risk facing MPW is its operators  Not only are MPW s operators concentrated as shown in the following table  but they are also at risk 

MPW s operators are at risk because of challenging financial conditions  For example  Adeptus  which represents just under 7  of MPW s rent  has filed for bankruptcy  For the time being  all of the Adeptus properties continue to make rent payments  however approximately 13 facilities will later be severed from the master leases and MPW will either sell or release them to other operators  This is a significant risk  And this risk is not just related to Adeptus  Other operators are facing challenges 
Steward and Prime  see our portfolio table above  are also facing risks  For example  Steward  which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management  plans to merge with IASIS Healthcare to become the US s largest private for profit hospital operator  These types of transactions can create challenges  Also Prime  another large tenant  has experienced lower than expected cash collections  primarily at six hospitals  and this will result in undesirable write offs of 6  to 7  of revenues 
Another way to gauge MPW s risks is its S P BB   non investment grade  credit rating  This is the highest non investment grade credit rating  and it is also the lowest credit rating of our top 5 healthcare REITs included in this report  This rating gives readers an indication of MPW s relative risks 
Overall  if you are an income focused investor  and you can get comfortable with the risks  i e  if you believe MPW s hospitals will continue to be in demand like CEO Ed Aldag believes  then this REIT is worth considering  especially considering its near dirt cheap valuation  and it s attractive well covered dividend yield 
4  Welltower  HCN   Yield  4 7 

Welltower Inc  NYSE HCN  is an attractive  highly conservative  blue chip healthcare REIT that focuses mainly on Senior Housing  There is a lot to like about this company including its attractive dividend coverage ratio  its healthy price to FFO ratio  its investment grade credit rating  its performance over the last year  assuming you are a contrarian   the huge demographic tailwinds on its side  and of course its big 4 7  dividend yield  For your reference  we recently wrote in detail about Welltower in this report   
And if you re looking for safe dividend yield from a healthcare REIT  Welltower is absolutely worth considering 
3  Ventas  VTR   Yield  4 5 

Very similar to Welltower  Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR  is another attractive  conservative  blue chip healthcare REIT focusing on Senior Housing  We like Ventas for many of the same reasons as Welltower  e g  powerful demographics  safe dividend yield  price appreciation potential   but we also list 10 specific reasons why we like Ventas even more than Welltower in this report 
 
We don t currently own shares of Ventas  we own a different healthcare REIT  more on this later   but we re not opposed to owning shares  Ventas is currently high on our watch list  and we can understand why a lot of conservative income focused investors currently do own shares 
2  HCP Inc  HCP   Yield  4 9 
Too many investors continue to hate HCP Inc  NYSE HCP  following its relatively recent troubled history with HCR ManorCare  the HCR ManorCare business has since been spun off into a separate healthcare REIT  QCP  focusing entirely on skilled nursing facilities   And the fact that so many investors hate HCP is a big part of the reason we like it  As the following chart shows  HCP s performance recently has been  lackluster  since the QCP spin off last year 

However  contrary to the performance  there are a lot of reasons to like HCP  For example 
Property Type Diversification  Aside from the fact that we like that HCP has no skilled nursing exposure  because they spun it off to QCP  we also like that HCP has better diversification than Welltower and Ventas in terms of property types 

Similar to Ventas and Welltower  HCP has significant exposure to Senior Housing  but it is less significant  only around 45  as shown in the graph above   This allows HCP to reduce risk by diversifying into other attractive property types  For example  we especially like HCP s exposure to Life Sciences  Specifically  Life Sciences industry funding is led by pharmaceutical companies looking to invest via M A  research funding  collaborations  and licensing to help backfill lost revenue as major drugs come off patent 
HCP s strategy is to own real estate in locations where the funding is flowing  and we believe there could be big gain opportunities hear  and the market may not be appreciating the size of these opportunities for HCP  

One caveat for HCP investors  however  is the concentration of top tenants at 27  versus only 9  Ventas and 8  Welltower  This is a risk factor that investors should be aware of  Overall though  we like the opportunities presented by HCP s attractive property type diversification 
Brookdale Reduction  Regarding tenant concentration  we like that HCP has reduced its exposure to Brookdale Senior Living  Specifically  HCP recently sold 64 triple net assets leased to Brookdale for  1 125 billion  This not only reduces HCP s tenant concentration  a good thing   it also reduces its exposure to an increasingly challenged tenant  Brookdale has been struggleing with reimbursement pressures causing its stock price to decline sharply and its net income to be consistently negative  We view this reduced exposure as a positive for HCP 
Investment Grade Credit Rating  We also like that HCP has an investment grade credit rating  The current ratings are Baa2 from Moody s and BBB from S P  These investment grade ratings are one one step the larger blue chips  Ventas and Welltower   and this rating is two steps above the non investment grade credit rating of MPW as described earlier 

Attractive Entry Point  HCP has been one of the worst performing healthcare REITs over the last year  And as contrarians  this is attractive to us  we d rather buy now that the price is lower  

And we especially like the lower price considering the many positive things HCP has going for it  as described above  and below  
Competitive fixed charge coverage ratio  We also like HCP s fixed charge coverage ratio of 3 6x versus 4 6x for Ventas and only 3 2x for Welltower  This is an indication of safety and financial conservatism  which are especially attractive considering HCP s big dividend 

The Huge Demographic Wave  HCP  and Healthcare REITs in general  are all expected to benefit from a huge demographic trend  Specifically  the population is expected to age  and this will drive demand 



This large demographic shift is expected to benefit HCP  Ventas  Welltower  and other healthcare REITs 
Smaller Base from Which to Grow  We also like that HCP is smaller than Ventas and Welltower  For example HCP s market cap is only around  14 billion  whereas Ventas is around  25 billion and Welltower  28 billion  This means HCP has to generate less absolute growth to achieve higher per share growth than Welltower and Ventas  It also means HCP can be more selective in its growth opportunities than Welltower and Ventas which have constant pressure to find larger scale opportunities 
Valuation  From a valuation standpoint  HCP trades at around only 15 4 times expected 2017 adjusted FFO  guidance is for  1 89 to  1 95 per share   And from a dividend payout ratio  HCP has some cushion  Specifically  the annual dividend per share is currently  1 48  which equates to a relatively safe 77  payout ratio  This means even if HCP experiences reduced payments from some operators  it has extra wherewithal to keep paying the dividend  And worth noting  95  of HCP s revenues are from private pay sources  versus only 93  for Ventas and Welltower  Private pay is generally considered safer because it does not have the same exposure to some of the regulatory uncertainties faced by public pay  This adds to the safety of the valuation and the dividend  in our view

Omega  NYSE OHI  is more risky than Welltower and Ventas  but it is also a different type of healthcare REIT  and it offers a better risk versus reward opportunity  in our view  Specifically  Omega is a skilled nursing facilities healthcare REIT  and this sub sector is particularly exposed to potential regulatory changes to reimbursement rates  e g  possible future changes to Medicaid Expansion under the Affordable Care Act  for example  
In the recent past  we have attempted to give a balanced view of Omega  instead of the usual one sided cheerleading articles  in this detailed OHI write up  and in our recent idea of the month video 
We do currently own shares of Omega as part of our broadly diversified investment portfolio  Many investors consider adding to their position in Omega if when the share price falls below  30  We are not opposed to that idea 
Our main thesis on Omega  however  is simply that the fear is overblown  and the shares are attractive if you re comfortable adding its specific risks within the constructs of your diversified investment portfolio 
Conclusion 
If you are an income focused investor  healthcare REITs are attractive  some more so than others  if you are comfortable with the risks  We believe all five of the healthcare REITs described in this article have attractive qualities  and may be worth considering for an allocation within your diversified investment portfolio  especially if you are a contrarian   In fact  we have ranked several of these healthcare REITs highly  e g Ventas is ranked  6  and Omega is ranked  3  on our more wide ranging members only article  Top 8 High Yield REITs  Overall  we believe the market has been overly fearful regarding healthcare REITs  and fearful corners of the market are often where some of the best investment opportunities exist ",2017-09-11,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-5-bigdividend-healthcare-reits-200212403,200212403
134047,355562,VTR,Ventas  VTR  To Gain From Life Science Assets And SNF Sale,opinion,Ventas Inc    NYSE VTR   is making every effort to ride on the growth curve through strategic dispositions and accretive investments The company recently accomplished the first phase of the sale of its 36 SNFs  operated by Kindred Healthcare  Inc    NYSE KND    to an affiliate of BlueMountain Capital Management  LLC  In the first phase  the company sold 22 SNFs  which helped it reap  488 million in proceeds  marking a 7  yield on current cash rent The company anticipates to generate  700 million in proceeds from the sale of the total 36 SNFs  which indicates a 7  cash yield on the current annual cash rent of  50 million and an 8  GAAP yield  The company is projected to gain more than  600 million from the sale of all the 36 SNFs The move is in sync with Ventas  strategy of de emphasis of this particular healthcare real estate category  Notably  amid healthcare reforms  though seniors housing  medical office buildings and hospitals have been able to reap solid top line growth in recent years  skilled nursing facilities are becoming more susceptible to top line pressure due to the shift in medical billing procedure Notably  the company successfully spun off majority of its SNF business in 2015  Following the anticipated sale of the aforementioned 36 SNFs  Ventas will be able to bring down its net operating income  NOI  from SNFs to just 1  of its aggregate NOI On the other hand  Ventas is making investments for its future prospects through selective development and redevelopment  The company has targeted on fortifying its position in the medical office and life science real estate market  In the second quarter 2017 earnings release  it announced that it expects to invest by funding around  350 million in development and redevelopment projects for full year 2017  This would include lucrative new ground up medical office and life science developments Specifically  university based life science real estate is a new zone of investment  which has been driving attention and Ventas has already made decent amount of investments in this segment  Such investments offer the opportunity to capitalize on the growing health care driven research and development  supported by top tier research universities Increasing longevity of the aging U S  population  along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities  has also promoted the institutional life science and medical market fundamentals  Further  long lease terms and top rated  institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for Ventas Also  Ventas has a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to eye high yielding acquisitions and high ROI  return on investments  capital projects  As of Jul 28  2017  the company enjoyed solid liquidity with  2 6 billion of available borrowing capacity and  95 million of cash on hand Additionally  solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Ventas remains committed to that  In fact  the company s annual cash dividend per share has increased at a CAGR of 8  since 2001  Given the company s financial position  this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable However  increase in supply of seniors housing assets in certain markets remain a concern for Ventas  This is because elevated supply usually curtails the landlords  pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level  Also  dilutive impact of asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term Furthermore hike in the interest rate is a concern for Ventas  particularly considering its substantial exposure to long term leased assets  In addition  rising rates increase the cost of financing acquisitions  investment and development activity costs  and also lower the amount which third parties are ready to pay for the company s assets at disposal Nevertheless  the stock has gained 9 3  year to date

134149,355664,VTR,3 REITs To Play The Aging Of America,opinion,"The Baby Boomers are at an interesting juncture of their lives  Too old to rock  n  roll  too young to die 

This is a colorful way to describe the years of late career and early retirement  but it is nothing to take lightly  The aging of the Baby Boomers is the single biggest mega trend facing America  At 80 million strong  the Baby Boomers  impact on the economy at each stage of their lives has been accurately compared to a pig passing through a python  Their integration into the workforce was a driving factor in the low productivity   high inflation nightmare that was the 1970s  And their  getting haircuts and real jobs  was a major driver of the productivity boom of the 1980s and 1990s 

Today  Boomers are scrambling to buy income producing assets to fund their retirement which is a significant contributing factor to the persistent low yields we see across the stock and bond markets 

The retirement and aging of the Boomers will create fantastic opportunities  particularly in products and services that cater to seniors  Today  I m going to cover three solid real estate investment trusts  REITs  that are uniquely positioned to profit  To start  they own the sorts of properties that are going to be most in demand from an aging population  But secondly  with their high and growing dividends  they also stand to benefit from the continued hunt for dividend yield 

LTC Properties Inc

We ll start with LTC Properties Inc  NYSE LTC  

Its name and ticker symbol say it all   LTC  is short for  long term care   and that is exactly what LTC provides  It invests primarily in the long term care sector of the healthcare industry  including long term care provider properties  skilled nursing properties  assisted living properties  independent living properties and memory care properties  LTC also invests in first lien mortgages secured by long term care properties 

Roughly four fifths of LTC s portfolio is invested in properties  and the remainder is in mortgages  Skilled nursing makes up 55  of its properties  with assisted living the next biggest portion at 37  

LTC pays a monthly dividend with a current dividend yield of 4 8   very competitive among medical REITs  And importantly  LTC also raises its dividend constantly   at a 8 6  annual clip over the past five years  In other words  had you bought into LTC five years ago  you d be enjoying a yield on cost of 7 4   Not bad 

Can we expect that kind of performance in the decade ahead  Given that   I would say absolutely 

Ventas  Inc 

Along the same lines we have one of the bluest of blue chip REITs  Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR    one of the few REITs included in the S P 500 

With a market cap of  23 billion  Ventas is one of the largest holdings in most REIT index funds  Due to its sheer size  VTR probably cannot grow at the rate that some of its smaller rivals can  But with its size comes stability and financial strength  And Ventas is certainly no slouch when it comes to growth  I might add  Its stock has generated total returns of about 29  per year over the past 15 years 

A little more than half of Ventas  portfolio  by contribution to net operating income  goes to senior housing  split between 24  in  triple net  properties  25  in domestic operating properties and 4  in international operating properties  Another 17  of the portfolio is invested in skilled nursing post acute care facilities  18  is invested in medical office buildings  with 7  in hospitals and the remainder spread among loans and other properties 

So  in Ventas  you get a nice  diversified sampling of the facilities that aging Baby Boomers will be using in the decades ahead 

Ventas sports a relatively lower current dividend yield of 3 5   But like LTC  Ventas is also a serial dividend raiser  VTR has grown its dividend at a 7 9  annual clip over the past five years and a 8 0  clip over the past ten 

It might be hard to sustain that kind of growth over the next ten years  but if anyone can do it  it would be Ventas 

Health Care REIT  NYSE HCN 

Another solid play on the aging of the Baby Boomers would be Health Care REIT Inc  NYSE HCN   Like Ventas  HCN is big  with a market cap of  28 billion  It s also one of the view REITs in the S P 500 

From its name  you might assume that HCN was primarily a play on hospitals and doctor s offices  but it s not  Only about  is invested in health related properties 

About 64  of the portfolio is in senior housing  split between properties that HCN operates  38   and those that are leased on a triple net basis  26    Looking at the health related properties  medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities make up another 16  and 14  of the portfolio  respectively  and the rest is split between hospitals and research facilities 

Here s something I like to see  Apart from the skilled nursing facilities and hospitals  which depend heavily on Medicare and Medicaid  HCN s tenants have very little dependence on the government  Across its portfolio   are from private pay clients  That s a major positive in an era of slashed reimbursements and Obamacare restrictions 

HCN sports a dividend yield of 4 6  and has been a steady dividend grower for years  Over the past five years  HCN has grown its dividend at a 3 4  clip  Had you bought HCN five years ago  you d be enjoying a yield on cost of 5 4  today

134150,355665,VTR,Will The Fed s Rate Hike Kill REITs ,opinion,"The Federal Reserve has spoken  and it s all pefectly clear now 
Ok  I sincerely hope you realize that I m joking  Janet Yellen gave us no real insight in her statement this week as to what comes next  We re left to assume a rate hike will be coming before year end  but Yellen insisted in her comments that  even post lift off  policy would remain  highly accomodative  for as long as inflation remains muted 
I have no Rosetta Stone to translate Fedspeak into English  But Yellen s words would seem to suggest a  one and done  scenario in which the Fed raises rates by a quarter point or two and then sits on its hands for a while to see what happens 
We ll see  In the meantime  yield sensitive assets like REITs continue to get whipsawed as investors handicap the likely move in interest rates  The received wisdom is that Fed tightening will take a wrecking ball to REIT prices  and REITs have been selling off for most of 2015 in anticipation 
But is it true  If interest rates really do rise significantly  will REITs suffer  Let s take a look at past tightening cycles to see 
The chart below tracks the price performance of the NAREIT All Equity REIT Index going back to the early 1980s and compares it to the Federal Reserve s targeted Fed funds rate  Periods of extended tightening are highlighted in blue 

We ve had five periods of extended tightening since 1981  In three of them  REIT prices did indeed suffer  But in the other two   and keep in mind  that is fully 40  of the total   REIT prices actually did very well  The tightening cycle of the mid 2000s coincided with one of the greatest bull markets in the history of REITs as an asset class 
A few points have to be made here  We only have five observations in our sample  which is far too few to draw strong conclusions  The quants in the room will rightly point out that you need a sample size of at least 30 to draw meaningful conclusions  But this data should at least cast doubt on the received wisdom that rising interest rates automatically mean falling REIT prices 
It s also worth noting that  the 2008 meltdown notwithstanding  REITs have arguably been in a secular bull market for over thirty years now  a thirty year period that also happened to correspond with the  great moderation  in inflation and interest rates  We ve never had interest rates this low for this long  so the historical precedents might not be the most appropriate 
Let s step away from the Federal Reserve for a second  As long term income investments  REITs should be less affected by Fed policy and more affected by moves in long term bond yields  The next chart takes a look at REIT performance during periods of rising bond yields 

There really haven t been too many extended periods of rising 10 year Treasury yields over the past three decades  The dominant trend has been one of falling yields  That said  I found six periods where 10 year yields trended upward for an extended period  Again  the story is ambiguous  In the early 1980s and mid 2000s  REITs did very well during periods of rising bond yields  But in the mid 1980s  early 1990s and late 1990s  REITs performed poorly  And most recently  during the  Taper Tantrum   REITs performed poorly 
This suggests that rising bond yields would  probably  hurt REITs  Of course  it is by no means certain that we ll see rising bond yields for a sustained period of time  Bond King Bill Gross said this week in a CNBC interview that a 2 4  yield on the 10 year Treasury was  about right  over the next several years  Gross swings and misses from time to time  but I agree with him here 
Finally  let s look at REIT valuations by comparing their current dividend yields to the yield to maturity on the 10 year Treasury  The following chart tracks the yield spread between the two  Conventional wisdom says that REITs should yield more than bonds due to their higher risk  But is this actually true in the real world 

Not exactly  Since the 1990s  REIT yields have been about 2  higher than the 10 year Treasury yield  But in the mid 2000s  REIT yields actually dipped below Treasury yields  And this was pretty standard for most of the 1970s and 1980s 
Given that  unlike bond coupons  REIT dividends are presumed to grow over time  I believe a a relatively tight spread is completely appropriate  At a yield spread of 3  4   I would consider REITs a  fat pitch  investment worthy of a home run swing  But even today s smaller spreads of 1 5  2  are attractive if you believe  as I do  that Treasury yields will stay below 3  for the next several years and stock market returns will be middling at best 
Many of my favorite REITs  including Realty Income Corporation  NYSE O   LTC Properties Inc  NYSE LTC  and Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR   are yielding near or above 5  at current prices  But even the Vanguard REIT  MX VNQ  is yielding close to 4   I consider all of these to be strong buys on any Fed induced sell offs ",2015-06-21,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-fed’s-rate-hike-kill-reits-255661,255661
134151,355666,VTR,7 Stocks To Fund A Happy Retirement,opinion,"I spend a lot time thinking about my investments  It sort of comes with the job description  But when I eventually retire  I don t intend to spend my days with my eyes glued to a monitor  I want to retire with my mind at ease and with a steady stream of cash coming in 
To start  it absolutely must pay a respectable dividend  I buy plenty of stocks that do not pay dividends  and there is nothing wrong with that  So  what are some of the qualities I would look for in an ideal retirement stock 
Young  fast growing companies generally have more pressing needs for their cash  But any stock I would feel comfortable holding in retirement needs to be mature enough to pay a dividend   potentially for decades 
Furthermore  that dividend should grow every year  or at least very regularly  A stock that doesn t grow its dividend is essentially a risky bond with no set maturity date  The income it throws off won t keep pace with inflation 
And finally  the stock should have survived a good crisis or two without cutting its dividend  If you re planning on living off dividends  you need to have faith that they re going to be there for you when you need them 
So with no more ado  let s jump into my list of seven stocks to fund a happy retirement 
Realty Income
I ll start with  the monthly dividend company   blue chip retail REIT Realty Income  NYSE O  
I write about Realty Income a lot  In fact  I may actually write about Realty Income more than any other stock 
And there is a solid reason for that  I consider it one of the very best dividend stocks a retiree can own  It s about as stable and conservative as a bond  while still offering regular dividend growth  Realty Income has paid 539 consecutive monthly dividends  and has raised its dividend for 71 consecutive quarters 
Not every dividend hike is newsworthy  but Realty Income has managed 5  compound annualized dividend growth for 20 years and running  That s well ahead of inflation and certainly enough to guarantee a happy retirement 
So  what is the secret to Realty Income s stability 
Realty Income isn t really a  company  as you might think of one  It s a passive landlord with a portfolio of more than 4 300 properties  As a triple net REIT  the tenants are responsible for all maintenance  taxes and insurance  and Realty Income has a long history of leasing to stable tenants 
Realty Income s stock price has faltered in 2015  falling in sympathy with bonds and other income producing assets  If you re looking to retire happy  use this as a buying opportunity in one of America s finest divided payers 
Ventas  Inc
Along the same lines  we have one of the bluest of blue chip REITs  Ventas  Inc   NYSE VTR  
With a market cap of  21 billion  Ventas is one of the largest holdings in most REIT index funds  and it s one of the few REITs to make it into the S P 500 
With Ventas  size comes stability and financial strength  but that doesn t mean that Ventas is wanting for growth  The stock has generated total returns of about 26  per year over the past 15 years 
As a diversified health REIT  Ventas is a nice play on the aging of the Baby Boomers  About half of Ventas  portfolio is invested in senior housing  Another 18  and 17   respectively  is invested in medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities with the rest invested in hospitals and assorted loans and other properties 
After the general selloff in the REIT sector  Ventas now sports a very attractive dividend yield of 5   And importantly  Ventas is also a serial dividend raiser  Ventas has grown its dividend at a 7 9  annual clip over the past five years and an 8 0  clip over the past 10 years 
A demographically favored portfolio with a long history of raising dividends  If that isn t a stock to help you retire happy  I don t know what would be 
McDonald s
My next  happy retirement  stock is the seller of the Happy Meal McDonald s  NYSE MCD  
In this age of organic eating  McDonald s has become something of a pariah stock  It hasn t quite reached the notoriety of Big Tobacco   or even of agribusiness giant Monsanto  NYSE MON   But it s hard to find a company more disdained by the chattering classes than good ol  Mickey D s 
But remember  tastes are always changing in America  and this is not the first time that McDonald s has been distinctly out of style  McDonald s is a survivor  and as Americans  tastes have changed  so have McDonald s menu offerings 
So  why do I like McDonald s as a happy retirement stock 
More than anything  it comes down to the dividend  McDonald s has raised its dividend every year since 1977  and its dividend has grown at an eye popping pace over the past decade  Over the past 10 years  McDonald s has grown its dividend at a 19 5  clip  Dividend growth has been a little more modest recently  growing at a 9  clip over the past three years 
But 9  growth is just fine in my book  McDonalds is a champion dividend payer  and you can buy it today with a 3 5  dividend yield 
StoneMor Partners
Unless you read about it from me  chances are good that you ve never heard of StoneMor Partners  LP  STON   StoneMor is in a line of work that a lot of people find downright creepy  It owns and operates 303 cemeteries and 98 funeral homes across the United States and Puerto Rico 
In our golden years  there are a lot of things we d prefer to think about other than caskets and tombstones  but Stonemor s dividend is far from gloomy  At current prices  it yields about 8 2  
StoneMor consistently raises its dividend  though the rate of growth is a little more modest than for some of the other companies I ve mentioned  Over the past five years  it has raised its dividend at a 1 9  clip  That s nothing to write home about  but I will add that it is has more than kept pace with inflation over the period 
I expect that the growth rate is about to pick up  Based on current life expectancies  the number of annual deaths in America will rise by more than 80  between 2015 and 2035  due to the aging of the Baby Boomers  Even allowing for an increased preference for cremation over traditional burial  there is an incredible amount of growth all but guaranteed 
If you want to retire happy  buy StoneMor and collect the dividend 
Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI 
Next up is oil and gas pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI   one of my very favorite dividend stocks 
Kinder Morgan owns and operates the largest network of oil and gas pipelines in North America  and with its size comes stability and diversification  So long as America needs oil and gas moved from point A to point B  Kinder Morgan should do quite nicely 
Whenever I invest  I like to know who s running the show  No matter how great a company looks on paper  you still have to trust that the people running it are competent and honest 
Well  Kinder Morgan is run by one of smartest men in the energy industry  Richard Kinder  who also happens to be one of the  good guys  in corporate America  Kinder receives no salary for his work as chairman  and he even reimburses the company for his health insurance  His only compensation comes from the dividends he receives as a shareholder  though as the owner of 234 million shares  Mr  Kinder is doing just fine  He takes home  400 million per year in dividends 
At current prices  Kinder Morgan sports a dividend yield of 5 1   and management expects dividend growth in the ballpark of 10  over the next five years 
Enterprise Products Partners
Along the same lines  we have Enterprise Products Partners  NYSE EPD   the only MLP that can rival Kinder Morgan in terms of size  scope  and diversification  Enterprise Products operated 51 000 miles of oil and gas pipelines  in additional to extensive salt dome storage capacity and marine transportation 
Anything energy related is going to give investors heartburn these days  but most of Enterprise Products  income is fee based  depending on the volume of oil and gas transported rather than the price 
After a fantastic run since 2008  EPD stock has hit the skids since last September  and is now down by more than a quarter from its 52 week high  Given its current size  Enterprise probably can t realistically generate the kinds of returns going forward that investors have become accustomed to 
But with a current distribution of 5  and a long history of raising that distribution  Enterprise looks like a decent bet at today s prices 
ExxonMobil
And finally  we get to the ultimate oil major  ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   I should be clear that I don t expect ExxonMobil stock to do much over the next few months  Exxon is down about 20  from its 52 week highs set before last year s oil price collapse  and I expect it to recover nicely   eventually 
But for that to happen  the price of energy needs to stabilize  and that may very well take a while 
In the meantime  investors would be wise to average into Exxon on any large dips  Exxon is one of the safest dividend payers in existence  having raised its dividend for 32 consecutive years and counting  Exxon even managed to continue growing its dividend during the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s  when energy prices slumped into a two decade bear market 
At today s prices  Exxon yields about 3 5   And over the past decade  Exxon has raised its dividend at a 10  annual clip 
Is that kind of growth realistic with oil priced where it is today  Probably not  But even if dividend growth comes in at half that rate over the next decade  that s still pretty solid and more than enough to ensure a happy retirement ",2015-07-09,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/7-stocks-to-fund-a-happy-retirement-257701,257701

134153,355668,VTR,Un Beta Portfolio II  Finding Certainty In Uncertain Markets,opinion,"I don t know if we are in a bear rally or the start of another serious up leg
But then   I m not in the prediction business
There are thousands of pundits ready to tell you which way the market will go tomorrow or this coming week   all of whom collectively cancel each other out
Me  I d rather sleep well knowing we re protected for any possible event 

I can t say if we are in a bear rally or  after 7 years  phhht  that was all the correction we got before heading off to the races again  But since I don t know  I m very happy with our Un Beta Portfolio  In my last article  in which I introduced this portfolio  I noted that for a generation now  a little more than 70  of the total market return has come from dividend income 
Some might say   Yeah  but didn t people who invested that way miss the big moves   Firs of all  what is a  yabbit  and second  yes  the massive rise from April 1997  December 1999 skewed the capital returns to the upside   but the 2000 to mid 2002 decline took 100  of the rise back again  Ditto for the rise from mid 2002 until the spring of 2007  all that and more was lost by March 2009 
 By the way  if Un Beta has a familiar ring to it  readers of a certain age may recall my inspiration for this title  back in the  70s  Geoffrey Holder   the Tony Award winning actor  dancer  choreographer  painter and singer  pitched  The Unnn Cola  for 7 Up  to distinguish its clean  refreshing  unadorned taste with all the other colored  flavored  more complicated colas out there  
It  seems  to me  now that we have had 7 good years of good market  certainly prolonged by Fed intervention  stock buybacks at ever higher prices  and a proliferation of pro forma rather than GAAP earnings reporting  that we are likely to see another decline  But no matter how many gurus tell you they  know  what the market will do  no one really knows  So mine is not a prediction  nor do I invest with the certainty  it must go up  or the certainty that  it must go down  
Therefore  I put my money  and that of our clients  where there is some certainty in an uncertain situation  I look to form the base of my investing pyramid by placing 50  or so in fixed income  That doesn t mean bonds necessarily  though I m happy to use them where appropriate  And it doesn t mean we have a static portfolio  one must always fine tune as a better opportunity to increase yield or raise quality comes along 
In my last article  I mentioned some of my favored foreign and US bond funds and closed end funds  municipal funds  closed end funds and ETFs  and specific preferred shares  all of which we purchased below par and all of which  thanks to the Fed s unwillingness to stick to its charter of keeping employment high and inflation under control  in favor of goosing the markets to the detriment of savers  have roared ahead just like common stocks  All these form the base of a very solid investing pyramid  If you d like to review some of these for your own due diligence  I refer you to that article  link above 
The next level up on our pyramid are dividend paying real estate investment trusts  REITs  and a select few dividend paying common stocks  Again  I must caution  these are not static positions  The asset classes themselves are a constant in our  protect  don t predict  Un Beta Portfolio  but there are many different types of REITs  some of which do best in certain market environments  some of which do poorly  This situation is always fluid so I watch these like a hawk and do my best to stay on top of the game by sliding into the up and comers and out of the overbought or likely to  underperform areas 
For instance  with an improving economy  many investors have concluded that business travel will pick up again and with cheap gas  more vacationers will travel this year  But others are concerned that Airbnb will make a serious dent in the hotel business and that the USD is still too strong to encourage tourists to visit the US  I tend to come down on the former side  So do at least some others 
Lodging firm Starwood  NYSE HOT  the non REIT parent of among others  hotels such as the St  Regis  The Luxury Collection  W  Westin  Le M ridien  Sheraton  and Four Point hotels  is currently mulling two competing takeover bids  The dollar is 3  cheaper this month than last and I believe Airbnb is enjoying the first flush of victory but without any real competition  If their business model proves a success  it will beget competitors and sooner or later quality will suffer 
Plus  there are a very large number of business travelers who don t want  unique    cozy   or  friendly neighbors   They are there to get work done and they want privacy  quiet  certain amenities like wifi that absolutely must work  and above all   no surprises  Add to these  folks like me who are happy to experience the unusual or unique when traveling but  on balance  if on a road trip  I want to accrue loyalty points and have dependable quality since I m just passing through  I can stay at the Hampton Inns  NYSE HLT  and Hyatt Places  NYSE H  that are located along the way  in smaller towns where there is no Airbnb option and  by accruing those loyalty points  stay where I prefer in London  Paris or New York  where there are lots of Airbnb choices 
I know some of the Airbnb homes can be quite nice  I just saw photographs of the  10 000 Airbnb home that Beyonce and  separately  Justin Bieber stayed at in Los Altos  CA  Five bedrooms  infinity pool  11 acres with an orchard  etc  Of course  pandering to celebrity is high sport these days  And Airbnb picks up the tab for numerous celebrities in order to get the biggest bang for their marketing dollar   As a hospitality company that embraces hosting  we work with a number of celebrities and often pick up the tab for their stays   Airbnb said 
Since I m pretty certain Airbnb is not going o invite thee and me to enjoy such earthly delights  I ll use my accrued points to stay for the same price   free   at the Bangkok Hilton  the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong  the Singapore Conrad  the  Hyatt  Hotel Madeleine in Paris or the  Hyatt  Hotel Churchill  don tcha know  when in London  I don t need 5 bedrooms and the infinity pool at the Bangkok Hilton is sized just right   for two 
Among the lodging REITs I like best is Ashford Hospitality Prime  NYSE AHP  Their properties tend to be high end  so Airbnb or a strong dollar are unlikely to deter guests who like to be pampered at properties like the Pier House in Key West  the Bardessono Hotel and Spa in Napa  the Water Tower Sofitel in Chicago or the Ritz Carlton in Saint Thomas 
AHP carries a higher debt load than most of its competitors and does not compare as well in ROA  ROE or operating margins  It doesn t even pay as good a dividend  In other words  management just doesn t seem to be on the ball  On the other hand  all this is already reflected in the price   it s only a couple of points off its 52 week low   and the activists are circling  The company s second largest holder  Sessa Capital  is currently trying to get board representation to get this company s management moving  Two other lodging REITs I am reviewing for possible inclusion in client portfolios are the much larger  better capitalized and better managed LaSalle Hotel Properties  NYSE LHO  and Host Hotels and Resorts  NYSE HST  
I am also a fan of most health care REITs  It s true that health care is down right now  having participated only weakly in the recent  thus far  short rally  But whether the Feds decide to penalize the health care industry even more than Obamacare already has or not  people are still going to age and they are still going to get sick  We may have no doctors left to treat them  my little town here at Lake Tahoe had 4 two years ago  3 shut down their practices  citing the fact that Obamacare forces them to pay more attention to the clock than their patients   but if we do  they ll need clinics and offices and hospitals  Our clients own three REITs that specialize in such medical office and treatment buildings  Physicians Realty Trust  NYSE DOC  Healthcare Realty Trust  NYSE HR  and Healthcare Trust of America  NYSE HTA  
We also own some REITs that specialize in gerontological care and accommodations  Before my Mom s Alzheimer s became so bad she needed special care  she had her own private apartment in such a facility  with common meals  many activities  and nurses on staff and doctors on call for any medical issues  This piqued my interest  so early on I researched and bought Ventas  NYSE VTR   LTC Properties  NYSE LTC   Welltower  NYSE HCN   Omega Healthcare  NYSE OHI  and National Health  NYSE NHI   I could go into a long discourse on each but here s a better idea  I am indebted to Brad Thomas  editor of the Forbes Real Estate Investor  for the latest research and opinion on many REITs  these among them  I m not vain enough to claim every idea is my own or all my research is seminal  no one has a lock on all the good ideas  So I would suggest that you google his name and affiliation for more on these and other fine REITs 
Finally   except for our cash position  some special situations particularly in energy  and a few short hedges  which I may discuss in a future article   we come to our flexible funds  long short funds and managed futures funds  In the interest of time and tide I will go into them in greater depth in my very next article  but for now know that this part of our Unnn Beta Portfolio is critical  These are the holdings that allow us to move up with the market but cushion us  to varying degrees  when it declines  There are ETFs for all these strategies but  frankly  the sharpest talent in most of them are the active managers in mutual funds  This is nowhere more evident than in the flexible portfolio arena where two Leuthold funds  Core  LCORX  and Global  GLBLX  rise to the top  Others of note in this niche or the closely aligned mixed asset target allocation area are Vanguard Wellesley  VWINX   Ridgeworth Conservative Allocation  SCCTX  and Hartford Balanced Income  HBLAX   I recommend all of these for your own due diligence 
Rounding out the rest of the long bias  but still long classic long short playing field  are my three favorite true long short funds  Boston Partners Long  Short Research  BPRRX   and Global Long Short  BGRSX  as well as AQR Long Short Equity  QLEIX   And I like the managed futures funds from AQR as well  both AQR Managed Futures  AQMIX  and its close cousin AQR Equity Market Neutral  QMNIX   Warning  All classes of the AQR funds are available if you work with a Registered Investment Advisor  and maybe other types of financial advisors as well   Go to them on your own  however  and the minimum purchase is from  1 million to  5 million  If that s not your cup of tea  then you might take a look at QuantShares US Market Neutral  NYSE BTAL   an ETF with just enough volume to meet our minimum threshold for liquidity

134182,355697,VTR,Low Cost Funds Dupe Investors,opinion,Fund holdings affect fund performance more than fees or past performance  A cheap fund is not necessarily a good fund  A fund that has done well in the past is not likely to do well in the future  Yet  traditional fund research focuses only on low fees and past performance    Our research on holdings enables investors  to find funds with high quality holdings   AND   low fees    Investors are good at picking cheap funds  We want them to be better at picking funds with good stocks  Both are required to maximize success    Figure 1 shows that 53  of funds assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with low costs but only 4  of assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with Attractive holdings  This discrepancy is astounding    Figure 1  Allocation of Fund Assets By Holdings Quality and By Costs  Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings   Two key shortcomings in the ETF and mutual fund industry cause this large discrepancy  A lack of research into the quality of holdings Not enough research focuses on the quality of Portfolio Management of fundsA lack of high quality holdings or good stocks  With about twice as many funds as stocks in the market  there simply are not enough good stocks to fill all the fundsThese issues are related  in my opinion  If investors had more insight into the quality of funds  holdings  I think they would allocate a lot less money to funds with poor quality holdings  Traditional ETF and fund research focuses only on low fees and past performance  Investors deserve research on the quality of stocks held by ETFs and mutual funds    Quality of holdings is the single most important factor in determining an ETF or mutual fund s future performance  No matter how low the costs  if the ETF or mutual fund holds bad stocks  performance will be poor  Costs are easy to find but research on the quality of holdings is almost non existent    Figure 2 shows investors are not putting enough money into ETFs and mutual funds with high quality holdings  Only 442 of 7471  4  of assets  of ETFs and mutual funds allocate a significantly to quality holdings  96  of assets are in funds that do not justify their costs and over charge investors for poor portfolio management    Figure 2  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Portfolio Management Rating  Source  New Constructs

rating    Clearly  ETF and mutual funds investors are smart shoppers when it comes to finding cheap investments  But cheap is not necessarily good    Vanguard Specialized Funds  Vanguard REIT Index Fund  VGSIX  is one of many funds with low costs but a Very Dangerous Portfolio Management rating  It gets an overall predictive rating of Very Dangerous because no matter how low its fees  I expect it to underperform because it holds too many Dangerous or worse rated stocks  Low fees cannot boost fund performance  Only good stocks can boost performance    One of the Dangerous or worse rated stocks held by VGSIX is Ventas Inc   VTR   to which it allocates over 4  of its value  The company has misleading earnings  dismal returns on invested capital  ROIC   negative cash flow  and an expensive valuation  To justify its current valuation    58 53   VTR must grow after tax profits  NOPAT  at 22  compounded annually for 20 years  It is hard to believe any company will grow that fast for that long  much less one that has misleading earnings  VTR offers investors a poor risk reward trade off    Out of the 97 stocks held by VSGIX  only one earns my Attractive rating and that s National Health Investors  Inc   NHI   NHI has proven that it has the ability to allocate capital intelligently  The company has managed to generate double digit ROIC s for the past nine years ending with a ROIC of 20  in 2011  This places them in the 90th percentile of all Russell 3000 companies  VGSIX s fund manager could turn things around and make VGSIX worthy of investment if he allocated more capital to stocks like NHI as opposed to the meager 0 3  he currently allocates    Figure 3  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Total Annual Costs Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   Investors should allocate their capital to funds with both high quality holdings and low costs because those are the fund that offer investors the best performance potential    But they do not  Not even close    Figure 4 shows that 3  of ETF and mutual fund assets are allocated to funds with low costs and high quality holdings according to my Predictive Fund Ratings  which are based on the quality of holdings and the all in costs to investors    Note the fund industry offers 3191 Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds compared to just 173 Attractive or better ETFs and mutual funds  nearly 18 times more bad funds than good funds  That means a lot of fees are being paid to managers that do not derive them    Figure 4  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Predictive Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   Investors deserve forward looking ETF and mutual fund research that assesses both costs and quality of holdings  For example  GMO Trust  GMO US Intrinsic Value Fund  GMVUX  is a fund with both low costs and an Attractive Portfolio Management rating    Two of the good stocks held by GMVUX are ConocoPhillips  COP  and UnitedHealth Group Inc  UNH   Both stocks get my Attractive rating  They have positive or rising economic earnings  high ROICs and cheap valuations  COP s current stock price    54 share  implies the company s NOPAT will permanently decline by 70  when our model shows rising economic earnings in 2011  UNH s current stock price    55 share  implies the company s NOPAT will permanently decline by 20   Both of these stocks offer Attractive risk reward because the expectations in their valuations are so low and their economic earnings are strong    Why is the most popular fund rating system based on backward looking past performance    I do not know  but I do know that the lack of transparency into the quality of portfolio management provides cover for the ETF and mutual fund industry to continue to over charge investors for poor portfolio management  How else could they get away with selling nearly 18 times more Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds than Attractive or better    John Bogle is correct    investors should not pay high fees for active portfolio management  His index funds have provided investors with many low cost alternatives to actively managed funds    However  by focusing entirely on costs  he overlooks the primary driver of fund performance  the stocks held by funds    Research on the quality of portfolio management of

134189,355704,VTR,5 Senior Housing REITs Raising Their Dividends,opinion,"Want to invest on the right side of one of the biggest demographic shifts in history  Try senior housing REITs 

10 000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day  and over the next 15 years  the number of Americans over the age of 50 will   This means unprecedented demand for everything from active retirement communities with golf and tennis lessons to assisted living with full time nurses 

This is fantastic news if you happen to be a senior housing landlord and with the plethora of publically traded senior themed REITs  you can  indeed  be a landlord  Today  we re going to look at the senior housing REITs best positioned to profit from the graying of America 

I should be clear on one point  Investing based on demographic trends is a long term strategy  But your patience is likely to be rewarded  In their  on demographics and industry returns  professors Stefano DellaVigna and Joshua Pollet found that  over time horizons of five to ten years  each additional point of annual demand growth due to demographic factors led to a 5  10  jump in annual abnormal industry stock returns  But over periods of five years or less  demographics had little impact on stock returns  With demographic trends  patience is key 

With that said  let s jump into some of the best potential long term senior REIT buys 

LTC Properties

LTC Properties Inc  NYSE LTC  invests primarily in the long term care sector of the health care industry  including long term care provider properties  skilled nursing properties  assisted living properties  independent living properties and memory care properties  LTC also invests in first lien mortgages secured by long term care properties 

A little over 80  of LTC s portfolio is invested in properties with the remainder in mortgages  And among properties  skilled nursing is the biggest single segment  at 55   Assisted living comes in second at 37  

With any health related stock  you have to address the issue of Medicare  It s no secret that the U S  government is short of funds these days  and Medicare cutbacks have been an unfortunate outcome  But that is what makes LTC such an attractive way to play the trend of Boomer aging  LTC is a landlord  not a care provider  so Medicare cutbacks will have little impact on revenues  And even better  most of LTC s properties are leased under triple net leases  meaning the tenant covers taxes  insurance and maintenance 

LTC s monthly dividend works out to a current yield of 4 3   making it competitive with other medical REITs  And importantly  LTC is a serial dividend raiser  Over the past five years  LTC has grown its dividend at a 9 3  annual clip  Had you bought LTC five years ago and held until today  you d be enjoying a yield on cost of 6 9   Not bad 

Ventas

Next up is one of the bluest of blue chip REITs  Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR  one of the few REITs included in the S P 500  With a market cap of  23 billion  Ventas is one of the largest holdings in most REIT index funds  Due to its sheer size  Ventas cannot grow at the rate that some of its smaller rivals can  But with its size comes stability and financial strength 

56  of Ventas property portfolio is invested in senior housing  split between 26  in  triple net  properties  26  in domestic operating properties  and 4  in international operating properties  Another 19  of the portfolio is invested in post acute care facilities  15  is invested in medical office buildings and the rest is spread among hospitals  loans and other properties 

So  in Ventas  you get a nice  diversified sampling of the facilities that aging Boomers will be using in the decades ahead 

Ventas sports a lower current dividend yield of 4 1   And like LTC  Ventas is also a serial dividend raiser  Ventas has grown its dividend at a 7 5  annual clip over the past five years  Had you bought Ventas five years ago and held until today  you d be enjoying a yield on cost of a very respectable 5 5  

Health Care REIT

Another option would be Health Care REIT Inc  NYSE HCN   Like Ventas  HCN is big  with a market cap of  28 billion  It s also one of the view REITs in the S P 500 

From its name  you might assume that HCN was primarily a play on hospitals and doctor s offices  but it s not  Only about  is invested in health related properties 

About 64  of the portfolio is in senior housing  split between properties that HCN operates  38   and those that are leased on a triple net basis  26    Looking at the health related properties  medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities make up another 16  and 14  of the portfolio  respectively  and the rest is split between hospitals and research facilities 

Impressively  apart from the skilled nursing facilities and hospitals  which depend heavily on Medicare and Medicaid  HCN s tenants have very little dependence on the government  Across its portfolio   are from private pay clients  That s a major positive in an era of slashed reimbursements and Obamacare restrictions 

HCN sports a dividend yield of 3 7  and has been a steady dividend grower for years  Over the past five years  HCN has grown its dividend at a 3 2  clip  Had you bought HCN five years ago  you d be enjoying a yield on cost of 4 5  today 

HCP  Inc 

Next up is HCP Inc  NYSE HCP   a blue chip REIT included in both the S P 500 Index and the Dividend Aristocrats Index following its 259 consecutive years of dividend hikes  With a  22 billion market cap  HCP is just a hair smaller than Ventas 

At 37   senior housing makes up the largest segment of HCP s portfolio  followed by post acute facilities at 31   Life sciences  medical offices  and hospitals fill out the rest of the portfolio at 14   13  and 5   respectively 

Given its size and quality  HCP pays a very respectable dividend at 4 5   And HCP has managed to grow that dividend at a 3 4  over the past five years  An investment five years ago would be generating a yield on cost of 5 3  today 

Sabra Health Care REIT

And finally  we get to Sabra Healthcare REIT Inc  NASDAQ SBRA   a smaller competitor with a market cap of  1 8 billion  Sabra owns 154 real estate properties in 34 states including 102 skilled nursing facilities  50 senior housing facilities  and two acute care hospitals  Sabra s properties are rented under triple net leases  meaning that the tenants are responsible for all maintenance  taxes and insurance 

54  of Sabra s revenues come from skilled nursing properties with 31  coming from senior living facilities  The remainder comes from acute care hospitals  Importantly  Sabra has been shifting its portfolio away from tenants that depend on reimbursement from the government  In 2013  68  of rent revenues depended on non private  i e  government  payers  Last year  it was reduced to just 46  

Sabra s history as a dividend paying REIT is fairly short  as the company was formerly part of Sun Healthcare Group  But since 2011  Sabra has raised its dividend by 22   The shares sport a current dividend yield of 4 7

134190,355705,VTR,An Undervalued REIT With A Nice Dividend,opinion,"Wouldn t it be nice to find a high yielding investment that s set to prosper from a powerful  long term trend 
Such a prospect would be quite valuable in today s challenging investing environment   especially given the dearth of real income opportunities 
While we re at it  what if this firm was trading at a discount relative to its better known competitors 
If you think that s too much to ask  well  it turns out you re wrong 
Enter  Senior Housing Properties Trust  NYSE SNH    a real estate investment trust  REIT  that owns independent living and assisted living communities  continuing care retirement communities  nursing homes  wellness centers  and medical office  clinic  and biotech laboratory buildings throughout the United States 
With a  4 6 billion market cap  it s not exactly tiny   but it s often passed over for its bigger competitors  such as Health Care REIT  Health Care REIT Inc  NYSE HCN     Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR    and  HCP Inc  NYSE HCP   
However  a quick glance at the numbers shows that Senior Housing isn t getting enough love  The chart below compares SNH to the three aforementioned companies 

One thing that sticks out immediately is SNH s dividend   which  at just shy of 7   is quite attractive 
In fact  this REIT stands up to other industry favorites all the way across the board 
For starters  it s relatively cheap right now  with a 2015 estimated price to funds from operation  P FFO  multiple that s well below the competition 
Additionally  SNH s one year net operating income  NOI  growth is nearly four times that of the other firms  while its debt to total assets is right in line with the industry s biggest players 
To top it off  SNH s assets are widely diversified  The firm is set to close on a deal during the first quarter of 2015 that will add 23 properties in 12 states  which gives it a total of 650 tenants in 395 properties across 39 states 
America s Aging Population
Additionally  SNH is well positioned to benefit from America s rapidly aging populace 
Currently  55  of Senior Housing s property is   go figure   senior housing  while the other 45  is mostly in medical office buildings 
Given that the age 65  population is growing more rapidly than the rest of the country  and will require increasing numbers of healthcare and assisted living facilities   SNH should be in good shape  The chart below illustrates the country s aging population trend 

Soon  more than 20  of the country will be above the age of 65   and that number has more than doubled since 1970 
Indeed  with a two headed business that encompasses both healthcare and senior housing  SNH should be able to capitalize as more and more people enter their golden years  Plus  SNH is the industry leader in private pay assets  meaning the firm should be able to weather the uncertainties surrounding Obamacare and Medicare 
Bottom line  With a juicy yield  relatively cheap valuation  and a well positioned business  SNH is one of the more intriguing income opportunities out there today ",2015-02-11,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-undervalued-reit-with-a-nice-dividend-241612,241612
134191,355706,VTR,The Real News Driving This Healthcare REIT Higher,opinion,"Ventas Inc   NYSE VTR  made news on Monday by announcing its purchase of privately held hospital chain Ardent Medical Services  sending shares up about 2  premarket and up more than 5  in Monday trading 
Though I view the jump as a little excessive  the market is giving the deal a very enthusiastic thumbs up 
The real news in the announcement   and the reason the shares are popping   has nothing to do with the hospital purchases 
Apart from the hospital deal  Ventas announced it would be spinning off its skilled nursing facilities  We ll jump into both of these items  but let s tackle the hospitals first 
Ventas is the second largest healthcare REIT in the world by market cap and the fifth largest REIT overall  It s also one of the few REITs included in the S P 500  But going into the deal  Ventas had very little exposure to hospitals  In fact  Ventas  portfolio makes it less a  healthcare  REIT and more a play on senior housing 
Dividing the portfolio by its contribution to net operating income  53  of Ventas  current property portfolio is invested in senior housing  split between 24  in  triple net  properties  25  in domestic operating properties and 4  in international operating properties  Another 17  of the portfolio is invested in skilled nursing post acute care facilities  18  is invested in medical office buildings  with 7  in hospitals and the remainder spread among loans and other properties 
Hospital Deal Will Boost FFO for VTR
There is a reason for Ventas  former hesitancy to invest in hospitals  Running a hospital has historically been a lousy business with high overhead and the unsolvable problem of having to provide emergency services to the uninsured knowing full well that they had no ability to pay  About 60  of all unpaid medical services are provided by hospitals  which leaves them at the mercy of the federal  state and local governments to at least partially plug the gaps 
Well  the economics of the business have gotten a little better in this age of Obamacare  Estimates from the Health and Human Services Department show that costs for treating the uninsured fell by more than  7 billion last year  All the same  we re still talking about roughly  38 billion in uncompensated services every year 
So  if running a hospital is such a cruddy business  why is Ventas interested 
That s easy  Ventas won t be running the hospital operations  Ventas intends to strip out the hospital real estate to keep for itself and sell the messy operations back to Ardent s management  This will make Ventas a pure landlord responsible for collecting the rent and not much else  Under a triple net lease  the tenant is responsible for all maintenance  insurance and taxes 
All in all  Ventas expects the deal to add about 8 cents to 10 cents to its annual funds from operations  That s not bad  but we need to remember that Ventas had FFO of  4 48 last year  So while the hospital properties are indeed a nice addition to an already solid portfolio  they don t quite explain the market s enthusiasm  This brings us to the real news  The spinoff of the skilled nursing facilities 
Does VTR s Spinoff News Matter to Investors 
  the company will spin off 355 triple net leased skilled nursing facilities into a new entity  Current Ventas shareholders will get shares of the new company as a tax free distribution 
So  why is Ventas so eager to dump the skilled nursing facilities 
That s easy  They re looking to decrease their dependence on government payers like Medicare and Medicaid and focus more on properties with private pay clientele 
Should investors care 
Ventas has had a great run  generating returns of about 29  per year over the past 15 years  And for the income investors in the room  Ventas stock has boosted its dividend at a nice 8 1  clip over the past five years  Management clearly has a knack for creating value  and I m sure the spinoff will be no exception 
But based on the REIT s current large market cap  you can t realistically expect the kinds of total returns we ve seen in the past 
That said  Ventas is a fantastic healthcare REIT  and it is one that I believe you can buy  dump in a drawer  and hold for decades without much in the way of risk  Today s dividend yield of about 3  is not particularly high  but it s not unattractive in a world of sub 2  bond yields  While I might prefer to wait for a pullback  Ventas is certainly worth considering  even at today s prices

134200,355715,VTR,Aging Population Should Power This REIT,opinion,"A famous proverb  often attributed to Benjamin Franklin  states that nothing in life is certain but death and  
And while that may be true  it hasn t stopped humankind from working to delay each person s final moments as long as possible  The result  of course  is that more and more people are living to advanced ages 
Meanwhile  the Baby Boomers   the largest generation in American history until recently   are joining the 65 and older population in great numbers 
The portion of the U S  population over age 65 is 17 5  today  and that number is expected to rise substantially in the next 30 years  In fact  by 2045  slightly more than a quarter of all Americans will have entered that demographic 
That s a powerful trend  and one company in particular has made several shrewd moves in April that should help it outperform going forward 
Addition by Subtraction
Ventas Inc  NYSE VTR  is a healthcare real estate investment trust  REIT  with a diversified portfolio of over 1 600 seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States  Canada  and the United Kingdom 
It s an intriguing company that has outperformed both the S P 500 and the MSCI US REIT Index  RMZ  for more than a decade while providing compound annual dividend growth of 9    not to mention that its current dividend yield is a very nice 4 33  
And recently  on April 6  Ventas announced two moves that should provide a significant step toward continued outperformance 
By mid year  Ventas will close a deal to acquire Ardent Health Services  a for profit hospital company whose network includes 12 acute care hospitals  a rehabilitation hospital  three multi specialty physician groups  and retail pharmacies 
Ventas ultimately plans to separate the hospital operations from the real estate and sell the operations portion of the business back to Ardent Management  Ventas will maintain a 9 9  stake in the new entity  but otherwise  it ll simply own the property and collect rent 
In conjunction with the Ardent deal  Ventas also plans to spin off its post acute care skilled nursing facilities into a new publicly traded REIT  Care Capital Properties  Inc   CCP   The new company  which will be one of just two pure play  publicly traded skilled nursing facility REITS  will own and operate 355 nursing homes across the country 
Initially  investors were thrilled by the moves  and Ventas stock shot up 5   However  it has given up those gains in the weeks since  and that s good news for patient investors  who now have a chance to buy VTR at a better price and hold it for the long term 
Deft Maneuvers
Indeed  Ventas looks well positioned to capitalize on the enormous aging population trend   as well as some helpful changes courtesy of Obamacare 
For instance  the Affordable Care Act is making hospitals much more profitable at the moment  which bodes well for the Ardent acquisition  Estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services show that the costs for treating the uninsured fell by  7 4 billion in 2014  which represents a 21  decrease from what costs could ve been if they d stayed at 2013 levels  As the number of uninsured continues to shrink  hospitals should continue to see their profits grow 
Meanwhile  the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has recommended a 3 25  increase in Medicare rates for acute care services for FY 2016  which should provide some relief to hospitals who are often left with reimbursements that don t cover the cost of care provided 
Plus  Ventas has been actively moving toward private pay sources for some time now in order to avoid the pitfalls of insufficient reimbursement  According to its website  the company now derives approximately 76  of its net operating income  NOI  from such sources  which is a great sign for future growth 
What s Not to Like 
Of course  being well positioned is irrelevant if the company is expensive  Luckily  Ardent appears reasonably valued right now 
Its 2015 estimated price to funds from operation  P FFO  is 15 5x  which is in line with other healthcare REITs and is below its own 10 year average  VTR is also the cheapest U S  REIT  with a market cap of  20 billion or more right now   though  the other REITs in that group span a variety of disparate industries 
As far as growth  Ventas has posted an extremely impressive five year annual revenue growth rate of 27 21   And Friday s earnings report  which featured a plethora of good news  also showed that Ventas is a healthy business  The company beat analysts  estimates for the fourth time in five quarters and reported solid growth  The total seniors housing operating portfolio NOI of  148 6 million represents a 21  increase  and same store cash NOI growth for the total portfolio was 3 2  
Bottom line  Ventas appears well positioned to capitalize on a powerful trend   the aging U S  population  Indeed  there s no reason to think Ventas won t continue to outperform going forward  and investors will be paid handsomely in the short term just for holding shares of this attractive REIT ",2015-04-29,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aging-population-should-power-this-reit-250046,250046
