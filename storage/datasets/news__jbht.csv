officer and president of highway services  Darren Field  executive vice president of intermodal  Brad Hicks  executive vice president of dedicated  and our Chief Accounting Officer John Kuhlow  At this time  I d like to turn the call to our CEO  Mr  John Roberts  for some opening comments  John Roberts    Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Brad  During our last call  my comments were focused on the key steps taken over the past several years that have charted our course  We highlighted how we prioritized two key growth initiatives  our technology platforms known comprehensively as J B  Hunt 360 and our final mile service offerings  We also confirmed our commitment to intermodal  dedicated and highway services as a part of our long term strategy  In 2019  we grew total revenue by 6  and operating income by 8   This data includes a downward shift of approximately  16 million in op income opportunity for ICS  in part driven by our stated position to move forward with the developmental strategies we have for our digital freight management platform  360  We called out a challenging pricing cycle through fiscal 2019 impacting our comparative data  And it should be observed that the financial data between 2018 and 2019 is rather noisy due to several onetime charges that occurred in 2018  Even still  we see the results for the year is confirming our ongoing portfolio approach to the markets we serve  A key to the improvement shown in 2019 for the company  overall  come from our DCS business unit  As the growth initiated in 2018 predictably moved into more stable performance for DCS  we experienced 25  top line growth and 39  operating income growth  In part  these increases are enhanced by the two previous acquisitions made for our final mile services  along with a strong trend in organic growth of private fleet conversion  which we anticipate will continue in 2020  We also enjoy an extremely high retention rate  approximately 98  with this business  which we attribute to the closeness we maintain to our customers in operations and shared data used in managing the services we provide  We are also pleased to have recently announced our third acquisition for final mile  Through 2019  intermodal continued to strive to return to loan growth and demonstrated a slight directional uptick through the third and fourth quarters  As we are in the early stages of bid season  we will watch closely for a balanced approach to growth and rate quality  We continue to experience cost headwinds and utilization challenges  both of which keep pressure on desired near term margin improvement  Hopefully  with much of the PSR work behind us  we can work with our rail providers to increase the transit velocity and service reliability needed to convert more business from the highways going forward  In addition  we will keep a close watch on freight patterns with newer customers in 360 for intermodal conversion opportunities  Our highway services lines  ICS and truckload  continue to monitor the pricing cycle challenges presented through the fourth quarter and the beginning of bid season  Our truckload business delivered a solid year given the conditions in 2019 and continues its march toward a more asset light model into 2020  ICS will continue to work through current bids  and we expect the investment in technology  particularly for the marketplace and shipper and carrier programs in 360  to continue throughout 2020  Lastly  we will be breaking out the final mile service business from DCS beginning in first quarter 2020 with supporting financial data for the prior year from both final mile and dedicated  2019 was a progressive year in many respects  and I see the setup for 2020 is productive  I expect this year to both reveal and confirm our strategy in executing on our base businesses  while we expand our presence within our growth channels  I ll now ask Dave Mee to make his comments David Mee    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  John  I ll just going to focus a little bit more on the shorter term results  basically around the fourth quarter of 2019  We experienced a fairly strong but a very compressed peak season during the quarter  and it allowed no room for operational hiccup  In addition  we saw customer expectations for operational accuracy at one of the highest levels we ve ever experienced  This was not a surprise to us going into the quarter  and we knew that if conditions change from our planning assumptions  we were going to err on the side of customer satisfaction  In intermodal  we realized some volume growth off the West Coast  as expected  but we also continue to feel the effects of the volume contraction as we finally get to lap delay in closure comps  but continue to see headwinds from truck competition in the Eastern network  And the Western growth was not seen across all of our customers  that put additional pressure on revenue per load results  In addition  we lost some volume due to some rail service interruptions and we incurred some additional costs recovering from those events  trying to meet customer expectations  In dedicated  we benefited from our customers  fluid freight patterns during the condensed peak season as the year over year asset productivity improvement and steady and predictable new contract start ups kept sequential margins from experiencing their normal seasonal decline from third quarter to fourth quarter  In ICS  we realized both volume and revenue growth versus last year  but this was almost entirely due to freight mix changes away from LTL business and toward truckload freight  This mix change resulted from both customer directives and a more concerted effort on our product to penetrate further into truckload brokered freight and then drive it through our Marketplace 360 platform  Most of this freight was contractual business  where we experienced very competitive pricing gain to bid season over the prior several quarters  However  we did not experience similar competitive pricing in the third party carrier markets  nor did we capture a materially larger portion of spot activity during the fourth quarter  hence  our margins were squeezed  Our operating income declined as we continue to disproportionately invest in a disruptive technology of Marketplace 360  And as John alluded to  we will continue to do so  most likely for the next four to six quarters  as we complete and improve our digital platforms to generate revenue growth and operating income longer term  In truck  we were down in both revenue and operating income  primarily from a smaller volume of spot activity and general customer rate pressure compared to a year ago  However  the mixture of company owned equipment with independent contract carriers buffered the operating income and return on capital impacts we have historically experienced during these volume and rate declines when we were operating with 100  of fleet  Brad  that pretty much covers my prepared remarks  I think we re now ready for questions Brad Delco    Vice President of Investor Relations All right  We re ready for questions  You can open up the lines  Questions   Answers  OperatorAll right   Operator instructions  All right  We ll go ahead and take the first question  All right  Your line is unmuted  Please state your name and your organization Christian Wetherbee    Citi    Analyst Yeah  Hey  it s Chris Wetherbee from Citi  Thanks for taking the question  I appreciate it  I guess I want to talk a little bit about what we expect the intermodal load growth to look like as we move at least into the first half of the year  You mentioned we re lapping some of the PSR initiatives for lane rationalization  I think there s been some share gains  Do we see an acceleration from what we saw on the fourth quarter  Do we need to see sort of improvement from rail utilization to kind of see that Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal OK  Fair question  one that we certainly would have expected  We hit a negative volume run rate in the back half of  18  As we entered early  19  the loan closures produced sort of a steeper hill to climb to dig out of the volume position we were in  And so we re happy that in the back half of  19  we were able to dig out of that and actually represent positive volume growth in the fourth quarter  Certainly  turning the corner on the comparison from last year when we lost an annualized run rate of 60 000 to 70 000 loads during the first quarter due to lane closures  certainly  this year  not having that comparison is going to drive some help for us  So I would expect continued volume growth  We re not guiding on just what that would be  but we re certainly    have the expectation based on what we know today that we will continue growing in 2020 Christian Wetherbee    Citi    Analyst OK  That s helpful  I appreciate that  And then just a follow up on the 360 spend  I know incrementally another four to six quarters of spend  Do you start to see that the potential losses go down or at least the rate of spending decelerates from here  Or maybe the net impact of that spending decelerates because maybe there s some profit coming from the initiative  I just want to get a sense of maybe how to think about the cost and maybe the returns starting to pile up here as we go through the next several quarters Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services Yes  So if we think about our investment in 360  we really think about it in three key areas  We are making an investment in scaling the business as we believe it s critical to reach mass scale for us to create a more efficient transportation network  So that s the first component that we re very focused on  That will be very dependent on what s happening in the market from a brokerage perspective in both bid season and in the carrier PTE side  The second piece of our investment is around our people  And so we do have people for both our shippers and our carriers  making sure that our experience is one that our customers would rave about and want to repeat and continue doing business with a very high retention rate on both customers and carriers  And then the third piece is in our technology spend  And so from a tech spend  we will continue to invest the rest of this year  really  our people and tech costs is fairly well known for 2020  too early for 2021  It s    the variability is more on our investment in scale and what that will look like here through the rest of this year Christian Wetherbee    Citi    Analyst OK  Thank you very much  Appreciate it OperatorAll right  With that  we ll go ahead and take the next question  This question comes from Justin Long from Stephens Inc Justin Long    Stephens Inc     Analyst Thanks  This is Justin Long from Stephens  Wanted to start with a question on intermodal margins  I know your initial expectation was for sequential improvement in the fourth quarter  we ended up seeing margins decline by about 40 basis points sequentially  Is there any way to break out how much of that shortfall was related to repositioning costs  And how much was related to the derailment you mentioned  I just wanted to get a better understanding of how much of this margin shortfall was specific to the fourth quarter versus something we ll continue to see in 2020 Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal OK  Again  another fair question  Justin  This is Darren  I think our margin challenge in the fourth quarter is simply costs are higher today than what we have experienced  In 2018  we were successful in increasing prices  but a lot of those dollars found their way to support our labor costs  Our rail purchase transportation costs are up and intermodal participates in the technology improvements we re making at J B  Hunt as well  So all of those present  to some degree  some challenge  As we go into 2020  it s certainly our expectation to be working toward improvements in our cost structure  but it s probably pretty early to call anything specific about that  I would just say the fourth quarter was hurt in a meaningful way by empty repositioning  But at the same time  empty repositioning is something we ve done during my entire career at J B  Hunt  and I would expect we will continue to do some degree of that in 2020  obviously  But that s an opportunity for us through mix and sales and our efforts with our customer base to help fill some of those empties  and that s an ongoing effort  And as we go through 2020  we ll be working toward solving that Justin Long    Stephens Inc     Analyst OK  That s helpful  Thanks  Darren  And secondly  I wanted to get your updated thoughts on intermodal pricing  I know it s still a little bit early  but curious if you had an initial take on what you think 2020 bid season could look like  And based on that outlook  do you feel like getting back to the intermodal margin target of 11  to 13  is possible in 2020  Or do we need to see a better pricing environment to get there Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Well  you re never going to hear me say it s not possible  Clearly  it s possible  I think it s    I think we have a lot of headwinds in front of us  The pricing  well  like you are saying  it is very early to say  we have very limited results and the results that we do have  have been a mixed bag  We have results that are beneficial  We have some pressure on price  certainly  and we have a lot of efforts going on in order to help solve for some of our mix challenges  And when you add    layer that on to just a difficult capacity market  I think it s really early to try to predict what will happen with price  but I would highlight there s pressure out there Justin Long    Stephens Inc     Analyst OK  I ll leave it at that  Thanks for the time OperatorAll right  Our next question comes from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs  Your line is unmuted  Please go ahead Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Yeah  Hi  Just a question on the dedicated business  Can you give an update on your fleet expectations for 2020 and then sort of longer term  And you mentioned productivity improving  I m just sort of wondering if you could comment a little bit more on that and how you expect that to move through next year  this year as well  Thanks Brad Hicks Certainly  This is Brad  Good morning Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Good morning Brad Hicks We would expect 2020 to be very similar to what we experienced in 2019 in terms of new sales  targeting 800 to 1 000 trucks inside of 2020  and really continue to have confidence in our ability to operate in the 11  to 13  range  as we ve stated historically  for the long term for our traditional dedicated business model  So pipelines remain very favorable to it based on historical standards  and we believe that    it gives us optimism to believe that we ll be successful in our 800 to 1 000 trucks Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Thank you  And just a quick follow up and you maybe addressed this  I don t remember  on the ICS business  I know you sort of talked about the    obviously  the increased spending  And then  obviously  there s the market weakness that s pretty well documented in brokerage right now  Any sense for like the order of magnitude between the two in terms of whether it be the decline in profits versus last year or sequentially  Just to try to get a sense for order of magnitude between the market and your spending  Thank you Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services So I would say  as we progress through the fourth quarter  we saw more margin compression as the quarter moves forward  So as we moved into December  really  right before Thanksgiving  all the way through December  we saw a pretty big squeeze from a margin perspective  primarily driven from the supply side  That has continued here in January  And I would say that s historically off from what we ve experienced in the past several years in total  So I think for us  we re just watching what s happening in the market and trying to make sure that we make the best estimates with our customers on how we should best handle what s happening and being close to the market Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Great  Thank you OperatorAll right  Moving on  Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski  Barclays Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    Analyst Hey  good morning  everyone  And thanks for taking my questions  I guess  Shelley  coming off the last question there  can you discuss the strategy  I guess  as you build out and make the investments this year  I think you guys have said that you have those losses probably continue through the year  But is this a game where you re increasing your efficiency to have much greater scale  you want to see a lot of growth and we just need to wait for the market to come back  Or is this more internally specific to what you guys are doing Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services Good question  So I believe we ve said the losses could continue between four and six quarters from our last call  And I believe Dave also reiterated that in our opening remarks  I will tell you  we are focused on gaining scale in the platform from a shipment perspective  and that s really from the data we see in the platform from the carrier community  So we do have a large adoption from the carriers  We see the abandon rate inside our platform  how often they re abandoning  and really how we need to  if you will  get the shelves full  That s a huge focus for us  But in addition to that  the market is under pressure on both our customer side and recently on the carrier supply side  So I would say that has a more material impact in ICS over the last six weeks  But our strategy is to continue to work very closely with our customers through the rest of this year and next year to build scale  and we will see the efficiency with our people moving into 2021 back half in total  and that should drive toward our bottom line Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    Analyst Sorry  just as a point of clarification  When we say supply  is that constraint on supply Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services There are constraints on supply  There have    there s been constraints on supply since about the week before Thanksgiving  We have seen slight easing over the last day or two  but it has been very tight on the supply side Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    Analyst OK  And then  if I don t    if you don t mind answering  but there s a lot of competitors  I think  pushing bigger into similar products and business models  So can you just tell us what is really differentiated about the 360 platform versus maybe some of the new entrants Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services Yeah  So for us  we are the largest multimodal digital freight platform  So we don t really look at it from a brokerage only perspective  We really think about the  700 billion market and how do we take waste out of the  700 billion market  So one third of every driver that is available in the market today  3 5 million drivers  one third of their hours is completely wasted every single day  And that s the heart of what we re trying to accomplish in 360  removing the waste in the system  So for us  our multimodal approach in bringing really the best intermodal product  best dedicated product to market inside that and certainly the large highway side really allows us to solve for our customers in a more efficient way Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    Analyst Thank you OperatorAll right  Moving on  Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel David Ross    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Yes  Good morning  A question on the intermodal side of things  You mentioned that you expect volumes to be up an undisclosed amount in 2020  Is that true for both the Eastern and the Western loads  Or is there a difference among those two Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal So we didn t differentiate the two there  I would say that s on macro for our system  I think it s too early to know the answer to that  Clearly  Eastern Network is where the bulk of the highway capacity challenges is really hurting intermodal s ability  Both Eastern railroads have improved their service in the back half of 2019  and we re encouraged by that  I don t have either railroad come and suggesting that they d like to cut our costs so that we can become more competitive in the market  So we will offer intermodal products to our customers across the board in the East and the West  I think  in today s environment  there is a challenge to grow in the East because the customers are able to secure truckload capacity at rates equal to or better than intermodal  And until we can offer economics and service  combined  that outperform truck  we re going to be challenged there  So we re not highlighting that we think any one segment will be stronger  That would certainly be    or would be growing  certainly  that would be    our system  our network will grow in 2020 David Ross    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst And then just a follow on  You mentioned the lane imbalances that popped up more than normal because there s always certain lane imbalances  Was that concentrated in either the east or the west  And what drove  I guess  the higher than usual lane imbalances in the network Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal I think what drove it is  for the first time in the history of our company  we were negative in volumes  And when trying to turn the corner  the load volume that is available to grow with comes on when it s available  And so growth  in essence  it s almost like a start up expense  We re layering on new business  and the opportunities that were presented to us in the middle to back half of last year were concentrated in a few markets  and that drove empty repositioning requirements in order to produce the capacity to bring on that business  We didn t highlight any repositioning in the East or the West  and so we reposition empties in both markets  And so I m just going to leave it at the macro  we certainly had a little higher run rate than what is normal  However  it s very normal to move empties in both markets all the time David Ross    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst That s helpful  Thank you OperatorAll right  Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research Scott Group    Wolfe Research    Analyst Hey  thanks  Morning  guys  So Darren  I get 11  to 13  is tough for the year  So two questions  One  do you think you see any margin improvement in intermodal this year  And then as you take over this role  do you think the 11  to 13  target is still the right long term target  Or do you think it s appropriate to sort of reset those lower Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal I m certainly not going to change our long term margin target  That s been our target for the long time and will continue to be our target  We re working every day to find ways to drive efficiency into our system  which would help expand our margin  Walk me through the first part of your question again  I just    you hit me with am I ready to change the long term target  Absolutely not Scott Group    Wolfe Research    Analyst The first part was just  do you think you see any intermodal margin improvement or not this year Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Well  certainly  finding a better margin is part of our plan  There are just    there s still a lot of unknowns out there  So I m not going to tell you that we re not planning to improve the margin  Certainly  we are Scott Group    Wolfe Research    Analyst OK  And then  Shelley  on the ICS  So I think we get four to six more quarters of losses  Any directional color on the magnitude of those losses  meaning  we did 103 or lower in the fourth quarter  Did that seem like the right sort of place  And then if we re losing money  at least for the next period of time  and you should be thinking maybe judging on maybe revenue growth  what s sort of the revenue growth that you d be happy with at that segment this year  Is it 10   20   50   I don t know how to think about it Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services So we think about revenue growth really outpacing our historical norm and outpacing what the market looks like  So if we are doing that  it will really trend with whatever is happening in the market  and that would be good for us  From a loss perspective  it s going to be very dependent on what happened here this bid season and also what s happening on the    in the carrier market  If we haven t experienced such a tightening on the supply side the last six weeks  probably we would have more certainty as to when the losses occur this year and by quarter  But because of that  I m a little fuzzy on what that s going to look like for the rest of the year Scott Group    Wolfe Research    Analyst OK  Thank you  guys OperatorOK  Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with the Susquehanna Financial Group Bascome Majors    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Yeah  Thanks for taking my questions  guys  If you look back over the last six years  the intermodal business has compounded profit growth of about 2  per year  If you look at the six years before that  it was closer to 11   and that period actually includes the Great Recession right in the middle of it  From a real high level and long term view  is    does management and the board of J B  Hunt still view intermodal as a secularly growing business  Or is it just becoming more cyclical in nature as you ve gotten bigger  supply chains are getting shorter and the Class 1 railroads continue to work to extract value from their partners Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Sure  I think it s a very fair question  Certainly  we continue to see opportunities from our customers in the millions of loads  I think we ve shared    I even think Terry highlighted on the last call  8 million to 10 million loads of opportunity to convert off the highway to intermodal  Now that s in raw data  The reality is we have to produce the combination of economics and service that convince that customer base that intermodal is the right solution for them  I would be wrong if I didn t highlight that it s more difficult today than it was during the six year period you ve referenced  There was a lot of expansion in the intermodal system  We had railroads opening services during those six years  So you have    you can go after some lower hanging fruit that the business that is warehouse transfer and it s inventory replenishment  and it s items that intermodal is perfect for  In today s environment  our customers are expecting a more truck like service environment with a benefit in the economics  Obviously  they re not going to give us intermodal business at rates that are higher than they can get the business truck for  They do expect some version of a discount  and it s up to us with our rail providers to develop service solutions that will continue to drive intermodal growth as we move into the next several years  I expect us to be successful in doing that  So yes  I expect it to be a growth market  but we need the railroads to participate with us on the service front and economics front  I think it is in their    they are delivering a strategy that that s what they want to do  I guess  over the next four or five years  we ll see if we re able to work together to accomplish that Bascome Majors    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Thank you for the thoughtful answer there  If I could just clarify the last point  In partnering with the railroads  has the bigger challenge in your perspective been the service design changes  Or is it the lack of flexibility in your cost of capacity  Thanks Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Wow  great question  I m not sure there s a correct answer to that  It s both  The lack of flexibility    reality is the railroads would say   In order to be more competitive on the economics  I have to find a way to be efficient   And one of the ways they can be more efficient is they re removing some of the flexibility from the customers trying to drive benefits in their networks  which ultimately produce a lower cost that we can pass along to the customer  So is it a chicken or egg thing  Are they trying to develop efficiencies so that we can  together with the railroads and the intermodal market  produce a lower cost to pass along with the customer  I think that s very real  And every railroad would say   I would love to offer a discount  a stronger discount to the market to grow intermodal  But in order to do that  I have to cut my costs   And I think that s a fair perspective on their part to try to drive efficiency in their system so that we can  together  pass some portion of that on to the customer Bascome Majors    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Thank you for all the time OperatorAll right  That will move on to our next question  This question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Todd Fowler    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Great  Thanks  and good morning  I just wanted to ask on final mile  I know that we re going to get some more detail next quarter and have that broken out separately  But if we strip that out from dedicated  can you help us think about how you re thinking about the growth for final mile  maybe both in 2020 and then on a longer term basis  And then also speak to what sort of investment is required to support the growth there  And do you see that being organic or are there other inorganic opportunities Brad Hicks Great question  And I think that we re gearing up  and it s part of the reason why we re separating it out as its own business unit  And so you re going to get and see a lot more information and details  As John alluded to  we do intend to show you what 2019 looks like in that separation and a look back  And so I think you ll have a much better perspective when we get to the end of the first quarter here in 2020  In terms of investment  Shelley spoke about the tech investments  There are similar technology investments in final mile  not nearly to the magnitude that we see in the 360 platform  but we do have incremental investment  But again  I think you re going to see in the guidance we ve given before is    the final mile  is going    and our target operating range is at 2  to 4   And we believe we ll see that when we split it out  and we re very confident that we re going to be able to operate in and around that range for the foreseeable future  Similar to the second part of your question on revenue growth  it s a lot like what Shelley said  We do believe that we will outpace the market in growth in our final mile segment  We re not prepared yet to disclose what those percent targets look like  But our full intentions are  as part of separating it out  are it will be a  1 billion business for us  You won t see that today  I think last reported numbers we heard were in the  500 million to  550 million for 2019 were the targets  But we re moving quickly toward that  John mentioned  we just had our third acquisition that was announced a few weeks back  and that s going to help us with some of that revenue growth  But we re also seeing organic revenue growth through our sales channels that we re excited about Todd Fowler    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Great  That s very helpful  And then just a follow up  David  I m not sure if you spoke to kind of a capex expectation for 2020  If you have a number you d like to share  And maybe you could break it down maybe a little bit and kind of give us some help on what you re thinking for the intermodal container fleet and where the rest of the spend would be  Thanks David Mee    Chief Financial Officer Yes  The    I think the number in our models range from  675 million to  700 million on a net basis  As far as container growth  dry van containers inside of intermodal are going to be virtually flat  We  obviously  have replacements we re going to place orders for  There may be some back end growth  We do have optionality in our contracts to allow for that  But we ll have to have some more conviction that we re going to actually need additional equipment  As I think you realize  our turns are not where they ve historically been  and we re going to focus on that  We will add refrigerated containers  The plan right now is around 1 500 throughout the year  They ll be sprinkled in throughout the year  We don t expect them to come in at any one quarter  but that s kind of our goal at this point in time is just to add refrigerated containers  Brad talked about adding 800 to 1 000 trucks in dedicated  so growth capex would be there  We have some technology that will be capitalized somewhere between  80 million and  100 million  I think  ends up being capitalized within the year  Again  that will be based on project completion  so we ll have to wait and see what that number actually turns out to be  And then the rest of it is just maintenance and replacement capex  So growth is somewhere around    out of that  675 million to  700 million  somewhere around  200 million   250 million  and the balance would be maintenance Todd Fowler    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst OK  Great  Thanks for the time this morning OperatorAll right  Our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    Analyst Hey  guys  good morning  Dave or Shelley  could you help us kind of ring fence kind of what the operating loss could be in DCS for 2020  I know the sequential rate has ticked up a little bit  Obviously  there s volatility on the gross margin side  But is there like a tens of millions of dollar range you can put around what the operating loss should be for 2020 Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Are you asking for guidance David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    Analyst No  I m asking for a directional range on what the loss should be around ICS for 2020 Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Zero to  400 million  I don t know  David  that s what Shelley was talking about  It s a little early to try to quantify that  A lot of it is going to be dependent upon the market and we re seeing some mixed signals in the market as it is right now  We have a pretty good idea of what we re going to spend on tech and what we re going to spend on people  But how all that shakes out at this point  it s too early to give any kind of range David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    Analyst All right  Well  maybe as you think about the volume growth in ICS coming in at 3   I understand the LTL is falling off and TL is growing in there  If we kind of    when should we expect us to lap that sort of LTL decline and see a pickup in the volume growth  Obviously  putting a bunch of capital to the business  you d expect to see some more volume running through it  Like when    is that a 2020 thing  Or is that a 2021 thing Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services So we watch both revenue and volume  Our LTL volume will have a much lower revenue per load or revenue per shipment in total  I would say  throughout this year  you should see an accelerated change in what s happening with our total revenue  and that s going to be the number that we ll watch most closely  I would think you ll start to see that in Q1  Shipments  I m not totally sure how much faster we re going to grow TL and what s going to happen inside LTL  so I can t really say when we may or may not lap that David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    Analyst Is there a time when the LTL headwind is sort of lapped  Or is that just    you re not going to give us any sort of additional insight into that Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services Yes  No more insight David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    Analyst All right  Thanks OperatorAll right  We ll move on to our next question  from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thanks  Good morning  So I just wanted to ask one on last mile  You ve  obviously  done a number of acquisitions  some more sizable than others  But just trying to gauge how aggressive you might be on this front  if  let s say  maybe a potentially very large opportunity came on the market and if you could answer that strategically  And from a capital allocation standpoint  how willing you might be able to take up leverage for M A  Thank you Brad Hicks You never say never  and so I would say that  from a strategic standpoint  I think that we ve been fairly open to growth in both modes  especially when it comes to final mile  both organic and through acquisitions  Obviously  there might be opportunities to make an acquisition at much larger size than what we ve done so far  And like I said  you never say never  But frankly  I hadn t thought about it up until two days ago  to be candid  As far as a strategic  whether we would be willing to lever up to make an acquisition  we ve always had that approach  Yes  we d be willing to use our balance sheet if we think that the return profile is sufficient to add it to the portfolio  But it would have to meet that criteria before we d be willing to extend our balance sheet in it  And that s  frankly  a rule regardless of the size  I think that we ve been fairly disciplined in our acquisitions and our performance of those  And it is all being based on return metrics  and I wouldn t think size would have anything or wouldn t change that directive Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    Analyst Excellent  Thank you  That was helpful OperatorAll right  Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    Analyst Yeah  Hi  It s Tom Wadewitz  So I wanted to ask you  I think this is for Shelley  I think we ve seen in the spot market data  the truck stop data or whatever spot data you want to look at  you ve commented on it as well  that there was some tightening in the spot market in  let s say  December  I think you said like the last six weeks  Do you think that that s more a function of seasonality  Or do you think this is really the beginning of the kind of anticipated big capacity reduction that I think people are hoping takes place and tightens up the trucking market  How do you think    what do you think is happening  I guess you get into seasonally weaker freight here  And so it s    just trying to figure out whether things are off due to the rates of capacity coming out or if it s seasonal kind of noise that has tightened things recently Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services Well  so I think I talked about this a little bit earlier  but it is the first time that we ve had such a short period between Thanksgiving and Christmas in a very long time  And so we haven t gone through the seasonality of that in so long that we target or draw any specific parallel to that  So I think that could have had some impact in total  But as I said earlier  we are watching very closely what s happening  I will say the available carriers went down considerably in both December and in the first couple of weeks here in January  That was a surprise even from normal seasonality  So for us  it s too early to call on what that means in the market  Certainly  it feels  from a supply side  like a tighter environment than really what people are talking about  We ll see if something starts to shake loose here in the next couple of weeks and then return more to norm  Maybe the shortened window between Thanksgiving and Christmas had an impact that we just can t forecast Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    Analyst So does that    the recent tightening  does that give you some optimism that maybe rates don t need to be down so much in terms of the 2020 bid season  whether it s truckload or intermodal contract rates  Or I think earlier on the call  someone mentioned pressure  so is it still realistic to think contract rates are down Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services We re working through each bid with each customer  It s something    we re trying to match what s happening in the market with every single customer as they re coming to bid  It s like I said earlier  we re watching very closely  trying to keep our customers abreast as to what s happening in the market  And we ll continue to do that throughout this season Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    Analyst OK  And last  a fine point on something you said  You re building scale or you re looking to kind of invest in scale in ICS  What is scale to you  Is it    you had  1 5 billion in ICS revenue in 2019  that s a decent amount of scale   3 billion   5 billion  how do you think about reaching scale in ICS Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services Yes  So the post market is actually around  86 billion or so  something like that  And so really  to have a platform where any shipment is available for any carrier  that would be our perfect platform that we ve got to get to a place where our abandon rate and abandoned cart from a carrier perspective is now filled  And so I think scale at  1 5 billion is good  but it s not good enough for our platform   1 5 billion is good for a traditional brokerage business  It is not good for our platform to actually execute freight in an automated way to create a more efficient transportation Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    Analyst OK  Thanks for the time OperatorAll right  Moving on  Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck from JP Morgan Brian Ossenbeck    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hey  good morning  Thanks for the time  Just another question  Shelley  on the 360 platform  Maybe if you can give us some sense as to how the recent iteration of Shipper 360 went  What sort of adoption and feedback you re getting  And then also on the carrier side  it looks like you re kind of bumping up against that 700 000 carriers on the platform  How many of those are returning  if you do 80  of this  20  of them  So if you can give us some sense as to the adoption and retention rate  both on the carrier and the shipper side in the platform Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services So I think we did release the percentage of carriers that are actually active in the platform  We were very pleased  That s what we came out with first inside the platform because of the fragmentation of the carrier market  and we are very pleased with the activity level  We continue to onboard new carriers  both into our entire company but also in the 360 as well  So I would say we feel really great about where we re at there  It really comes back to the shipment side  So for us  it is about gaining more scale on shipments  From a customer perspective  our Shipper 360 launch that we did there in November  We have been talking to customers about what that looks like  We are setting up our sales offices as we speak  accelerating growth inside those offices to really talk with those  We expect that to progress as we come through this year that we continue to escalate the amount of shipments coming through Shipper 360  I would say really early in that space Brian Ossenbeck    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  Thanks  Thanks for that  Shelley  Darren  a quick follow up for you  Just going back to the whole cyclical versus secular movement within truck to rail conversion  How far    how far off do you think we are from a tipping point of getting that secular conversion back  And do you think there has to be some sort of catalyst or shock to the system  Obviously  you felt some of those    some of the opposite direction consolidation  but do you need something else to happen here to maybe put an existential threat in the mix  And I guess what I m referring to is  with the autonomous trucking sort of launch or traction  do you think that would actually help drive some more collaboration here between intermodal Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Well  certainly  I think  as truck capacity goes and prices in that market change  intermodal will either benefit or feel pressure from that  If truck capacity tightens  we ve got an opportunity  Now for more sustainability of intermodal  what I would    what I ve told the railroads is I m appreciative and supportive and a believer that the efforts that are putting in place to improve their service this year are material  they re impactful  and they re going to help us  But we as an industry have to sustain that for a much longer period of time than a few months in November  December and January  We have to sustain it for multiple cycles  We have to be very good at educating our customers on what s the best method to benefit from intermodal  I think we re the best at doing that  I think we do offer the best service product already  But at the same time  we ve got to continue to drive confidence in our shippers that intermodal won t put them at a risk of delivering their goods to their customer if the transportation move is actually a transaction between two businesses  That s really the big bucket of business left to convert  It s smaller shippers  And to them  they view intermodal as being a little bit risky  and we have to continue to work hard to educate and give them assurance and make sure that their experience is excellent with intermodal  and I think we re positioned to do that  I m not sure I m answering your question  I don t know how to tell you the railroads need to cut their price by 5   and that s going to give us a pickup  I don t think it s that clear  I think we ll have to continue to drive high quality service and capacity and design and communication with the customers  and that will help drive intermodal growth  Meanwhile  the railroads have to work with us  and together  a combination of our costs has to represent a value to the shipper  period Shelley Simpson    Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services And Darren  I might add to that  One of our long term targets inside our platform is to be able to identify the shipments that are moving over the road that can convert into intermodal  We still do a lot of our business in intermodal with a small group of customers  And so we re just now entering the midsized market in small market with Shipper 360  We already see good results in our platform of shipments that historically have moved truckload and marketplace that we are talking to those customers now about what that would mean and what that would look like for them as they re getting introduced to intermodal for the first time  So the more scale we gain inside J B  Hunt 360  the better it is for intermodal and for the rest of our asset business Brian Ossenbeck    J P  Morgan    Analyst All right  I appreciate that  Shelley and Darren  I guess  the question is really if you have a mixed dilutive venture for railroads that are all focused on operating ratio  it might be a little harder to get them to the table  But I can appreciate the challenges and the opportunities you re trying to drive internally  So thank you for that OperatorAll right  Moving on  We ll take our next question  Your line has been unmuted  Please go ahead Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Thanks  It s Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank  David  I was just wondering if you could help us with respect to the headwinds to intermodal buffets from the 360 investments in 2019 because I think it would just be helpful in understanding the real underlying profitability of the business  And also  like whether that 360 related costs that are allocated to intermodal increase or decrease in 2020 David Mee    Chief Financial Officer I ll let Darren hit on that  That s in his business Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal Well  we certainly don t    we re modernizing our technology platform  so that s our operating system  It s the way that we book orders  the way we did batch trucks  the way we communicate paid railroads  that sort of thing  All of those systems need to be modernized into today s technology and get an impact  Do I have a specific number for you  Amit  I guess we don t  We don t break that out  so I m not going to be able to do that  But certainly  it s different than it was a cost headwind  and that s probably all I can say about it Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Is it higher in 2020 than it is in 2019 in terms of incremental costs Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal I don t    I honestly don t know the answer to that Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    Analyst OK  I just had a couple of very quick follow ups  One is could you talk about yield  The length of all dynamics were more favorable in the quarter  I guess if you look at sequentially or year over year  We would    I would have just expected yield to be a little bit better than it was in the quarter  If you could just talk about that  And then  I guess  more relevant is  as growth returns to the Eastern network because  hopefully  tightening truckload capacity  is there a potential for yield to be down this year because of that maybe mix effect  Or maybe I m not thinking about it  if you could talk through that Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal So we ve    through my years of meeting with the various folks  a lot of people would like to ask us  what s the difference in our margin in the West and the East  and we simply don t highlight that  We make our    another marketing for   Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    Analyst I m asking about yield  though  I m not asking about margin  sorry  I m asking about yields Darren Field    Executive Vice President of Intermodal OK  Well  on    I mean it s all going to    the Eastern Network business  if we were to grow that faster than the transcon business  is that going to lower our length of haul  Potentially  I guess  it could  In the past  we have had times where if it was going to grow in the East much faster than the West  it s going to influence your revenue per load  certainly it would  That s a potential outcome of growing faster in the East Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    Analyst OK  OK  One quick  very quick follow up  I know I m over my allocation  but one very quick one  You talked about 700 to 900 trucks being added in dedicated  and that s    you have this nice wave effect in 2019 because you added a lot more trucks in  18 and you have that    you benefited from that in the OR  I know you talked about 11  to 13  as a long term target  but given that the additions this year are pretty consistent with  19  would the wave effect kind of be null and void and it ll    kind of margins    the way we should think about margins  are flat year over year at best given that dynamic David Mee    Chief Financial Officer First  I would say that the wave effect that you have seen and we ve realized was overstated off of historical standards because of the 2018 tractor add year that we had that was abnormally high  That 800 to 1 000 trucks  we ll still have a wave  But historically  our business does not come on evenly throughout the year  It doesn t come on one twelve each month  it comes on in chunks at points in time  and we don t know yet when exactly it will all onboard  There s also a gap in timing from when we sell the business to when it actually starts  And so again  we feel very favorable on our ability to hit our goals  But it s just a matter of you can t predict a win Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Right  OK  That s helpful  Thank you very much  everybody  Appreciate it  Have a good weekend OperatorAll right  We got time for one final question David Mee    Chief Financial Officer Will  if there are no other question  we ll be ending the

116608,338123,JBHT,J B  Hunt Earnings Surge in Q4 2019    But It s Still No Bargain,news,"When J B  Hunt  NASDAQ JBHT  reported its financial results last week  it was kind of like that old  tale of two cities   On the one hand  there were the trucking company s quarterly results for the fourth quarter  which seemed fantastic  And then there were the results for the year  which     didn t 
Let s address them one at a time  beginning with  

J B  Hunt s Q4 results
Q4 numbers at J B  Hunt  at first glance  looked bright and shiny   2 45 billion in Q4 sales grew only 6   granted  But the profits earned on those revenues grew 67  year over year  to  1 35 per share 
Those numbers actually sound better than they were  however  because Hunt s year ago profits were weighed down by  charges for contingent liabilities related to the arbitration with BNSF Railway Company   making Q4 2019 profits look better by way of comparison  Back out the one time charges  though  and Hunt explains that its operating income would have  decreased 20  from fourth quarter 2018  
J B  Hunt s full year results
That s the value of looking at numbers context  To further see how things are going at J B  Hunt  let s draw back and look at the year as a whole 
For all of fiscal 2019  Hunt collected  9 17 billion in revenue  That was up 6  year over year  so very similar to Q4 s results  Profits wise  though  the results couldn t look more different  Instead of operating profit surging by two thirds  it crept up only 7   to  4 75 per share  or almost as slowly as revenues grew 
What it means to investors
Now the question  Is that growth rate fast enough to justify the stock price 
With only moderate levels of debt  about  1 3 billion on a  12 1 billion market capitalization  on its balance sheet  I think it s fair to evaluate J B  Hunt stock by valuing it on either price to earnings or  more conservatively  price to free cash flow  not adjusting for net debt  By the former measure  the stock sells for 23 8 times its  516 million in trailing GAAP earnings 
Free cash flow at Hunt isn t great  however  Although up more than double over 2018 s  202 million in cash profits  Hunt generated only about  410 million in cash profit in 2019  So when valued on free cash flow  Hunt stock sells for a 30x multiple    about 20  more expensive than its P E ratio makes it appear 
Whichever valuation you choose to guide you  it seems to me that these prices are too high for a stock that s growing earnings at only 7  or so 
Granted  it s possible J B  Hunt will grow its earnings faster in future years than it did in 2019  Although sales were relatively flat  up less than 1   in both the company s intermodal and  integrated capacity solutions  businesses  sales surged 25  in Hunt s dedicated  contracted  trucking division  That s Hunt s most profitable division  albeit still not hugely profitable at an operating margin of only 11 1    With continued growth there  I suppose it s possible Hunt could grow earnings at the 13  long term earnings growth rate that Wall Street analysts project for it  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  
Still  even when giving Hunt every benefit of the doubt    valuing the stock on P E instead of its more expensive P FCF ratio  ignoring the debt load  and even assuming a 13  growth rate that s nearly twice what Hunt accomplished in 2019    I think J B  Hunt stock is simply too expensive to buy right now ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plvc9,2065925

116630,338145,JBHT,Wall Street slips as bank earnings  Trump trade comments weigh,news,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  stocks edged lower on Tuesday as quarterly results from banks added to concerns about lower interest rates dampening their profits  while comments from U S  President Donald Trump on trade also dragged down Wall Street s major indexes 
JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  and  Wells Fargo    Co  N WFC  beat quarterly profit estimates but reported weaker net interest income  pointing to rising deposit costs  Those results followed  Citigroup  Inc s  N C  results on Monday  in which the bank reported a drop in its net interest margin 
JPMorgan shares erased early losses to end 1 1  higher  Wells Fargo shares  however  slipped 3 0  as the bank tempered its outlook for cutting costs 
 The expectation is the yield curve is going to remain flat  so you re going to still continue to see net interest margins compress  and that s going to hurt profitability   said Michael O Rourke  chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich  Connecticut   There s not a lot of expected upside to Q3 and Q4  
Stocks also moved lower after Trump said there was a long way to go with China on trade and threatened to put tariffs on another  325 billion of Chinese goods 
The major indexes briefly pared losses after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would  act as appropriate  to keep the U S  economy humming  but they later moved back to their previous levels 
 In a really quiet market  a headline like this has a magnified effect  so even if it s not something investors don t already know  it can move the market with ease   said Michael Antonelli  market strategist at Robert W  Baird in Milwaukee of Trump s comments 
Shares of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS   which also announced results  rose 1 9   Goldman Sachs is considered the least rate sensitive of the three major banks that gave quarterly reports on Tuesday 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  fell 23 53 points  or 0 09   to 27 335 63  the S P 500  SPX  lost 10 26 points  or 0 34   to 3 004 04 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  dropped 35 39 points  or 0 43   to 8 222 80 
Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  shares slipped 1 6  after the diversified healthcare company warned that competition from generic and copycat drugs could impact its third quarter results  Johnson   Johnson was the second biggest drag on the S P 500 
Shares of J B  Hunt Transport Services Inc  O JBHT  jumped 5 6   the greatest percentage gain among S P 500 stocks  after the trucking company posted strong quarterly performance in its second largest unit DCS  which provides final mile delivery

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook

116662,338177,JBHT,Earnings Preview  JB Hunt  JBHT  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"JB Hunt  NASDAQ JBHT  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This trucking and logistics company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 56 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 47 billion  up 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 11  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for JB Hunt 
For JB Hunt  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that JB Hunt will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that JB Hunt would post earnings of  1 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 40  delivering a surprise of  2 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
JB Hunt doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-jb-hunt-jbht-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200498019,200498019

116697,338212,JBHT,JB Hunt  JBHT  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"JB Hunt  NASDAQ JBHT  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 15  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This trucking and logistics company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 34 billion  up 5 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 32  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for JB Hunt 
For JB Hunt  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that JB Hunt will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that JB Hunt would post earnings of  1 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 37  delivering a surprise of  1 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
JB Hunt appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jb-hunt-jbht-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200471521,200471521

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
JB Hunt shares have added about 17 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 3  
What s Next for JB Hunt 
While JB Hunt has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

116708,338223,JBHT,Rails  truckers have gotten cheap but trade wars a risk,news,By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK  Reuters    Many U S  stocks cheapened up during the first quarter s choppy trading scene  relieving some concern investors had about lofty valuations  But the companies that move goods through a humming economy now look among the market s best bargains  as long as the U S  China trade dispute doesn t derail their outlook  Railroad and trucking stocks took a hit starting in late January just like the rest of the market  From its record high on Jan  26  the S P 500  SPX  slumped more than 10 percent in less than two weeks to enter a correction  and the S P 1500 road and rail index  fell 9 1 percent  Demand to move U S  goods by rail  truck and ship  however  has held firm so far this year  So the shippers emerged from the tumult sporting some of their cheapest valuations in years thanks to an atypical phenomenon  as their share prices were falling  their earnings expectations were moving up sharply   meaning their price to earnings ratios fell by an even wider margin   The volatility we saw in the first quarter was actually a pretty healthy thing for the entire market  it kind of reset expectations  it kept excess valuations from bubbling up   said Eric Marshall  portfolio manager and Director of Research  Hodges Capital Management in Dallas  Texas  That valuation reset may mean more upside for these stocks than the market as a whole if earnings reports in the coming days validate those optimistic profit forecasts    Now that it has occurred  people have gone back in  re evaluated the fundamentals and you are starting to see those stocks work their way back up off of a base   Marshall said  J B Hunt Transportation  O JBHT  may provide investors with a template of what to expect   The trucker s shares fell more than 13 percent between late January and early April  But its forward P E ratio slumped by twice that margin  27 percent  contracting from 27 2 to 19 8  below its five year average of 21 5   By comparison the full S P 500 s P E ratio contracted by about 12 percent to 16 3  and still sits above its historic average of 15 1  The stock surged more than 6 percent in the wake of its earnings on Monday  its best day in five years  Nine of the analysts tracking the stock have raised their price targets since then  JB Hunt Forward PE now in line with 5 yr average   On the rail side  CSX Corp  O CSX  saw its forward PE drop from 22 02 in mid January to 16 05 on Feb  8  well below its five year average of 19 9  Its shares rose nearly 8 percent on Wednesday  its best day in six years  following its quarterly results to send the stock to a record closing high of  61 01  CSX Corp Forward PE and Price   A big concern  however  is an escalation of the current trade dispute between the U S  and China  which was a primary cause of the recent downturn in the group   If you are looking at it in a quite linear focus  you think it would affect the rails probably because they move a lot of exported goods and they are susceptible to what goes on in trade   said Lindsay Bettiol  analyst at Atlantic Equities in London   The United States imposed a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports on March 23 along with a 25 percent duty on steel imports  U S  President Donald Trump called for the tariffs to protect U S  metal makers from cheap imports  A strengthening economy  however  is likely to overpower those concerns and shipping companies are primed to benefit   In a recent note to clients   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  noted its TLFI index  which measures the incremental supply and demand for Dry Van Truckload services  has done better than its typical performance for this time of the year despite a decline over the past two weeks   The index is projected above levels last seen in 2014  but below the fourth quarter of 2017  When a given reading is above a prior year s level  it means there is more freight demand relative to available capacity  according to the firm   Trucking Stocks Forward PE   Earnings are expected at the end of April and early May from rail and trucking names such as  Union Pacific   N UNP    Norfolk Southern   N NSC  and Genesee   Wyoming  N GWR  as well as trucking companies Knight Swift Transportation  N KNX  and  Heartland Express   O HTLD   Each are currently at or below their two year average forward PE  Rail Stocks Forward PE   While these stocks are poised to benefit from continued economic growth  they could also be susceptible to another bout of trade war concerns  even if they are relatively insulated to the global economy   A Reuters poll of over 500 economists worldwide showed the global economy will race further ahead this year  expanding at its fastest pace since 2010  but trade protectionism has the potential to derail that momentum    These stocks will see bigger up days and bigger low days but over the long term the fundamentals will lay out   said Jim Corridore  equity analyst at CFRA in New York    Of course if the entire economy blows up because of trade wars  that is a risk that has to be thought about  but I just don t see it happening at this time

116718,338233,JBHT,JB Hunt  JBHT  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when JB Hunt  NASDAQ JBHT  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 15  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This trucking and logistics company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 30 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 7  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for JB Hunt 
For JB Hunt  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 65  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that JB Hunt will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that JB Hunt would post earnings of  1 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  12 80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Oil
Crude prices remain vulnerable as global demand concerns returned on Trump s tariff threat and after the API reported that US crude stockpiles dropped only by 1 4 million barrels  It seems the rally stemming from increased tensions in the Persian Gulf is taking a backseat for the time being after Iran signaled the door is open for negotiations if Trump lifts sanctions he put in place in 2017  Energy markets could come further under pressure if today s EIA report delivers a smaller than expected drawdown with crude stockpiles 

Gold
The bullion rally is taking a break on the strong dollar and Fed rate cut uncertainty  A recent wrath of better than expected US labor  inflation and retail sales is putting a dent in demand for safe havens  Gold is still in a bullish trend and could see its upward momentum return on disappointing earnings results and lack of progress on the trade front  If US equities resume the march for fresh record highs  gold should still find strong support around the  1 380 an ounce level 

Bitcoin
Governments and central banks have their eyes on cryptocurrencies and the toughened regulatory environment will put a cap on the recent rally  Yesterday  Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed on something  They are extremely skeptical on Facebook s Libra  The problem is mainly that Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is too big and if they did create their own digital currency that was backed on fiat currencies and government bonds  it would create massive pools that could leave the global economy vulnerable in times of crisis 
Bitcoin will likely survive this recent onslaught of negative news as US brokerages remained committed to offering crypto trading services and as mainstream commerce makes strides to accepting digital coins

116869,338384,JBHT,Bet On These 5 Top Stocks Displaying Attractive Sales Growth,opinion,Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies that put emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales are generally converted into growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings while assessing the growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability to generate more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base Stable or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without solid top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires robust sales growth However  sales growth in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits Therefore  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Roanoke  VA  Advance Auto Parts  Inc    NYSE AAP   provides automotive replacement parts  accessories

116872,338387,JBHT,5 Dividend Raising Transports To Combat Market Uncertainties,opinion,"The U S  equity market has been on a roller coaster of late  In fact  Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1 033 points or 4 2   on Feb 8  Other major bourses   the S P 500 and the Nasdaq   also finished in the red on the same day 
In fact  this was the second time in a week that the Dow shed over 1 000 points in a day after the 1 175 points decline on Feb 5  Following the latest U S  sell off  both the Dow as well as the S P 500 are officially into the correction territory  down more than 10  from the recent all time high reached in January 
The steep sell off was due to the stronger than expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years  These factors  in turn  triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected 
Furthermore  heightened volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX    Wall Street s so called fear gauge   which currently is more than 30  near the highest level since August 2015  indicates bearish market prospects  Notably  any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market 
Given this backdrop  investing in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same seem to prudent  This is because such companies are financially stable and mature  and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions 
Transportation Stocks Riding High
A sector that boasts well paying stocks in terms of dividends  is the one having transportation stocks  Transports have been having a good time lately after being laid low for most of 2017  due to various headwinds like back to back hurricanes  increased costs to name a few 
Also  the string of outperformances  in terms of earnings as well as revenues  by the key sector participants like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group and Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC   in fourth quarter 2017 bears testimony to the improved scenario surrounding the highly diversified   one of the 16 Zacks sectors  
Factors Behind the Resurgence
Railroads are one of the most important sub groups in the transportation sector  After facing multiple challenges over the past few years due to coal related winds  stocks in the space seem to have bounced back on improvements in the coal scenario 
Particularly with Donald Trump s presidency  the coal industry is witnessing better days  In fact  Trump is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations  which were hurting its prospects  Apart from coal  the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads   intermodal   has improved by leaps and bounds lately 
Airlines   another important sub group in the broader sector   are also seeing good times now  courtesy of the improved demand for air travel  For 2018  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry  This is much higher than the profitability forecast of  34 5 billion for the current year 
Moreover  package delivery companies like FedEx   NYSE FDX   and United Parcel Service   NYSE UPS   performed well on the back of e commerce growth in the most recent holiday season  This further highlights the optimism surrounding transports 
Trump s Tax Overhaul   A Boon
On Dec 22  2017  Trump signed the much anticipated tax bill into law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   Under the  1 5 trillion tax overhaul package  corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21  from 35   The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow  which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks 
Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate  the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence  which was not allowed earlier  This aspect hugely favors transportation stocks as they invest substantially toward capital expenditures  As a result  their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions 
For example  Delta  which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4  and 6  on a year over year basis lifted its earnings per share guidance anticipating the new tax law to boost its results  The company now expects earnings per share in the range of  6 35 to  6 70  previous outlook   5 35 to  5 70  
Shareholder Friendly Activities Likely to Pick Up Pace
As noted above  many stocks in the transportation space reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks  For example  United Continental Holdings   a key transportation player   announced a new buyback program late last year  Moreover  the likes of Delta and Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  hiked their quarterly dividend payouts in 2017 
Following the new tax law  we expect an increase in these shareholder friendly activities from various transportation companies  Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills  more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others 
Dividend Paying Transports   A Prudent Choice
In view of the above mentioned tailwinds  we believe that stocks from the transportation space should be in one s portfolio  Moreover  picking dividend stocks seems prudent during uncertain times like the current scenario 
Consequently  we have zeroed in on five stocks in this high flying space  which have a strong dividend paying history  Also  these companies have raised their dividend payouts recently  All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
Our first choice is  UPS  the world s largest express carrier  Markedly  UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally  UPS  board of directors cleared an approximately 10  hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share   3 64 annually  on Feb 8  The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 7  2018 to the stockholders of record on Feb 20 
The raised dividend highlights UPS  commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects  going forward 
Also  it has an impressive record with respect to dividends  The company has been rewarding shareholders with cash dividends regularly since 1969 and has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since it went public in 1999 
Furthermore  the company s  of A highlights its short term attractiveness  Notably  the Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum 
Our next choice is Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP    which provides rail transportation services across 23 states in the United States through its principal operating company  Union Pacific Railroad Company 
On Feb 8  this railroad operator s board of directors a 10  hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share  annualized  2 92 per share   The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30  2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28 
In fact  this is the company s second dividend hike in three months   In November 2017  the company had announced a 10  hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66 5 cents per share  We believe that two dividend hikes in such a short span reflect the increased financial prosperity following the introduction of the new tax law 
Additionally  the company has an impressive dividend history having rewarded shareholders through dividends for 119 consecutive years 
The next member in our list is also a railroad operator   Norfolk Southern   Last month  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share  annualized  2 88 per share  from 61 cents per share  annualized  2 44 per share   The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 10  2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 2 
Moreover  it has an impressive record with respect to dividends  The company has paid dividends for 142 consecutive quarters  since inception in 1982 
GATX Corporation   NYSE GATX   is our next choice  This leading global railcar lessor specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing  aircraft operating leasing  information technology leasing  and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide 
On Jan 26  2018  the company s board of directors cleared a 5  hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share   1 76 annually   The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 31  2018 to shareholders of record on Mar 5 
Also  it has an impressive record with respect to dividends  It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919  Furthermore  the company s Momentum Score of B highlights its short term attractiveness

116899,338414,JBHT,CSX And CP Q3 Earnings  Here Are The Key Predictions,opinion,The Q3 earnings season is in the nascent stage with 32 S P 500 participants having reported results so far  As is the norm  the early earnings reports included those of major banks like JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   and Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   Again  this current week is going to an extremely busy one with 178 companies  including 53 S P 500 participants  revealing their Q3 numbers In fact  the  sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has seen third quarter reports from a handful of players  Evidently  airline behemoth Delta Air Lines    NYSE DAL   earnings per share and revenues surpassed expectations  despite recent natural calamities  On the flip side  J B  Hunt Transport Services    NASDAQ JBHT   posted mixed results   wherein the company reported lower than expected earnings per share but better than expected revenues Though too early to reach a definite conclusion about the performance of this sector  it is widely expected that the recent natural calamities  Harvey  Irma  Maria and the earthquake in Mexico  will dent results of the sector participants in Q3   The latest too predicts that this widely diversified sector will cut a sorry figure in the quarter under review  with its bottom line contracting 15 5  owing to high costs Markedly  one of the key components of the transportation sector are railroads  Though things are looking up for the same following improvement in the coal related scenario and U S  Presidential election last year  the natural disasters are likely to hurt earnings  These  in turn  have hurt operations at railroads by damaging important rail lines  Also  freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters  With fuel costs on the rise  the bottom line of the same are likely to be hurt in Q3 due to the escalating costs induced by the hurricanes Given this gloomy backdrop  investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await earnings reports of key railroads companies like CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited   NYSE CP   on Oct 17 According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase its odds of an earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  CSX Corporation is not expected to report better than expected earnings per share in this quarter despite the improvement in coal revenues The bullish sentiment pertaining to the commodity is reflected by the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter coal revenues is  530 million  much higher than the  501 million expected in the second quarter of 2017   In fact  this Jacksonville  FL based company s intermodal segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter intermodal revenues stands at  451 million  again higher than the  446 million expected in the second quarter of 2017  Despite the bullish top line scenario  the bottom line is expected to be hurt by increased costs induced by the hurricanes  Also  the recent service issues encountered by the company may hurt results In fact  our proven model too does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat earnings estimates in Q3  despite its Zacks Rank  3  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of  0 88   You can see  Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too  When we issued its Q3   the company had an earnings ESP of  1 33  and carried a Zacks Rank  3 CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Meanwhile  improvement in the coal related scenario is a positive for Canadian Pacific Railway as well  Freight revenues from the grain and potash units should also be impressive in Q3  However  high costs are likely to hurt the bottom line of the Calgary  Canada based company  Consequently  our proven model too does not show that Canadian Pacific is likely to outperform with respect to the bottom line in Q3  despite its Zacks Rank  3  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of   0 66   This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 31 per share is currently pegged at 2 cents above the Most Accurate estimate In fact  our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too  When we

116900,338415,JBHT,Key Predictions For Q3 Earnings Reports Of AAL  UPS   LUV,opinion,The Q3 earnings season is in full flow with earnings reports available from more than 135 S P 500 companies  In fact the current week is an extremely busy one with 722 companies  including 180 S P 500 players  slated to unveil their numbers during its course Per the latest   stocks in the highly sought after fraternity are projected to end Q3 with their top and bottom lines expanding 5  and 2 6   respectively  In fact  seven of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year over year basis Rough Ride for Transports in Q3 The   does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14 9  due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes  In fact  the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   have contracted 7 6  and 28 6   respectively  in Q3 on a year over year basis Notably  the unfavorable projection for this widely diversified sector highlights the fact it has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters  Harvey  Irma  Maria and the earthquake in Mexico   For example  airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues In fact  the negative impact of the hurricanes is also well reflected in the key transportation earnings reports available thus far  Evidently  United Continental Holdings had to cancel 8 300 flights in the quarter and consequently its third quarter pretax income reduced to the tune of approximately  185 million Additionally  these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines  leading to rapid increase in freight costs  Also  the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads  For trucking companies  shortage of drivers remains a major headwind  Meanwhile  the rise in labor costs has hurt J B  Hunt Transport Services    NASDAQ JBHT   and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of Q3 Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 26Given this backdrop  investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    United Parcel Service   NYSE UPS   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   that are scheduled for Oct 26 According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise American Airlines Group  headquartered in Fort Worth  TX  operates more than 6 700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe  Of late  this carrier also underwent a turbulent phase like the other airlines  mainly due to the hurricanes Consequently  the company called off approximately 8 000 flights in the third quarter  Also  increased costs  fuel and labor  are expected to hit the bottom line  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter fuel price per gallon  including taxes  is pegged at  1 59  much higher than the  1 48 reported a year ago Despite the disruptions  the scenario with respect to total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  is an improved one from the year ago quarter  courtesy better than expected yields  For the third quarter  American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  to grow between 0 5  and 1 5    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter TRASM is pegged at 14 98 cents  higher than 14 73 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter yields is pegged at 15 56 cents  higher than 15 27 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016 However  the chances of this legacy carrier beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q3 are less  even though it has an Earnings ESP of  0 53   This is because American Airlines  Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  acts as

116957,338472,JBHT,A Few Key Consideration For Traders,opinion,"A new week and new challenges for traders and investors and it will be interesting to see if the ASX 200 can make it five positive weeks in a row  The term  hedge because you can and not because you have to  will ring true for more conservative investors  although we will need to see a rampant appreciation of the USD to really see strong risk aversion in markets and the fact the VIX fell 7 5  on Friday hardly screams of panic 
There is plenty of news for market participants to digest  Asia based traders will have their chance to react to the below par payrolls data  so one should watch the USD intently  The hawks will point to the 2 5  earnings growth and overall reduction of slack in the labour market  but it was comments from New York President Bill Dudley  continuing to call for two hikes this year  that were the key catalyst behind the positive reversal in the USD on Friday  Recall Bill Dudley  along with Janet Yellen  Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard are still hugely influential  however the market is still highly sceptical around future hikes  with the next interest rate hike not fully priced until June 2017  Last week the USD rallied 1 5  despite the implied probability of a hike by the December meeting falling ten percentage points to 70   This suggest the move higher was purely based on positioning and testament to a speculative community who up until Tuesday were running a net short position on the USD 
Traders also have been seen China report a 10 9  drop in imports in April  released on Sunday  the weekend and while we haven t seen much of a move this morning in AUD the falls in import volume should keep the downside momentum alive  The bears will take this as a sign that the improvement in domestic demand is wanning  A  6 4 billion rise in China s FX reserves is positive  although it was purely down to changes in the valuation of its currency holdings and in actuality we saw a modest outflow  although not enough to trouble market sentiment 
We are calling for a modestly weaker open on the ASX 200 and see no reason for this to be hugely influenced by the weekend data given S P futures have opened on a flat note  Good strength is likely in BHP Billiton Ltd  AX BHP   based on the American Depositary Receipt  and we may see a slight rotation out of banks  JB Hunt Transport Services Inc  NASDAQ JBHT  and Avis Budget Group Inc  NASDAQ CAR  are the stocks du jour and whether you are a trend or momentum or fundamental trader the daily charts look very bullish   stay long till proven wrong  The change of the Saudi oil minister is also a key consideration  and we have seen a 2  jump in brent futures  so watch for inflows into energy names on open ",2016-05-09,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-few-key-consideration-for-traders-200128679,200128679

116999,338514,JBHT,Transports Through Year s End,opinion,"The transportation sector had a great 2014    at least until last month  With crude oil s fall  the railroad stocks  a big part of the sector  took a hard right to the face  The ironic part is that many in the sector transport crude oil  but that s a story for another day 
Trucking stocks have had mixed results  Some are falling while others have spent the time consolidating  But doesn t cheap crude oil lead to cheap gas and diesel  What s important is not how they should react but how they re starting to react 
Here are two companies  JB Hunt Transport Services  NASDAQ JBHT  and Knight Transportation  NYSE KNX   which look poised for a drive higher into year s end 

J B  Hunt has been consolidating between 79 60 and 82 60  At least until Tuesday when it broke the range higher with a Measured Move to 91  And momentum indicators support it  The RSI held at the mid line and is rising again  And the MACD is crossing up  also a buy signal 

Knight Transportation went through a bit of a pullback  which reset the RSI lower  while it held over the mid line  The MACD is now leveling as the RSI is rising  The price also bounced and is now crossing the 20 day SMA as it moves higher 
Keep an eye on Heartland Express  NASDAQ HTLD   Swift Transportation  NYSE SWFT  and Werner Enterprises  NASDAQ WERN  as well  All of their charts are looking similar ",2014-12-16,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/transports-through-year's-end-236007,236007
117000,338515,JBHT,August  Equity Opening Calls,opinion,"A new week and a new month and there will be many in the market happy to see the back of July  although developed market equities generally did well 
The key thematic we have been detailing of late has been an increasing focus on the start of a long awaited normalisation process from the Federal Reserve  The end result being a stronger USD  weakness in commodities and deflationary expectations  as seen by the 35 basis point fall in US five year breakevens since 18 June   We have also seen a strong widening of spreads between corporate credit yields and US treasuries  a sign of default risk   while MSCI world MSCI emerging ratio has pushed to the highest level since 2005 
This trade is still very much in play and won t go away just because it s a new month  If anything  we have seen more fuel added to the fire with China producing some further discouraging manufacturing data prints  The official print  released Saturday  came in a 50  but the sub components such as new orders and new export orders were hardly encouraging  Today s Caixin compiled manufacturing report deteriorated in its revision and at 47 8 was the lowest level since July 2013  Chinese equities were struggling in early trade  but have seen some buying on the concept of additional support  As detailed before  the eyes of the market are 100  focused on how the Shanghai Composite acts around the 200 day moving average  which now stands at 3 560 
FX markets opened on a flat note  with limited reaction seen to the China data  USD CAD has printed a higher high and is now at the highest levels since 2004  WTI looks horrible and I see no reason  looking at the daily chart  why I would want to be long right now  but I see every reason why I would want to stay long USD CAD  GBP CAD and even EUR CAD  The trend here is absolutely your friend 
US futures have opened a touch weaker and perhaps this is a reflection of the slight weakness in commodities  Asian equities are generally offered despite a better than forecast result from heavyweight HSBC that has helped lift our after hours FTSE 100 call  In Australia  the ASX 200 notably failed again at the 5 700 level  Aussie earning season ramps up this week with  NYSE SUN    NYSE RIO    NYSE DOW    NYSE ANN    NYSE BEN  and  NASDAQ JBHT  in focus  I like the idea of listening to companies that make over 10  of revenue from China  specifically after hearing discouraging rhetoric from the likes of Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   VW  United Technology and  PARIS CARR   PARIS CARR   In Australia  this specifically means listening to FMG  97  of earnings come from China   ILU  40    RIO  38    BHP  35    SEK  27   and MIN  21   
There has been some discussion today around Fed policy and whether Friday s Employee Cost Index  ECI   at the weakest level since 1982  should derail a September hike  Marrying up a chart of the ECI and core PCE  personal consumption expenditure   the Fed s preferred inflation read   there is a fairly limited correlation between the two over the last five years  Still  fed funds futures have lowered their probability for a September move by eight percentage points to 40  and we saw solid buying in the front end of the US curve  That makes this such an interesting week for global markets  especially with Friday s payrolls report likely to meet the  some  requirement with regards to further improvement in the labour market  for the Fed with another 200 000  print  Hourly earnings are expected to grow 2 3  year on year and that would surely naturalise Friday s ECI 
It s not just US data though  In Australia  we get the monthly Reserve Bank meeting  should be a fairly dull affair   trade  employment and retail data  On Friday the RBA releases its Statement on Monetary policy  I continue to like selling rallies in AUD USD into  0 7450 to  0 7500  but the risk is whether it moves into this zone and this may be too ambitious  However  there is an elevated risk of short covering  especially in light of speculators increasing their short exposure 24  last week to the most since March 
Elsewhere  the Bank of England inflation report  US ISM manufacturing  core PCE  Vehicle sales and ADP private payrolls will also play into price action  Watch US 2 year bond yields this week for a move above 75 basis points could be the trigger for renewed USD buying 
There is also some focus on the re opening of the Athens stock exchange  ASE   Some have made the connection between the sharp falls in Greek equity index ETF s traded on the NYSE and how the market may open  Given the GREE  Global X Greece 20  is 17  lower from where the underlying exchange closed on 26 June  I am personally sceptical the ASE will fall that far  but we do know that stocks will be halted it undergoes a price variance of 7  over a 10 minutes window ",2015-08-03,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/equity-opening-calls-260291,260291
