94336,315851,PG,Stocks   Wall Street Tumbles on Virus Fears  Mixed Earnings,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    Stocks tumbled on Wall Street amid a mixed bag of corporate earnings and growing concern at the spread of the coronavirus  after China quarantined the city at the heart of the outbreak and authorities confirmed more cases in new countries 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  fell 110 points  or 0 4   by 10 45 AM ET  1545 GMT  to 29 075 54 points  The S P 500  SPX  ofell 0 3  and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  dropped 0 1  
The authorities closed down public transport into and out of Wuhan and six other cities in the region around it  in an effort to stem the spread of the disease that has already been detected in most of China s biggest cities 
But a loss of momentum in corporate earnings also played a part in the sell off on Wall Street 
Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  fell 0 5    although it pared earlier losses   after its upgraded guidance failed to meet the expectations of investors who have seen big improvements in profitability over the last two years 
Elsewhere  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  fell 2 4  after reporting that it continued to hemorrhage cable TV customers and embarked on what could be an investment heavy task of rivalling CNN in global news 
Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  overcame an early stumble after its results to trade up 1 8  while American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  was flat  as strong guidance for 2020 offset weaker than expected figures for the three months through December 
  Union Pacific    NYSE UNP  rose 3 1  after its chief executive struck an upbeat note after a rocky fourth quarter  saying that the U S  China trade deal should help stop the slump in freight volumes 
Elsewhere  oil stock continued to suffer as U S  crude futures tumbled another 3   crashing through  55 a barrel for the first time in two months  Refiners Valero  NYSE VLO  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  both lost 1 5   while shale driller Continental Resources fell 2 3

94337,315852,PG,Gold Rises on Risk Off Move Triggered by Coronavirus Fears,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    The gold buyers  strike finally ended on Thursday as rising concerns about the coronavirus  which had weighed on risk assets all week  finally lent support to havens 
By 11 30 AM ET  1630 GMT   gold futures were up 0 6  at  1 565 75 a troy ounce  a mirror image of the decline in global stocks after China quarantined Wuhan and six cities nearby in an effort to contain the spread of the virus  Spot gold was up  0 5  at  1566 38 
The measures came on the eve of the week long Lunar New Year holiday in China  the peak travel season in the country  The traditional seasonal spike in consumer spending now appears more than a little vulnerable to public health measures clamping down on official celebrations  which may make the next couple of months of Chinese data more than usually difficult to interpret 
Copper futures  a rough proxy for risk assets  fell 1 8  to a seven week low as fears grew for demand from the world s biggest consumer 
Gold prices were supported  as normal  by falling bond yields  as both classes of haven benefited from inflows  U S  10 Year Treasury bond yields by five basis points to their lowest since early December 
The news from China combined with some weak looking earnings reports to stop this week s rise in stocks and prompt more caution  Global consumer giant Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  warned that the dollar s strength had continued to weigh on its reported earnings in the quarter  and the dollar index  which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies  rose to its highest this year in response to the Chinese news 
Earlier  European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was coy about the possible impact of her review of the bank s monetary policy strategy on interest rates and was careful not to talk up signs of a recent stabilization in eurozone confidence 
However  a statement on the review s parameters  released by the bank later  conspicuously included a reference to the  possible side effects  of current monetary policy tools  which some took as a concession to the German led minority on the council that is opposed to any further easing 
The Indonesian central bank left its key interest rate unchanged for the third month in a row  after cutting it four months in a row earlier in 2019

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning  and welcome to Procter   Gamble s Quarter End Conference Call  P G would like to remind you that today s discussion will include a number of forward looking statements  If you ll refer to P G s most recent 10 K  10 Q and 8 K reports  you would see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from these projections Also  as required by Regulation G  Procter   Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion  the Company will make a number of references to non GAAP and other financial measures  Procter   Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website   a full reconciliation of non GAAP financial measures Now  I will turn the call over to P G s Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer  Jon Moeller Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  This was another relatively straightforward quarter  And as David Taylor will be with us to provide additional depth at CAGNY in just a few weeks  I m going to keep prepared remarks this morning brief  turning fairly quickly to your questions This was another very solid quarter  Top line  bottom line and cash  driven by our portfolio  superiority  productivity  constructive disruption  and organization strategies  Organic sales up 5   3 points of volume growth  2 points of price mix  two year stacked average growth of 4 5   Fiscal year to date  organic sales growth of 6   Calendar year 2019 organic growth of 6  This growth continues to be broad based  Nine of ten global categories grew organic sales  Skin and Personal Care up double digits  Personal Health Care and Home Care grew high singles  Fabric Care  Feminine Care  Hair Care  Oral Care and Grooming grew mid single digits  Family Care grew low singles  Focus markets and enterprise markets each grew mid singles  We continue to perform very well in our two largest markets  the U S  up 4  and China up 13  for the quarter Aggregate market share continuing to grow  These results required us to overcome several challenges  While we re seeing real signs of progress with grooming organic sales up 4  this quarter  we re still working to sustainably improve results in this business and in baby care Sales results in Japan our third largest market created nearly a 0 5 point drag on total Company organic sales growth due to timing of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1st The timing  as we highlighted last quarter  led to higher shipments last quarter and lower shipments in the quarter we just completed  We faced market level challenges in an increasing number of markets  India  the U K   Australia  Turkey  Iraq  Nigeria  Kenya  Lebanon  Argentina  Chile  Mexico and the Hong Kong market  Through all of this we grew organic sales 5  in the quarter and 6  over the first half Moving to the bottom line  core earnings per share were up 14  versus the prior year  Foreign exchange was a one point earnings growth headwind  so on a constant currency basis  core earnings per share increased 15   Fiscal year to date core earnings per share are up 18   up 19  on a constant currency basis Gross margin up 200 basis points in the second quarter  Core operating margin up a 190 basis points  Continued strong cash generation with operating cash flow of  4 4 billion and free cash flow productivity of a 100    1 9 billion of dividends paid   3 5 billion of P G stock repurchased   5 4 billion of cash returned to shareowners Yet another strong quarter  solid volume  sales  and market share trends across both categories and geographies  Strong operating earnings  margins advancing  strong core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returns to shareowners We continue to face the challenges of a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and of competitive response to our growth  But all in  we re continuing to make progress behind the set of integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies  The strategic choices we ve made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice  We established and extended the superiority of our brands To make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation  to lead constructive disruption across the value chain  and to improve organization focus agility and accountability  reinforce and build on each other  They position us well within our industry to deal with near term macro and competitive challenges  They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short  mid and long term Moving to guidance  we re again  increasing our fiscal year outlook for organic sales growth  for core earnings per share growth  and for free cash flow productivity as well as cash return  We started the year with organic sales growth guidance of 3  to 4   We increased the range to 3  to 5  last quarter and are now increasing the range to 4  to 5  This 4  to 5  range compares with underlying market growth of 3  to 4   implying continued market share growth  On the bottom line  our core earnings per share growth guidance started the year at a range of 4  to 9   We raised the range to 5  to 10  last quarter and we re now increasing the range again to 8  to 11  for the year We re increasing our outlook  our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90  going into the year to 95  last quarter and now to 100   We ll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return  expecting to pay over  7 5 billion in dividends and now increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of  6 billion to  8 billion to a range of  7 billion to  8 billion in fiscal 2020 While we delivered strong first half results  please keep in mind that comps get more difficult as we move through the year  both top line and bottom line  Pricing annualizes as we move through the back half of the year affecting both top and bottom line trends  We ll comp the earnings gains from the Boston land sale and Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4 Competitors are responding to our outperformance  which will require continued innovation and equity building investments on our part  And the market level challenges I mentioned earlier will be top and bottom line headlines    headwinds for the balance of the year Our guidance is based on current market growth rates  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates  Significant currency weakness  commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not included within the new and improved guidance ranges We look forward to seeing many of you at the CAGNY conference in just a few weeks  As I mentioned  David Taylor will join us and will provide further perspective on forward looking strategies and plans  We look forward to engaging with you and to benefiting from your thoughts and reactions With that  I m happy to take questions Questions and Answers Operator Operating Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley Dara Mohsenian    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  Jon  I wanted to focus on organic sales growth  Obviously the 5  result  still very healthy this quarter  But it is below 7  in each of the prior two quarters  It sounds like some of that s Japan timing based on the prepared remarks  I m assuming perhaps some U S  inventory reductions as the retailers approach fiscal year end So just want to get your read on an underlying basis looking at retail sales growth ex shipment timing  ex inventory changes  Has anything changed in terms of the underlying momentum as you look at fiscal Q2 results versus the last couple of quarters And then within that answer  perhaps you can just touch briefly on the competitive environment  Have you seen incremental promotion with the recent commodity pull back  and also  give us an update on China performance in the quarter and any impact so far from the virus that we re seeing over there  Thanks Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerI could complete the whole call Dara  Speech Overlap   On the first part of your question  we re very pleased with the top line growth in the quarter that we just completed  As you all know  we delivered 7   but as you mentioned Dara  in the prior quarter  our guidance was 3  to 5  for the full fiscal year  implying something below that beyond the first quarter and we delivered at the high end of that range As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth was broad based both across categories and regions and we built market share  From an underlying consumption standpoint  you ve seen the offtake numbers at least through December  which continue to be very strong and we really haven t seen anything that would cause us to change that outlook in the first part of the current quarter So all the fundamentals are there  Our superiority levels continue to increase  We re investing behind that  while building margins  we re building market share at increasingly the growth is broader as you look at both categories and geographies We did have some headwinds in the quarter from two items  You mentioned    really three  you mentioned one which is Japan and that had a 0 5 point impact which benefited the prior quarter  The other dynamic has been a series  and I mentioned this also in my prepared remarks  of geopolitical  economics  societal and other impacts in individual markets  I mean  think about what s happened in the last or since we last gathered even  the situation in the Hong Kong market has continued to be difficult  which had a real impact on the quarter and had an impact on the travel retail businessSome of the market level events in South America  whether that s Argentina or Chile where stores were burnt and are not yet back in place  Some of the events that you re very familiar with in our headline items in the Middle East impacted our business as well  And those items will impact us going forward for the balance of the year  I m very    we re very pleased that we were able to overcome all of that and still deliver very strong numbers that build share and build household penetration and allow us to deliver significant bottom line benefits From a competitive environment standpoint  which was the second part of your question  Promotion levels  percentage of sales in our category sold on promotion are actually down the index at 98 for the last quarter  That s all I have visibility to  I don t have visibility into the future and where individual competitors are up versus year ago  they re up typically a point So very simply  and we can get into this later with others if you want more detail  we re not seeing competitive activity that s indicative of downward price spirals  Phonetic  by any means  That can change tomorrow  but what we have in front of us today continues to look very healthy China  we are very optimistic about our prospects in China  It s a difficult market  It moves at a very fast pace both from a consumer and trade channel standpoint  but we continue to increase the rate of growth in that market  You ll recall four years ago we were at minus 1  the following year we were at plus 7    excuse me minus 5  plus 1  plus 7  last year at plus 10 and fiscal year to date at plus 13 So that continues to be a very attractive market within that some really strong growth rates in some categories  I m talking the high 20  in categories like Skincare  Feminine Care over 20   Fabric Care double digits  So generally a very strong market  I have no idea what the developments are going to be relative to the new virus  We re obviously monitoring that closely as it relates both to the health of our employees and broader community and we ll have to see what impact that has if any on the business going forward But it s one of those things and I do think it s important to mention because it can have broad impacts well beyond China  It can also affect consumer confidence and in large parts of the market  it can affect travel which does affect our business  And so  it s one of the many pieces of volatility that s just important and we keep in front of us as we think about the prospects for the future  which I view is generally extremely positive  but not without risk and without challenge OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS Steve Strycula    UBS    AnalystHi  good morning  So  Jon  I ll stick to one topic here and just to clarify one of your early responses  With the slowdown you re seeing in travel retail  is that specific to Hong Kong or is a little bit broader based in China  That would be quick clarification And the broader question would be  can you talk to just what we re seeing across the global beauty spectrum in your portfolio right now  How is China performing with SK II versus Olay  And then  what is the opportunity to extend SK II to broader markets looking forward  Thank you Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerAnother three parter  I ll try to get to each of the pieces efficiently  Travel retail concentrated in Hong Kong  Beauty broadly continues to do extremely well  This is our 17th consecutive quarter of growth with Q2 up 8   That growth is broad based  Hair Care grew 6  in the quarter  Our skin and Personal business grew 10   It was actually a relatively slow quarter for SK II given both the VAT dynamic in Japan were SK II has a big business and the Hong Kong dynamics Skincare broadly in China  as I mentioned  is doing extraordinarily well  Olay was up strong  strong double digits and    but the balance of the business as well  our Safeguard business  which is part of our beauty segment grew double digits  again strong double digits over 20   So the growth in beauty both on a global basis and within the China market is broad based I think you asked another question  but I don t  Oh  SK II expansion  yeah  There are    first of all  there are significant opportunities in the markets that we re in  as evidenced by the current growth rates  There are also at the right time and in the right way  expansion opportunities available Sir  are there other questions  we re not   OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan Andrea Teixeira    JPMorgan Chase   Co     AnalystHi  good morning everyone  Thank you  I just wanted to double click on what you just said on the China  on the China    how it evolved for the quarter  And if you re baking any more level of conservatism into the back end of the year  given what happened recently  So I think what you also discussed is hair care coming back  So is that a mitigating effect from what could be expected in a continuation of the deceleration for SK II  Thank you Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerLet me first talk about Hair Care  I m assuming the question is in a China context  We grew hair care in the mid to high single digits in China  which is the fastest growth rate in a period of time  And so  yes  that can offer some offsets  if you will  to other businesses that may soften due to competitive activity or other things On the other hand  the hair care business is a highly  highly competitive business as are many of our categories  so the dynamics can change there quite rapidly  Our job is to continue to steadily increase our margin of superiority  And if we do that  over time  if not quarter to quarter  we ll continue to have a strong business In terms of the conservatism on the    in the back half of the year and I ll answer this question both relative to China  which obviously we don t provide specific guidance for in the balance of the Company  One thing to keep in mind with China is the timing of Chinese New Year  which as you know from all the press on China recently has happening    is beginning as we speak And that is earlier in the calendar year than it typically occurs  And so it s likely there were some sell in in the O D period that wouldn t have been there in the prior year period  But on a global P G basis that doesn t move the needle significantly  but something just to be aware of as it relates to the China specific situation I talked in my prepared remarks about some of the headwinds that exist that increased during the quarter and will impact us in the back half of the year or could impact us in the back half of the year  We talked about the market level dynamics  So if you take a market that may not be that large but take a market like Chile that impact happened at the very end of the quarter and will exist through the balance of the year  The same with  for example  the situation in Lebanon  the same for the situation in Iraq The India market  the growth rates have slowed  still growing and we re doing very well and building share  But the challenges there have increased and will likely remain for the balance of the year  So that s one reason  one thing that needs to be netted against the strong progress that we hope to continue to make The other is the annualization of price increases  So for example  in February  we annualized both the Dish Care price increase from year ago and a Family Care price increase from year ago  And I don t want to talk about how we re going to handle pricing going forward  That s kind of off limits  But irregardless  those annualization impacts as well as some of the price increases we ve taken for the valuation over the last year will annualize And third is the competitive environment  and I don t know what that s going to hold  I ve described what has held so far  but most of our calendars    most of our competitors are calendar year based  They start their new fiscal years as we speak and many of them have talked  understandably  about increasing investments for growth That can be a very healthy thing  It can grow categories  We can all benefit from that  but certain implementations of that obviously are less healthy  Now  against all of that backdrop  we continue to make progress on the things that we control or making very strong progress  Our margin of superiority is increasing across the board  It s dynamic  it s not static So we have moved forward and moves back but the net move is a forward move  We re in a position because of our productivity programs to invest to support communication of that superiority  and that s really driving some outsized growth in many of our categories And over time and it will take some time  I expect we ll deliver higher growth rates on businesses like Baby Care  So overall  we re very optimistic about where we stand today and what the future holds  at least in the near term  But it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the challenges that exists OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Lauren Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good morning  I m going to ask one question  And I just wanted to talk a little bit about Grooming and particularly shaving  You d mentioned there were still some devaluation driven pricing and I just was curious if you could talk about performance of that business just specific to developed markets  how things are trending  The impacts of Gillette Sensitive  you ve made some portfolio moves  right  There has been several  Phonetic  that are already been acquired  you just acquired Billie  So if you can maybe give us a little bit of the lay of the land on how you re chipping away and making progress or not so much in Shave Care would be great Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Laura  And within that one question  you ve managed to ask three  which is very well done  The  on    our grooming business strengthened in the quarter overall  We were up 4  and that s the third consecutive quarter of growth  Importantly  we grew global market share 0 3 points  which is very encouraging  Shaving within that was up versus year ago  Not as much as    I mean  not as much as the dry shave business  but the wet shave business did grow and we ve seen pretty strong response to our investments both in product and communication  Encouragingly we ve added 18 million new users to our brands over the last 12 months Skin Guard is contributing to category growth  Is doing well and continues to expand  In the U S   for example  razor value share on Skin Guard is now 9  which is a third largest for P G sub brand and we re building  unlike most of our competitors  our shave business online We re pretty excited about the Billie acquisition  That s something that obviously needs to pass regulatory clearance and we need to remain separate from that business until that happens  But there is a real unique set of skills  experiences and knowledge between Billie and P G that we think has the potential to create some real magic Clearly they ve created very effectively a fresh new brand that extends across several categories and they ve done it and we can benefit from their experience on this in a digital fashion with one to one mass marketing  which is something we re continuing to increase our focus and keep focus on and capabilities related to We have innovation capability across the majority of their categories  We have best in class manufacturing across the majority of their categories  and we have a go to market presence both online and bricks and mortar certainly in omnichannel that can accelerate the growth in that business  So we re very excited about the potential and are working through the clearance process OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Ali Dibadj    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystHey guys  thanks  I wanted to ask in more detail your view about the future on pricing  kind of the future solidness from the recent price increases globally  given there is starting to be    to your point Jon  competitive murmurs with more investments coming  like most recently  Essity in Europe yesterday seemingly talking about pricing and commodity is clearly continuing to fall So I get you re not seeing anything yet  but within that context  two questions  And one is  what kind of lead time notice you get in terms of price competition  So can you feel comfortable saying it s all clear for a quarter  it all clear for two quarters or is it just literally  this may change tomorrow And then the second thing is  part of our job is pattern recognition and so historically we have seen net prices  we think we trade them  Phonetic  and promote everything down in categories especially Baby and Family with these types of commodity declines  do you think this time is different  and if so  kind of why  So there is a technical question on timing and there is more of a  how do you see the go forward in the patterns we ve seen historically  Thank you Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ali  Obviously just related to Essity first  they re talking about a market that we re not competing in  I know that    you know that and it s a very different market  It s much more of a commodity market than our primary market from a Tissue Towel standpoint  which is what I believe they were talking about which is North America In general we see commodity prices as supportive of the current prices in the market  So while they re down some versus kind of historical levels and where we were before the price increases went into effect  we feel the current prices are justified  That does not speak to an indication of future activity  I won t go there  And our outlook for those commodities continues to be relatively flat to slight increases  particularly in the Pulp space So I don t see the kind of sea change environment that would necessitate activity  Having said that  each competitor will do what they choose to do and we need to be responsive to that  which gets to your second question  And candidly  we do not have advanced notice of the implementation of price increases and so we    or decreases  sorry  either one And so we react as we see those in the marketplace and that reaction time typically is anywhere from a quarter to six months  So if we think along reasonable periods of time  I don t expect us to be a crippling dynamic or anything resembling that going forward  It may cause a quarter or two of    or a benefit or hurt  but not a big thing to worry about OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Wendy Nicholson    Citigroup    AnalystHi  unlike some of your peers who have had less margin expansion  your margin trends have been terrific and a lot of that things have been driven by the productivity initiatives  I know you re kind of coming and you re in your four maybe of your five year program  And I m just wondering  what s your outlook  not for the next quarter  but sort of for the next two to three years  Is there another  10 billion restructuring program coming or how do you keep this productivity benefits accruing when you come into the end of the program  Thanks Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Wendy  I mentioned as one of our strategic choices the desire to make productivity as integral to our nature as innovation and be leaders in productivity  just as we are innovation  And I think we ve made a lot of progress on that journey  as you rightly point out  which is reflected in our margins certainly this quarter My hope is that as we move forward  this is simply an integral part of our operating strategy and it needs to be  because we will need to continue to invest in both holding and advancing our margin of superiority  Some of the continuous disruption we re talking about will also require some investment whether that s in human resources  capital etc And I feel very good about each of the business units understanding and commitment to continue delivering productivity  So that brings us to another part of the question  which is are there degrees of freedom that enable that to occur  Will is one thing  delivery is another  And I don t think we ve ever been in a place where there are more degrees of freedom or more opportunities to improve productivity  the tools that we have available to us now across the digital spectrum and that s everywhere from marketing to the manufacturing floor to the office environment  have never offered more opportunity than they do today And we have significant opportunity still in terms of how we think about our new organization structure and are there opportunities within that as we learn more about it to become even more efficient and effective  and I certainly believe they are    there are  I just attended  along with David  a review of our Product Supply Innovation Program last week  And there are big opportunities relative to robotics  relative to a tighter sequencing of the entire supply chain from order signal  all the way back to delivery  We re in the middle of this still  the product supply transformation across markets and geographies  So I continue to believe that productivity will be an inherent part of our operating strategy and we have the tools and opportunities to continue to deliver that OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Olivia Tong    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  thanks  good morning  Wanted to talk a little bit about advertising because that continues to move up to    up a 150 basis points this quarter  And at this point  I think there is a fair bit of investment already in the base  So was that already    always the plan  to continue to increase or is this more opportunistic than you expected  Was it  is there anything that you need to defend because obviously you said that we haven t seen that much of a change in percent of sales goes on promos  So just wondering where that advertising dollar is going toward  Thank you Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerA couple of things there  Olivia  We ve been very clear I think that while we need to be competitive from a trade spending standpoint a need to offer attractive margins to our retail partners where we have a degree of flexibility  we would prefer to spend that incremental dollar on advertising or innovation every day of the week  The reason is very simple  There s nothing proprietary in pricing  We can build proprietary advantage with both advertising and innovation So  again  on the margin where we have the opportunity to make those shifts  we re doing it and we re doing it in a way that is attractive to our retail partners as well because it drives business and grows categories The second piece we ve talked a lot about  and Marc Pritchard  our Chief Marketing Officer has talked a lot about externally is the opportunity to move what were historically a significant amount of non working dollars into working in advertising and that s been about a  1 billion shift and it continues And the third piece of this is  when you have innovation that s noticeably superior  you need to and want to and should be communicating that superiority and those performance benefits and the value that comes with them to consumers  And the good news is  we have a lot of very strong innovation in the marketplace that has a lot of legs left in terms of either    you know it s just launch or something like PODS or beads which have been on the market for a number of years but have significant household penetration opportunities and are peer delighters from a consumption standpoint  we want to be supporting those  I mentioned both as relates to competitive activity  but also in general that we will continue to invest in both equity and innovation as we move forward OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  good morning  Jon  and congratulations on a strong quarter  Can we come back to China  which was particularly strong in the quarter against a notably difficult comparison  Can you delineate a bit the Company s progress in that market between category strength and superior Procter market share performance and maybe how that s changed You talked about Skincare  obviously very strong  up 20  and Fem Care I think was up double digits  Maybe just talk a little bit about how much of this is category versus strategic execution by Procter in certain categories  and then your expectations here for the balance of the year  Thanks Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Kevin  It s honestly hard to separate those because if we do our job right from an execution standpoint and an innovation standpoint  we grow markets  So we don t view market growth as something that is separate from our efforts  It s in many cases  obviously not a 100  but it s caused by our efforts  I realize that s not that helpful to use  but it s an important point As we back up from that and I look at category growth in China  it continues to be strong in our categories  The one area that s under a little bit of pressure from a category growth standpoint is Baby Care and that relates to the birth rates which have gone from about 15 million babies a year down to 10 million which is significant impact On the other hand  within that category there are a significant premiumization opportunities and the premium part of our business is growing 20  or 30  depending on whether that s premium tape diapers or pant style diapers  But in general  in China  the answer on category growth is  remains very strong The answer on  if you will  P Gs specific efforts if we pretend for a second that they re not impacting category growth that also is abundant and real  I mean we ve gone  it s not the inflection in category growth rate that has changed the results on Skincare  it s our share of progress within the category  albeit in a very growth full category  So we ve gone from declines    perennial declines on that business to perennial gains and strong double digit gains Our    the improvement in our Hair Care top line  still not what we d like it to be but definitely improved from where we ve been  This is a result of much stronger branding and innovation efforts as well as go to market strengthening  So it s hard for me to tease those apart  The simple answer is it s both and that s a good thing OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  good morning folks and happy belated New Year  Two questions from me  First on U S  growth  you mentioned 4   obviously solid in context of the U S   but it is a decel from last quarter and it comes despite an easier comp  Is there anything worth calling out  any nuance to take note of there on that growth And then secondly on the Baby  Fem  and Family Care segment  growth was a little weaker than we expected this quarter  it s kind of the weakest we ve seen in a while  and I know this has been one business that s been a little harder for you to kind of get going like everything else  Can you walk us through what the game plan is and what our expectation should be for that business as we think about the next 12 months  Thank you Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerTo start where you started  U S  growth of 4  is indeed very strong and it s building market share  We ve build market share in the U S  over the past three  six and 12 months periods  Nine of our 10 categories grew in the U S  in the last quarter  The one that didn t was either at 98 5 or 99 5 index  The difference between the quarters reflects a number of things  Part of it is trade inventory  which was reduced as we went through the second quarter There is initiative timing that impacts this pretty significantly as well  I would expect going forward  we re going to continue to see some chop if we look at it on a quarter to quarter basis  But across a slightly longer period of time  we remain very  very happy with the way the business is progressing  And if we look at underlying consumption  going back to a discussion earlier in this call  that continues to be  as you ve seen  and at least the scanner data  very  very strong From a Baby Care standpoint  if we look at the first half of the year Baby Care was flat to up slightly which is a better position than we ve been in  and it ranges from  if you look at our two largest markets  China and the U S   those are relatively    again on a relative basis healthy  China in the first half  they grew at 5   That s the fastest growth we ve had from    on a semester basis in about six years  We regained market share leadership about two years ago and have continued to hold that And as I mentioned in the last answer  we re growing our premium business and our pant business  very  very strongly  The U S  were about flat versus year ago  which again is an improvement on a relative basis and what should take both of those businesses as well as the broader Baby Care business to a stronger position is innovation  which builds superiority  We have across parts of the portfolio  not been offering a superior product  It s largely been  in some of those cases a parity product We have strong innovation plans in place  not only in terms of incrementality  but we re really increased the pace of innovation and the amount that s coming to market  A lot of which has driven the China result that I talked about  But innovation  whether it s on Baby Care or Beauty Care  is not an overnight endeavor and we ll continue to hopefully improve sequentially as we go forward OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Mark Astrachan    Analyst    Stifel NicolausThanks and good morning everybody  I guess maybe just a quick question for you  Jon  The enterprise versus rest of business seems to have slowed a little bit  you guys don t really talk about EM versus DM kind of anymore  but maybe talk a bit about what has driven this slowdown  You touched on Chile  Hong Kong etc  How much is that in terms of country specific issues versus lapping the pricing and kind of how should we be thinking about that dynamic on a go forward basis Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerWe re pretty pleased with the growth rates in the enterprise markets currently  You mentioned mid single digits  It s really at the border of mid single digits and high single digits  I ll leave you to interpret that and that s despite these pretty significant impacts  If you think about two of the largest markets in the enterprise environment are India and Mexico  And I talked about the slowing growth rates in India largely as a result of some of the monetary policies  which has created a bit of a liquidity squeeze  which is drying up inventory through the system  But we continue to grow well in India and are building share Mexico is technically  from an economic growth standpoint  in a recession  we continue to grow reasonably well there  mid single digits and are growing share there as well  So  broadly  we continue to be pretty pleased with our progress And just briefly  even though it wasn t part of your question  on the bottom line  we re creating more value in these markets currently than we ever have  So our bottom line progress was strong double digits  well ahead of the Company average  We need to be focused on value creation in these markets  That includes growth where we can generate a meaningful return and that s what we re focused on doing and there s tons of opportunity OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI Robert Ottenstein    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  thank you  Jon  I d like to kind of focus on e Commerce  I think in the past you ve said that it s about 8  of sales  has that moved up maybe closer to 10   And globally  how fast is it growing on a global basis  Then specifically  how fast in China  how fast in the U S  and are you gaining share in e Commerce in China and in the U S   Thank you Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerIt continues to be a significant opportunity for growth  It s currently growing at about 30  and in the big e Commerce markets while that growth differs across categories  it s pretty much at that level across markets It is now about 10  of our total business  And when I    just for clarity  when I mention e Commerce I m talking  obviously  the totality of e Commerce  which includes omnichannel  And our market share in general has been increasing  Of course  there is some volatility to that  But particularly  in the China context  and again it differs by category  we ve been making significant progress in that space So I see us as very well positioned to exceed    to succeed in that space  though that s something that requires internal efforts  flexibility  and the constructive disruption of ourselves which we re committed to  to ensure that we offer a competitive and relevant offering wherever consumers want to shop  whether that s e Commerce  whether that s large format  whether that s small format  And generally  we re progressing well in each of those OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Nik Modi    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystYes  good morning  Thanks everyone  Jon  maybe you can talk a little bit about the Merck OTC business  I mean healthcare was a pretty nice contributor to the top line  So just wanted to understand what s driving that business kind of what s the strategy there  Any context would be helpful  Thanks Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerAs you probably recall  Merck offers a very complementary portfolio to our legacy personal healthcare P G business  Has a strong presence in the developing world  complementary categories across geographies and there were significant  we felt  cost synergies in addition to revenue synergies by bringing the best of both companies together and driving growth  It s early days  we re still in the middle of integrating  We just closed 18 months ago  but we re very pleased with the results so far This is the first quarter in which Merck has reported as part of our organic sales growth rates  They contributed positively to that  It s a real asset to our overall Personal Health Care business and it s playing out that way  The revenue synergies are on track  The cost synergies are on track  It was some real exciting examples of the possibility of driving both of those ahead of what our initial plans have been  The organization is a strong organization and they re doing a great job so far really  really good OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Bill Chappell    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThanks  good morning  Hey Jon  just circling back to the Billie acquisition  just a little surprised that I guess P G thinks that can pass with the FTC and just with your market share  And also with kind of FTC cracking down on a lot of even recent small acquisitions that struck me  Phonetic   So kind of any thoughts there on why you are moving forward with that especially in the U S  positioning  And then if that s part of a plan then you know do you think there is more opportunities to do tuck ins to where you have 40 50 share of a market Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerIn general  just starting from the strategic level  we want to ensure that we are serving consumers in all relevant segments of the categories that we ve chosen to play in  Sometimes  that s easier and more straightforward from an organic standpoint  So if you think about the natural segment  for example  something like Pampers Pure On the other hand  getting a quick presence in some of these high growth segments or with different groups of consumers is sometimes easier to do via acquisition  So if I just    a good example is This Is L  on Feminine Care  which is now the number one natural products from a market share standpoint  Obviously very early  but so far has proven to be a very strong idea to expand in a very relevant consumer segment very quickly That s the motivation here  I m obviously not going to speak to regulatory dynamics or anything related to that  but we re excited about this and we re hopeful we have the opportunity to really work to grow this combined set of categories  grow the market and create value OperatorAnd your next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse Kaumil Gajrawala    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning  Jon  can you talk a little bit about how you and the Board think about valuation in the context of share buybacks  Your results are obviously the best they ve been probably in a decade so is the  perhaps appropriately  so is the value of your shares  So if you just talk a little bit about valuation in buyback context Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Obviously over the last decade  buybacks have created extraordinary value  but that s been on the back  which is implicit in your question on over time a significant increase in the stock price  If I look at it today  first of all  we don t try to forecast where the market is going to go  We don t pretend that we know that  And so  in general  we feel very strong about our prospects as a Company  There s no reason at present not to feel reasonably good about the market itself And so well kind of  if you will  dollar cost averaging over time  The other thing that s important though is to think about the context of our dividend yield relative to financing rates that are available because at some level what s you re dealing with is  can I retire a dividend rate with an incremental financing costs that s lower than that rate  And with negative interest rates in many parts of the world  this is a very attractive time to be  if you will  financing share repurchase We re going to stay within our credit limits  As we do that  that s another constraint  if you will or another rail and we ll continually look at this  Obviously  capital allocation is a broad topic  inclusive of share repurchase is something that is reviewed regularly with the Board and we value their input to that  But the current plan obviously reflects that  And as we sit here today  I don t have a reason to suggest a change in that plan OperatorAnd your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Jonathan Feeney    Consumer Edge Research    AnalystHey  Jon  Thank you  Are you concerned at all that your business has become much more macro sensitive in the past five to 10 years  Some segments of outsized growth would seem to indicate that but any historical context or consumer data you have that could affirm or dispel that  I d appreciate Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerI think Jon  we re actually less sensitive to the macro environment  and that s been a very deliberate choice we ve made and let me explain that  We were in  as we went into the last recession  as an example  a lot of or a number of relatively to highly discretionary product categories  Things like Salon hair color  high end premium fragrance  just two examples And our intentional and strategic part of our portfolio focus was to be instead  in daily use categories that are used in good times and bad times  because they re just important to get through the day  sometimes multiple uses important to get through the day  So if you look at the total portfolio through that lens we re more macro resilient  I would argue  today than we were some years ago The second reason I say that is the efforts that we ve made and we ll continue to make and the investment we ve put behind it on product superiority  product package the whole set of drivers  that inherently increases consumer value  So the value of each purchase is higher than it would have been even inclusive of small price increases And that too puts us in a better position relative to things like trade down that can happen as a result of macro dynamics and more difficult economic times  not immune  but in a better position today  The third thing I would argue is  to the extent that we ve been successful in creating a culture where productivity is as integral to our being as innovation  we have more financial flexibility and therefore more degrees of freedom for how we manage the difficulties that the macroeconomic situation can present So for those three reasons  Jon  I think we re in a much better place today  We will be impacted if there are negative developments in any part of the world  It does create challenge  It s the right question to continue to ask  And I m not talking in absolutes but on a relative basis we re much more macro resilient than I think we were historically Great  well thanks everybody  Again  just a quick summary  we really view this quarter as another step in our journey forward  Strong topline progress  building market share  strong operating earnings growth  building margins  strong core earnings per share  generating cash  returning that cash to shareholders  All behind an integrated strategy that s working and we will continue to execute  We look forward to seeing many of you  As I said earlier  at CAGNY and I look forward to our conversations  Thanks Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  59 minutesCall participants Jon R  Moeller    Vice Chairman  Chief Operating Officer and Chief

94342,315857,PG,Beauty Product Wins Propel Another Procter   Gamble Earnings Beat,news,"Investors pushed Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  shares well ahead of the market last year  Its 35  stock price rally was unusual given that it runs a massive business whose consumer staples focus supports predictably steady results  Yet P G s operating momentum took a surprising turn higher in 2019  and investors responded by raising their expectations 
On Thursday  the company extended that streak of positive momentum into early 2020 by announcing broadly strong fiscal second quarter results and boosting its outlook for the year  Let s take a closer look 

Growth is strong
As expected  P G s growth rate decelerated from the scorching 7  increase it had managed over the prior six months  But its rebound is still firing on all cylinders  Sharp demand increases in its beauty  healthcare  and fabric care segments met with more modest boosts in each of its other two units to generate a 5  organic sales gain 
Looking beyond the headline figure  investors saw several factors confirming strong sales growth  P G achieved a good balance between organic volume and pricing increases  with volume contributing slightly more toward overall growth  Rival Kimberly Clark  in contrast  reported another quarter of reduced volume this week and had to rely on price increases to deliver all of its organic growth for the quarter  
P G s pace of gains indicates market share wins across most of its portfolio and in both established markets like the U S  and emerging ones such as China   We delivered another strong quarter of organic sales growth   CEO David Taylor said in a press release 
All the profits
P G s 8  spike in its high margin beauty product division was helpful to the bottom line  But several more factors contributed to its gleaming finances this quarter  The company also benefited from higher prices  reduced expenses  and increased manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies  Altogether  these improvements allowed operating its already industry leading profit margin to rise by 2 full percentage points toward 22  of sales  As a result  core earnings jumped 15  to significantly outpace the 5  sales boost 
P G converted all of its earnings into free cash  too  and that success allowed for aggressive cash returns to investors  with dividend payments reaching  1 9 billion as stock repurchase spending hit  3 5 billion 
Raising the bar
Taylor and his team took the opportunity to raise each of its financial targets for the full 2020 fiscal year  They now see organic sales rising by between 4  and 5  rather than the prior range of between 3  and 5   The consumer staples leader s earnings should now rise by nearly 11  at the midpoint of guidance  compared to the prior goal of 8  
Investors can look forward to seeing that growth support a brighter global sales picture this year  but the more immediate benefit will come from P G s cash returns  The company now expects to spend roughly  8 billion on stock buybacks in 2020  Meanwhile  the improving cash flow points to a potentially large dividend increase when executives set their annual payout in a few months ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmhdj,2067311
94345,315860,PG,Procter   Gamble Breaks Down Its 19  Earnings Surge,news,"There s a new normal for Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  shareholders  After watching their company struggle for years with a massive turnaround effort that failed to deliver improved results  the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers is finally on a different path  Last week  P G raised its sales outlook following another blockbuster quarter highlighted by market share gains and sparkling financial returns 
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts  CFO Jon Moeller broke down the latest results and explained why the management team expects the positive momentum to continue at least through the second half of fiscal 2020  Below are a few highlights from that presentation 

Global wins
Moeller said   We faced market level challenges in an increasing number of markets  India  the U K   Australia  Turkey  Iraq  Nigeria  Kenya  Lebanon  Argentina  Chile  Mexico and the Hong Kong market  Through all of this  we grew organic sales 5  in the quarter and 6  over the first half  of fiscal 2020   
Executives noted two major areas of demand weakness this quarter with the Gillette shaving business and the Pampers diapers franchise each underperforming  Yet the broader picture was one of strong growth that shines through in a few data points  P G noted positive organic sales in nine of its ten major product categories and market beating growth in its two core geographies  the U S  and China 
Volume is leading the way higher  too  as organic sales rose 6  through calendar 2019 compared to 4  for rival Kimberly Clark   Yet another strong quarter   Moeller explained    with  solid volume  sales  and market share trends across both  product  categories and geographies  
Still gaining efficiency
 Fiscal year to date core earnings per share are up 18   up 19  on a constant currency basis   Moeller said 
P G is almost six years into its cost cutting and restructuring initiative  but management is still finding room to add efficiency to the business  Rising prices and reduced manufacturing and supply chain spending helped push gross profit margin up by two full percentage points this quarter  and that success flowed right down to the bottom line 
As a result  the consumer giant s core adjusted earnings jumped 19   Kimberly Clark  in contrast  is expanding its profits at a 4  pace these days 
Raising its outlook again
Moeller said   We re again increasing our fiscal year outlook for organic sales growth  for core earnings per share growth  and for free cash flow productivity as well as cash return  
Shareholders went years without seeing an outlook upgrade from P G  but they ve now been treated to two such surprises back to back  The company entered fiscal 2020 projecting growth of 3 5  at the midpoint of guidance before boosting that forecast to 4  last quarter and raising it most recently to 4 5  
CEO David Taylor and his team also raised their earnings prediction and their cash flow target  That latter metric is especially important  because it supports increasing cash returns to investors  And sure enough  P G is now expecting to spend roughly  500 million more on stock repurchases this fiscal year 
The second half of fiscal 2020 will have bigger challenges  including a tough comparison with booming prior year demand  Competitors are also stepping up their market share advances  including with aggressive price cuts  These moves should contribute to slower growth over the next six months than the 6  rate that shareholders saw over the past six months  Still  the company s firm expansion pace and its rising margins will likely power double digit earnings growth in 2020 and a robust increase to P G s dividend by early spring ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnum6,2069204

94378,315893,PG,Chart Of The Day  Procter   Gamble Shares Losing Momentum Even Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  is due to release corporate results Thursday before the market open  for the fiscal quarter ending December 2019 
We expect EPS of  1 37  unchanged from the previous quarter  up from the  1 25 for the same quarter last year  while revenue is anticipated to  18 41 billion  up from the  17 45 billion of the previous quarter which is even higher than the  17 16 billion for the corresponding quarter last year 
P G earnings have beaten estimates for 15 straight quarters and revenue for five  Will the streak continue  And if it does  why has the balance of supply demand traded like it may not  Though we can t know for certain that the collective investor does not expect an upside surprise for these earnings  this could be a sign that the stock is running out of steam 

Shares have been trading within a converging pattern since Oct  1 with an upward bias  This is called a rising wedge  It demonstrates that while a stock has indeed been rising  the rate of the climb has been slowing 
This flags the possibility that investors may begin to lose patience at not seeing the same kind of returns they d become accustomed to before the pattern emerged  This is underscored by the 100 DMA as a moving uptrend line that provides a fair measure of the uptrend  as well as marking the bottom of the rising wedge as a significant technical pressure point 
The current share price is as about 25  above its uptrend line since the May 2018 bottom  Compare that to the Dow Jones Industrial Average  its index  It is only about 7  above its uptrend since the nearest bottom in December 2018  If we consider the uptrend line as the normal rate of ascent throughout a period  Procter   Gamble s spike is almost four times as sharp as that of the index on which it s listed  giving it a lot of room to fall in order to return to a sustainable rally 
Note the negative divergence between the RSI s falling channel and the rising wedge of the stock  another bearish indicator 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait for a downside breakout  with at least a 3  penetration to avoid a bear trap  then wait for a pullback to demonstrate resistance by the bottom of the wedge 
Moderate traders would wait for a downside breakout  with a minimum 2  filter  to avoid being knocked out of position by a whipsaw  then wait for the expected return move for a better entry  not necessarily for proof of a reversal 
Aggressive traders may short now  providing they understand the pattern is not complete before a downside breakout and are willing to accept the risk

94379,315894,PG,P G Earnings Preview  Sales Growth In Focus As Shares Hit New High,opinion,"  Reports Q2 2020 results on Thursday  Jan  23  before the market opens
  Revenue Expectation   18 42 billion
  EPS Expectation   1 37
The shares of global consumer staples giant Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  have had a great 2019  Investors sent the stock soaring to a record high after seeing five consecutive quarters of explosive growth and the company building in strong expectations for the current year 
That remarkable run of strong sales is likely to continue when the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors reports its 2Q fiscal 2020 earnings tomorrow morning  Analysts  on average are expecting  1 37 a share profit on sales of  18 42 billion 
In expectation of another blowout quarter  the shares of the world s largest maker of household products touched another record high of  127 on Friday  The stock closed at  126 09 yesterday  up about 38  in the past year 
During the past two years  P G  whose other brands include many household names such as Dawn dish washing soap  Bounty paper towels and Crest toothpastes  has consistently been growing sales  helped by its innovation  marketing and a simplified organizational structure 
In October  the company reported that organic sales  which exclude things like acquisitions and currency fluctuations  rose 7  in its fiscal first quarter  showing that it is keeping up the momentum after it matched the previous quarter s fastest organic sales growth in more than a decade 
But the pace of growth that P G is showing is unusual for a company which produces everyday consumables in categories where the competition is intense and margins are low  From a big consumer staple giant like P G it wouldn t be fair to expect a blow out quarter every time 
During the same period  Kleenex and Huggies maker Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  reported organic sales growth of 4   while  Reckitt Benckiser   LON RB  the U K  based maker of Lysol disinfectant products and Woolite detergent  reported disappointing organic growth of just 1 6  
Lofty Valuations 
These concerns have made some investors question P G s lofty valuations and its potential to provide further upside after such a fast and powerful rally 
Today  P G trades at 24 times forward earnings compared to its five year average of around 20  Over the past decade  the stock has never featured a forward earnings multiple this big 
These concerns could be valid for short term investors  but we think measuring P G stock performance on these metrics doesn t present a true picture of the company s growth potential  What s fueling the share price gains is the company s success in its turnaround strategy to cope with changing consumer needs as well as its ability to put itself way ahead of competitors 
Under Chief Executive Officer David Taylor  Cincinnati based P G has cut its roster of brands from 175 to 65  focusing on the 10 product categories where the margin is highest  During the course of that process the company has also eliminated 34 000 jobs through a combination of brand sales and buyouts  as well as plant closures  slashing more than  10 billion in costs 
These measures are clearly helping the company to seek higher prices for its products despite a very benign inflationary environment  P G started implementing phased price increases last summer after failing to revive growth by doing the opposite  The shift in pricing strategy will be completed by February  which could boost prices between 4  10  on products including its Pampers  Bounty  Charmin and Puffs brands 
Bottom Line
P G stock remains our favorite pick from among the packaged consumer goods companies  It s one of the largest dividend payers in the U S    distributing  2 98 per share annual dividend for a yield of 2 36    and a track record that s hard to match  The maker of Pampers diapers has raised its payout for 62 consecutive years  Now that growth is back on track  investors should expect more hefty dividend hikes  We see little reason to abandon this consumer powerhouse  even if its stock goes through some weakness ",2020-01-22,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pg-earnings-preview-sales-growth-in-focus-as-shares-hit-new-high-200500418,200500418

94395,315910,PG,How Technology Is Transforming Procter   Gamble,news,"Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  might make most people think of toothbrushes and diapers  but for a while now  this consumer staples company has shown it can carve out a formidable spot in the tech world as well  At the start of 2020  in its second appearance at the CES annual technology trade show  the company took home five  Best of CES  awards for innovation 
But Procter   Gamble isn t turning its back on toothbrushes and diapers  Instead  it s making them high tech  This emphasis on technology means Procter   Gamble isn t only a company that will interest investors looking for a steady dividend but those seeking the growth potential that often accompanies innovation  Thanks to this strategy  the consumer products giant is less vulnerable to agile start ups  which makes it a bit like a start up itself despite its size 

Status of a baby s diaper
What makes Procter   Gamble less like a technology start up  though  is the fact that its innovation revolves around the basic consumer products mentioned above    products most of us use daily  The company made headlines last year with the introduction of the Lumi by Pampers baby monitoring system  which the company showcased at CES last week 
This system goes way beyond traditional video cameras and sleep monitors  With Lumi  an activity sensor coupled with a video monitor track the status of a baby s diaper  wet or dry   sleeping patterns  and even room temperature and humidity  Through the system s app  parents get a thorough picture of their baby s comfort in real time  all of the time 
But perhaps Procter   Gamble s biggest CES star was its smart toothbrush  the Oral B iO  How many of us hear   You re brushing too hard   every time we go to the dentist  Well  that might become a thing of the past with this brush  which has pressure sensors  several cleaning modes  and frictionless magnetic drive  among other features  Through artificial intelligence and an app  the toothbrush provides guidance to optimize the user s brushing  The company plans to launch the product in August 
Operate like a start up
So how does a consumer staples company with a  310 billion market value operate like a start up  Procter   Gamble isn t new to this game    a lot is going on under the company s roof with individual teams working on only the most promising projects in the spirit of Silicon Valley  At an industry conference in December  the company s chief brand officer Marc Pritchard said outright   And we decided that one way to compete with start ups is to build our own  We now have many internal start ups that are transforming how we innovate through lean innovation  
And the company reaches out beyond its own walls  Through the P G Ventures arm  which the company calls its  start up studio   the company meets with entrepreneurs and aims to take innovations that address consumers  unmet needs  outside of the company s existing product categories  from development to market 
According to Deloitte  the focus on disruptive technologies    or ones that change the landscape in an industry    is the way of the future for consumer product companies  boosting efficiency  profitability  and customer experience  Artificial intelligence  for example  is forecast to bring in more than  190 billion in revenue by 2025  with a compound annual growth rate of more than 36   a Markets and Markets report showed 
In October  Procter   Gamble reported quarterly earnings and sales that surpassed analysts  estimates and said each product category grew organic sales  On the earnings call  Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said the company is operating more and more through  lean innovation   with the goal of bringing the most meaningful products to market quickly  Procter   Gamble also continues to grow through acquisitions  and just recently announced its plan to buy Billie  a subscription service that sells shaving and other bodycare products for women 
Surpassing analysts  estimates
Procter   Gamble has raised its dividend annually for more than 60 years  and with an annualized dividend and yield of  2 98 per share and 2 4   respectively  it still is a solid stock in terms of returning capital to shareholders  Though the stock trades at 25 times forward earnings  the company has shown it can deliver on the top and bottom line  outperforming analysts  estimates for the past five quarters 
But Procter   Gamble isn t the sort of stock an investor must buy or sell on one particular day  but instead  it s that steady player you want to have on your team pretty much all of the time  For Procter   Gamble  integrating technology into the organization assures its spot as an innovator in its field going forward  but it by no means turns the company into a daily mover and shaker on the stock market  And that s why investors should like it ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pid2y,2060059
94396,315911,PG,Procter   Gamble Earnings  3 Numbers to Watch,news,"Last year was a good one for Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  shareholders  After watching for years to see whether its rebound plan would work  shareholders finally saw concrete evidence of accelerating sales growth in 2019  In fact  P G s last quarterly report contained some of the fastest revenue gains in over a decade for the owner of global consumer brands like Bounty paper towels and Tide detergent 
P G is looking to keep that positive momentum going when it releases its first earnings report of 2020 in just a few days  Let s take a look at a few key numbers to watch for in Thursday s announcement 

1  Sales growth
Sales growth is always a closely followed metric  and most investors expect P G to announce a 5  revenue uptick to  18 3 billion this quarter  Yet that top line result isn t very informative on its own 
The company s organic sales growth is the better figure to watch since it strips out volatile swings in exchange rates and gives a clearer picture of market share trends  P G s last announcement showed a scorching 7  increase in that metric    its best performance in over a decade  Management predicted a moderation of that growth pace  down to about 3  for the remainder of the fiscal year 
Within the sales figure  keep an eye on the balance between pricing and volume trends  P G is aiming for a solid contribution from both areas  but ideally  volume will lead the way higher  as it has in each of the last two quarterly reports  Rival Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB   in contrast  has had to rely entirely on price increases for its organic sales growth 
2  Margin expansion
Market share growth has been a key catalyst of P G s surging stock price  but investors are also salivating at the prospect of substantially higher profitability in 2020  We saw some hints of it back in late October when the consumer staples company revealed an increase of 2 percentage points in gross profit margin and a surge of nearly 3 percentage points in operating margin in the fiscal first quarter 
Kimberly Clark and other peers will be doing their best to knock P G from that industry leading perch  Yet CFO Jon Moeller told investors that the margin increase is supported by sustainable improvements to the business that span categories like marketing  product packaging  and innovation  It s also helping that commodity costs are trending lower  Investors will get another chance to judge the stability of P G s profit surge in Thursday s report by following its margin metrics  especially in comparison to Kimberly Clark s 
3  That guidance
P G raised its full year outlook back in October  but its financial targets still imply a dramatic slowing of growth in the second half of the year compared to the blistering 7  pace it achieved over the last six months  The company s updated outlook this week  and comments by CEO David Taylor and his team  should add context to that forecast 
Specifically  investors will want to know how much of the slowdown might come from competitors  including retail chains like Walmart  cutting prices on their own value based brands  We ll get a big clue on that point when P G updates its forecast  which today includes a wide range of potential growth  with organic sales targeted to rise by between 3  and 5   The low end of that prediction would likely be a disappointment for shareholders  while a step toward the high end would show that the rebound momentum is still accelerating ",2020-01-20,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkdl3,2063211
94397,315912,PG,Procter   Gamble  Buy at the High ,news,"Consumer products veteran Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  is setting fresh all time highs nearly every week nowadays  The stock has gained 38  over the past 52 weeks  breaking a habit of trading mostly sideways from 2013 to 2018 
Does P G have any rocket fuel left in its tanks or will this mature industry giant start behaving like a sleepy value stock again 

How healthy is P G s business 
In October s first quarter report  P G showed significant year over year growth in four of its five product categories  Health care led the way with 20  higher net sales driven almost entirely by 17  higher unit volumes  Management pointed to strong sales of premium tooth care products and unusually active consumer interest in cough and cold medication  Beauty products posted 8  higher revenues thanks to a double digit increase in organic sales  Here  the product mix shifted toward the pricier end of the spectrum 
These are not unique points of light but sustainable trends  Health care sales also rose by a double digit percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019  and organic sales have been surging all year long in the beauty division  All of these gains were achieved in the face of substantial currency exchange headwinds 
I would be surprised to see P G s healthy sales trends breaking down when the company reports second quarter results this Thursday    or at any point in the foreseeable future  With market defining brand names like Tide  Gillette  Vicks  Crest  and Old Spice  this company dominates nearly every subsector in which it chooses to compete  More than 20 of these brands generate more than  1 billion of annual sales  That s per product line  not a total across all these household names  As a reminder  P G pulled in a cool  68 8 billion of total sales over the last year 
How healthy is the stock 
P G has most certainly been on a roll recently  The steady climb since the summer of 2018 is nothing short of impressive 

PG data by YCharts
The  4 2 billion buyout of pharmaceuticals giant Merck s  NYSE MRK  consumer products division was announced just before that hockey stick moment and closed soon afterward  That deal kicked off a string of rosy reports from P G s healthcare segment  and that momentum continues today 
Investors embraced P G s business improvements with enthusiasm  driving share prices upward faster than the underlying earnings and cash flow improvements  As a result  the stock now trades at historically high price to earnings and price to cash flow ratios 
It is tempting to wave P G off as an overpriced turnaround stock right now  but I think that would be a mistake  You get what you pay for    an unrivaled portfolio of consumer goods businesses organized into a smoothly humming cash machine  which in turn rewards investors with a generous dividend yield of 2 4  and a  6 7 billion annual budget for share buybacks 
So growth investors wouldn t back up the truck to Procter   Gamble in its current form but those who are stalking Wall Street in search of long term value bets and generous dividend payers should definitely take a second look at this stock  Yes  even at these lofty stock prices    Warren Buffett would advise you to buy great companies at fair prices rather than the other way around ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plc87,2064869
94398,315913,PG,Proxy solicitor Morrow Sodali hires Schulman from MacKenzie,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Jessica DiNapoli
BOSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    Proxy solicitor Morrow Sodali this week hired Paul Schulman from rival MacKenzie Partners  a prominent shakeup in the tight knit world of vote counting for corporate battles 
Schulman will be co head of Mergers   Acquisitions  Activism and Contested Situations along with Michael Verrechia  a Morrow veteran  according to his LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  profile and two sources who could not speak publicly about the personnel matter 
A spokeswoman for Morrow  which worked with Newell Brands  O NWL  during its fight with activist investor Starboard and dining chain Luby s  N LUB  when it was targeted by Bandera Partners  was not immediately available for comment 
Schulman spent the last decade steeped in corporate battles at MacKenzie where he was widely seen as one of founder Dan Burch s top two lieutenants  Alongside Burch  Schulman worked on corporate fights at Procter   Gamble  N PG    SandRidge Energy   N SD  and Dell among others  He resigned on Tuesday

94418,315933,PG,4 Blue Chip Stocks To Win Big On Phase One Trade Deal,opinion,The United States and China have signed the much anticipated phase one trade deal  While Washington has pledged to cut some tariff on Chinese imports  Beijing has agreed to purchase more goods and services from America Although most of the details on the deal were known  the phase one accord has lent the much needed impetus to keep the nation s longest economic expansion on track  Wall Street rallied following the first phase of the U S  China trade pact  with Dow Jones Industrial Average and S P 500 closing at record highs More on the Phase One Trade DealPer the deal details released by the office of the U S  Trade Representative  Beijing has agreed to boost purchase of products and services from Washington by at least  200 billion in the next two years  For comparison purposes  the accord considered 2017 as the baseline China has pledged manufacturing purchases from the United States of an additional  77 7 billion in two years  time  In 2020 and 2021  Beijing will buy an additional  32 9 billion and  44 8 billion of manufacturing products  respectively  Thus  the second largest economy s total imports of manufactured goods from America will total no less than  120 0 billion in 2020 and  131 9 billion in 2021  China s manufacturing purchases are likely to comprise electrical equipment  pharmaceutical products  industrial machinery  vehicles  optical   medical instruments  aircraft  iron   steel  hardwood lumber  solar grade polysilicon  and other goods As compared to a baseline of  9 1 billion in 2017  China has agreed to purchase additional energy products of at least  52 4 billion over two years  The deal also included  32 billion of additional U S  agriculture products purchases over the time frame  From Washington  Beijing has decided to buy services of an additional  37 9 billion over the two years  time  Included in the phase one accord  Washington will halve the tariff rate levied on Sep 1 on a list of Chinese goods  worth  120 billion  to 7 5   Moreover  the United States indefinitely called off the Dec 15 implementation of 15  tariffs on  160 billion worth of China goods   comprising toys  laptops  cell phones and clothing  Beijing also suspended the retaliatory tariffs of 25  on American autos that were set to go into effect on the same day  However  to leverage negotiations for the second phase in 2020  the United States has kept its 25  duty on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods in place The agreement will also address some of the complaints made by America about the practices of intellectual property Favorable Labor MarketAlthough data from the Labor Department showed that the pace of hiring slowed last December  most of the economists believe that the job growth data was satisfactory enough to keep the nation s longest economic expansion on track   Moreover  the country s jobless rate was at a 50 year low of 3 5  in December  per the closely watched monthly employment report of the Labor Department Earnings to Bounce Back in 2020After a disappointing 2019  we expect a rebound in earnings this year For the December quarter of 2019  S P 500 is likely to have seen a year over year earnings decline of 3 2   Notably  in the first and third quarter of 2019  the S P 500 witnessed an earnings decline of 0 1  and 1 7   respectively  In the second quarter of 2019  the index saw a marginal improvement of 0 6   Thus  more than a year long trade spat that prompted the slowdown in the global economy has primarily hurt the companies  overall business However  the historic phase one deal has renewed investors  hopes and spurred Wall Street  The corporate earnings picture is likely to recover in 2020 and we are expecting year over year earnings growth in the first  second  third and fourth quarter of 2020 to be much healthier at 3 8   3 6   7 7  and 11 2   respectively Stocks to Make MerryWith Dow and S P 500 closing at record highs on phase one trade deal  the upward trend is likely to continue as a favorable labor market and expectations for healthy corporate earnings picture for 2020 have been acting as catalysts  Thus  to outdo market returns as well as take advantage of the aforesaid factors  we have used the  to narrow down on blue chip stocks  carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   These

 Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM    Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   and The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog 4 Blue Chip Stocks to Win Big on Phase One Trade DealThe United States and China have signed the much anticipated phase one trade deal  While Washington has pledged to cut some tariff on Chinese imports  Beijing has agreed to purchase more goods and services from America Although most of the details on the deal were known  the phase one accord has lent the much needed impetus to keep the nation s longest economic expansion on track  Wall Street rallied following the first phase of the U S  China trade pact  with Dow Jones Industrial Average and S P 500 closing at record highs More on the Phase One Trade DealPer the deal details released by the office of the U S  Trade Representative  Beijing has agreed to boost purchase of products and services from Washington by at least  200 billion in the next two years  For comparison purposes  the accord considered 2017 as the baseline China has pledged manufacturing purchases from the United States of an additional  77 7 billion in two years  time  In 2020 and 2021  Beijing will buy an additional  32 9 billion and  44 8 billion of manufacturing products  respectively  Thus  the second largest economy s total imports of manufactured goods from America will total no less than  120 0 billion in 2020 and  131 9 billion in 2021  China s manufacturing purchases are likely to comprise electrical equipment  pharmaceutical products  industrial machinery  vehicles  optical   medical instruments  aircraft  iron   steel  hardwood lumber  solar grade polysilicon  and other goods As compared to a baseline of  9 1 billion in 2017  China has agreed to purchase additional energy products of at least  52 4 billion over two years  The deal also included  32 billion of additional U S  agriculture products purchases over the time frame  From Washington  Beijing has decided to buy services of an additional  37 9 billion over the two years  time  Included in the phase one accord  Washington will halve the tariff rate levied on Sep 1 on a list of Chinese goods  worth  120 billion  to 7 5   Moreover  the United States indefinitely called off the Dec 15 implementation of 15  tariffs on  160 billion worth of China goods   comprising toys  laptops  cell phones and clothing  Beijing also suspended the retaliatory tariffs of 25  on American autos that were set to go into effect on the same day  However  to leverage negotiations for the second phase in 2020  the United States has kept its 25  duty on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods in place The agreement will also address some of the complaints made by America about the practices of intellectual property Favorable Labor MarketAlthough data from the Labor Department showed that the pace of hiring slowed last December  most of the economists believe that the job growth data was satisfactory enough to keep the nation s longest economic expansion on track  Moreover  the country s jobless rate was at a 50 year low of 3 5  in December  per the closely watched monthly employment report of the Labor Department Earnings to Bounce Back in 2020After a disappointing 2019  we expect a rebound in earnings this year For the December quarter of 2019  S P 500 is likely to have seen a year over year earnings decline of 3 2   Notably  in the first and third quarter of 2019  the S P 500 witnessed an earnings decline of 0 1  and 1 7   respectively  In the second quarter of 2019  the index saw a marginal improvement of 0 6   Thus  more than a year long trade spat that prompted the slowdown in the global economy has primarily hurt the companies  overall business However  the historic phase one deal has renewed investors  hopes and spurred Wall Street  The corporate earnings picture is likely to recover in 2020 and we are expecting year over year earnings growth in the first  second  third and fourth quarter of 2020 to be much healthier at 3 8   3 6   7 7  and 11 2   respectively Stocks to Make MerryWith Dow and S P 500 closing at record highs on phase one trade deal  the upward trend is likely to continue as a favorable labor market and expectations for healthy corporate earnings picture for 2020 have been acting as catalysts  Thus  to outdo market returns as well as take

94445,315960,PG,Is Procter   Gamble Stock Overvalued ,opinion,"Shares of global consumer staples giant Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  have had a great 2019  Investors sent the stock soaring to a record high after seeing five consecutive quarters of explosive growth and building in strong expectations for the current year 
The shares of the world s largest maker of household products surged to  126 60 on Dec  2 after a remarkable turnaround over the past 18 months  The stock closed at  122 51 on Thursday  up about 37  in the past year 
During the past two years  the maker of Dawn dish washing soap  Bounty paper towels and Crest toothpastes has consistently been growing its sales  helped by its innovation  marketing and a simplified organizational structure 
In October  P G reported organic sales  which exclude things like acquisitions and currency fluctuations  rose 7  in its fiscal first quarter  showing the company is keeping up the momentum after it matched the previous quarter s fastest organic sales growth in more than a decade 
But the pace of growth that P G is showing is unusual for a company which produces everyday consumables in categories where the competition is intense and margins are low  From a big consumer staple giant like P G it wouldn t be fair to expect a blow out quarter every time 
During the same period  Kleenex and Huggies maker Kimberly Clark  NYSE  NYSE KMB  reported organic sales growth of 4   while Reckitt Benckiser  NYSE RBGLY  the U K  based maker of Lysol cleanser and Woolite detergent  reported disappointing organic growth of just 1 6  
These concerns have made some investors question P G s lofty valuations and its potential for providing further upside after such a fast and powerful rally 
Today  P G trades at 23 42 times forward earnings compared to its five year average of around 20  Over the past decade  the stock has never featured a forward earnings multiple this big  To put things in perspective  both Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   NASDAQ GOOG  and Facebook  NASDAQ NASDAQ FB  are forecast to grow their profit more than 20  against the single digit growth for P G  These high growth technology stocks are trading at around 24 times forward earnings 
Another factor that could take some of the steam out of P G shares is that  because of its defensive nature  it attracted a lot of cash last year as fear of a global recession grew amid the U S  China trade war  Once that dispute settles  or the risks to growth recede  investors might again shift their funds to riskier assets  hurting P G stock 
P G   Most Underweight   Consumer Stock
These concerns could be valid for short term investors  but we think measuring P G stock performance on these metrics doesn t present a true picture of the company s growth potential  What s fueling these share price gains is the company s success in its turnaround strategy to cope with changing consumer needs and putting itself much ahead of competitors 
Under Chief Executive Officer David Taylor  Cincinnati based P G has cut its roster of brands from 175 to 65  focusing on the 10 product categories where the margin is highest  During the course of that process the company has also eliminated 34 000 jobs through a combination of brand sales and buyouts  as well as plant closures slashing more than  10 billion in costs 
These measures are clearly helping the company to seek higher prices for its products despite a very benign inflationationary environment  P G started implementing phased price increases last summer after failing to revive growth by doing the opposite  The shift in pricing strategy will be completed by February  which could boost prices between 4  10  on products including its Pampers  Bounty  Charmin and Puffs brands 
Goldman Sachs  while upgrading P G stock last year  tried to quell overvaluation concerns by pointing to the company s strong growth momentum in organic sales that could continue over the next three years  Said Goldman in a note 

 We believe there is a role in investors  portfolios for a large liquid global staples company such as this and note that PG remains the most underweight U S  listed mega cap global consumer packaged goods company among mutual funds   

Bottom Line
P G stock remains our favorite pick from the packaged consumer goods companies  It s one of the largest dividend payers in the U S    distributing  2 98 per share annual dividend for a yield of 2 6    and a track record that s hard to match  The maker of Pampers diapers has raised its payout for 62 consecutive years  Now that growth is back on track  investors should expect more hefty dividend hikes and we see little reason to abandon this consumer powerhouse  even if its stock goes through some weakness ",2020-01-10,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-procter--gamble-stock-overvalued-200497802,200497802

94537,316052,PG,Clorox  CLX  Down 9  In 3 Months  Can Efforts Aid Revival ,opinion,The Clorox Company   NYSE CLX   stock has been hurt owing to headwinds in the Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses  Investor sentiment for the stock was further hurt by first quarter fiscal 2020 results  which were impacted by higher trade promotional spending  unfavorable mix  higher manufacturing and logistics costs  and adverse currency  Elevated costs remain an added concern  Moreover  the company reiterated its recently lowered view for fiscal 2020  based on revised assumptions for currency rates For fiscal 2020  the company projects sales between low single digits decline and up 1   including currency headwinds  Furthermore  it anticipates sales in the first half of fiscal 2020 to be lower than the second half  due to its ongoing efforts to navigate through the challenges in Bags and Wraps  and Charcoal  Due to higher cost  gross and EBIT margins are estimated to be slightly down in fiscal 2020  Also  management anticipates earnings per share of  6 05  6 25 for fiscal 2020 A glimpse at this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock s price performance reveals that it has underperformed the industry in the past three months  Shares of this Oakland  CA based company have lost 9 4   wider than the  s 4 6  decline Reasons for Clorox s Dismal RunClorox has been witnessing operational headwinds in the Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses  which are hurting the top line of the Household segment as well as the overall company  Notably  the Household segment reported sales decline of 14  in first quarter fiscal 2020 while the company s net sales fell 4   Bags and Wraps sales declined double digits owing to larger price gaps compared with the year ago quarter as well as distribution losses in certain portions of the portfolio  Meanwhile  the Charcoal business delivered double digit sales decline on lower shipments and increased trade promotional spending to manage inventory levels before the 2020 grilling season  With revival efforts underway  the company expects to bring these categories back on track in the second half of fiscal 2020 Unlike most of its peers  Clorox witnessed gross margin expansion in the fiscal first quarter  However  growth was partly negated by 180 basis points  bps  impact of elevated trade promotion spending  and higher manufacturing and logistics expenses  Moreover  higher trade promotion spending hurt pre tax earnings of the Household segment  While selling and administrative expenses remained flat on a year over year basis  it increased 40 bps to 14   as a percentage of sales  due to reduced operating leverage  Further  advertising and sales promotion investments  as a percentage of sales  were nearly flat in the fiscal first quarter  while spending for the U S  retail business was 10  of sales In fiscal 2020  advertising and sales promotion spending is anticipated to be roughly 10  of sales  Selling and administrative expenses are projected to be nearly 14  of sales  driven by ongoing acquisition related investments and technology transformation investments to support long term growth and cost savings Can Efforts Aid Revival Clorox recently introduced IGNITE  its latest and integrated strategy  formulated on a sturdy foundation of its 2020 Strategy  This new initiative mainly focuses on the expansion of the key elements under the 2020 Strategy to pace up innovation in each area of business  As a result  the company will be able to drive overall growth and reinforce competitive advantage  hence boost shareholder value Backed by the IGNITE strategy  the company remains on track with its cost saving and productivity initiatives  It aims at higher cost savings annually by emphasizing more on technology and integrated design  With this  it expects to achieve EBIT margin expansion of 175 bps annually  Further  the company s cost based pricing strategy has enabled it to address the inflationary environment that has persisted for over three years  These cost saving and pricing actions should continue to support its investment in long term brands and category growth  In the fiscal first quarter  Clorox witnessed gross margin expansion of 60 bps  driven by 180 bps of benefit from cost savings and 120 bps from pricing  By the end of fiscal 2020  the company expects to surpass its annual cost savings target of 150 bps  supported by meaningful productivity improvements Apart from these  the company is witnessing strong progress in the core International business as it continues to build on the success of the segment s Go Lean strategy  These efforts will help in accelerating profitable growth for the segment  While sales for the International segment remained flat year over year  it demonstrated strong volume growth  innovation and benefits of price increases  which offset the currency headwinds  Moreover  organic sales for the segment rose 8   driven by strong gains in Latin America and Asia  Driven by its IGNITE Strategy  which aims to improve profitability in International business  the company expects to invest selectively in profitable platforms  These investments are likely to result in improved returns from businesses like Burt s Bees and Cat Litter We believe the aforementioned factors should benefit company s performance and help it win back investors  confidence Key PicksThe

94552,316067,PG,Energizer sues Warren Buffett s Duracell over  Optimum  battery claims,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    The maker of Energizer batteries sued the maker of Duracell batteries on Monday  accusing Duracell of duping consumers by implying that its new  Optimum  AA and AAA batteries are more powerful and last longer than all rival batteries 
Energizer Holdings Inc  N ENR  said Duracell  a unit of Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa   engaged in false advertising for Optimum with packaging that said its batteries offer  extra life  and  extra power   and TV commercials that said   Both is better than not both  
It is only in the  mice type  fine print  according to Energizer  that battery buyers learn that Optimum may outperform Duracell s own Coppertop batteries  not rival batteries  and only in some devices 
 These paltry and sporadic benefits are not the stuff great ads are made of and  indeed  barely seem worth touting at all   Energizer said in its complaint in Manhattan federal court 
The St  Louis based company is seeking damages for false advertising under New York law and the federal Lanham Act  and a halt to any improper advertising 
Duracell did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Berkshire bought Duracell  which has offices in Chicago and Bethel  Connecticut  from Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  in February 2016  It was not named specifically as a defendant 
The lawsuit is not the first Duracell has faced over Optimum  which were launched in July 
In August  New Jersey vaping company What A Smoke LLC accused Duracell of infringing its trademark rights in  Optimum  with respect to batteries  battery chargers  liquids and other products associated with electronic cigarettes  That lawsuit was filed in the federal court in Newark  New Jersey 
The case is Energizer Brands LLC v Duracell U S  Operations LLC  U S  District Court  Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York  No  19 09061 ",2019-09-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/energizer-sues-warren-buffetts-duracell-over-optimum-battery-claims-1989389,1989389
94553,316068,PG,Coty looks to offload brands including Wella  Clairol  shares rise,news," Reuters     Coty Inc   N COTY  is exploring the sale of its business unit that houses hair and nail care brands such as Wella  Clairol and OPI as part of its plan to whittle down its portfolio and cut debt  sending its shares up nearly 14  on Monday 
The cosmetics company has struggled to integrate about 40 beauty brands  including Covergirl and Max Factor  that it bought from Procter   Gamble  N PG  in 2016  forcing it to take billions of dollars in writedowns and outline a four year restructuring plan 
The company also said it was exploring options for its Brazilian unit as it shifts its focus to its fragrance  cosmetics and skin care businesses 
 Coty is the No  2 player in the global professional hair business  which has high consumer loyalty and should be an attractive business to a potential buyer    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Joe Lachky said 
Lachky  however  said the company s Brazil business was less attractive given the macro economic volatility in the country 
Coty s professional beauty unit  which primarily sells hair and nail care products to salon professionals  raked in about  1 81 billion in annual sales and accounted for about 21  of its total revenue 
The unit  however  has seen falling sales in the last four quarters 
  The announcement  accelerates this transformation and will help     deleverage our balance sheet  and improve our ability to invest in areas with the greatest growth potential   Chief executive Officer Pierre Laubies said 
Coty said it would use the proceeds from any of the transactions to pay down debt and return excess cash to shareholders 
The company  which is majority owned by German conglomerate JAB Holdings  has hired  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  to run a sale process for the units  which generated about  2 7 billion in net revenue in fiscal 2019 
Earlier this year  JAB raised its stake in Coty to 60   giving it a firmer grip on the company ",2019-10-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/coty-looks-to-offload-brands-including-wella-clairol-shares-rise-2000423,2000423

household and specialty products  mainly make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry  The personal care segment comprises skin and hair care products  deodorants  and oral care items  The household category covers home care products  including fabric and laundry care  house cleaning agents  bleaching products  air care  dishwashing liquids and other cleaning items The product range of these companies extends to baby and feminine care products  such as baby wipes  diapers  paper towels  tissues and toilet paper  Additionally  some companies offer food and refreshments  including

companies market and sell products through supermarkets  mass merchandisers  grocery stores wholesale clubs  distributors  wholesalers  department stores  drugstores  convenience stores  home stores  baby stores  specialty beauty stores  dollar stores and pet stores  and other specialty stores  as well as through websites  Pet nutrition products are mainly distributed via pet supply retailers and veterinarians Here are the three major industry themes The industry enjoys inelastic demand as soap and cleaning products are staple goods  The industry players mostly thrive on a positive consumer environment  backed by favorable consumer spending and overall economic growth  Disposable income greatly influences the quality and quantity of purchases for FMCG products  For instance  consumers will purchase low cost  generic products when disposable income is low  However  the industry is currently favored by rising income levels and a steady job market  The Soaps and Cleaning Materials industry players are grappling with escalating raw material and transportation costs  much like the others in the broader Consumer Staples sector  Cost elevation along with U S  China trade war concerns  uncertain global markets  higher operating expenses due to advertising investments  and unfavorable foreign currency rates is eating into revenues and margins  Furthermore  heightened competition has resulted in increased pricing pressure due to aggressive promotional activities  which is hurting margins  Despite the odds  the industry players are poised to benefit from efforts to boost productivity  product launches and enhanced focus on investments and innovation  Additionally  the players are undertaking pricing  packaging and marketing initiatives  and restructuring actions   including acquisitions and divestitures  accelerated investments in brands  and expansion into new markets and channels  These are likely to aid the sales graphs of consumer product companies  For instance  the cost based pricing strategy adopted by The Clorox Company  NYSE CLX   CLX  has enabled it to address the inflationary environment that has persisted for over three years  resulting in gross margin expansion  Focus on products with eco friendly and natural ingredients is catching pace among industry players as consumers are turning environmentally friendly and health conscious  This

margins  These initiatives include cutting costs in areas like supply chain  research   development  marketing and overheads Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Soaps and Cleaning

94581,316096,PG,Trian and P G highlight activist corporate collaboration after  fog of war ,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
NEW YORK  Reuters    Eighteen months after officially burying the hatchet in one of America s most bitter proxy contests  Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  CEO David Taylor and billionaire investor Nelson Peltz proclaimed their mutual respect on Thursday  underscoring how activists and corporations can end up working collaboratively 
Sitting next to each other on a hotel stage in New York at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference  the men brushed away the acrimony of two years ago when Peltz  Trian Partners was battling P G over its strategy and asking for a board seat 
 That was the fog of war   Peltz said  dismissing the rough comments P G had made about the veteran activist who works to present himself as a partner who can offer constructive advice rather than a corporate raider intent on breaking up companies 
After an incredibly close proxy contest  which could have dragged on for months  Taylor invited Peltz to join the board  which he did in early 2018 
Since then  the men say the have communicated a lot as the company took Trian s white paper to heart and hired consulting firm McKinsey for additional input on how the consumer products company  whose brands include Tide detergent and Pampers diapers  can move more quickly and nimbly 
 I found that the most important ingredient a CEO needs to have is to be a good listener   Peltz said  adding   Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas  We have an attitude at Trian  we steal any good idea  We d rather be rich than right  
The partnership is clearly paying off for all shareholders as P G s share price has surged 50  since before Peltz joined the board and has gained 32  in 2019 alone 
 I don t have to be right  I have to get the right thing done   Taylor said 
Peltz joked that he had promised to shave his beard when P G hit a price of  120 per share and he made good on that Wednesday when he cut it off  with P G razors  of course 
As the men bantered  their once bitter fight brought home some parallels to a contest taking shape between AT T  N T  and Elliott Management 
Investors in the audience  including powerful pension funds from Massachusetts and Florida  got a glimpse at how activists and companies can work together  as AT T undertakes a review of suggestions for a corporate overhaul from Elliott 
Elliott has urged AT T to divest some units  save  5 billion in costs  stop acquiring more companies and review its leadership  While the hedge fund has a number of potential board candidates  it has not disclosed their names and said privately it has no specific number of directors in mind 
Recent academic research has pointed to a growing appetite for settlements between activists and companies ",2019-09-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trian-and-pg-highlight-activistcorporate-collaboration-after-fog-of-war-1982170,1982170

94609,316124,PG,No rash moves  Kao aims to bolster  Made in Japan  cachet in China diaper market,news,"By Ritsuko Ando and Pei Li
TOKYO BEIJING  Reuters    Like many urban Chinese professionals with young children  Shenzhen based fintech executive Jacob Cao is a fan of Japanese diaper brands including Kao Corp s  T 4452  Merries 
While he knows some Merries are made in China  with little difference in quality compared with higher priced versions from Japan  he prefers the latter 
 I just get the feeling the Japan made ones are better  to be honest   said the father of 20 month old twin girls 
The perception that Japanese baby products are superior owes much to Chinese aversion to homegrown goods after a tainted milk formula scandal in 2008  It has served Kao well  propelling it to the No 2 spot in the world s biggest diaper market despite a late entry in 2009 
But Kao s sales have been hit after a clampdown by Beijing last year on  daigou  merchants  who buy goods abroad for resale online in China  More reliant than rivals on daigou sales  its baby diaper sales tumbled 14  in the first half compared to the same period a year earlier  the company said this week 
To preserve and bolster the made in Japan cachet  Kao began selling a premium line of  Tender Love  Merries in June  produced in its home market but only for sale in China 
Made of soft  silky fabric  they cost 4 9 yuan per diaper or roughly 200 yuan   29  for a medium sized pack of 40  more than double the price of standard Merries and considered too expensive to market in Japan 
 Our strategy in China is to go for the premium market  We don t want to go for volume   said Tomoharu Matsuda  Kao managing executive officer in charge of consumer products 
Promoting made in Japan products comes amid emerging competition from Chinese brands in premium diapers and despite Kao s longer term goal of producing all diapers for the Chinese market in China  which would help it manufacture and distribute more economically 
Baby diapers make up roughly half of Kao s sales in its  human healthcare  division  which in turn accounted for 18  of  14 billion in revenue last year 
P G SHARE LOSS
Estimated to be worth some  9 billion in annual sales  China s baby diaper market is five times bigger than Japan s and is expected to show a double digit compound annual growth rate through 2023  according to research firm Euromonitor 
In the past five years  Kao has doubled its China market share to 10   mainly at the expense of Procter   Gamble Co  N PG   which has seen its share tumble to 19  from 33   Huggies maker Kimberly Clark Corp  N KMB  has 8 6  and Japan s Unicharm Corp  T 8113  has taken 7  with its MamyPoko and Moony brands 
P G  which introduced China to disposable diapers in the 1990s when most babies there were wearing open crotch pants  has also sought to benefit from the made in Japan cachet 
Two years ago it began production in western Japan for its brand  Ichiban    the Japanese word for  best   Sold mainly in China  they are priced at around 2 0 yuan per diaper 
Unicharm opened a new factory in Japan s southern island of Kyushu this year to bolster production of diapers for the Chinese market 
But it is taking a slightly different tack from Kao  In recent months it began making a premium Moony diaper in China  which are sold for 3 5 4 yuan each  in line with pricing for existing imports from Japan 
 Demand for  Made in Japan  still exists  but needs are diversifying   said Unicharm spokesman Hitoshi Watanabe   Consumers are no longer making decisions based solely on where something s made  
Kao s Matsuda agrees that change in consumer sentiment is coming  but the company remains wary of making hasty moves  He noted made in Japan Merries diapers  which cost 1 8 yuan each  are still more popular than those made at its Anhui factory which sell for 1 6 yuan each 
 We ll need to carefully consider how the market develops  For now  there are people who still say it has to be made in Japan   he said ",2019-08-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/no-rash-moves-kao-aims-to-bolster-made-in-japan-cachet-in-china-diaper-market-1943488,1943488
94610,316125,PG,Kraft Heinz books more than  1 billion in charges  first half profit slumps,news,"By Richa Naidu and Aishwarya Venugopal
 Reuters    Kraft Heinz Co s  O KHC  net income halved in the first six months of the year  the packaged food maker said on Thursday as it wrote down the value of several business units by over  1 billion in results delayed by an internal investigation into procurement practices 
The company took a charge of about  744 million on its U S  refrigerated  Latin American exports and Brazil units among others  blaming lower five year operating forecasts  It also booked an impairment charge of about  474 million in the second quarter to write down the value of six brands  including Velveeta and Cool Whip 
The company added that the impairment charges for the first half of 2019 were preliminary and subject to finalization of control procedures 
This marks Kraft Heinz s second major writedown since Feb  21  when the company knocked  15 4 billion off the value of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands  posted a surprise quarterly loss  and disclosed a U S  Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting practices 
After an internal review of the accounting missteps  Kraft Heinz said it had increased the initial brand writedown by about  13 million due to misstatements in reports for 2016  2017 and the first nine months of 2018 
The company s shares fell 6 5  in premarket trading on Thursday  The stock has lost a third of its value since February 
 The level of decline we experienced in the first half of this year is nothing we should find acceptable moving forward   said Kraft Heinz s new Chief Executive Officer Miguel Patricio  Patricio a 30 year marketing veteran from  Anheuser Busch InBev   BR ABI   was named to the role in April 
Kraft Heinz s struggles have rocked other major consumer goods companies this year  highlighting the industry s struggle to cut costs without gutting marketing budgets  Companies from Kellogg  N K  to Procter   Gamble  N PG  have raised prices and invested to keep products relevant amid intense private label competition from grocers including Walmart  N WMT   Kroger  N KR  and Amazon com  O AMZN   Net income attributable to the company s shareholders fell to  854 million  or 70 cents per share  in the six months ended June 29  from  1 76 billion  or  1 43 per share  a year earlier

 Reuters    Cosmetics maker  Coty Inc   N COTY  raised its annual revenue forecast on Wednesday  as it embarks on a multi year turnaround plan that involves cost cuts and increased investment in advertising  sending shares up 5  
The company said in July it would write down about  3 billion in value of brands acquired from Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  in 2016  and laid out a restructuring plan to turn around the business hurt by falling sales in its consumer beauty unit 
The plan involves reducing organizational layers and reorganizing the operation into regional units with new business heads  Coty expects to incur restructuring costs of about  300 million during the year 
The consumer beauty unit has suffered in the past  mainly from the poor performance of brands it bought from P G  including Covergirl and Max Factor  due to integration issues 
Consumers shifting to trendier  Instagram friendly brands like NYX and Winky Lux has also been hurting the unit 
Coty said it was now pumping money into advertising  while cutting down on promotion and discounts  to boost sales of brands sold under the segment 
 We have been historically overpromoting    We have made the decision to be less dependent on promotion and more dependent upon advertising   Chief Executive Officer Pierre Laubies told analysts 
Laubies said revenue projections for the year reflect  clearly improving trends  in the segment  and stressed that the unit may not show a growth  but a reduction in decline 
The company expects net revenue  on a comparable basis  to be flat to slightly lower in fiscal 2020  with visible progress in the first quarter  It had earlier estimated a moderating decline in net revenue 
In the fourth quarter  revenue from the consumer beauty segment fell 15 2  to  902 4 million  as it also took a hit from its online Younique brand 
Coty on Wednesday said it ended its partnership with the brand  in which it bought a 60  stake in 2017 
 Management seems to have a handle on the business and is starting building credibility with investors   RBC Capital Markets  Nik Modi said 
Coty also forecast earnings to grow by mid single digits in the current year  Wall Street estimated earnings of 68 cents  or a growth of 5 8   according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
Net loss widened to  2 80 billion  in the reported quarter  from  181 3 million  a year earlier  mainly due to the writedown

US equity futures are up following a positive trading session in New York  The Dow   0 15   and NASDAQ   0 27   futures edge higher along with the Japanese stocks 
The US dollar is softer against the majority of its G10 counterparts  except from the risk haven yen and the franc 
Gold retreated to  1481 an ounce  The downside risks prevail  as investors trim their net speculative long positions which hit a three year high in September  This far  less than 20  of non commercial long positions that have been built during the past year have been closed  This means that there is a good potential for a deeper downside correction in gold  Improved US yields and falling inflation are other factors supporting a further sell off in the yellow metal 
The US 10 year yield advanced to 1 80   although the probability of a 25 basis point cut stands at a solid 90  for next week s FOMC meeting  The Fed s treasury bill purchases apply a downside pressure on the short end of the US yield curve  however  The one to six month fraction of the curve is down by more than 20 to 30 basis points over the month 
Third quarter company earnings should determine whether investors would increase the pressure for a broader balance sheet expansion from the Fed  So far  the earnings have surprised on the upside  with visibly better than expected bank results 
Today  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  will reveal their latest results before the market open  Snap is due to announce its earnings after the market close 
P G to reveal good looking results despite strong dollar
The P G s fiscal first quarter organic sales are expected to top estimates despite a difficult quarter on the back of a stronger US dollar  But good sales growth and solid volume performance is expected to have generated a solid 4 785  organic growth during the quarter  The adjusted EPS estimate stands at  1 24 per share  expectations range from  1 18 to  1 30 
The P G shares gained almost 40  since the beginning of this year  and nearly 45  since December  Hence  better than expected earnings could send the stock price to  125 per share  where it could meet some resistance  We believe that strong quarterly results could encourage investors to realize profits and walk away for a while  assuming they have hit their target for now  provided that the twelve month average target price for P G stand at  124 a share on a Bloomberg survey  But overall  investors will continue loving P G for its strength in price led competition and innovation 
Is Brexit happening 
The pound has been flirting with the 1 30 hurdle against the US dollar on relief that Johnson led negotiations will certainly not result in a chaotic Brexit by the end of this month  Markets price in the likelihood of a three month extension in the Brexit deadline  with an increased possibility of inking a deal before the October 31st time limit 
The government published a 110 page Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Monday  Today  MPs will vote on whether they go ahead with Johnson s Brexit bill  According to recent talks  Johnson has just enough support to pass his withdrawal bill through Parliament 
If the bill passes  British policymakers should also agree on whether they should accelerate the timetable to scrutinize the bill in order to deliver the Brexit by next week 
The pound s destiny depends mostly on the withdrawal vote  given that if Johnson s deal passes through Parliament  Europeans will likely forgive a minor delay in finalizing the divorce

94623,316138,PG,Solid PG Earnings To Further Boost Staples ETFs ,opinion,"One of the most famous names in the consumer products world   Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG     gave investors sweet surprises on October 22  2019 by beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in first quarter fiscal 2020  In addition  the company s raised guidance for fiscal 2020 also added to the upbeat tone  The stock gained 2 6  in the key trading session 
This positive news came at a time when half of the consumer staples ETFs returned more than the S P 500 index in the one year time frame  as of Oct 22  2019  and three out of 14 staples ETFs carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and most having a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Let s delve a little deeper and see if PG s strong numbers can do further good to the sector 
Procter   Gamble s 1Q20 Earnings in Focus
Procter   Gamble s core earnings of  1 37 per share improved 22  year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 24  Meanwhile  currency neutral core earnings per share  EPS  grew 24   Procter   Gamble reported net sales of  17 798 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  17 465 million and improving 6 6  year over year  However  the top line was hurt by currency fluctuations of about 2  
Organically  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestitures and foreign exchange   revenues grew 7   driven by 4  rise in organic shipment volume  Further  organic sales benefited 1  from increased pricing and 2  from favorable mix  Strong Personal Health Care  and Skin and Personal Care categories along with robust gains in Japan mainly aided the company s mix  Notably  all of these have higher than average selling prices 
Driven by strong top line growth  margin expansion and cash productivity witnessed in the fiscal first quarter  Procter   Gamble raised its view for fiscal 2020  The company now projects all in and organic sales growth of 3 5  compared with 3 4  mentioned earlier  The guidance includes a modest impact of adverse foreign currency  which is likely to be mostly offset by slight gain from acquisitions and divestitures  Moreover  the company now projects core EPS growth of 5 10  for fiscal 2020 compared with 4 9  mentioned earlier  In fiscal 2019  it reported core earnings of  4 52 per share 
Consumer ETF Impact
Thanks to an upbeat earnings release  shares of PG notched up about 2 6  in the key trading session of Oct 22  2019 on double the usual volumes  The gain also reflected in the ETF world  with consumer staples funds being benefited moderately  Many of the key funds in this segment have a double digit allocation to the consumer product giant  suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on P G s performance 
Let s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter   Gamble 
Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund 
The most popular consumer ETF on the market  XLP  follows the S P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index  The fund invests about  13 91 billion of assets in 33 holdings  Of these firms  the in focus P G takes the first spot  making up roughly 16  of the assets  The fund has returned about 0 03  on Oct 22  2019  see  here  
Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF 
This fund manages a  5 36 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 89 consumer stocks  The product charges a low fee of 10 bps per year from investors  Here too  P G is the top firm with 15  allocation  VDC advanced about 0 07  on Oct 22  2019 
iShares U S  Consumer Goods ETF 
This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U S  Consumer Goods Index  giving investors exposure to the broad consumer staples space  The fund holds about 106 stocks in its basket with AUM of  481 1 million  Like the other two  the stock under consideration occupies the top position in the basket with 13 2  of assets  The fund gained 0 6  on Oct 22 
Bottom Line
Even though PG had a favorable day  its impact on the rest of the consumer staples market wasn t as solid as some might expect  Yes  all of the major consumer staples ETFs were up  but their gains were not profuse 
Consumer staples had a good run in recent months as yields remained low on global growth concerns and this safe sector had a reason to outperform  However  such a rally added to the overvaluation concern 
But if PG s outlook is any guide  the sector has still something to offer  However  to come to any conclusion  we need to keep a track on earnings of other staples giants  read

Q1 Results Shine Bright
P G s latest quarterly report showed investors  and Wall Street  that it is still able to produce impressive growth numbers 
Earnings of  1 37 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  and revenues grew 7  year over year to  17 8 billion  Across its business segments  P G saw organic sales gains in beauty  healthcare  and fabric   home care of 10   9   and 8   respectively 
The icing on the cake was its cash flow generation  P G generated over  4 billion in operating cash flow in Q1  and  2 billion of that was paid out to shareholders via dividends 
As a result  the company boosted its fiscal 2020 outlook  and now expects organic sales growth of 3  to 5   up from previous guidance of 3  to 4   EPS growth is now estimated to be between 5  and 10   up from 4  to 9  
PG is on the Up and UpShares of P G are up almost 28  since January compared to the S P 500 s return of about 11 6   Earnings estimates have been rising too  and PG is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  pick right now

PG currently trades around 25 3X its forward full year earnings estimates  sitting above the broader Consumer Staples Market  19X  
Going forward  P G s overall organic sales  earnings  and cash flow growth will help the industry titan continue to remain on top  rewarding investors with potentially more share repurchases and increasing dividend income  The company currently boasts a 2 4  yield  making P G a stock to seriously consider adding to a portfolio

94650,316165,PG,P G Earnings Preview  Can This Consumer Giant Sustain Its Growth Momentum ,opinion,"  Reports Q1 2020 results on Tuesday  Oct  22  before the open
  Revenue expectation   17 46 billion
  EPS expectation   1 23
After seeing four consecutive quarters of explosive growth  investors have built in strong expectations from Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  before its fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday 
Going into this earnings season  the shares of the world s largest maker of household products have surged 45  during the past 12 months  massively outperforming its peers and the benchmark S P 500 Index 
In July  the maker of Dawn dish washing soap  Bounty paper towels and Crest toothpaste reported its best quarter of organic sales in more than a decade  helped by strong demand for its beauty and health care products 
Organic sales growth  which excludes items like acquisitions and currency effects  expanded a higher than expected 7   far surpassing last year s 1  growth  The company beat its 4  organic sales growth target for the fiscal year by a full percentage point 
What s fueling these share price gains is the company s success in its turnaround strategy to cope with changing consumer needs and smaller competitors  The demand for P G shares also rose this year as investors shifted their funds to stocks that provide safety in turbulent economic times 
Under Chief Executive Officer David Taylor  Cincinnati based P G has cut its roster of brands from 175 to 65  focusing on the 10 product categories where the margin is highest  During the course of that process the company has also eliminated 34 000 jobs through a combination of brand sales and buyouts  as well as plant closures slashing more than  10 billion in costs 
Vulnerable to Sell Off 
From a big consumer staple giant like P G it wouldn t be fair to expect a blow out quarter every time  and the risk of underperformance makes its stock vulnerable to some level of sell off on any negative earnings surprise 
Another factor that could take some of the steam out of P G shares is that  because of its defensive nature  it attracted a lot of cash this year as fear of a global recession grew amid the U S  China trade war  Once that dispute settles  or the risks to growth recede  investors might again shift their funds to riskier assets  hurting P G stock 
That being said  we still find P G a great long term investment for income seeking investors  given the company s successful response to dwindling consumer brand loyalty  For example  the beauty segment saw organic sales rise 8  on strong results from its SK II and Olay skin care brands 
The other reason to be optimistic about P G s next fiscal year outlook is that consumers are willing to pay more for the company s products  P G started implementing phased price increases last summer after failing to revive growth by doing the opposite  The shift in pricing strategy will be completed by February  which could boost prices between 4  10  on products including its Pampers  Bounty  Charmin and Puffs brands 
Bottom Line
P G stock remains our favorite pick for income seeking investors  It s one of the largest dividend payers in the U S    distributing  2 98 per share annual dividend for a yield of 2 6    and a track record that s hard to match  The maker of Pampers diapers has hiked its payout for 62 consecutive years 
Now that growth is back on track  investors should expect more hefty dividend hikes and we see little reason to abandon this consumer powerhouse  even if its stock goes through some weakness ",2019-10-18,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pg-earnings-preview-can-this-consumer-giant-sustain-its-growth-momentum-200474959,200474959

94662,316177,PG,Colgate s  CL  Growth Efforts On Track  Cost Woes Persist,opinion,Colgate Palmolive Company   NYSE CL   is benefiting from accelerated investments in brands  pricing and innovation along with expansion in new markets and e commerce  However  weak margin trend and adverse impacts of currency are hurting performance lately Although  shares of this New York based company have increased 7 3  in the past six months  it has underperformed the  s growth of 12 2  Notably  the company s earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in second quarter 2019 and declined year over year  Also  operating margin contracted in the second quarter  marking ninth straight quarter of decrease That said  let s take a closer look at the factors impacting its performance Hurdles on the WayColgate has been witnessing strained margins for the past few quarters now mainly due to higher raw material and other costs  Adjusted operating margin contracted 180 basis points  bps  to 24  in the second quarter  mainly hurt by a 200 bps increase in adjusted selling  general   administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  Moreover  management expects increases in raw material costs  including foreign exchange transaction costs  to be a deterrent to margin expansion in the second half of 2019 Despite pricing gains  Colgate s sales for second quarter 2019 continued to be hurt by adverse currency rates  Currency had a 4 5  negative impact on net sales  Moreover  unfavorable currency impacted sales across all geographic regions  Raw material costs  which included foreign exchange transaction costs  marred gross margin by 300 bps  Although management expects a moderate inflation environment in the second half of 2019  foreign currency may continue to hurt the company s top and bottom lines Efforts to Counter HurdlesColgate is on track with product innovation as part of its growth strategy over the years  This is clear from the re launch of Colgate Total and Hill s Science Diet  as well as the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions  The initial response to the re launch of Hill s Science Diet has been positive  with improved market share in the second quarter  The company expects to continue the re launch globally through the first half of 2020 Further  the company continues to expand the Naturals toothpaste  with the solid progress of the charcoal launches worldwide  In Latin America  its Oral Care innovations bore fruit  with market share gains in Colgate Total  Personal Care premium innovation and revenue growth management fueled robust pricing gain in the region In 2019  Colgate continues to expand its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets  It is also likely to increase investments in professional skincare businesses   Elta MD and PCA Skin   in spas and dermatologists  Further  the company is on track to expand its premium skincare portfolio with the recent agreement to buy the Filorga skincare business The company s expansion plan focuses on improving organic sales performance  In the second quarter  its organic sales improved 4  mainly driven by increase in global unit volume and rise in pricing  In 2019  it expects gains from pricing and productivity programs to offset increase in raw material costs  including the impact of transnational foreign exchange Further  it is progressing well with its savings programs   Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program and Funding the Growth program   which are delivering impressive results  In 2019  management expects gross margin expansion  both on a GAAP and adjusted basis The company s four year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs to improve gross and operating profit  standardizing processes to improve the decision making procedure and increasing market share worldwide  It expects after tax savings from this program to be  500  575 million  Additionally  these programs are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term Apart from these  the company is expanding the availability of its products through the e commerce offerings with the launch of Hill s to home  which will enable pet parents to purchase prescription diet products directly from their veterinarian  with home delivery option  This should enable it to deliver strong e commerce growth in the current year  All these actions are likely to drive top line growth in 2019 Though Colgate expects strong top line growth in 2019 backed by aforementioned efforts  its earnings outlook remains bleak  The company expects higher raw material costs  uncertainties in the global economy  and currency rates to hurt the bottom line  Consequently  GAAP earnings per share for 2019 are likely to decline in a low single digit  Also  adjusted earnings per share are expected to decline in a mid single digit Going ahead  we expect the aforementioned tailwinds to partly cushion these hurdles and help this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock to gain momentum 3 Stocks to WatchSkechers U S A   Inc    NYSE

94711,316226,PG,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Procter   Gamble  Kimberly Clark And Chesapeake Utilities,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 16  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG    Kimberly Clark   NYSE KMB   and Chesapeake Utilities   NYSE CPK   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Bond Yield Curve Inverts  3 Defensive Stocks to BuyThe U S  bond market has indicated what some people believe to be the biggest warning of an upcoming recession  The spread between the 2 year treasury yield and the 10 year yield inverted  with the 2 year yield climbing higher than the benchmark 10 year yield for the first time since 2007 On top of that  the U S  30 year bond yield fell to a record low early Wednesday  dropping down to 2 105  for the first time ever  Bond yield drops were not exclusive to the U S   yields across Europe fell with the German 10 year bund reaching a new low of  0 65   Strategists believe that a yield curve must stay inverted for it to truly signal a recession  Therefore  current bond yields are cause for concern only if they remain inverted  An inverted bond yield curve has been a reliable indicator of economic contractions but it does not always precede a recession With some bond yields at all time lows amid broader economic uncertainty  investors have turned toward defensive stocks  Let s take a closer look at a few stocks that can perform well during global economic uncertainty   Procter   Gambleis part of the consumer staples industry that is often seen as a relatively defensive move during market unpredictability  PG is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now and its shares have climbed 27 7  in 2019  with the broader soaps and cosmetics market trailing close behind  up 20  PG had a solid Q4 2019  beating earnings and revenue estimates by 3 77  and 1 31   respectively  Furthermore  both revenue and earnings grew Y Y in Q4  Zacks Consensus estimates project PG s growth to continue in Q1 2019 with earnings projected to climb 10 71  and revenue to pop 4 82  to  17 49 billion  Furthermore  estimate revisions have ticked favorably in the right direction for PG as the chart below shows  Kimberly Clarkis another consumer staples stock that has had a strong year  with KMB stock up 22   The company operates some of the most recognizable personal care brands such as  Huggies  Pull Ups  Kleenex  and Scott  Kimberly Clark continued its strong 2019 with a second quarter earnings beat that saw its EPS jump 5  to  1 67 per share KMB also raised its full year earnings outlook to  6 65  6 80  up from management s previous estimate of  6 50  6 70  Consensus estimates calls for KMB to sustain this bottom line growth in Q3 with a jump of 4 68  to  1 79 on the back of 2 02  higher sales that would see it reach to  4 67 billion  Positive top and bottom line growth is projected through 2020 and Kimberly Clark sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Chesapeake Utilitiesis a utility company engaged in natural gas distribution and transmission  Utilities are generally more stable stocks as the demand for electricity and gas often remains constant despite broader economic conditions  Utilities companies are also non cyclical and don t often move with larger market trends  CPK has a beta of 0 24 and pays out a quarterly dividend of  1 62  with a yield of 1 75  at the moment Chesapeake s quarterly dividend paired with its low volatility can provide investors with a secure defensive investment  Consensus estimates also forecast CPK s bottom line to spike 5 88   while sales surge 21 33  to  170 2 million in Q3  Looking ahead to the company s full fiscal year outlook  estimates call for earnings to pop 12 39  to  3 72 and revenue to grow 6 95  to  767 37 million  Like its defensive peers  CPK is Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop

94713,316228,PG,Here s Why Procter   Gamble  PG  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Procter   Gamble  PG   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Procter   Gamble currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if PG is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this world s largest consumer products maker holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For PG  shares are up 2 06  over the past week while the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is up 2 06  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 03  compares favorably with the industry s 0 33  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Procter   Gamble have increased 11 38  over the past quarter  and have gained 40 94  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 1 47  and 1 74   respectively 
Investors should also take note of PG s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  PG is averaging 8 688 290 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with PG 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PG s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 75 to  4 84 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that PG is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Procter   Gamble on your short list ",2019-08-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-procter--gamble-pg-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200458619,200458619

include  Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG    T Mobile   NASDAQ TMUS    Zoetis   NYSE ZTS    Autodesk   NASDAQ ADSK   and FedEx   NYSE FDX   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Top Stock Reports for Procter   Gamble  T Mobile and ZoetisThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features updated research reports on 16 major stocks  including Procter   Gamble  T Mobile and Zoetis  These research reports have been hand picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Procter   Gamble s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry in the past year  gaining  45 4  vs   25 8   The Zacks analyst thinks that this can be attributed to the company s impressive earnings history  It delivered its 17th straight earnings beat in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  with sales beat in seven of the last eight quarters Earnings benefited from its ongoing productivity efforts  while strong organic sales growth backed by higher shipment volumes and favorable price mix boosted the top line  The company also provided upbeat guidance for fiscal 2020  It is gaining from focus on product improvement  packaging and marketing initiatives  and productivity and cost savings plan However  adverse foreign currency rates are hurting the company s top and bottom lines  The company expects currency headwinds to hurt its top line in fiscal 2020  Moreover  global economic challenges and stiff competition poses concern Shares of T Mobile shares have outperformed the Zacks National Wireless industry over the past year  gaining  16 8  vs   5 1   The Zacks analyst likes the fact that T Mobile has cleared most of the regulatory and shareholder approvals for its game changing merger with Sprint The New T Mobile will have about 127 million customers and a strong closing balance sheet  and is expected to bring robust competition in the 5G era  T Mobile continues to invest in its network and prepare for nationwide 5G with the aggressive rollout of its 600 MHz spectrum  The wireless carrier has introduced 5G millimeter wave network in six cities including New York and Los Angeles However  a highly competitive and saturated U S  wireless market remains a major headwind  Intensifying competition is likely to limit its ability to attract and retain customers and may adversely affect operating results  The company launched several low priced service plans which have enhanced its revenues  but not significantly improved the bottom line Zoetis s shares have outperformed the Zacks Drugs industry in the past year  gaining  40  vs  21 2   Zoetis  second quarter earnings and sales beat estimates on the back of growth in new parasiticide products  Simparica and Stronghold Plus  and vaccines  a solid dermatology portfolio  and the addition of Abaxis  diagnostics platform Livestock product sales returned to growth as well in the second quarter  The Zacks analyst thinks the Abaxis acquisition has strengthened the company s presence in the animal health diagnostics market  Moreover  Zoetis  five year collaboration agreement with Regeneron will further diversify its portfolio  Shares have outperformed the industry in the year so far However  growth in the cattle market is expected to be limited in 2019  based on the challenging market conditions for beef and dairy customers  Moreover  growth in the swine market is being impacted by the African swine fever in China    Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Autodesk and FedEx

P G  which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry  posted revenues of  17 09 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 31   This compares to year ago revenues of  16 50 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
P G shares have added about 26 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for P G 
While P G has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for P G was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

94728,316243,PG,Is Procter   Gamble  PG  Stock Outpacing Its Consumer Staples Peers This Year ,opinion,"For those looking to find strong Consumer Staples stocks  it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers  Procter   Gamble  PG  is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors  but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole  One simple way to answer this question is to take a look at the year to date performance of PG and the rest of the Consumer Staples group s stocks 
Procter   Gamble is one of 176 individual stocks in the Consumer Staples sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  6 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  PG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG s full year earnings has moved 2 17  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Based on the most recent data  PG has returned 26 99  so far this year  Meanwhile  the Consumer Staples sector has returned an average of 19  on a year to date basis  As we can see  Procter   Gamble is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
To break things down more  PG belongs to the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry  a group that includes 8 individual companies and currently sits at  161 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  this group has gained an average of 21 47  so far this year  meaning that PG is performing better in terms of year to date returns

94736,316251,PG,Procter   Gamble  PG  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Procter   Gamble  PG   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Procter   Gamble currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PG that show why this world s largest consumer products maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For PG  shares are up 1 49  over the past week while the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is down 1 83  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 1 56  compares favorably with the industry s 1 01  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Procter   Gamble have increased 8 27  over the past quarter  and have gained 40 28  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 53  and 2 94   respectively 
Investors should also take note of PG s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  PG is averaging 8 788 650 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with PG 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PG s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 74 to  4 84 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that PG is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Procter   Gamble on your short list ",2019-08-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/procter-amp-gamble-pg-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200453084,200453084

94740,316255,PG,Bond Yield Curve Inverts  3 Defensive Stocks To Buy  ,opinion,"The U S  bond market has indicated what some people believe to be the biggest warning of an upcoming recession  The spread between the 2 year treasury yield and the 10 year yield inverted  with the 2 year yield climbing higher than the benchmark 10 year yield for the first time since 2007 
On top of that  the U S  30 year bond yield fell to a record low early Wednesday  dropping down to 2 105  for the first time ever  Bond yield drops were not exclusive to the U S   yields across Europe fell with the German 10 year bund reaching a new low of  0 65   Strategists believe that a yield curve must stay inverted for it to truly signal a recession  Therefore  current bond yields are cause for concern only if they remain inverted  An inverted bond yield curve has been a reliable indicator of economic contractions but it does not always precede a recession 
With some bond yields at all time lows amid broader economic uncertainty  investors have turned toward defensive stocks  Let s take a closer look at a few stocks that can perform well during global economic uncertainty   
Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   is part of the consumer staples industry that is often seen as a relatively defensive move during market unpredictability  PG is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now and its shares have climbed 27 7  in 2019  with the broader soaps and cosmetics market trailing close behind  up 20  
PG had a solid Q4 2019  beating earnings and revenue estimates by 3 77  and 1 31   respectively  Furthermore  both revenue and earnings grew Y Y in Q4  Zacks Consensus estimates project PG s growth to continue in Q1 2019 with earnings projected to climb 10 71  and revenue to pop 4 82  to  17 49 billion  Furthermore  estimate revisions have ticked favorably in the right direction for PG as the chart below shows  

Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB   is another consumer staples stock that has had a strong year  with KMB stock up 22   The company operates some of the most recognizable personal care brands such as  Huggies  Pull Ups  Kleenex  and Scott  Kimberly Clark continued its strong 2019 with a second quarter earnings beat that saw its EPS jump 5  to  1 67 per share 
 
KMB also raised its full year earnings outlook to  6 65  6 80  up from management s previous estimate of  6 50  6 70  Consensus estimates calls for KMB to sustain this bottom line growth in Q3 with a jump of 4 68  to  1 79 on the back of 2 02  higher sales that would see it reach to  4 67 billion  Positive top and bottom line growth is projected through 2020 and Kimberly Clark sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Chesapeake Utilities  NYSE CPK   is a utility company engaged in natural gas distribution and transmission  Utilities are generally more stable stocks as the demand for electricity and gas often remains constant despite broader economic conditions  Utilities companies are also non cyclical and don t often move with larger market trends  CPK has a beta of 0 24 and pays out a quarterly dividend of  1 62  with a yield of 1 75  at the moment 
Chesapeake s quarterly dividend paired with its low volatility can provide investors with a secure defensive investment  Consensus estimates also forecast CPK s bottom line to spike 5 88   while sales surge 21 33  to  170 2 million in Q3  Looking ahead to the company s full fiscal year outlook  estimates call for earnings to pop 12 39  to  3 72 and revenue to grow 6 95  to  767 37 million  Like its defensive peers  CPK is Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment

94770,316285,PG,Procter   Gamble  PG  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Procter   Gamble  PG  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 8  
Revenues are expected to be  16 87 billion  up 2 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P G 
For P G  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 22  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that P G will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that P G would post earnings of  1 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 06  delivering a surprise of  1 92  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
P G appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/procter--gamble-pg-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200443171,200443171
94771,316286,PG,P G Investors Optimistic Ahead Of Q4 Results As Turnaround Picks Up Steam,opinion,"Reports Q4 2019 results on Tuesday  July 30  before the open


Revenue expectation   16 86 billion


EPS expectation   1 05

Judging by the trajectory of Procter   Gamble s  NYSE PG  share price  investors are expecting an extraordinary performance from the world s largest maker of household products when its reports Q4 earnings tomorrow 
The stock has gained more than 40  during the past 12 months  outperforming its peers and the benchmark S P 500 Index  Closing on Friday at  114 73  the shares are trading ahead of the analysts  12 month consensus price target of  110  with its trailing price to earnings multiple of 27 54 close to the highest in five years 





What s fueling these expectations is the company s strong growth in sales and the success of its turnaround strategy  In April  the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors reported its strongest quarterly sales growth in eight years  helped by higher prices and growth in developing markets 
Building Momentum
Under Chief Executive Officer David Taylor  Cincinnati based P G has cut its roster of brands from 175 to 65  focusing on the 10 product categories where the margin is highest  During the course of that process the company has also eliminated 34 000 jobs through a combination of brand sales and buyouts  as well as plant closures slashing more than  10 billion in costs 
The results of these efforts have been encouraging for investors  In 3Q  organic sales a closely watched metric that strips out currency moves  acquisitions and divestitures rose 5   It was the third consecutive quarter of solid sales gains for P G  The company attributed 2 percentage points of the overall gain to price increases and another 2 percentage points to higher shipment volumes compared with a year ago 
Will P G be able to sustain this momentum going forward  We believe that s very much a possibility  given the company s successful response to dwindling consumer brand loyalty  For example  P G s beauty division is performing strongly  getting a big boost from its SK II skin care line  Organic sales of beauty products climbed 9  in Q3  in addition to gains in the health care  fabric and home care units 
The other reason to be optimistic about P G s next fiscal year outlook is that consumers are willing to pay more for the company s products  P G started implementing phased price increases last summer after failing to revive growth by doing the opposite  The shift in pricing strategy will be completed by February  which could boost prices between 4  10  on products including its Pampers  Bounty  Charmin and Puffs brands 
Bottom Line
P G stock remains our favorite pick for income seeking investors  It s one of the largest dividend payers in the U S  with a track record that s hard to match  The maker of Pampers diapers and Dawn dish soap has hiked its payout for 62 consecutive years  Now that growth is back on track  investors should expect more hefty dividend hikes and we see little reason to abandon this consumer powerhouse ",2019-07-29,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pg-investors-optimistic-ahead-of-q4-results-as-turnaround-picks-up-steam-200446144,200446144

94803,316318,PG,Colgate s  CL  Growth Efforts Well On Track Amid Soft Margins,opinion,"Shares of Colgate Palmolive Company   NYSE CL   have rallied 22 9  year to date  outperforming the  s growth of 20 4   The company s accelerated investments in brands  higher pricing and strong innovation along with expansion in new markets and channels act as key drivers  

 
Let s delve deeper 
A Brief Introspection
Colgate is on track with product innovation as part of its growth strategy over the years  The company has already re launched Colgate Total and Hill s Science Diet  Notably  the initial response to the re launch of Hill s Science Diet has been positive  with improved market share in the first quarter  The company expects to continue the re launch globally through the first half of 2020 
Further  it continues to expand the Naturals toothpastes category  based on local insights  with the launch of the charcoal range across many countries  The Naturals range is a key area of focus for the companies in personal and home care categories This along with accelerated investments in brands and higher pricing is likely to aid Colgate s top line in 2019  
Moreover  the company is focused on its expansion plans to improve organic sales performance  In 2019  it plans to expand the portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like Elmex and Meridol to newer markets  It is also likely to increase investments in professional skin care businesses   Elta MD and PCA Skin   in spas and dermatologists  
Additionally  it is expanding e commerce offerings with the launch of Hill s to home  which significantly exceeded subscription targets in the first quarter  This platform will enable pet parents to purchase prescription diet products directly from their veterinarian with home delivery option  This should enable the company to deliver strong e commerce growth in 2019  Such well chalked efforts are likely to drive the top line this year 
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is also progressing well with its savings programs   Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program and the Funding the Growth program   which are delivering impressive results 
The company s four year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs to improve gross and operating profit  standardizing processes to improve the decision making procedure and increasing market share worldwide  It expects after tax savings from this program to be  500  575 million  Additionally  these programs are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term 
These apart  the company s first quarter marked the second straight quarter of sales beat and the third positive earnings surprise in the last five quarters  Moreover  it delivered volume and pricing growth  on an organic basis  in all four categories   Oral Care  Pet Nutrition  Personal Care and Home Care   for the first time in more than two years  Additionally  organic sales growth was led by toothpaste and Hill s businesses  
Hurdles
Despite pricing gains  Colgate s sales for first quarter 2019 continued to be hurt by adverse currency rates  Adverse currency translations affected sales by 6  in the first quarter  Moreover  unfavorable currency impacted sales across all geographic regions  In fact  foreign exchange is expected to adversely impact sales and earnings in 2019  The company expects negative currency impacts of about 2 2 5  in 2019 
Further  higher raw material costs have been hurting margins for the past few quarters  Adjusted gross margin contracted 110 basis points  bps  in first quarter 2019  owing to increased raw and packaging material expenses  Notably  this marked the sixth straight quarter of gross margin contraction and eighth consecutive quarter of operating margin decline  We expect the company s soft margins trend to continue in 2019  as raw material expenses are likely to increase 
Though Colgate expects strong top line growth in 2019  its earnings outlook remains bleak  The company expects higher raw material costs  increase in tax rate  and uncertainties in the global economy  currency rates and pricing to hurt the bottom line  Consequently  adjusted earnings per share are expected to decline mid single digit

    How Things are Shaping Prior to Q2 EarningsBoston Beer has been displaying significant earnings momentum on the back of sturdy shipment volume and depletions  Further  the company s results are benefiting from the three point growth plan that focuses on cost saving initiatives  long term innovation  and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  These trends should continue to boost the company s operational performance and market position in the to be reported quarter Boston Beer has been witnessing sturdy depletion growth for a while now  which is aiding the top line performance  Solid shipment growth stems from the company s efforts to ensure that distributors  inventory levels are appropriate to cater to increased customer demand  Additionally  a planned acceleration in the timing of shipments to support the current and expected rise in future demand is likely to boost shipments  Robust shipments along with major innovations  quality of products and strong brands as well as solid sales execution and support from distributors are aiding depletion growth  Moreover  the company remains poised for further depletion growth  backed by increases in Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands  Based on the favorable trends witnessed in the first quarter  Boston Beer raised its shipment and depletion growth target for 2019 Additionally  we expect the company s continued focus on pricing  product innovation and growth of non beer categories alongside brand development to boost its operational performance and position in the market  Its innovation in the non beer categories  including hard teas  ciders and seltzer  has been a hit among liquor drinkers  which should drive depletion growth  In 2019  it is on track to launch three new brands namely 26 2 Brew  Wild Leaf Hard Tea and Tura Alcoholic Kombucha  which address health and wellness ideals of consumers  These product launches throughout the year should provide a significant lift to the company s results in the upcoming quarters  including the second quarter However  persistent softness in the Samuel Adams brand as well as higher operational costs may prove detrimental to the earnings performance in the upcoming quarter  Looking ahead  the company notes that increased volumes for the brands are attracting higher costs due to the use of third party breweries  which is likely to hurt the gross margin throughout 2019  Additionally  higher advertising  promotional and selling expenses along with increased general and administrative costs remain a threat to its overall profitability  These escalated costs may hurt the company s bottom line performance in the to be reported quarter Moreover  the Samuel Adams brand is struggling due to the industry wide softening of the craft beer growth rates and increased choices for drinkers on retail shelves  Volume declines for the brand is partly hurting depletion growth  The company is working hard on the brand messaging  with focus on the quality and brewing of the Samuel Adams Boston Lager as well as the new Sam Adams packaging design and a  lighter and brighter  taste for Samuel Adams Summer Ale  However  we believe that there is a lot of work to be done before seeing a turnaround in the trends for this troubled brand  Therefore  we believe that soft volume at the brand may hurt the otherwise strong depletion growth expected in second quarter 2019 Zacks ModelOur proven model does not predict that Boston Beer is likely to beat earnings estimates in the second quarter  This is because it does not have the right combination of two key components   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Although Boston Beer currently has a Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks Likely to Deliver Earnings BeatHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   has an Earnings ESP of  0 84  and a Zacks Rank  2 at present  You can see  Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 31  and a Zacks Rank  2 Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   presently has an Earnings ESP of  0 38  and a Zacks Rank  3 Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-a-beat-in-store-for-boston-beer-sam-in-q2-earnings-200440605,200440605

94829,316344,PG,Why P G  PG  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Procter   Gamble  PG   This company  which is in the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This world s largest consumer products maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 61  
For the most recent quarter  P G was expected to post earnings of  1 04 per share  but it reported  1 06 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 92   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 21 per share  while it actually produced  1 25 per share  a surprise of 3 31  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for P G lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
P G has an Earnings ESP of  0 85  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pg-pg-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200436157,200436157

94831,316346,PG,Will Snacks Category Boost PepsiCo s  PEP  Earnings In Q2 ,opinion,PepsiCo  Inc    NASDAQ PEP   is set to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 9  before the market opens  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 4  Notably  PepsiCo has reported positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 13 quarters and sales beat in seven of the last nine quarters  It has an average trailing four quarter beat of 3 5  Pepsico  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings is pegged at  1 49 per share  implying a 7 5  decline from the year earlier quarter s reported figure  Notably  the consensus mark has moved down by a penny over the past seven days  For quarterly revenues  the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  16 4 billion  suggesting 1 9  growth from the prior year quarter reported number Let s see how things are shaping prior to the earnings announcement Factors at PlayPepsiCo s robust surprise trend is mainly attributable to strong performances in international divisions  propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets  Further  strong net revenues and operating profit growth at Frito Lay North America along with sequential revenue gains in the North America Beverages segment have boosted results in the last few quarters  Backed by these trends  the company is likely to continue with its impressive top  and bottom line performances in the to be reported quarter Moreover  the company s fundamental strength is evident from its solid brand portfolio  product innovation and strong snacks business  PepsiCo is also focusing on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness by lowering costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities  This  in turn  is likely to boost margins and the bottom line PepsiCo has the competitive advantage of selling both snacks and beverages  which are complementary food categories  The complementary portfolio results in cost leverage  capability sharing  cross category promotions and other commercial benefits With popular brands like Doritos  Cheetos and Lay s  the company holds the number one position in the global snacks market  Just over half of PepsiCo s sales come from snacks  while the remainder is contributed by beverages  The Frito Lay North American snacks business has delivered consistent solid performance over the last four years  offsetting the sluggishness in the beverages business  This segment is expected to continue delivering strong sales and profits as clear from the rising demand for savory snacks Furthermore  PepsiCo generates a significant part of its revenues outside the United States  38  of 2018 net revenues   The company is expanding in developing markets like Russia  Mexico  China  India  Brazil and Africa through tailored distribution models as well as by offering locally relevant innovation and value added products  In Mexico and India  PepsiCo has a massive expansion plan in place over the next five years  Continued growth in these markets should contribute meaningfully to top line growth in the second quarter Expectations for 2019For 2019  the company estimates organic revenue growth of 4  compared with 3 7  growth in 2018  For the longer term  it projects organic revenue growth of 4 6  However  unfavorable impacts of ongoing investments to strengthen business  higher tax rate  and the absence of asset sale and refranchising gains that occurred in 2018 are likely to weigh on PepsiCo s earnings in 2019  Further  adverse currency rates are likely to hurt the company s sales and earnings this year Nevertheless  we expect all aforementioned growth drivers to offset these minor hurdles and help the company to sustain its robust top  and bottom line beat trend in the second quarter Earnings WhisperHere is what our quantitative model predicts PepsiCo has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    to increase the odds of an earnings beat Earnings ESP  PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of  0 17   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  PepsiCo currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which combined with a positive ESP increases the chances of an earnings beat

94921,316436,PG,Procter   Gamble  3M  2 Dividend Aristocrats That Could Boost Retirement Income,opinion,"Investing in income producing stocks is an ideal strategy for those seeking to earn extra cash during retirement  Of course  dividend paying stocks aren t sexy  and the shares alone won t make you rich  but they often belong to a mature group of companies in stable markets that don t stop returning cash to investors  often by boosting dividends  even during the worst economic times 
The big challenge  though  is to identify the right stocks  One way is to focus on the high quality companies in the S P 500 with at least 25 years of dividend growth  known in the market as  Dividend Aristocrats   While good historical performance doesn t guarantee that companies in this group will continue to provide you cash streams going forward  this is still a much safer bet than picking names with no track record 
The dividend stocks below are two examples we think are worth considering as additions to your retirement portfolio 
1  3M  Cash Machine for Long Term Investors
The shares of one of the world s largest industrial conglomerates  3M  NYSE MMM   are certainly not a buy if your investing objective is to see quick gains and move on to the next growth stock  The future outlook for this industrial giant is becoming uncertain amid the many powerful headwinds threatening the global economy  and any prolonged economic weakness has the potential to hurt the demand for its products 
But what if all you want is to earn steadily growing income  On this criteria  the maker of Post it notes and touch screens has an excellent track record  The company has raised its dividend every year between 1962 and 2018  This impressive run of dividend growth suggests that the company has the power to endure recessions  demand weakness and other turbulence along the way 
Trading at around  212 a share at yesterday s close  3M stock is down about 17  from the record high reached in January last year on concerns that rising costs and a slowing global economy will hit its earnings  But this temporary slip also allows long term income investors to lock in its dividend yield of close to 3  and earn growing payouts year after year  The company will pay a quarterly dividend of  1 44 per share on March 12  up almost 6  from the  1 36 per share paid in the same period in 2018 

2  Procter   Gamble  Owner of Powerful Consumer Brands
Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   the maker of Crest toothpaste  Tide laundry detergent and Bounty paper towels among other well known consumer brands  has one thing in common with 3M  the unique ability to produce recurring cash flows from their large number of brands  No matter what cycle the economy is entering  companies like P G will continue to sell toothpaste and detergent and generate cash for its investors  The world s largest consumer product company is also one of the largest dividend payers in the sector 
The maker of Dawn dish soap and Pampers has hiked its dividend for 62 consecutive years  Over the past 128 years it has never stopped paying dividends  making money during recessions  wars and droughts  With a current dividend yield of 2 98   P G stock pays about  0 72 a share each quarter  This remarkable history of payouts makes this consumer stock a dependable source of passive income for retirement portfolios 
The shares closed down 0 3  at  104 66 yesterday  but they ve risen almost 34  in the last 12 months  28  over the past 5 years  Consumer staple stocks like P G may not always produce the explosive gains seen in some of the growth stocks  but keeping them in your cash generating portfolio eliminates the need to worry about the daily market volatility  Once you buy them  you don t sell them  but sit back and watch them earn regular dividend income 

Bottom Line
It s not hard to generate a steady stream of passive income in your retirement if you start saving early and use a portion of these savings to buy dependable income stocks  such as 3M and P G  Researchers at the Stanford Center on Longevity project conclude that  in order to retire at age 65 and maintain your standard of living  you need to put 10  17  of your current income into a retirement account  And that s if you start saving as early as age 25  As the years tick by and you keep re investing dividends back into your income portfolio  you ll realize how quickly your nest egg grows  generating sizeable monthly cash flows for you ",2019-04-10,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-dividend-stocks-that-could-help-earn-passive-income-in-your-retirement-200405369,200405369

94925,316440,PG,Procter   Gamble  PG  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Procter   Gamble  PG  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4  
Revenues are expected to be  16 38 billion  up 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 47  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P G 
For P G  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 63  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that P G will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that P G would post earnings of  1 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 25  delivering a surprise of  3 31  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
P G doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/procter--gamble-pg-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407230,200407230

94951,316466,PG,4 Signals Dividend Stocks Such As Procter   Gamble Are Near Pullbacks,opinion,"Perhaps lost in the hubbub about the stock market s handsome gains so far this year  as well as the boost of more than 20  since bottoming on Dec  24  is how long fixed income  defensive equities can keep on rallying 
Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  and similar stocks have enjoyed quite a run  Shares of P G are up more than 16  since Christmas and more than 40  since they bottomed in May 2018  The stock has hit 14  52 week highs just since Feb  1 after a bullish earnings report in January  The consumer staple giant s shares are currently trading near the top of their range  closing yesterday at  101 51 

Rival Colgate Palmolive  NYSE CL  and utility companies are seeing similar gains  The Dow Jones Utility Average finished Friday at a 52 week high  Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED  hit a 52 week high last Thursday 
These stocks aren t rising because of fantastic sales growth  in general their performance has been modest but steady  Rather  investors are signaling they will be content if they see growth in earnings per share that supports and expands dividend payouts  in part because they don t see the Federal Reserve raising interest rates any time soon 
P G s  2 87 a share annual dividend represents a 2 80  yield and may be boosted in April  Colgate Palmolive s annual  1 72 dividend is yielding 2 6  while Con Ed s annual  2 96 dividend yields 3 49  
But at some point these stocks will see a hiccup  at the very least  and share prices will fall  presenting some good buying opportunities for those paying attention  Investors should be on the watch now for warning signs  Four are especially critical 
1  Price
P G shares are now selling at a rich 24 9x trailing 12 month earnings and have outperformed Colgate Palmolive over the last year  Colgate Palmolive  which makes consumer staples such as dental care products  soaps and pet foods  is right behind at a 24 4x multiple  Both are ahead of the S P 500 s current multiple of 21x  Con Ed s multiple stands at 19 4x 
Prices for all three stocks are ahead of consensus estimates from analysts  which suggests they have moved up too far  And remember  a stock like P G or a utility isn t going to grow anywhere near as fast as Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   which keeps hitting new highs and is up more than 20  this year 
2  Business Fundamentals
Two years ago  P G was in an existential crisis  Many of its biggest brands were losing market share and it owns some globally recognized names including Tide  Dawn  Pampers  Crest and Charmin 
At the same time that the consumer staples giant undertook an expensive proxy fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz  it was trying to cut costs  slim down  bust up a stodgy infrastructure and put some fire back into those brands 
P G is starting to see results of a turnaround plan that included selling off some 100 businesses  The company s first and second quarter 2019 earnings and revenue beat estimates  The second quarter results  released on Jan  23 pushed P G shares up 4 9  
Still  a stumble on any relatively strong results can clobber a stock  But for fixed income shares  at least there s the dividend 
3  Trade 
The U S  China trade dispute remains unsettled  with some sources characterizing the current stalemate as heading into overtime  If the trade talks fail  like the negotiations with North Korea  that could mean a new round of market volatility and currency gyrations  which can affect earnings 
4  The Fed
The value of a dividend to an investor is a function of the dollar amount paid and interest rates  Right now  the Fed is the friend to all companies that use their dividends to attract investors  Rates are low and likely to stay that way for some months  That s good for P G  Colgate Palmolive or Con Ed  which also need low rates to finance improvements to their systems 
So far  the price question is probably the biggest issue for a P G or Colgate  How the businesses perform and the trade question are the next wild cards  And always  it pays to watch the Fed  just in case ",2019-03-19,Charley Blaine/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-spot-if-pg-and-other-safety-stocks-are-near-pullbacks-200398840,200398840
94952,316467,PG,Will Dow Rally Continue In The Long Term  4 Top Picks ,opinion,The Dow    one of the equity markets  most closely watched indexes    is showering attractive returns on investors in 2019  The 30 stock index is currently within striking distance to reach to its all time high level  Moreover  its 50 day and 200 day moving averages are showing a long term uptrend for the Dow Positive development on the trade war front and the Fed s dovish monetary stance are likely to be long term catalysts for the blue chip index  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in Dow stocks with favorable Zacks Rank Dow Surging Ahead in 2019On Mar 19  the Dow closed at 25 887 38  reflecting a gain of 11  year over year  At present  the index is just 3 6  away to reach its all time high closing of 26 828 39 recorded on Oct 3  2018  In the first two months of this year  the Dow generated positive returns of 7 2  and 3 7   respectively Notably  at the closing on Mar 19  the 50 day moving average of Dow rose to 25 177 43 from 25 128 34 in the previous day  Likewise  the 200 day moving average of Dow rose to 25 165 68 from 25 158 32 the day before  In financial literature  the 50 day moving average line is generally recognized as the short term trend setter  while the 200 day moving average is considered as long term trend setter It is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50 day moving average line surged ahead of the 200 day moving average line  a long term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility Moreover  27 components of the total portfolio of 30 stocks on the Dow 30 index have provided positive returns so far this year  A strong bunch of 15 stocks have provided positive double digit returns Two Major Catalysts for DowFirst  the 11 month long trade dispute between the United States and China is heading toward a likely resolution  If the two countries reach an amicable solution  a major concern for global economic slowdown will be eliminated The International Monetary Fund has identified ongoing tariff related tussle between the United States and China as the primary factor for a perceived global economic slowdown in 2019  Several Dow stocks are sensitive to global economic conditions Second  the Fed is unlikely to change its benchmark interest rate structure in its two day long FOMC meeting which stared on Mar 19  On Jan 30  the Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds target rate unchanged at 2 25   2 50  Per Powell  the central bank will maintain its dovish monetary stance at least for the time being  On Feb 27  in his testimony before the House Committee  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank will not downsize its  4 trillion balance sheet this year Top

This has helped this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock surge close to 40  in the past three months compared with the S P 500 s growth of nearly 4   So  let s take a look at Coty s outcome and see if its

earnings of 24 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents  Also  revenues of  2 511 2 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 472 million  During the quarter  Coty s Luxury unit continued to deliver a strong show  primarily backed by solid brand performances  innovations and strong consumer demand Net revenues in the segment rose 7  to  1 017 5 million  while LFL revenues improved 10 8   driven by the inclusion of Burberry and growth in core portfolio  Further  the category witnessed growth in brands like Gucci  Tiffany  Chloe and Calvin Klein  Adjusted operating income in the category came in at  176 9 million  up 41  on the back of revenue growth and fixed cost reductions  Management is committed toward bolstering performance of the Luxury segment  which accounted for 40 5  of Coty s revenues in the second quarter Will Momentum Sustain Amid Barriers We note that Coty is boosting its end to end digital transformation efforts like e commerce across its divisions and region  The buyout of the leading online peer to peer social selling platform  Younique is a major evidence of Coty s focus on connecting with customers through e commerce  Further  the company is making progress with COVERGIRL brand through its Custom Blend app  Apart from these  the company s partnerships with major retailers like Tmall and JD com have also been lucrative  Needless to say  the company has been taking great strides in boosting e commerce sales  which was well reflected in Coty s second quarter performance  E commerce is expected to remain a vital performance driver in the forthcoming periods Also  the company has made several acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio  In this regard  the company concluded the buyout of the iconic Burberry brand in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  which largely fueled Coty s Luxury segment s performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  Additionally  Coty is progressing well with the integration of P G s   NYSE PG   Beauty Business  Simultaneously  the company is focusing on investing in brands and transforming digital capabilities to drive sustainable growth  The company is encouraged by the progress it made in the last two years and targets realizing nearly  750 million of synergies  driven by cost  procurement  supply chain and SG A savings  by 2020  These factors are likely to help the company reach its medium term target of high teen adjusted operating margin that was announced earlier However  we note that Coty has long been struggling with persistent sluggishness at its Consumer Beauty segment  which has been posting soft organic sales  The segment remained pressurized in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  wherein revenues plunged 15  to  967 8 million  and like for like  LFL  or organic sales declined 7 3   Results were hurt by supply chain disruptions  including customer penalties and increased promotions  Further  persistent softness in mass beauty categories in the United States and Europe dented results Nonetheless  management is working toward enhancing the performance of this segment along with mitigating supply chain issues  We

is disheartening Consequently  shares of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  have lost 29 4  in the past three months  much wider than the  s 3 7  decline Newell s sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing six quarters  including fourth quarter 2018  Sales also fell 6  year over year due to a 1 2  dip in core sales  and a decline in sales across all its segments  Unfortunately  the company continues to witness a decline in core sales since the start of 2019  which is worrisome  This might lead to the continuation of the dismal top line trend in the quarters ahead Notably  Newell estimates net sales of  1 66  1 70 billion for first quarter 2019  down from  3 billion realized a year ago  Core sales are projected to decline in the 2 4  range  Normalized earnings per share are envisioned in the band of 4 8 cents for the quarter versus 34 cents earned in the year ago quarter For 2019  management projects net sales to be  8 2  8 4 billion  down from  8 6 billion generated in

execution of the Accelerated Transformation Plan through market share gains  point of sale growth  innovation  e commerce improvement and cost saving plans  Notably  the key aspects of the Transformation Plan are restructuring the company into a global consumer product entity  valued at more than  9 billion In sync with this initiative  the company plans to offload its non core businesses that account for nearly 35  of the company s sales  utilize  10 billion after tax proceeds from divestitures and free cash flow to lower debt and make share repurchase  as well as retain its investment grade rating and an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019  targeting 30 35  payout ratio The execution of the Transformation Plan will lead to simplification of the company s operations  which is likely to reduce the company s number of manufacturing facilities by 66   distribution centers by 55   brands by 45   number of employees by 39  as well as lower above 30 ERP systems to two by the end of 2019  Management will also focus on right sizing the cost structure for anticipated smaller net sales  remove stranded corporate expenses and recover the synergies lost through the divestitures Further  it is imperative to mention that the company returned to gross margin growth in fourth quarter 2018  While gross margin expanded after seven straight quarters of contraction  the company recorded the second consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion  Gains from the company s productivity initiatives  pricing actions  and the revenue recognition standard provided a boost to gross margin  somewhat offset by higher inflationary pressures  Management anticipates this uptrend to continue in 2019 with normalized operating margin likely to expand 10 50 bps

94991,316506,PG,Pulp problems  Why shoppers may pay more for tissues  toilet paper,news,"By Richa Naidu and Martinne Geller
CHICAGO LONDON  Reuters    With toilet roll and tissues swept up in an escalating international trade row  it s not just Procter   Gamble s  N PG  Charmin that s going to get the squeeze 
Higher prices in the wake of possible tariffs would exacerbate what is already mounting pressure on consumer product company profits from soaring costs from pulp  a main ingredient in tissues  diapers and sanitary towels 
P G  the purveyor of Charmin toilet paper  Bounty towels and Puffs tissues  said on Tuesday that it had recently begun notifying retailers of a 5 percent average price increase on all three brands  The company said it had also started rolling out an average 4 percent price increase on Pampers diapers in North America 
Kimberly Clark  N KMB  raised prices on Kleenex and other tissue products around the world by 2 percent in the most recent quarter  while cutting its full year profit forecast 
Pulp  made from wood chips or recycled paper  is the only component in many tissue products  and is part of most diapers and pads  As many as 1 000 rolls of toilet paper can be made from the pulp of one eucalyptus tree   Graphic   
The price of hardwood pulp  an ingredient in tissues and toilet paper  has surged by about 60 percent since late 2016  according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council  which tracks prices based on global customs data  The price of softwood pulp  used in diapers and sanitary pads  jumped by 21 percent during that period 
 They have to raise prices   if you re paying 21 percent more for softwood pulp and 60 more for hardwood  you have to pass that price on to someone or you re just not going to be able to stay in business   said Arnaud Franco  senior analyst at the council 
Demand from China  the world s biggest and fastest growing consumer of pulp  is at the heart of the global shortfall  Pulp prices were at an all time low in 2016  weakened by China s slowing economy  A pick up in economic momentum in 2017 spurred higher demand for hard and softwood pulp  which the market could not meet due to a few large mills closing unexpectedly 
Additionally  in an effort to shed its role as the main recycler of the world s waste  China only imported 7 1 million tons of waste paper in the first half of 2018  down 52 percent from last year  Its ban on imported  unsorted mixed recycled paper came into effect December 31  leaving the Chinese in sudden need of large quantities of recovered pulp  used in packaging 
Trade battles are further complicating matters  Canada levied tariffs on  575 million worth of U S  tissue  toilet paper and paper towel exports earlier this year as part of its trade dispute with the United States 
Industry executives worry that tariffs from China could be next on the horizon  if the United States goes through with a threat to tax a further  200 billion of Chinese imports 
If China reacted in kind  and placed tariffs on a similar amount of U S  imports  that would cover about  2 4 billion worth of U S  paper and pulp exports to China  said Jake Handelsman  senior director of international trade at the American Forest   Paper Association 
 China is a very important market for our industry   said Handelsman   This is definitely not welcome news  
RIPPLE EFFECTS
Not only is pulp a core component in consumer products such as paper towels  but many companies also use packaging made with it  As costs to produce and ship paper goods climb  consumers may have to pay more for everyday items such as tissue or sanitary napkins 
U S  shoppers have already been spending more this year for many of these products  according to Nielsen data  analyzed by investment management firm Bernstein 
Ultimately  the price shoppers pay is up to retailers   which balance prices across a range of products   and may not always reflect costs passed along by the manufacturer  Retailers may hike prices for paper towels  for instance  to avoid raising them on diapers 
So  while P G said in June it has avoided raising prices on its products despite higher pulp costs  U S  consumers shopping at retail stores are still paying more this year for Charmin toilet paper  Bernstein s analysis of the data showed the average U S  retail price Charmin rose by 6 4 percent in the month ended mid July   Graphic   
Similarly  retail prices for Bounty paper towels began rising about six months ago  though retail prices for Puffs tissues have mostly fallen or been flat since the start of the year  P G declined to comment on the Nielsen data 
 Pulp is pervasive  When pulp moves  it s the proverbial golf ball through the garden hose that ripples through the industry s entire cost structure   AlixPartners consumer products consultant David Garfield said

95031,316546,PG,P G says  vast majority  of products in Canada to be hit by tariffs,news,"By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO  Reuters    Many Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  products sold in Canada   from Febreze candles to Gillette shaving foam   will be affected by retaliatory tariffs on U S  made goods after Canadian authorities rejected a request for exemptions  a P G spokesman said on Wednesday 
P G said Bounty paper towels  Charmin toilet tissue and Puffs facial tissue   made in a facility in Mehoopany  Pennsylvania   would be taxed  as would Cascade automatic dish washing detergent  Febreze aerosols  Pantene hair sprays and Olay body wash and more 
 The vast majority of our Canadian products are imported from the U S    P G spokesman Damon Jones told Reuters 
Jones said P G had unsuccessfully petitioned the International Trade Policy Division of Canada s Department of Finance for exemptions on its products 
A spokesman for Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau   whose department is responsible for granting such exemptions   was not immediately available for comment 
This month  Canada struck back at the Trump administration over U S  steel and aluminum tariffs  imposing taxes on C 16 6 billion of U S  packaged goods  steel and aluminum products 
It levied a 10 percent surtax on a wide range of consumer goods from soup and whiskey to hair care and manicure products  according to a list by the Department of Finance    
P G  the second largest packaged goods company in the world after Nestle SA  S NESN   said Canada accounted for about 3 percent of its total revenue of  65 1 billion last year  This amounts to just under  2 billion in sales from Canada  according to Reuters calculations 
Nestle had no immediate comment on how tariffs would affect its business  while Anglo Dutch rival  Unilever  Plc  L ULVR  declined to comment
Like other global consumer companies  P G is already under pressure to boost sales as consumers flock to fresher products and newer brands  Profits in the industry have also taken a hit from rising commodities and freight costs  and as big retailers keep prices down to compete with Amazon com  O AMZN

95059,316574,PG,Week Ahead  Stronger Corporate Guidance Could Boost U S  Stocks  USD Lower,opinion,"Earnings results plus guidance renews hopes on growth  offsetting some of IMF s outlook cut
Dow  NASDAQ  Russell all gain for fifth straight week
Oil remains flat  caught between conflicting forces

Though major U S  equity indices  including the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ Composite  all closed higher on Friday  boosted by President Donald Trump agreeing to end the partial government shutdown that had been in affect for 35 days  weekly market performance painted a much more nuanced and mixed picture  It appears corporate results may actually be buoying shares during this earnings season  though we maintain it s the better forward guidance that s doing the heavy lifting after last quarter s dismal forecasts 
Still  even if it s understandable and healthy for investors to take a breather in the wake of the equity market s bullish performance since Christmas  that doesn t explain the repeated breakdown in market structure  displayed by the total lack of coherence between defensive and cyclical stocks  As such we view these retreats as signaling a lack of leadership rather than an orderly correction 
Stronger Corporate Guidance Boosts Stocks
Without doubt  however  the bright spot on Friday was the president agreeing to open the government for three weeks as Congress continues to negotiate for border wall funds  It was a dramatic turnaround after five weeks of political infighting while furloughed government employees remained unpaid 
Nonetheless  we re convinced the longer term market driver will continue to be corporate guidance  Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  provides a case in point  Despite releasing modestly stronger than expected earnings when it reported Q2 2019 results on Wednesday  January 23  its stock climbed 4 87 percent as the firm raised its full year sales guidance 
This becomes more significant when recalling that the IMF reduced its global growth outlook for the next two years  citing the trade war as the central culprit for its assessment  As well  recent numbers out of China  and declining PMIs in Europe and Japan support that perspective 
Risk On Returns
U S  equities advanced for a second day on Friday  as positive earnings reports spurred risk on appetite  Treasuries dropped  and the dollar plunged 
The S P 500 Index opened the final day of trade last week 0 57 percent higher  extending the day s gains as much as 1 14 percent  before trimming that to  0 85 percent at the close  Materials outperformed   1 9 percent  and Industrials rose   1 27 percent  on speculation the arrival of a Chinese delegation in Washington this coming week may help pave the way for a trade deal 
Adding to overall optimism were reports that the Federal Reserve is weighing an end to reducing its balance sheet sooner than previously expected  a move that could ease regulatory measures of financial conditions  However  persistent quantitative easing weighed on Financial shares   0 81 percent   resulting in mediocre returns  Defensive sectors Utilities   1 37 percent  and Consumer Staples   0 4 percent  were the laggards during Friday s risk on day 
However  on a weekly basis  the SPX s performance was much choppier  Thursday  for example  trade was weak at the open  with stocks languishing till the final hour  At that point  volume rebounded as did prices  The previous day  Wednesday  was particularly volatile  with prices both falling and rising about 0 75 percent  to ultimately eke out gains of just 0 22 percent at the end of the day 
All told  the SPX dropped 0 22 percent for the week  the first weekly loss for the benchmark index in 2019  ending a four week winning streak  Real Estate shares outperformed   1 44 percent   as FINRA released data showing that shorts for the XLRE index decreased to 2 48 million shares from 2 97 million shares  down 16 56 percent  We assume that the Fed s recent dovish shift may be at the heart of a change in outlook for property investments  the post Christmas rally did the rest 
At the opposite end of the spectrum  Energy shares languished   1 43 percent  amid a volatile week for oil prices 
The more telling aspect  however  is that it was another week in which market structure broke down  with no apparent leadership path  providing an incoherent message to investors 

Technically  the S P 500 finished the week in the same place it ended last week  under the resistance we forecast before the post Christmas rally  coupled with a prediction of another rally  The resistance is formed by the downtrend line since the benchmark SPX s record peak in September  the consolidation between the September peak and the December selloff as well as the major MAs  after triggering a Death Cross during the December rout 
The mega cap Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0 75 percent on Friday  to turn around a week of losses  eking out a 0 09 percent boost which extended its rally for a fifth week  Technically  Friday s price action gave up much higher profits  as much as 1 24 percent  The retreat formed a shooting star 
The NASDAQ Composite jumped 1 29 percent Friday and 0 11 percent for the week  following the same pattern as the mega cap index  rallying for a fifth week as well 
However  small caps  activity remains a mystery  The Russell 2000 outperformed the peer U S  averages  leaping 1 3 percent  even amid the outlook for a resolution of the trade spat  We would expect small caps to fall in such an environment  as traders rotate out of domestic companies to large caps which would be able to continue raking in monster profits internationally once tariffs are eased  The fact that the Russell 2000 has outperformed repeatedly since the current round of trade talks puzzles us 
Perhaps the market message is that it does not believe there will be a breakthrough on U S  Sino trade relations  Could it be the trade tit for tat really isn t a headwind as the market narrative has been indicating 

Though yields jumped on Friday as risk appetite returned  they fell on a weekly basis  What s noteworthy is the technical location of the 10 year during this weekly decline 
While the rate seems to have found resistance at the uptrend line since July 2016  after falling below it  it found support above the highs of late 2016 and early 2017  This technical conflict may very well echo the similar tug of war taking place with the outlook for growth  which includes a multitude of factors the path to higher interest rates  normalizing the balance sheet  the U S China trade dispute  global growth or lack thereof  notably from China   Brexit  Trump s political stability  the dollar and oil 
In our view  the technical analysis shows that while the peak trough series remains intact  the fall below its uptrend line is a red flag  This may be the first sign of a massive H S top reversal since December 2016  where the left shoulder begins to form  Falling yields will occur if demand for Treasurys increases  generally a telltale sign of a bear market 

The dollar plunged on Friday as Treasurys were sold off  suggesting off shore investors repatriated capital to get back into risk assets  Technically  the price fell back below the neckline  reinforcing the outlook of a top 

Oil closed flat after a volatile week  The price retraced 0 2 percent  ending three straight weeks of gains  similar to stocks 
Crude slumped on renewed fears of a slowdown after the IMF cut its forecast  The API s weekly oil inventories report  released Wednesday  rose by 6 55 million barrels last week  which hit oil prices when they were already down  The OPEC  production cut agreement provided oil prices with support  which were further boosted by concerns about political events in Libya and Venezuela  a downtrend in U S  drilling and sanctions against Iran 
Technically  an advance for three straight weeks is very bullish  forming a Three White Soldiers pattern  The commodity s price needs all the bullish trends it can muster as it s failing to surpass levels for a second week 
In addition  after the December rout  the recent rally has still kept prices flat  As well  the November slide below the long term uptrend line since the February 2016 bottom called into question oil s ability to maintain the rising peak trough sequence  If prices fail to post a trough above  54 55 but fall below  42  we may be looking at a long term downtrend

95062,316577,PG,Procter   Gamble Stock Approaching Heavy Resistance,opinion,"The lower the price paid the higher the return  This is a simple truth all stock market investors should keep in mind all the time  Yet  few really do  Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   for example  is the same strong company it was last year and the year before 
Depending on the price you paid for its stock  however  it could have brought you tremendously different returns  Procter   Gamble stock was hovering near  95 a share in September  2017  Investors  who paid that price 16 months ago are just breaking even now 
But those  who joined the bulls near  71 in early May 2018  have earned a good 35  interest on their money in less than a year 
Procter   Gamble 20 Year Channel
Now  with PG stock approaching  97  it is time to take a look at the charts and see if it is still a good bet at the current price 

The weekly price chart of the stock shows PG has been moving within the parallel lines of a channel for the past 20 years  The upper line of the channel served as resistance in 1999  2007 and 2014  The share price bounced off the lower line in 2000  2009  2015 and most recently in May 2018 
Unfortunately for the bulls  Procter   Gamble is approaching the upper line of this huge channel once again  so it makes sense to prepare for another bearish reversal  Of course  we cannot rely on a single line for our analysis  The Elliott Wave principle applied to the 4 hour chart of PG stock below will add another layer of conviction 

The 4 hour chart of Procter   Gamble visualizes the rally from  70 73 for us  As shown  it has evolved into a five wave impulse pattern  whose wave  5  is still in progress 
The sub waves of wave  1  are perfectly visible  as well  The market has also obeyed the guideline of alternation since wave  2  is a sharp pullback  while wave  4  is a sideways correction in the form of an A B C expanding flat 
Major Resistance Approaching
The Elliott Wave theory states that a three wave correction follows every impulse  If this count is correct  wave  5  is about to lift Procter   Gamble stock to a new all time high near  105 before the bears show up  This price level coincides with the upper line of the price channel on the weekly chart  which further supports the bearish idea 
The bulls might enjoy a few more months of gains  but both the weekly and 4 hour charts indicate the rally from  70 73 is slowly coming to an end  In the next couple of years Procter   Gamble longs opened at the current price levels are likely to yield returns no different than of those opened in September 2017 
There is a difference between a good company and a good investment  Procter   Gamble is undoubtedly a great company  but it cannot grow fast enough to justify the high price of the stock  which makes it a bad investment right now

    Net sales of  1 473 million advanced 4  year over year but marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 479 million  The year over year improvement in the top line was driven by solid execution of pricing and cost saving plans  Additionally  the company s sales benefited from a contribution of 4 percentage points from the Nutranext acquisition  However  these gains were partly compensated by negative impact of 3 percentage points from foreign currency Gaining from recent price increases and cost savings  Clorox witnessed gross margin expansion of 70 bps to 43 7  in the fiscal second quarter  However  the aforementioned gains were partly negated by elevated commodity as well as manufacturing and logistics expenses This is unlike most of the company s peers  who are witnessing gross margin declines due to increased raw material and commodity costs  Notably  Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG   and Colgate Palmolive   NYSE CL   reported gross margin declines of 80 basis points  bps  and 100 bps  respectively  in the last reported quarter   Segmental DiscussionSales in the Cleaning segment improved 6  to  500 million  courtesy of strength across all businesses  Sales growth was led by the Home Care category  backed by strong innovation across the portfolio  This was followed by robust sales for the Professional Products business  with strong category growth The Household segment s sales declined 4  to  393 million mainly due to fall in Bags and Wraps  These categories were largely impacted by increased competition for trash bags and distribution losses in food storage products  and lower consumption of Charcoal  However  gains in Cat Litter  driven by great results for the Fresh Step Clean Paws innovation  partly mitigated the segment s top line decline Sales at the Lifestyle segment increased 25  to  335 million  mainly driven by the Nutranext buyout  Moreover  Dressings and Sauces  and Natural Personal Care divisions aided the segment s growth At the International segment  sales dropped 8  to  245 million as gains from higher prices were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts FinancialsClorox ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  162 million  and long term debt of  2 285 million  In the first half of fiscal 2019  the company generated  449 million of net cash from continuing operations FY19 Guidance IntactClorox reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2019  The company continues to project sales growth of 2 4  from the fiscal 2018 level  The improvement will be backed by innovations that are likely to deliver about 3 percentage points of additional sales  The top line is also likely to reflect the combined positive effect of the Nutranext acquisition and the Aplicare divestiture to the tune of 3 percentage points  However  top line growth guidance includes negative impact of about 3 percentage points from currency rates Gross margin is estimated to remain flat in fiscal 2019 as gains from higher prices and cost savings efforts are expected to be offset by increased costs and adverse foreign currency exchange rates  Advertising and sales promotion spending is anticipated to be roughly 10  of sales  Selling and administrative expenses are projected to be nearly 14  of sales  The company continues to envision effective tax rate of 23 24  Consequently  for fiscal 2019  management anticipates earnings per share of  6 20  6 40 from continuing operations  Notably  earnings projection includes nearly 8 12 cents from the Nutranext acquisition  It also includes negative impact of nearly 5 7 cents from tariffs  which are hurting certain business segments  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 is pegged at  6 32 A Better Ranked Stock in the Soaps and Cleaning Materials IndustryChurch   Dwight Co  Inc    NYSE CHD   has an impressive long term earnings growth rate of 10 2  and it currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/clorox-clx-earnings-surpass-estimates-in-q2-sales-miss-200383306,200383306

95065,316580,PG,Carrefour  Tesco deal to squeeze suppliers  big and small,news,"By Dominique Vidalon and James Davey PARIS LONDON  Reuters    A deal between  Carrefour   PA CARR  and  Tesco   L TSCO  to team up on global purchasing will help them not only cut prices but also expand their own label ranges  tightening a squeeze on major brand producers such as Nestle and Kraft Heinz  The Carrefour Tesco alliance will reset relationships with global suppliers like  Unilever   L ULVR   Nestle  S NESN  and Procter   Gamble  N PG   at a time when they are already battling sluggish demand and start up rivals  In a further blow to major consumer goods firms  the pair will also jointly source own brand products  sales of which are growing rapidly in Europe due to the expansion of discounters like Aldi and Lidl which mostly stock private label goods   Buying alliances have a detrimental effect on the whole food supply chain   said Mella Frewen  director general of FoodDrinkEurope  an industry lobby group  However  the alliance could also allow smaller suppliers that only supply one of the retailers to double their business   They could be into a massive opportunity for which they might very well drop their prices and compete   said David Sables  CEO of Sentinel Management Consultants  which coaches suppliers on how to negotiate with big supermarket groups  Sales growth at Nestle  Procter   Gamble and Unilever has been driven almost entirely by shifting more goods this year  rather than price rises given a tough retail environment  In the latest salvo from an activist investor seeking to shake up the sector  Third Point on Sunday recommended a series of steps to boost earnings at Nestle  whose brands include KitKat chocolates and Thomy sauces  Faced with consumers shifting towards healthier food and independent brands  manufacturers like Nestle are responding by trying to sell more premium  higher priced items  But retailers are reluctant to put up prices as they face their own battle with discount groups and online players like internet giant Amazon  O AMZN    Top brands have long taken a hard line in negotiations with retailers  assuming that stores are loathe to remove consumers  favourite products from their shelves   That approach backfired for Nestle earlier this year when a buying group representing six European retailers flexed its muscles with the Swiss group  pulling some of its products for months during a pricing row that was only settled in May  The Carrefour Tesco alliance is just the latest purchasing agreement struck by major European retailers in recent years  German retailer Metro  DE B4B  agreed a similar partnership with Auchan  Casino and Schiever of France last week  The deals compound pressure on suppliers after Britain s second ranked Sainsbury s  L SBRY  agreed to buy Wal Mart owned  N WMT  Asda  the number three player  PRIVATE LABEL SALES RISING FAST Tesco CEO Dave Lewis  a former Unilever executive  said branded giants were being outflanked by start ups and retailers when it comes to developing new products   For a lot of branded manufacturers     agility is not always there and so they are getting out innovated by a lot of small players   Lewis said last week  While about half of Tesco s sales already comes from private label goods  which tend to be more profitable for retailers than branded ones  the figure is only about a quarter at Carrefour  The French firm aims to raise that to a third by 2022  while it is expected to cut the branded goods it offers by 20 percent  Retailers creating their own products is seen as a major challenge by a quarter of top executives at consumer goods firms  according to a recent survey by consultants KPMG  Private label goods grew to account for more than 31 percent of sales in the European Union in 2016  and are set to keep growing  according to Nielsen  eroding demand for big brands  As Lewis has sought to rebuild trust in the British retailer since an accounting scandal in 2014  Tesco has operated in a more collaborative way with suppliers  in contrast to a confrontational approach at Carrefour  Sables said   Suppliers to Carrefour might think if any of Tesco s attitude in dealing with suppliers rubs off on Carrefour   that s a positive thing   he said  adding Tesco could recommend its private label suppliers to Carrefour and vice versa  The alliance could impact companies like Biscuit International  a leading producer of own label sweet biscuits owned by private equity firm Qualium Investissement  according to Yves Marin  an associate at Bartle Business Consulting  The deal could take time to take effect as private label contracts run for one to two years and suppliers will have to cross check prices of products sold by Tesco and Carrefour  Marin added  POWER SHIFT  In another sign of the shifting balance of power towards retailers  British supermarkets are taking longer to pay their suppliers  according to Duncan Swift  who runs the food advisory group at business consultancy Moore Stephens   The swelling  piggy bank  of supplier monies held by supermarkets exacerbates the risk of them making unwarranted deductions which causes suppliers financial distress   he said  Swift said retailers had to be careful about how they implement purchasing alliances so they do not ring alarm bells with competition authorities  adding they do this by not sharing too much information  Ian Wright  chief executive of Britain s Food and Drink Federation  said the Tesco Carrefour deal would increase concerns about buyer power stoked by the Sainsbury Asda merger and the risks they impose on suppliers  mostly smaller firms   It is imperative that these important changes to retailer supplier market dynamics are properly examined by the competition authorities   in the round   he said   Britain s Competition and Markets Authorities is already examining the merger of  Sainsbury  and Asda  which are expected to argue their deal is justified given the shake up of the market due to the rise of the discounters and Amazon  Discounters now account for 22 percent of sales of fast moving consumer goods in Europe  up from 17 percent a decade ago  according to data analytics firm Nielsen  Analysts at Fitch Ratings do not expect the Tesco Carrefour partnership to be subject to competition scrutiny as they have hardly any geographic overlap  although regulators could start paying more attention if more alliances emerge  David McCarthy  HSBC head of consumer retail research  said buying alliances have not worked well in the past as retailers have failed to secure standardised prices  But he said Tesco and Carrefour now have a strong incentive to succeed  
 New ways of doing business are needed to deal with exogenous threats such as Amazon and discounter expansion   he said   What is different this time is both the desire and need for the deal to work  ",2018-07-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/carrefour-tesco-deal-to-squeeze-suppliers-big-and-small-1516929,1516929

95097,316612,PG,European Central Bank To Keep Policy Unchanged As Uncertainty Rises,opinion,"The US dollar is weaker against major pairs on Wednesday  The prolonged government shutdown and lack of clarity on trade talks put downward pressure on the greenback while investors sought higher yields as risk appetite was back in action  The US dollar and the Japanese yen fell as a result of the risk on factor  The European Central Bank  ECB  will publish its main refinancing rate at 7 45 am EST  with no changes expected  the major event of the day will be the press conference by President Mario Draghi at 8 30 am EST  where investors can get some insights into how much the events of the past month and a half have changed the view on European monetary policy 
ECB to maintain monetary policy
European PMIs to keep supporting currency
Davos has not brought US China trade closer
Euro Rises Ahead of ECB Despite Dovish Outlook
The EUR USD rose on Wednesday as the government shutdown continues  putting pressure on the greenback  The news out of Europe has been mixed with weaker growth and inflation  but on the bright side there has been some progress on the Brexit talks  The single currency is trading at 1 1383 ahead of Mario Draghi s press conference  The challenge for the central banker will be on what to say  and more importantly given the miscommunication in the past  how he delivers 

The ECB was expected to hike rates in the fall of 2019  but that could now be an optimistic forecast  With no updated projections the only outlook would be the one Draghi gives the market so he needs to be careful to avoid spooking already sensitive investors 
European growth remains elusive  and harder to achieve in a protectionist environment  The statements out of Davos have said as much  but real change will not happen abroad but when those leaders return home to do the hard work  Draghi will not enjoy the spotlight on Thursday as he has little good news for the market  and will work on how to best deliver the bad news 
Sterling surged 0 86 percent as Labour could be onboard with passing legislation to delay Brexit  Extending the fast approaching March 29 deadline and minimizing the probability of a no deal exit have been positive for the currency  The pound will continue to be sensitive to developments in parliament as Theresa May s government struggles to put together a proposal that will satisfy members of parliament as well as be acceptable by the European Union 
OIL   Iran Sanction Loophole Offset by Venezuela Sanctions
Crude prices fell on Wednesday as global growth expectations continue to decline with no signs of a China US tariff reduction  President Donald Trump mentioned that trade talks are going well  but then said that if a deal is not reached tariffs could be even higher  Global energy demand has been soft as uncertainty remains in the minds of investors 
President Trump officially recognized the leader of the Venezuelan opposition as the interim president  Economic and diplomatic pressure will be applied if Juan Guaido is not recognized  President Maduro has retaliated by giving US diplomats in Venezuela 72 hours to exit the country 
Sanctions on oil producing countries increase the price of crude  as the market has seen after the sanctions on Iran  Earlier in the session part of the weakness in oil prices was that the EU was seeking a way to circumvent US sanctions  Venezuelan exports to the United States have declined and American refiners will be impacted as they scramble to find suitable replacements in the short term  driving prices of heavier grades higher 
GOLD   Yellow Metal Flat as Investors Seek Riskier Assets
Gold fell slightly by 0 1 percent on Wednesday  The yellow metal was sold as investors flocked to equities  Dollar weakness and no deal Brexit headlines appreciated gold  but the move did not last as Labour threw its support behind an extension of Article 50 
Geopolitical risk events have kept gold in a tight but volatile range  Today investors favoured yield over safety as equity markets shrugged off global growth slowdown fears  the sentiment is subject to change as the ECB publishes its monetary policy statement and President Draghi addresses the financial press 
STOCKS  Blue Chips in Charge as Markets Shrug Off Global Growth Downgrade
Strong earnings from IBM  NYSE IBM  and Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  guided US stock markets higher  Equities followed blue chip performance despite a gloomy growth outlook as the US and China remain far apart in their upcoming trade talks  The partial shutdown of the US government continues and the White House Economic adviser said on Wednesday that it could bring down quarterly growth to zero 
The ECB is not expected to make any changes to its monetary policy on Thursday  but all eyes will be on President Mario Draghi  A dovish outlook could come up during the press conference and spark a sell off if the view is more pessimistic than usual

95098,316613,PG,Markets Struggle For Direction Amid Conflicting Data,opinion,"After a sharp recovery from their December lows  global equity markets are struggling for direction this week  If you re in the bullish camp  the U S  earning season may support your views  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 171 points yesterday driven by surprise positive earnings from United Technologies  NYSE UTX   IBM  NYSE IBM   and Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   Whether this trend of positive surprises will continue remains in question  but it s likely that the Tech sector  which makes up more than a quarter of the S P 500 market cap  will dictate the fate of U S  equities 
If you are on the other side of the camp  there is a lot of news supporting bearish views  Slowing global economic growth  the unresolved U S  China trade conflict  the U S  government shutdown  and Brexit drama are all sources of uncertainty dragging at sentiment 
Eventually one camp will win  but there isn t sufficient momentum on either side  This will likely lead markets to continue to be driven by daily news flows until one factor dominates  However  expect to see further moves of more than 1  up or down in the near future 
ECB Meeting  The European Central Bank meets today for what is likely to be the week s most significant risk event  Most of last year s focus was on how to shift from monetary easing to tightening  Back then it was expected that the European economy would be in better shape in the following years  However  the latest updates from the IMF shows that Europe may be under more pressure than the rest of the world  Recent economic data confirm such views with PMI s  sentiment surveys  inflation  and other wide sets of economic figures pointing south  Will ECB President Mario Draghi acknowledge the darkening clouds today  Moreover  what tools the central bank will use to offset the slowdown will determine the euro s direction  Lowering growth and inflation projections may provide a sell signal to the Euro  but Draghi s speech today may have even more impact on the single currency 
Sterling soars after breaking above 1 30 Sterling saw its best daily performance since December 12 on Wednesday  rising against the dollar  and has been the best performing major currency so far in 2019  The surge in the pound was driven by beliefs that a no deal Brexit will eventually be avoided and the chances of extending Article 50 look more likely  Although extending Article 50 doesn t mean a final solution to Brexit has been found  any news delaying the process and supporting avoiding a hard Brexit will be supportive of the pound  If no negative surprises materialize  the currency may find further support on technical buying after GBP USD broke above the 200 day moving average

95101,316616,PG,Facebook expands offerings for video creators to cash in on views,news,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters     Facebook Inc   O FB  launched a matchmaking system Tuesday to cultivate partnerships between advertisers and video creators as the world s largest social media company tries to quickly parallel the variety of commercial opportunities offered by its video rival YouTube 
Some advertisers have tested the Brand Collabs Manager  which identifies video makers that may be good fits for product placement or endorsement deals 
Facebook also said it was allowing more content creators to run ad breaks in longer videos  and offer subscriptions for  4 99 a month to fans  Subscribers receive perks  such as exclusive behind the scenes footage 
Facebook is not keeping a cut of partnerships or subscriptions during testing  and it is uncertain about eventual fees  company Vice President Fidji Simo told Reuters in an interview last week 
The company has long been wary of polluting newer experiences  such as video  with ads and paid options  But it has deployed the moneymaking features in recent months after a year in which many videomakers saw their YouTube earnings clipped 
YouTube  part of Alphabet Inc s  O GOOGL  Google  tightened revenue sharing policies last year after advertisers including Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  expressed concern about automated ad buying tools that had turned them into sponsors of unflattering content 
Both Facebook and YouTube are racing to attract high quality content  which would help them win over the  200 billion spent annually on TV advertising globally 
Facebook s appeal to video makers has been limited by the few opportunities they have had to turn viewership on the service into revenue  For instance  YouTube added a partnership match tool in 2016 via acquisition 
YouTube plans to update its commercialization options later this week as 30 000 members of the online video industry  including fans  gather for the VidCon festival in Anaheim  California beginning Wednesday 
Simo acknowledged that video makers want even more alternatives  Facebook already is testing how to promote new videos as  live events  that could become big destinations for advertising  she said 
Many creators have asked for a tool to sell merchandise they develop to fans  Simo said  For now  Simo said the company plans to do a  small test  this year of selling third party products featured in videos

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Procter   Gamble in Focus
Procter   Gamble  PG  is headquartered in Cincinnati  and is in the Consumer Staples sector  The stock has seen a price change of  0 54  since the start of the year  The world s largest consumer products maker is paying out a dividend of  0 72 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 14  compared to the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry s yield of 2 34  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 87 is up 3  from last year  Procter   Gamble has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 2 80   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  P G s current payout ratio is 68   meaning it paid out 68  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  PG expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 42 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 74  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PG is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/procter--gamble-pg-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200377624,200377624

95148,316663,PG,Procter   Gamble  PG  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Procter   Gamble in Focus
Procter   Gamble  PG  is headquartered in Cincinnati  and is in the Consumer Staples sector  The stock has seen a price change of  1 39  since the start of the year  The world s largest consumer products maker is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 72 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 16   This compares to the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry s yield of 2 38  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 2  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 87 is up 3  from last year  Procter   Gamble has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 2 99   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  P G s current payout ratio is 68   meaning it paid out 68  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  PG expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 41 per share  with earnings expected to increase 4 50  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PG is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/procter--gamble-pg-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200372945,200372945

95181,316696,PG,What FedEx s Plunge Means For Portfolio Allocation,opinion,"For FedEx  NYSE FDX  a slowdown in global growth isn t a possibility  It s already here 
While announcing its fiscal second quarter earnings this week  the company drastically slashed its fiscal 2019 profit forecast  just three months after the package delivery company had raised it  Adjusted earnings in 2019 will be no more than  16 60 a share  FedEx said in a statement Tuesday  That was below the lowest analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg 

FedEx s earnings  which come almost a month earlier than the fourth quarter numbers of the majority of US companies  generally attract close attention because the delivery business is a proxy for the global economy and could give early warnings on trade and business investment issues 
Unfortunately  the global shipper didn t have good news for investors 
CEO Fred Smith said on the conference call 

 When you have a change that comes on you as fast as this did  it s hard to react to it 
Our international business  especially in Europe  weakened significantly since we last talked with you  

FedEx s view on global growth and its impact on business is one of the clearest admissions by any global company that we have seen the peak of global expansion and the best is behind us 
Investors took the gloomy prediction seriously  sending FedEx shares tumbling the most in a decade  During the past three months  FedEx shares are down about 35 percent more than twice the decline in the benchmark S P 500  which is down about 15 5  
FedEx s Grim View Means Get Defensive
The stock s underperformance and the company s grim outlook are a warning for investors that they should avoid buying cyclical growth stocks tied to global growth  as they might see further erosion in values in the first quarter of 2019 
At FedEx  international revenue fell short of company expectations in the three months ended Nov  30  In Asia  FedEx cited  continued tariff and trade concerns  as a drag  In Europe  it pointed to deterioration in Germany and Italy  as well as uncertainty in the UK over the country s negotiations to leave the European Union 
To deal with sudden changes in the economic environment  the delivery company plans to start a voluntary buyout program for its US and international workers  FedEx employs more than 450 000 people globally 
The company said the vast majority of its buyout offers will be made to workers at the FedEx Express unit  which has 227 000 employees  and at FedEx Services  which provides back office functions and employs another 30 000 people 
FedEx s outlook on global trade and the economy cements our view that investors should increase the number of defensive stocks in their portfolios  These stocks are better positioned to withstand the economic slowdown  or even a recession 
That means picking stocks from the basic industries  such as utilities  telecom operators and top healthcare companies  These defensive areas of the market have a long track record of doing better in times of uncertainty while offering steadily growing dividends 
Bottom Line
Companies such as Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   Verizon  NYSE VZ  and Merck  NYSE MRK  are among the best defensive bets for long term investors in this market downturn  These companies could outperform the broader market if we re in for a deep correction and a possible recession in 2019  Diversifying your portfolio with defensive stocks that pay regularly growing dividends is always a good strategy ",2018-12-21,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-fedexs-plunge-means-for-portfolio-allocation-200369992,200369992

You can see Procter   Gamble s shares outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry in the past three months  gaining  8  vs  1 6   The Zacks analyst thinks that this can be attributed to the company s robust earnings history  having outpaced estimates for 14 straight quarters when it reported first quarter fiscal 2019 Moreover  earnings grew year over year  Also  sales beat estimates  though it remained flat due to adverse currency fluctuations   which acted as a major deterrent in the first quarter and is likely to remain a concern in the second quarter  The company has been witnessing strained margins for last few quarters due to higher commodity and shipping costs  adverse currency  increased business investments and aggressive pricing from private label products Soft baby care business is also a concern  Nonetheless  the company is focused on improving productivity and cost savings to boost margins  Its focus on product improvement  packaging and marketing initiatives is encouraging  You can   Shares of Oracle have underperformed the Zacks Computer Software industry in the past year  losing  2 4  vs   12 2   Oracle is one of the largest enterprise grade database  middleware and application software providers  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is benefiting from strong adoption of its cloud based solutions  comprising Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM  among others Partnerships with the likes of Accenture  NYSE ACN  are helping the company rapidly expand its cloud base clientele  Also  anticipated strong demand for the next generation autonomous database supported by machine learning will boost competitive position against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS  Nonetheless  stiff competition in the cloud market from dominant players is anticipated to limit margin expansion  Further  lower hardware volumes are anticipated to hurt top line growth consequently keeping margins under pressure  Additionally  integration risks from buyouts remain a concern  You can   United Parcel Service s shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year  losing  20 8  vs   27 1   United Parcel Service has been benefitting from strong e commerce growth  The company anticipates cross border e commerce volume to grow by 28  over the next three years The company s transformation plan  unveiled in September 2018  is aimed at boosting its bottom line  Approval of the deal by its freight workers is an added positive  The Zacks analyst is also impressed by UPS  efforts to reward its shareholders UPS  bullish full year forecast on free cash flow supports the possibility of a dividend hike in the near future  However  the company s high capital expenditures are a cause for concern  UPS spent  4 5 billion as capital expenditure in the first nine months of 2018 Trade war related tensions and high debts pose further challenges to the company  In a year s time  the UPS stock has declined more than 20   You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include FedEx and AstraZeneca Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on

95183,316698,PG,Why P G  PG  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Procter   Gamble  PG   which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry 
This world s largest consumer products maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 60  
For the last reported quarter  P G came out with earnings of  1 12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 09 per share  representing a surprise of 2 75   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 90 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 94 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 44  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for P G lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
P G currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 50   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 22  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pg-pg-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200370718,200370718
95184,316699,PG,5 Consumer Staples Stocks That Escaped 2018 Sector Shortfall,opinion,The year 2018 hasn t been that rosy for the Zacks  sector  Markedly  the space has witnessed a shortfall of close to 18  so far this year  wider than the S P 500 s decline of almost 8   Also  troubles over several consumer staple players have placed the sector among the bottom 19   ranked 13  of the 16 Zacks sectors Well  the consumer staples universe is largely plagued by escalated commodity and transportation costs  with the latter bearing the brunt of lower driver availability  This  in turn  has raised freight costs for many players  Evidently  a lot of consumer staple companies  including food  beverage  cosmetic as well as cleaning material companies have been grappling with escalating input costs  These costs  along with rising marketing and advertising expenses keep margins under pressure Other than this  quite a few players are struggling with stiff competition  which has created significant pricing pressure  compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities  These factors again pose major threats to margins  which have been plateaued for quite some time now  Moreover  significant exposure to international regions  especially emerging markets  keeps members of the consumer staples sector exposed to volatile currency movements  Also  tariff related risks stemming from trade war with China remain a concern Are There Any Bright Spots Still Despite the barriers in the sector  there are some companies that have managed to stay strong on the back of solid pricing initiatives  focus on innovation  product launches and diversification  Also  benefits from acquisitions  divestitures and alliances have helped many companies refine their portfolio  Additionally  many firms are gaining from efforts to augment organic and natural offerings in response to rising health consciousness  To top these  stringent cost containment efforts and efficient productivity programs have helped a host of consumer staple players stand apart Clearly  there s always some light at the end of the tunnel  and on that note  we handpicked some bright spots in the

 product innovations  cost containment measures and efficient marketing initiatives  Notably  this leading manufacturer and distributor of spices and seasonings carries a long term growth rate of 9  and has a market cap of  18 2 billion Investors can also bet on The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG    While the consumer products biggie has returned just 2 5  this year  it fares much better than the sector  Also  the Ohio based company  with a market cap of  222 6 billion holds immense potential   as evident from its sturdy savings and productivity enhancement efforts  Procter   Gamble  which

NASDAQ OLLI   and Lamb Weston Holdings  Inc    NYSE LW   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Consumer Staples Stocks that Escaped the 2018 Sector ShortfallThe year 2018 hasn t been that rosy for the Zacks  sector  Markedly  the space has witnessed a shortfall of close to 18  so far this year  wider than the S P 500 s decline of almost 8   Also  troubles over several consumer staple players have placed the sector among the bottom 19   ranked 13  of the 16 Zacks sectors Well  the consumer staples universe is largely plagued by escalated commodity and transportation costs  with the latter bearing the brunt of lower driver availability  This  in turn  has raised freight costs for many players  Evidently  a lot of consumer staple companies  including food  beverage  cosmetic as well as cleaning material companies have been grappling with escalating input costs  These costs  along with rising marketing and advertising expenses keep margins under pressure Other than this  quite a few players are struggling with stiff competition  which has created significant pricing pressure  compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities  These factors again pose major threats to margins  which have been plateaued for quite some time now  Moreover  significant exposure to international regions  especially emerging markets  keeps members of the consumer staples sector exposed to volatile currency movements  Also  tariff related risks stemming from trade war with China remain a concern Are There Any Bright Spots Still Despite the barriers in the sector  there are some companies that have managed to stay strong on the back of solid pricing initiatives  focus on innovation  product launches and diversification  Also  benefits from acquisitions  divestitures and alliances have helped many companies refine their portfolio  Additionally  many firms are gaining from efforts to augment organic and natural offerings in response to rising health consciousness  To top these  stringent cost containment efforts and efficient productivity programs have helped a host of consumer staple players stand apart Clearly  there s always some light at the end of the tunnel  and on that note  we handpicked some bright spots in the consumer staples space  which is popular as a defensive zone among investors  Markedly  these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  each

seasonings carries a long term growth rate of 9  and has a market cap of  18 2 billion Investors can also bet on The Procter   Gamble Company  While the consumer products biggie has returned just 2 5  this year  it fares much better than the sector  Also  the Ohio based company  with a market cap of  222 6 billion holds immense potential   as evident from its sturdy savings and productivity

95214,316729,PG,Is Franklin LibertyQ U S  Equity ETF  FLQL  A Strong ETF Right Now ,opinion,"The Franklin LibertyQ U S  Equity ETF  FLQL  made its debut on 04 26 2017  and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Style Box   Large Cap Blend category of the market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes  which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole  have traditionally dominated the ETF industry 
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency 
If you re the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection  then smart beta funds are your best choice  this fund class is known for tracking non cap weighted strategies 
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  non cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such 
Methodologies like equal weighting  one of the simplest options out there  fundamental weighting  and volatility momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space  but not all of them can deliver superior returns 
Fund Sponsor   Index
Managed by Franklin Templeton Investments  FLQL has amassed assets over  396 50 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box   Large Cap Blend  This particular fund  before fees and expenses  seeks to match the performance of the LibertyQ US Large Cap Equity Index 
The U S  Large Cap Underlying Index seeks to achieve a lower level of risk and higher risk adjusted performance than the Russell 1000 Index over the long term by applying a multi factor selection process  which is designed to select equity securities from the Russell 1000 Index that have favorable exposure to four investment style factors quality  value  momentum and low volatility 
Cost   Other Expenses
When considering an ETF s total return  expense ratios are an important factor  And  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal 
Annual operating expenses for FLQL are 0 25   which makes it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 1 64  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  a deep look into a fund s holdings is a valuable exercise  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
FLQL s heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector  which is about 19 70  of the portfolio  Its Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Eli Lilly   Co  LLY  accounts for about 1 34  of total assets  followed by Procter   Gamble Co the  PG  and Pfizer Inc  PFE  
The top 10 holdings account for about 12 04  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 2 61  and was up about 3 76  so far this year and in the past one year  as of 12 13 2018   respectively  FLQL has traded between  27 88 and  31 54 during this last 52 week period 
FLQL has a beta of 0 80 and standard deviation of 10 74  for the trailing three year period  With about 249 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
Franklin LibertyQ U S  Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box   Large Cap Blend segment of the market  However  there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider 
IShares Core S P 500 ETF  IVV  tracks S P 500 Index and the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  tracks S P 500 Index  IShares Core S P 500 ETF has  154 80 B in assets  SPDR S P 500 ETF has  250 66 B  IVV has an expense ratio of 0 04  and SPY charges 0 09  
Investors looking for cheaper and lower risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box   Large Cap Blend

95215,316730,PG,Hate Volatility  Then Procter   Gamble Is Just The Ticket,opinion,"Over the past decade it was difficult to find any investors who bragged about buying into companies which were too big  too slow and too cautious when it came to delivering growth  Rather  shares of young technology giants were all the rage as they powered an unprecedented US bull market run 
But when uncertainty rules and it s difficult to know what lies ahead  a different sort of investing perspective is required  Highly cyclical growth stocks suffer the most in this environment  while slow moving consumer staple stocks outperform 

Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   the multinational consumer staple manufacturer  is a stock we recommend when volatility drives markets and investors would prefer slow but steady capital growth with regular dividend payments  Since we first recommended P G to readers on May 28  its shares have surged 29   The stock is now trading at  92 77  close to its 52 week high of  96 89 
During the past six months  when volatility spiked in financial markets and the sell off in high growth  cyclical stocks accelerated  shares of Procter   Gamble have clearly been a top choice for investors in search of stability  The stock s outperformance is also a good reminder that it s prudent to always balance one s portfolio by including some solid income stocks that are generally immune to market gyrations and perform better during times of distress 
Turnaround Delivering Results
If you re ready to make this bet  even with shares trading just 4  below their 52 week high  the timing still seems right to acquire the stock of the world s largest consumer product company on signs that its turnaround strategy has started to pay off  P G owns some of the world s best known consumer brands  including Bounty paper towels  Gillette razors  and Tide laundry detergent 
This portfolio of leading businesses generated more than  65 billion in annual sales last year and 22  in core operating margins  which is among the highest in the industry  Given their dominant position  the biggest challenge P G has faced was reversing the trend of slowing sales growth amid changing consumer preferences 
Over the past five years  as part of its turnaround strategy  Procter and Gamble pruned its brand roster from 175 to 65  focusing on the 10 product categories where the margins are highest  As part of that process  the company also eliminated 34 000 jobs through a combination of brand sales and buyouts  as well as plant closures slashing more than  10 billion in corporate costs 
But investors  led by billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz  want the company s turnaround efforts to be even more aggressive  Chief Executive Officer David Taylor has responded by buying new businesses and introducing greener versions of existing products such as the company s new Pampers Pure Protection line  In the most recent quarterly results  P G showed its plan is working 
The company s organic growth in Q1  which exclude items like acquisitions and currency effects  rose 4   P G said in October  more than double the gain projected by analysts  Procter   Gamble s unexpectedly strong performance in the quarter was fueled by its growth in US markets  which was led by brands such as Olay and the new SK II luxury skin cream  already popular in Asia 
The momentum in P G s turnaround is prompting some bears to change their view on the stock with some bullish calls from top investment banks  Morgan Stanley analysts last week upgraded the consumer group to overweight from equal weight and boosted their price target on the stock by  15 to to  106 a share 
In a note to clients the bank s analyst wrote 

 Broad based market share momentum  an improving gross margin outlook  and greater earnings achievability are not adequately reflected in relative valuation verses peers  

P G is valued at 25 times trailing twelve month earnings  versus Colgate Palmolive s  NYSE CL  multiple of 26 
Bottom Line
Procter   Gamble is one of the largest dividend payers in the sector  with a payout track record going back to the past century  The maker of Dawn dish soap and Crest toothpaste has hiked its dividend for 61 consecutive years  and over the past 127 years it never stopped paying dividends no matter economic conditions 
With a current dividend yield of just a hair under 3   P G stock is the perfect candidate for long term  buy and hold investors  The company s growth is accelerating after a number of sluggish years and we believe shares still have room to run ",2018-12-18,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hate-volatility-then-this-consumer-staple-stock-is-just-the-ticket-200368966,200368966
95216,316731,PG,Why Procter   Gamble  PG  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Procter   Gamble in Focus
Procter   Gamble  PG  is headquartered in Cincinnati  and is in the Consumer Staples sector  The stock has seen a price change of 0 66  since the start of the year  The world s largest consumer products maker is paying out a dividend of  0 72 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 1  compared to the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry s yield of 2 28  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 1  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 87 is up 3  from last year  Procter   Gamble has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 2 99   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  P G s current payout ratio is 68   meaning it paid out 68  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PG for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  4 41 per share  with earnings expected to increase 4 50  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PG is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2018-12-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-procter--gamble-pg-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200369573,200369573

this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock can witness a turnaround Factors Acting as Hurdles Coty has been grappling with persistent sluggishness at its Consumer Beauty segment  which has been posting soft organic sales for the past few quarters  The segment remained pressurized in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  wherein revenues at this unit plunged 20 6  to  828 8 million and like for like  LFL  or organic sales declined 14   Results were hurt by supply chain disruptions  including customer penalties and increased promotions  These factors led to a sequential decline in the segment Also  underlying weakness owing to persistent softness in mass beauty categories in United States and Europe dented results  Additionally  softness in certain developed markets  stiff competition and challenges associated with certain brands were deterrents  Though management is working toward enhancing this segment  full recovery is likely to take time  Evidently  Consumer Beauty segment LFL revenues are expected to fall at a high single digit rate in the second quarter In fact  Coty has been struggling with supply chain hurdles for a while now  These headwinds lingered in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  wherein the company s LFL revenues fell 7 7  mainly on account of supply chain hurdles  which hit LFL revenue growth by nearly 5   The company s supply chain woes included disruptions related to warehouse and planning center consolidation  in Europe and United States   This had an adverse effect on all three business units  Further  shortages from various external suppliers marred the Luxury unit that was also largely hurt by Hurricane Florence  Moreover  gross margin contracted 120 basis points due to supply chain hurdles and escalated freight costs in the Consumer Beauty and Luxury divisions Will the Stock Revive Coty s Luxury and Professional beauty segments have been performing impressively for quite some time now  primarily backed by solid brand performances  innovations and strong consumer demand  Though revenues in these segments were also hurt by supply chain headwinds to some extent in the first quarter  the units continued to witness underlying growth  In the Luxury segment  underlying growth was backed by strength in Gucci  Tiffany   NYSE TIF    Chloe and MiuMiu brands  The company also witnessed sturdy results from Burberry  which will form part of Coty s LFL base in the second quarter  Also  contributions from ghd drove underlying performance  Management plans to continue bolstering performances of the Luxury and Professional beauty segments  by tapping the opportunities provided by brands in these categories Moreover  Coty is on course to turn around its operations  as it progresses with the integration of P G s   NYSE PG   Beauty Business  The company is on track with building and streamlining back office operations  upgrading systems  optimizing manufacturing and logistics  and simplifying overall operations  Simultaneously  the company is focused on investing in brands and transforming digital capabilities to drive sustainable growth  The company is encouraged by the progress it has made in the last two years  Moreover  Coty targets to realize nearly  750 million of synergies  driven by cost  procurement  supply chain and SG A savings by 2020 In fact  in fiscal 2018  Coty released synergies worth  225 million  The company is now focusing on delivering the remaining synergies  which are expected to drive operating income  The company also focuses on returning the business to LFL revenue growth  In fact  management expects Luxury and Professional beauty segments to revert to year over year LFL revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 itself  These factors alongside the company s stringent focus on cost management are likely to help the company reach its medium term target of high teen adjusted operating margin announced earlier Coty is on track to mitigate supply chain issues that are expected to be fully offset only by the third quarter of fiscal 2019  Thus  it remains to be seen if Coty s upsides can help the stock revive  Meanwhile  investors can

95241,316756,PG,Is Franklin LibertyQ U S  Equity ETF  FLQL  A Hot ETF Right Now ,opinion,"Making its debut on 04 26 2017  smart beta exchange traded fund Franklin LibertyQ U S  Equity ETF  FLQL  provides investors broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market  or a specific segment of the market  and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy 
A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency  market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns 
However  some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection  and choose a different type of fund that tracks non cap weighted strategies  smart beta 
Non cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  which is based on specific fundamental characteristics  or a mix of other such characteristics 
Even though this space provides many choices to investors  think one of the simplest methodologies like equal weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility momentum based weighting  not all have been able to deliver first rate results 
Fund Sponsor   Index
FLQL is managed by Franklin Templeton Investments  and this fund has amassed over  397 52 M  which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs  FLQL seeks to match the performance of the LibertyQ US Large Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses 
The U S  Large Cap Underlying Index seeks to achieve a lower level of risk and higher risk adjusted performance than the Russell 1000 Index over the long term by applying a multi factor selection process  which is designed to select equity securities from the Russell 1000 Index that have favorable exposure to four investment style factors quality  value  momentum and low volatility 
Cost   Other Expenses
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds  assuming all other factors remain equal  it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF s expense ratio 
With on par with most peer products in the space  this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0 25  
The fund has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 1 65  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  a deep look into a fund s holdings is a valuable exercise  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
FLQL s heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector  which is about 19 40  of the portfolio  Its Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Eli Lilly   Co  LLY  accounts for about 1 29  of total assets  followed by Procter   Gamble Co the  PG  and Walmart Inc  NYSE WMT

95242,316757,PG,2 Dividend Growth Stocks To Build Wealth And Protect Your Portfolio,opinion,"As has been discussed previously  for long term investors looking to build wealth and boost retirement income  stocks that have a proven history of rewarding shareholders via dividends could be a key investment strategy  Unlike growth investing though  where quick appreciation of a stock s value as the company expands profits is the goal  a dividend growth investor s main focus would be reliable and reliably increasing payouts so that the value of the dividend checks keeps growing every year 
The math on this is simple  suppose you bought a stock at  20 a share and in return receive a  1 annual dividend  The annual yield on your initial investment would be 5   But if that payout is hiked by the company to  1 50 annually your yield based on the cost of your  20 share purchase is now 7 5   If that annual payout continues to grow  reaching  2 a share your yield on cost would be a whopping 10  
Because the right dividend growth investment could be a powerful way to improve your returns over time  we recommend investing in companies that have a history of offering regular dividend increases on a sustained basis  As a rule  these companies run mature and stable businesses whose management has a long term philosophy that involves caring about the company s reputation and rewarding loyal investors 
Regular dividend payouts can also signal a lot about a company s ability to predict its own future  It would look very unprofessional  not to mention damaging  for management to hike dividends only to then cut them after a few quarters because cash flows had collapsed 
Our picks for strong dividend growth stocks  The two below hit all the right parameters 
1  Home Depot

For example  Home Depot  NYSE HD  is the largest home improvement retailer in the US  Shares of the stock  which closed yesterday at  169 82  are currently trading at the lower end of their 52 week range  And though its 2 44  dividend yield may not look too exciting  if you take into account the number of dividend hikes the company delivered during the past 10 years  the investment case changes 
Home Depot has paid dividends for the past 29 years  raising its payout by more than 350  over the last 10 years  Investors now get a quarterly dividend of  1 03 per share  up from  0 225 a a decade ago 
Plus  Home Depot is expanding digital sales which is helping propel strong growth momentum for the retailer  With a manageable dividend payout ratio below 50   you can expect continued dividend growth as well 
2  Procter   Gamble

Consumer staple giant Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   is another example of a stock worth stashing in a buy and hold portfolio where it can sit quietly and earn growing payouts for an investor  P G stock  which closed yesterday at  91 94 currently yields 3 1   It has increased its payouts for 60 consecutive years  a track record few companies throughout the world can match 
This consistent dividend growth also shows how powerful the company s cash flow generation is  Its product portfolio  which includes such globally recognized brands as Pampers diapers  Tide laundry detergent  and Charmin toilet paper  is strong enough to sustain revenue growth through wars  recessions and market downturns  And its payout ratio of 67 67 is healthy enough to ensure a continued growing income stream to investors  Over the past decade  its annual payout has doubled to  2 87 per share 
Bottom Line
Buying dividend growth stocks should be a critical component of your buy and hold investing strategy  Their steadily increasing payouts will help expand wealth while providing a hedge against economic uncertainty  In our view both Home Depot and Procter   Gamble fit the bill handsomely ",2018-11-27,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-dividend-growth-stocks-200362557,200362557

95246,316761,PG,Unilever and consumer rivals raise bets on Nigeria,news,By Alexis Akwagyiram LAGOS  Reuters    With Africa s most populous country out of recession  and the wider region on the path to growth  the world s consumer goods companies are looking to cash in   Last month   Unilever  opened a  12 million Blue Band margarine factory in Nigeria s southwestern state of Ogun so that it does not have to import margarine from Ghana  as it has in recent years  It is also in talks with suppliers to switch to a locally sourced flavoring agent for its toothpaste   These are examples of how the Anglo Dutch group  like its global rivals  has been forced to adapt its business to cope with a central bank decision to restrict access to foreign currency for the import of certain products since 2015 to boost the economy  Another way Unilever  L ULVR  is tailoring its operations to the local market is by offering smaller pack sizes of a range of products  from tea to stock cubes  to appeal to more customers in a country and region plagued by poverty and inequality  Shops in Nigeria s commercial capital Lagos sell packets containing just two Unilever produced tea bags or two stock cubes  for example   These are all packs that we use to gain penetration and to develop the market   said Yaw Nsarkoh  managing director of Unilever Nigeria  But again  the firm is not alone in such tactics  the same shops stock Nestle  S NESN  cereals ranging in size from 50 grams to 250 grams and 1 kilogram  Britain s PZ Cussons  L PZC  meanwhile has rolled out a range of small pack sizes over the last three years for products from soap and detergent to milk and vegetable oil   They have been popular and the biggest contributor in sales to each brand   said Christos Giannopoulos  CEO of the company s Nigerian business  How best to navigate the African consumer market is on the agenda to be discussed by corporate leaders at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos this week  The potential prize is alluring  It helps explains why these companies  plus the likes of Procter   Gamble  N PG    Diageo   L DGE  and  Danone   PA DANO   have long operated in Nigeria and are willing to go to some lengths to build brands and market share  The market is huge  Nigeria has about 190 million people  and that is expected to rise to 300 million by 2030 and 400 million by 2050  according to U N  data  which would make it the world s third most populous country after China and India   Companies are positioning themselves in the expectation that low household spending will rise as the economy grows and people come out of poverty and become consumers of packaged goods   If you look at the per capita consumption levels and the penetration levels of consumer categories in Nigeria generally  they are below many comparable markets   said Nsarkoh  pointing to India as an example   EMERGING FROM DOWNTURN But Nigeria and Sub Saharan Africa has not been the mecca some envisioned  A continent wide downturn since 2014  tied to low commodity prices  has dampened hopes for companies   Net earnings of 28 consumer companies in nine African countries have grown just 2 percent per year in local currency in the five years to 2016  and even less in dollar terms  according to Exotix  an emerging markets focused financial services firm   But Nigeria  Africa s top oil producer  last year emerged from its first recession in 25 years which was largely caused by low crude prices  The World Bank sees the country s economy growing from 1 percent in 2017 to 2 5 percent this year     Sub Saharan Africa s economy is meanwhile projected to pick up this year  with the World Bank predicting growth of 3 2 percent in 2018 and 3 5 percent in 2019  up from 2 4 percent in 2017  due to firmer commodity prices  In Nigeria  doing business has been particularly tough since 2015  when the foreign exchange curbs and the devaluation of the naira currency meant the cost of importing certain goods  which the government wanted to be grown locally  increased markedly  However Unilever Nigeria s financial results suggest that some of the tactics adopted to counter this may be paying off   Its operating profit almost tripled to 9 2 billion naira   30 1 million  in the first nine months of 2017  the latest figures available  after growing 25 percent in 2016  Before that  profits were flat in 2015 and fell 40 percent in 2014  Fola Abimbola  an analyst at Nigerian bank FCMB  credited the latest profit rise to price increases  taken to offset the impact of currency devaluation  as well as the use of smaller pack sizes    All of these companies have been selling smaller packs because  during the recession  people have less money to spend  People opt for smaller packs   said Abimbola  The use of smaller packaging is not new in emerging markets  but industry experts say that in Sub Saharan Africa  it has not yet been widely adopted beyond the beer industry  and expect it to catch on further in coming years   MAIZE  MILLET  PALM OIL Unilever s Nsarkoh said 90 percent of its Nigerian goods were now manufactured locally  up from 80 percent about three years ago  to make its business more resilient  As well as margarine  locally made products include soap  tea and toothpaste      In a sprawling manufacturing plant in the bustling Ikeja district of Lagos  for example  Unilever workers clad in white lab coats oversee production lines capable of producing hundreds of tubes of Close Up toothpaste a minute       Among rivals  Swiss group Nestle said that 41 600 local farmers suppled maize  soybean  sorghum and millet to its Nigerian factories  It said 82 percent of its inputs were sourced locally and that it aimed to extend to 100 percent where possible  It cited Golden Morn cereal  made from maize farmed in the northwestern state of Kaduna  as a product in which the goal had been achieved       PZ Cussons meanwhile has a stake in a 26 000 hectare palm oil plantation in the state of Cross River  Half of its vegetable oil is made using local palm oil  said Giannopoulos

Region wise  the segment witnessed strong performances in Europe and in emerging markets  especially Asia  On the contrary  North America and Ttravel retail businesses were hit by supply chain and impacts from the hurricane  Management intends to fully offset the lower shipments stemming from hurricanes in the second quarter  which includes the crucial holiday season  Also  the company is on track to resolve supply chain hurdles Consumer Beauty  Consumer Beauty revenues plunged 20 6  to  828 8 million and LFL sales declined 14   Results were hurt by supply chain disruptions  including customer penalties and increased promotions  These factors led to a sequential decline in the segment  Also  underlying weakness owing to persistent softness in mass beauty categories in United States and Europe dented results Professional Beauty  Professional Beauty net revenues of  409 6 million fell 4 9  year over year and 2 6  on LFL basis as disruptions at Coty s North American distribution center hampered its hair and nail businesses in the region  The segment otherwise witnessed underlying growth  fueled by brands like Wella  and robust growth in ALMEA and Europe  Also  contributions from ghd drove underlying performance Regional ResultsOn a regional basis  net revenues declined 14   down 15  LFL  in North America due to continued softness at Consumer Beauty  including supply chain hurdles  Also  effects of hurricanes and supply chain on Professional Beauty hit the region

95268,316783,PG,2 Stocks To Buy  AZN And PG,opinion,"The last couple of weeks have been choppy for most of the international stock markets  with UK FTSE 100 swinging between 7140 and 6940 points  US index S P 500 shuffling between 2815 and 2640 points and India based Nifty 50 index trading between 10600 and 10000 points 
Consequently  in the shorter term  it is not easy to determine which direction world indices may go  but most of them have broken below their uptrend channels in the medium term charts and are waiting for the next course of action which will eventually be first reflected in the short term chart 
To bring down uncertainty in the market  companies like FMCG  Pharma and Logistics help tide over market volatility  They are considered defensives  as traders and investors use them as a hedge to safeguard their portfolios from major downside  But company internals are equally important  If a company is not doing very well from inside  it may turn out to be a poor investment irrespective of market direction 
We look at three international stocks today  one FMCG and one Pharma and Health Care 
AstraZeneca PLC ADR  NYSE AZN  Close  41 49
Headquartered in UK  listed on both US and UK stock exchanges  the Anglo Swedish multinational pharmaceutical company ASTRAZENECA PLC is inside a rising trend channel in the medium term  This signals increasing optimism among investors and that the company s prospects continue to be promising in the coming future 
The stock price has given a new buy signal from a rectangle formation and a break up through the resistance at 40 39 dollars  Further rise to 43 45 dollars or more is signaled  The stock has support at 39 70 and 37 dollars respectively

This recent price move of this world renowned FMCG company has been supported by high volume  which suggests that buyers have been aggressive while sellers were passive  Also the momentum indicator RSI is above 70and is at a multi month high  It indicates rising optimism among investors and further rise in stock price 
Procter   Gamble Company may have some resistance around 94 40 dollars  which is its earlier top  A close above that level will be a new buy signal and the stock would continue to rise  There is support between 92 40 and 86 00 dollars Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Buy

95288,316803,PG,Week Ahead  U S  Equities  Oil To Test Uptrend  Bearish USD Could Boost Gold,opinion,"Most US indices finish the week lower
Earnings beats pressured by lowest home sales since 2015
Is credit crunch creating a financial crisis  hurting the dollar 

Most US stocks and indices including the S P 500  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000  closed lower on Friday  as solid corporate earnings were severely pressured by weak housing data after existing home sales seriously disappointed  dropping 3 4 percent in August to their lowest level since November 2015  There was also a psychological factor driving volatility  the 31st anniversary of  Black Monday   when  on Monday October 19  1987  global equity markets crashed 
While analysts continue to debate whether the current selloff is the beginning of a deeper correction or merely a buying opportunity  for many experienced traders and investors  a dark cloud hovers over the month of October  During the 1987 collapse  the Dow lost 508 points in just one day  making it among the worst single day performances in stock market history 
Indices Slip But Defensive Sectors Shine
Stocks initially rose on Friday  with early reports beating estimates  PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  jumped 9 4 percent after the company beat on both earnings and revenue and boosted its outlook  Proctor   Gamble  NYSE PG  surged 8 8 percent thanks to the best quarterly sales figures since 2013  American Express  NYSE AXP  rose 3 8 percent after beating expectations and revising guidance upwards 
Some stocks  however  offset the gains  eBay  EBAY  dropped 8 9 percent to its lowest since December 2016 after Stifel Nicolaus downgraded its shares from buy to hold  DowDuPont  NYSE DWDP  tumbled 1 9 percent after after the company cut the asset value of its agricultural business by  4 6 billion  American International Group  NYSE AIG  slumped 2 9 percent after announcing it will likely post quarterly catastrophic losses of as much as  1 7 billion from such natural disasters as Hurricane Florence in the US and typhoons Jebi and Trami in Asia 
Overall  the S P 500 Index edged down only slightly to finish the week  off 0 04 percent  However it was the third straight day of declines for the benchmark  Nevertheless  it was propped up for the second day by its 200 DMA as well as the bottom of a still forming bearish rising flag  right above the uptrend line since the February 2016 bottom 
Defensive sectors Consumer Staples   2 28 Friday and  4 41 percent weekly  and Utilities   1 56 percent Friday and  3 06 for the week  outshone  while risk sectors Consumer Discretionary   0 98 percent Friday and 1 97 percent weekly  led the losses  underscoring the risk off attitude investors have assumed 

The NASDAQ plunged 0 48 percent  capping a three day decline  as well as a three week slide  losing 1 29 percent of value for the week  After crossing back above the 200 DMA in Friday s early rally  it dropped back below it  where it closed for the weekend 
The Russell 2000 underperformed  falling 1 08 percent  It was down 0 59 percent for the week 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only index to close in the green on Friday  up 0 26 percent  It gained 0 41 for the week  outperforming US peer indices and ending a three day decline  However it found resistance at the 100 DMA 
The selloffs are still testing the very much current uptrend  What it all boils down to is strong economic data and earnings growth on the one hand  versus geopolitical risks on the other hand  Conservative traders should wait for confirmations of the trend s integrity  though more aggressive traders might view these selloffs as rare buying opportunities  with relatively minimal risk  if placing close stop losses   as they receive the lowest stock prices relative to the uptrend since March 

In FX markets  the dollar advanced 0 51 percent on a weekly basis  However  it lost 0 27 percent on Friday  This loss to close out the trading week is a bad omen for multiple technical reasons  It formed a bearish engulfing pattern  below the broken uptrend line since May 14  for the second time  and beneath the preceding early October peak 
Fundamentally  the credit market is demonstrating a growing tightening shortage  which has the potential to cause the next financial crisis 

Such a dollar demise would  in all likelihood  boost gold  The yellow metal has been forming a pennant since last week  bullish with an upside breakout 

After the growing tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi provided a boost for oil prices  the commodity tumbled following a 6 5 million barrel increase in US inventories last week  the fourth in a row  Exports  on the other hand  were down 1 8 million BPD  according to the US Energy Information Administration  Oil stocks rose sharply even as US crude production slipped 300 000 bpd to 10 9 million bpd last week  which analysts attributed to the effects of offshore facilities closing temporarily for Hurricane Michael 
While oil markets look adequately supplied for now after a significant production increase  despite the earlier market narrative indicating otherwise  in the last six months the energy industry has been coming under strain  The International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that the world s spare oil production capacity was down to 2  of global demand  with further slippage likely  Technically  the price found support on Friday above the uptrend line since June 2017

95304,316819,PG,It Is No Longer A Gamble Investing In Procter   Gamble  Part 5  ,opinion,"Introduction
Procter   Gamble  PG  is a Dividend Aristocrat  Champion and blue chip stalwart that has increased its dividend for 62 consecutive years  Therefore  it should be no surprise that this blue chip stalwart has traditionally commanded a higher valuation than most stocks  Over the past couple of decades at least  it has been a very rare occurrence to be able to invest in this company at a valuation that would be considered reasonable or attractive  In fact  prior to current times  it took the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 to bring Procter   Gamble down to reasonable valuation levels 
To put Procter   Gamble s current valuation into perspective  this blue chip can be purchased today with a 3 7  current dividend yield which is hovering around the highest it has been over the past two decades  Furthermore  Procter   Gamble appears attractively valued over virtually every rational valuation metric that prudent value investors might consider 
Procter   Gamble at a Glance
As the following screenshot clearly depicts  Procter   Gamble is a formidable company that has been in business for 180 years  The company sells products in more than 180 countries  and as previously stated  has increased their dividends for 62 consecutive years  Procter   Gamble is a diversified consumer staples company with businesses covering 10 product categories generating over  65 billion in annual sales 
The following screenshot provides a breakdown of Procter   Gamble s net sales and earnings over each of their five reportable segments  Additionally  the company s products are quality leaders in each of their categories and subcategories 
Morningstar offered their investment thesis on Procter   Gamble discussing the company s effort to cull around 100 brands from its mix leaving it with 65 brands  However  the following excerpt from the report suggests Procter   Gamble s clout with retailers remains formidable 

In our view  despite slimming down  we still think P G will carry clout with retailers  maintaining its scale edge  The 65 brands it maintains in its portfolio include 21 that generate  1 billion  10 billion in annual sales and another 11 that account for  500 million  1 billion in sales each year  We believe that by supplying products across multiple categories  such as fabric care  baby care  feminine care  and grooming among others   trusted manufacturers like P G are critical to retailers looking to drive traffic  both into physical stores and on e commerce platforms 


FAST Graphs analyze out loud video  Valuing Procter   Gamble in Multiple Ways
There are numerous ways to examine and then ascertain the fair value of a business public or private  I am often asked what do I think is the best metric to use when trying to determine fair value  My answer to this question is simple and straightforward  I believe that investors should evaluate any stock they are examining over as many valuation metrics as they can  Therefore  my stock answer is to utilize all of the valuation resources at your disposal 
In addition to providing different perspectives on the relative valuation of a given stock  examining various metrics can also provide insights into the company s operating strengths and or challenges  Moreover  in addition to simply trying to ascertain valuation  I believe that examining various metrics also affords insights into important considerations such as dividend coverage  In other words  is the dividend safe and can it be expected to continue growing 
Consequently  the following analyze out loud video will look at Procter   Gamble s valuation and the safety of its dividend utilizing numerous metrics  These will include adjusted and GAAP earnings  operating and free cash flow as well as EBITDA  I will also look at important underlying financial numbers associated with the company s financial statements 
Most importantly  I will also provide insights into what I believe an investor stands to make by investing in Procter   Gamble today  To my way of thinking  this is a critical step that every investor should make prior to investing in a stock  Unfortunately  it is also a critical step that often is ignored  To be clear  what I m suggesting is that I always calculate a precise range of reasonable return possibilities that I believe an investment in a given stock offers me  I never invest simply hoping that the price might go up  Instead  I invest with a specific expectation in mind  and then I closely monitor whether the business is meeting those expectations  Importantly  I am monitoring fundamental results as they unfold and not short term stock price movements 

Summary and Conclusions
Procter   Gamble is a blue chip dividend growth stock with a long history of increasing their dividend  However  since the beginning of fiscal year 2009  the company has produced anemic earnings growth and below average dividend growth relative to its historical norms  However  the company is taking actions to reinvigorate future growth  At this juncture  the consensus of leading analysts are giving them the benefit of the doubt 
Regardless of whether the company reinvigorates its historical normal growth rates or not  I contend the company is fairly valued based on historical norms  Most importantly  I believe the dividend is safe and very attractive for such a high quality iconic blue chip Dividend Aristocrat  Therefore  I would suggest that investors seeking a quality dividend growth stock with an above market current yield might give Procter   Gamble a closer look

95314,316829,PG,P G and Nestle Stand to Gain From China s Lower Import Taxes ,news," Bloomberg     China s new plan to slash import taxes on a wide range of consumer goods promises to boost the prospects of multinationals in the Chinese market  with everything from Procter   Gamble Company s  NYSE PG  diapers to  Diageo   LON DGE  Plc s whiskey becoming more affordable to local consumers 
Tariffs for 187 product categories will drop from an average 17 3 percent to 7 7 percent after the cut takes effect on Dec  1  the Ministry of Finance said in a statement Friday  citing the need to help consumers access quality and specialty products that aren t widely produced locally 
The new policy follows President Xi Jinping s call at the October Communist Party conclave to meet citizens  demands for improved living standards and better quality products in the world s largest consumer market  Foreign multinationals stand to benefit as middle class shoppers seek out goods stamped with foreign brands  while the cuts also encourage consumers to spend at home rather than on trips overseas 
 It s aimed at three things  helping boost consumption in China  reforming the Chinese economy by continuing to open it up  and sending a signal to the world and particularly to the U S  that it is committed to advancing global trade   said Shane Oliver  head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd  in Sydney 
Nestle Gains
Tariffs for some types of baby formula were cut to zero  triggering losses in Chinese dairy stocks  Shares climbed  meanwhile  for European food and beverage companies 
The moves will help companies like  Danone  SA  PA DANO  and Nestle SA  SIX NESN  that compete with local brands in the large market for infant formula  That industry will see sales increase about 15 percent to 123 billion yuan   18 7 billion  in China by 2020  according to a  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   report in October  Chinese parents worried about a series of food safety scandals often favor foreign brands 
 This is very good news for Nestle  and excellent news for its infant milk formula   said Jean Philippe Bertschy  an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG   It s a win win situation for both consumers and high quality global consumer goods companies  
Nestle generated some 7 3 percent of revenue in the Greater China region last year  with sales of 6 5 billion francs   6 6 billion   Nestle is the market leader in China s  21 5 billion baby food market with a 17 percent share  followed by Danone with a 9 3 percent share  according to Euromonitor International 
Local Production
Still  big consumer product companies emphasized that many of the wares they sell to Chinese consumers are made in the country 
 We welcome the new measures  although imports only make up a very small portion of our business in China   Veronica Sze  a Nestle spokeswoman  said by email   Over 95 percent of all products we sell are made in China  
Nestle shares gained as much as 0 8 percent on Friday  while Danone rose 1 8 percent  More broadly  food and beverage companies climbed the most among industries in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index 
Among other foreign companies poised to benefit is Procter   Gamble  which gets 8 percent of its sales from Greater China  P G  the owner of brands such as Crest  Gillette and Tide  may get a lift from cuts to items including diapers and personal care products  For instance  the tariff on electric toothbrushes will fall from 30 percent to 10 percent 
 While P G products are largely designed for Chinese consumers and manufactured in China  this will allow Chinese consumers even more access to our latest global innovations where there is a strong local consumer demand and need   P G s Rene Co said in an email 
Diageo also welcomed the move  which will lead to more Chinese consuming Scotch whiskey  according to spokesman Chen Ye 
The CSI 300 Consumer Staples Index fell as much as 2 6 percent on Friday  led by Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co Ltd  SS 600887  and food companies Henan Shuanghui Investment   Development Co Ltd  SZ 000895  and Muyuan Foodstuff Co Ltd  SZ 002714  The gauge has plunged 6 1 percent this week  the most since January 2016 
 China is trying to encourage more foreign companies to sell locally and wants to give consumers more choice   said Matthew Crabbe  Mintel International Group Ltd  s director of Asia Pacific research   What it will do is help foreign products already within the market get more competitive  
Robust consumption is an increasingly important stabilizer for the world s second largest economy  as it shifts away from an investment  and export led growth model  Domestic consumption contributed 64 5 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2017  according to the National Bureau of Statistics 
Items in Friday s list of tariff cuts are part of broader categories of consumer goods that made up around 30 percent of China s total imports in 2016  according to Bloomberg calculations  China s retail sales totaled more than  5 trillion last year 
Bolstering Imports
China has faced criticism for not doing enough to bolster imports  a move that would help balance the trade surpluses that it runs with a raft of other countries  U S  President Donald Trump has long complained that China engages in unfair trade practices and has pledged to close the trade deficit with China  the U S  s largest 
Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said this month that a range of measures to open domestic markets will be taken to support demand for imports  a move that could help narrow the  327 billion trade gap with the U S 
 It is unlikely to move the needle much on the trade balance but it is still a small  solid step forward   said Christopher Balding  an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen   China is moving to a consumption economy and with so much cross border commerce streaming in across these product segments  they are under pressure to lower tariffs  
Taxes for a range of medicines  including various antibiotics and insulin products  were lowered to 2 percent from as much as 6 percent  potentially a big win for multinational drug companies such as  Pfizer  Inc   NYSE PFE  and  Novartis  AG  SIX NOVN  that import many of their drugs into the country  China s medical imports stood at  22 billion in the first 10 months of 2017  according to latest data from the General Administration of Customs 
The biggest reduction came for vermouth or similar alcohol  from 65 percent to 14 percent  according to the statement  Whiskey tariffs were cut to 5 percent from 10 percent 
China will host its first ever import fair in November next year  and will roll out tax  fiscal and administrative initiatives aimed at helping foreign firms sell more into what is becoming a big and sophisticated consumer market  Zhong said earlier this month ",2017-11-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pg-and-nestle-stand-to-gain-from-chinas-lower-import-taxes-2-908860,908860

95322,316837,PG,Top Analyst Reports For Procter   Gamble  AbbVie  McDonald s   PepsiCo ,opinion,"Monday  May 21  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 17 major stocks  including Procter   Gamble  PG   AbbVie  ABBV   McDonald s  MCD  and PepsiCo   PEP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Procter   Gamble s shares have underperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the last six months   16 9  vs   10 2    P G reported third quarter fiscal 2018 results  wherein earnings and revenues surpassed expectations  benefiting from higher demand for skincare products  along with fabric and home care products  
Adjusted earnings grew 4  from the year ago level  aided by productivity cost savings  Top line grew 4  on organic sales growth of 1   comprising 2  volume growth  The Zacks analyst emphasizes that Procter   Gamble remains focused on improved product  packaging and marketing initiatives  and productivity cost savings plan  
Meanwhile  it intends to acquire the consumer health unit of Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA  which will enhance P G s existing consumer healthcare capabilities  However  core gross and operating margin declined 110 bps and 100 bps  respectively  in the quarter  
Lower pricing  higher commodity costs and increased competition continued to hurt results  P G s shares have lost around 20 1  year to date  Estimates for fiscal 2018 and 2019 have moved down 0 2  and 1 3   over the past 60 days 
 You can   
Shares of AbbVie have gained  9 6  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which has declined  3 8  over the same period  AbbVie beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the first quarter  It also raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on strong Q1 performance and an optimistic outlook for future quarters  
AbbVie s key drug  Humira  has been performing well based on strong demand trends  despite new competition  Moreover  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases  Mavyret s launch has also been stronger than expected  AbbVie has an impressive late stage pipeline with label expansions for both new and existing products expected over the next few years  
The Zacks analyst thinks promising data from several pivotal studies and settlement of its second Humira patent dispute with Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  are key positives  However  Viekira s sales continue to be hurt by intensifying competition 
 You can   
McDonald s shares have gained  8 6  over the past one year  outperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry which has gained  1 7  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks McDonald s impressive earnings surprise history  various sales and digital initiatives as well as positive comparable sales are major positives  
Earnings surpassed the estimate for 15th straight quarter  as it reported first quarter 2018 results  Furthermore  increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should boost its performance  
Efforts to attract customers in International Lead   High Growth Markets also bode well  In fact  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the trailing eleven quarters  Yet  high labor costs and currency headwinds are major concerns  
Moreover  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to strategic refranchising initiative  Even so  its augmented focus on refranchising should cut the capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth in the long run 
 You can   
Shares of PepsiCo have decreased  18 7  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Soft Beverages industry  which has declined  12 3  over the same period  PepsiCo s first quarter 2018 earnings and revenues both beat expectations  Notably  this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise  
The improvement was mainly due to strong performances in its international divisions  propelled by higher revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets  Core earnings and revenues grew 3  and 4 3  year over year  respectively  Organic revenues were 2 3  in the quarter  same as the prior quarter  
However  NAB division reported dismal results with revenues and operating profit decreasing 1  and 22   respectively  Volumes declined 2 5   led by 4  decline in CSDs and 1  decrease in Non CSDs  Shift in consumer preferences toward healthier options is a potent headwind  Earnings estimates have moved 0 2  and 0 5  south for 2018 and 2019  respectively  over the past 30 days

95323,316838,PG,Will China Erase Birth Limits  Stocks   ETFs To Watch,opinion,"Reforms   whether financial or demographic   are pretty rampant in China right now  The ride has been rocky for this economy  with growth dropping to a 26 year low last year and with little respite in sight   The Chinese economy expanded 1 4  sequentially in Q1  marking the weakest pace of expansion since the first quarter of 2016 and also lagging market expectations of 1 5  
Naturally  the government is adopting a host of accommodative measures to boost the economy   Probably  as part of the demographic reform  Beijing is planning to end the four decade old infamous policy pertaining to birth limits  as   The reform is expected to take effect by 2019 
China is actually gradually easing its one child policy in recent times  China had slightly loosened the policy in 2013  relaxing the limit for couples where one partner is an only child  In 2015  China scrapped its one child policy altogether  allowing couples to have two children 
Why the Move  
Put into effect in 1979  the policy is expected to have put off about  births  However  concerns over China s ageing population and the resultant shortage of workers and consumers prompted this move 
China s working age population dropped to its lowest level since 2009 last year and also fell below a billion for   The number of people 65 or older rose to 11 4  of the population  up from 10 8  in 2016 
The State Council last year estimated that about 25  of China s population will cross 60 by 2030  up from 13  in 2010  As a result  slowing population growth and declining number of workers pose a threat to China s economic growth and its state run pension program  per an article published on Reuters 
Investors should note that China has long been working on stepping up domestic consumption  reducing focus on exports and intending to move to a  slower and more balanced growth  economy 
How Effective Will the Move Be  
Now  the scrapping of restriction is expected to translate into huge demographic gains down the road  However  a former division chief at the National Family Planning Commission indicated that  scrapping birth limits will have little effect on the tendency of China s declining births   as the decision came in late 
Investors should note that the number of births fell  to 17 23 million in 2017 despite 2015 s loosening of birth limits  Still  we expect some positives out of this move over the long term 
Impact of Likely Baby Boom on Stock Market
As expected  companies selling baby related goods and services will be the immediate beneficiaries from the end of this policy  Baby related stocks rallied in China following the news  Of course  companies selling products related to baby care should see a surge over the long run and the Real Estate and Education sectors will also get a lift

95324,316839,PG,After A Lengthy Retreat  Why Procter   Gamble Is Attractive Again,opinion,"Dividend stock investing has fallen out of fashion  Companies that reliably and religiously reward their investors don t get a lot of financial press nor much air time on TV  Right now it s the high flying technology names that are consuming most of our attention 
But if you ignore what s currently in vogue and actually dig a bit deeper  you ll find that some of the top dividend paying stocks have produced returns which consistently beat the market  According to one such study by Goldman Sachs  wealth management division  dividend paying stocks produced  15 fold better returns than shares of non dividend paying companies between 1972 and 2014 
If you re in the market for the long haul  you should include stocks in your portfolio that not only pay dividends  but that also consistently raise their dividend payouts  This combination is a great recipe for growing an investment portfolio by enabling better performance during a variety of different market cycles 
The biggest attraction I see for investing in dividend stocks is that you can also compound your money  Compounding is a simple strategy  take dividend or interest payments and use them to buy more of the dividend  or interest paying investment  In other words  in the case of a dividend stock  you get to buy additional shares without having to lay out supplemental dollars from your own pocket 
Companies that regularly hike their payouts are generally businesses which sell products and services without which it would be difficult for people to live a normal life  These  forever  stocks churn out cash quarter after quarter  providing stability and growth to your portfolio in both good and bad times 
Dividend Cash Machine But Shares Under Pressure
Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   is a consumer product powerhouse  It s also one of those largest dividend payers in the US with a dividend track record that s hard to match  The maker of Pampers diapers and Dawn dish soap has hiked its dividend for 61 consecutive years  and it never stopped paying dividends for the last 127 years 
So  what makes P G such a massive cash machine for dividend investors  P G owns some of the world s top consumer brands  including Bounty paper towels  Gillette razors  and Tide laundry detergent  The company s portfolio of such leading businesses generated more than  65 billion in annual sales last year and 22  in core operating margins  which is among the highest in the industry 

Despite its dominant position in the consumer packaged goods arena  P G shares have been under pressure  Indeed  the stock has underperformed the broader market in recent years  The biggest challenge P G now faces is reversing the trend of slowing sales growth amid changing consumer preferences 
As part of its turnaround strategy  over the past five years P G has cut its roster of brands from 175 to 65  focusing on the 10 product categories where the margin is highest  During the course of that process the company has also eliminated 34 000 jobs through a combination of brand sales and buyouts  as well as plant closures slashing more than  10 billion in costs 
But investors  led by the billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz  want P G to be even more aggressive in its turnaround efforts  Chief Executive Officer David Taylor has responded by buying new businesses and introducing greener versions of existing products such as the company s new Pampers Pure Protection line 
Sure Bet Or Still Risky 
There s no doubt that during the past five years investing in P G has been a big disappointment 

However  there are signs that the company s product re organization and cost cutting have started to pay off  P G is holding or expanding market share in about half of its top product segments  up from one third in mid 2016  P G s operating margins improved to 22 1  of sales last year  up from 19 6  in fiscal 2015 
Trading at  74 31 at time of writing and with an annual dividend yield of 3 94   P G stock may not be an attractive option for investors seeking double digit returns over the short term  but it s a good turnaround bet with the potential for significant dividend increases 
By adding Procter   Gamble shares now  investors get a less sprawling  more focused company whose growth is powered by marquee brands  That s a far better performance proposition than the old P G was able to deliver ",2018-05-28,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/after-a-lengthy-retreat-heres-why-pg-is-once-again-attractive-200319698,200319698
95325,316840,PG,These Safe Monthly Payers Yield 6  To 8  With 60  Upside ,opinion,"If you feel trapped  grinding out  dividend income with popular 2  and 3  stocks and funds  here s the three letter acronym that will fund your retirement 
C E F
For whatever reason  closed end funds don t have nearly the following   or analyst paperazzi   that dividend paying stocks boast  This  secret  is one of the last great efficiencies in an otherwise tough to beat market 
And we contrarian income hounds will gladly take this edge 
After all  it doesn t make much sense that we can trade in our  dumb  stocks  ETFs and mutual funds for superior tickers that 

Yield 6   7   8  or more 
Pay their investors every month 
Often trade at a discount to the assets they each own  and
Are managed for free  I ll explain more later  by a top notch investment manager 

Let s start with an example featuring stock based CEFs  For those of you shaking your head at your portfolio s low yield  you can actually 2X or 3X your portfolio s yield and improve your upside potential to boot using this strategy  And it s actually simpler than traditional stock picking 
How to Bank 6  Yields From Blue Chip Stocks
Many income investors have mistakenly parked their capital in  safe  consumer staples like General Mills  NYSE GIS   Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  and Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  in search of yield and security  Their money was safe  alright   their cash has grinded straight sideways for the last five years 
They d have been better off  outsourcing  their dividend decisions to the great Mario Gabelli  His namesake Gabelli Dividend   Income Closed Fund  NYSE GDV  tends to pay around 6  or so  it yields 5 8  today   Mario s dividends show up around the 14th of the month  every month  to the tune of  0 11 per share 
Sounds like a sweet deal  right  His investors get the benefit of a legendary money mind along with his access to ideas and cheap money  And get paid monthly to boot 
It really is quite the opportunity  The monthly dividends plus the boss  smarts have rewarded investors who made the  one click  investing decision to buy shares in GDV and let Mario take care of the rest 
In Mario We Trust  for 62  Returns in 5 Years 
His secret sauce is his stock selection  Meanwhile our opportunity lies with the discount   the fact that Mario s fund tends to trade at a discount to the value of the shares it holds  Over the past three years  GDV has traded at an average discount of 10  to its NAV  net asset value    which means investors have bought his stocks for just  0 90 on the dollar 
 Since GDV is a CEF  it has a fixed pool of shares   versus a mutual fund  which can simply issue more shares anytime it wants  The restricted supply means the fund s price trades like a stock   which means it can stray from its NAV  
Mario s brilliance at a bargain is one example of our  CEF edge   With  1 9 billion in assets  this particular fund is too small for big players to put money to work  Which works out perfectly for us 
And in CEF land  stocks aren t the only assets with price upside  Let s now talk about way to further accelerate these returns  As nice as Mario s 60  in five years is  I m going to show you how to bank that much in just two 
How to Boost Your Bond Yields to 8  
There are serious deals available in secure bonds  No safe bond pays 8  itself  of course  But it is possible to generate 8  and even 9  or more from a portfolio of reliable bonds 
You can even diversify your portfolio  bank these safe 8   and hire one of the best bond managers on the planet  For free  to boot 
It just requires a bit of contrarian thinking   and knowing which publicly traded funds these guys are managing behind the scenes  via their often underrated CEFs  
Here s a real life fixed income bargain  You probably know the  Bond King  Bill Gross  How about his successor  Dan Ivascyn 
When Gross left PIMCO  a tide of cash followed him out the door  But the flow of money quickly subsided when Ivascyn stepped to the plate and outperformed Gross himself  No wonder PIMCO let the King walk out the door   they had their next superstar in waiting 
A money manager of Ivascyn s caliber will usually cost 2  annually  plus 20  of profits   And it d take a million bucks or two to get his attention 
But from time to time you can hire him for free  In fact there are times you ll be paid up front to give him your money 
And like buying a regular stock or mutual fund  you can buy this super CEF with one click from your computer  or tap from your phone  by purchasing PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund  NYSE PCI 
PCI charges a 2  management fee  But it s easy to get the fee comped   if you simply buy the fund when it trades for a discount 
For top notch managers like Ivascyn  the fund s price usually wanders above its NAV  Investors are willing to pay more than  1 for a dollar in assets just to get in 
Big PIMCO Premiums Today
But I always demand a discount  A 2  discount means our management fee is comped  A bigger bargain means we have some upside  as the discount window closes  and our yield is higher than it would be if the fund traded for fair value  because income is earned per NAV unit   so the less we pay for it  the better  
The three funds above are trading at big premiums however  Is it possible to ever get Ivascyn s expertise at a discount  You bet 
First Level Worries to the Rescue
PCI had been neglected by investors because of its strategy focused on mortgage backed securities  MBSs   which had the lead role in the last financial crisis  They have recently been immortalized in the book and movie The Big Short  MBSs blew up the financial system in 2008 and have been outcasts ever since 
But a  second level  look at mortgage payments showed these assets have successfully completed financial rehab  They quietly began to enjoy the benefits of clean living   with mortgage defaults and delinquencies trending down  Ivascyn and his team capitalized on this misplaced despair 
Two years ago  we added PCI to our Contrarian Income Report portfolio  The fund traded at a 10  discount to its NAV and yielded an incredible 10 7   This  free lunch  was gradually gobbled up as these safe bonds crushed the stock market at large 
Ivascyn Worth Every Penny   58  Net of Fees 
Our secret here was our  no brainer  purchase of a 10   yield at a 10  discount  Ivascyn did the rest   not only did he keep his monthly distribution funded  but he bought bonds that went up in value as rates rose 
Even after we pocketed these generous monthly payouts  the fund s NAV sits 18  higher today than it was two years ago  Proving that it is possible to bank plenty of upside from secure bonds  You just need to know where to look   and CEFs are the ideal place to start

95326,316841,PG,Book Review  Yu  Leap,opinion,"Legally or illegally  companies have for centuries copied the intellectual property of their competitors and encroached on their market share  One only has to think back to the commercial espionage of Francis Cabot Lowell  who in 1810 11  while strolling through dozens of British cotton mills  memorized critical details of mechanized textile manufacturing  Using this information  his Boston Manufacturing Company and eventually mills throughout New England took the growing American mass market away from British textile exporters 
Leap  How to Thrive in a World Where Everything Can Be Copied  PublicAffairs Hachette  2018  by Howard Yu is  in the best sense of the word  a story book  It tells tales of woe as well as tales of resilience  These case studies all have a point  but  even if they didn t  they would be fascinating in and of themselves 
Wu  a professor at the International Institute for Management Development  IMD  in Lausanne  Switzerland  believes that the key to outlasting copycat competition is to leap   Pioneers must move across knowledge disciplines  to leverage or create new knowledge on how a product is made or a service is delivered  Absent such efforts  latecomers will always catch up  
Wu articulates five principles necessary for making a successful leap   1  understand your firm s foundational knowledge and its trajectory   2  acquire and cultivate new knowledge disciplines   3  leverage seismic shifts   4  experiment to gain evidence  and  5  dive deep into execution  These principles  as stated  are somewhat telegraphic  but Wu develops them through compelling case studies from companies spanning the globe  for instance  Steinway  an example of what not to do in the face of competition  in its case  from Yamaha   Procter   Gamble  Novartis  WeChat  Recruit Holdings  and John Deere 
Leap is the kind of book that everyone with an interest in business can profit from  And here s a lesson that everybody  active investors traders in particular  can profit from   Successful executives often exhibit a bias for action  But it s even more important to separate the noise from the signal that actually pinpoints the glacial movement around us  Listening carefully to the right signals requires patience and discipline  Seizing a window of opportunity  which means not necessarily being the first mover but the first to get it right  takes courage and determination  To leap successfully is to master these two seemingly contradictory abilities  The discipline to wait and the determination to drive  in balanced combination  often pay off handsomely  ",2018-06-13,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review-yu-leap-200324460,200324460

95349,316864,PG,Why P G Weighs On Staples ETFs Despite Beating Estimates,opinion,"One of the most famous names in the consumer products world   Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG     came up with a beat on both line in results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018  The consumer behemoth also announced a big ticket acquisition of Merck  NYSE MRK  s Consumer Health Unit as well as the terminated a joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  
Such a volley of good news should boost the stock of P G  but in reality  shares fell about 4 2  due to about  in its core business  per CNBC  Margin pressure was pronounced in the earnings report 
Let s delve a little deeper into the results and assess what could be done with P G shares in the coming days  read    
Procter   Gamble s 3Q18 Earnings in Focus
P G s fiscal third quarter core earnings of  1 00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 2   The bottom line increased 4  from the prior year quarter  Currency neutral core earnings per share  EPS  also improved 1   The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate 
Reported net sales of  16 3 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  16 2 billion and grew 4  from the year ago level  thanks to strong sales from its beauty  and fabric and homecare business lines  Foreign exchange had a 4  positive impact on sales 
On the flip side  organically  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestitures and foreign exchange   revenues grew 1   versus 2  growth seen in the preceding quarter   Pricing had a 2  negative impact on sales  P G s Gillette shaving business continues to face pricing pressure from U S  retailers  The brand has been facing steep competition from the likes of  have due to the latter s less expensive products 
Core gross margin dropped 110 basis points  bps  to 49 4   as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds like higher commodity costs and unfavorable pricing impacts 
Outlook 
The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 6 8   versus   But it maintained its projection for the year and expects organic sales growth in the range of 2 3  for fiscal 2018 
Acquisition Details 
P G announced to buy the consumer health business of Germany based Merck KGaA for approximately 3 4 billion euro   4 billion   Per the terms  P G will also acquire a 51 8  stake in India listed Merck Ltd  The deal is expected to close during the 2018 19 fiscal  The acquisition will help P G to solidify its consumer healthcare business 
Consumer ETF Impact
The loss in PG and Philip Morris   NYSE PM   shares is reflected in the ETF world  with consumer staples funds being hurt  Many of the key funds in this segment have a double digit allocation to the consumer product giant P G  suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on the company s performance  Let s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter   Gamble  read    
Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund 
The most popular consumer ETF on the market  XLP  follows the S P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index  The fund invests about  7 56 billion of assets in 34 holdings  Of these firms  the in focus P G takes the first spot  making up roughly 1 4  of the assets  The fund lost 2 9  on Apr 19  see  here  
Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF 
This fund manages a  3 79 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 99 consumer stocks  The product charges a low fee of 10 bps per year from investors  Here too  P G is the top firm with 10 4  allocation  VDC retreated about 2 7  on Apr 19 
iShares U S  Consumer Goods ETF 
The fund holds about 107 stocks in its basket with AUM of  468 4 million  Like the other two  the stock under consideration occupies the top position in the basket with 9 12  of assets  The fund shed about 2 9  on Apr 19 
Bottom Line
Even though acquisition announcement should bode well over the long term  the near term prospect of P G doesn t appear to be smooth  Plus  the Zacks Industry Rank of Procter   Gamble is in the bottom 8   The VGM Score of the stock is D  Investors should also keep in mind that the wind is not in favor of the broader sector  The Zacks Sector Rank is in the bottom 44   So  it is better to stay away from the consumer space at this moment

95371,316886,PG,These 3 Blue Chips Will Cost You  643 915 By 2038,opinion,"Blue chip stocks are among the worst retirement investments you can make 
There are several blue chip stocks that will actually cost you thousands of dollars each year  We ll discuss three in a moment 
Sure  the financial media might lionize these stocks  But blue chips are simply big companies  When the term first came into being  it was simply an homage to the blue poker chip   at the time  the most valuable chip on the table  Before purples  oranges and grays began to grace the baize 
However  now the term comes with a boat load of perks   the simple assignment of the term  blue chip  is practically a buy recommendation  And therein lies the danger  Because in many cases  these larger companies have not only hit the end of their growth cycle  but are nearing the latter stages of their dividend growth cycle as well 
This means that keeping your money in these blue chips can severely cap your nest egg s upside  Let s compare  safe  blue chip stocks paying 2  or 3  per year in dividends  growing their payouts by 3  to 4  per year with other investment options 
Generally speaking  a stock price will appreciate in line with its dividend  This means a 4  dividend grower will see its shares rise by about 4  per year over the long term 
When we combine a 2  to 3  current yield with 3  to 4  yearly price upside  we get 6  growth  This may be safe  but who cares  It trails the market and the 8  dividend payers  with upside potential  you could easily enjoy with more careful research 
Blue Chips Can Underperform by  643 915
That s right  You re losing out on  6 000 in your first year alone  and if you sit on that portfolio of underachieving blue chips for 20 years  you ll sell yourself short by  643 915 76 
I ll share my favorite picks for reclaiming that  600K  in a minute  First  let me pick on three blue chip dogs to show you an example of  dead retirement money  
L Brands  NYSE LB Dividend Yield  6 3 
The name L Brands  LB  probably won t spark much in your memory banks  but its brands certainly will   Victoria s Secret and Bath   Body Works  as well as Pink  La Senza and Henri Bendel 
Victoria s Secret and Bath   Body Works specifically are practically royalty among mall store names   but that s a tarnished throne to sit in  And L Brands  operations and stock price performance both reflect that 
 as Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  wreaks havoc across brick and mortar retail  but to L Brands  credit  during the past five years   during which many retailers  top lines have dwindled   LB s revenues have improved each and every year 
But that s where the plaudits end  The company has watched its operating margins dwindle over the past couple years  and as a result  profits have shrunk from about  1 25 billion to  980 million in just three years  Worse  analysts expect another pullback on the bottom line this year  from about  3 20 per share to  3 17  That s not enough to put the dividend in danger   at  2 40 annually  that s still about three quarters of net income   but the payout has been stagnant for years  and the company s profitability trend means investors should expect more of the same 
Even the top line progress might be in serious trouble soon  The Victoria s Secret brand is deteriorating rapidly  less able to command the premiums it once did  Last year  comparable store sales declined a miserable 8   if it weren t for a resurgent Bath   Body Works  L Brands would be in even more dire straits 
A few retailers still are worth buying in the Age of Amazon  but L Brands isn t one of them 
L Brands  LB  Is Making a Massive Sacrifice for Growth 
Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG Dividend Yield  3 5 
When you think of typical Amazon victims  your mind goes to companies just like L Brands   but probably not to consumer staples darlings like Procter   Gamble  PG  
But hear me out  P G may very well  
At the moment  you can buy popular Procter   Gamble brands such as Tide laundry detergent  Crest toothpaste and Pampers diapers on Amazon com  which would seem to be a good place to be as consumers migrate out of grocery stores and into the online checkout lane 
However  Amazon is beginning to build its own army of private label products  boasting more than 70 brands  according to Recode research  Most of those are in clothing  shoes and jewelry  but AMZN also sells things such as toilet paper and paper towels via its Presto brand  and baby wipes under Amazon Elements 
It s bad enough that Amazon is encroaching upon P G by entering the consumer staples arena  but couple that with all of the purchasing data Amazon has collected on Procter   Gamble s sales  and add in Amazon s ability to increasingly promote its own brands via its legacy site and through the Alexa AI interface  and it s clear this is a potential time bomb for numerous staples companies  P G included 
Yes  PG s dividend yield is at the high end of its 10 year range  But considering its Amazon problem  as well as analyst estimates for low single digit top line expansion over the next few years   and throwing in the company s lackluster 15  dividend growth during the past half decade   I just don t see a buy case for this revered but slowing blue chip 
Procter   Gamble s  PG  Biggest Draw Is a Good  But Not Even Great  Dividend
Ford Motor Company  NYSE F Dividend Yield  5 4 
If you re a value hunter  you re going to bristle at this next chart 
Will the Market Ever Recognize Ford s  F  Value 
Ford  F  has been an infuriating stock for years  I m talking about a price to earnings ratio  blue line above  in the mid single digits  a price to sales ratio  orange line  of well less than half and an increasingly juicy dividend that s on par with AT T  NYSE T  at the moment 
The table has been set  but it seems like even when Ford shows promise  nothing happens  Wall Street is being almost stubbornly bearish about the massive automaker 
But not without reason 
Ford made an exciting move in spring 2017  booting CEO Mark Fields and appointing Jim Hackett   long considered a company visionary who is viewed as  the future  thanks to his previous role with Ford s mobility efforts  Yet  for as exciting as Lyft partnerships and driverless cars seem  the company has considerable issues here in the land of reality 
Moody s downgraded Ford s credit rating outlook at the end of January  which heightens the chances of a costly downgrade later down the road  with Senior Vice President Bruce Clark saying   We expect that Ford s operating performance will remain under pressure into 2019   More importantly  he cited a challenge the entire auto industry faces  Namely  trying to figure out how to judiciously invest across a number of emerging technologies as automakers try to determine exactly what the future of automobiles will be 
That  as well as analysts  estimates for a pullback in overall auto sales in 2018  likely will keep Ford s stock cheap   and low  for the foreseeable future

95372,316887,PG,Should Investors Avoid Procter   Gamble  PG  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG   are down roughly 13  over the last year as the consumer packaged goods giant faces tougher competition from rivals and upstarts  With that said  earnings season could give Procter   Gamble a much needed shot in the arm  if it impresses investors 
One proven way for investors to benefit during earnings season is to find companies that are set to outperform earnings expectations  This tactic becomes even more important amid volatile market conditions 
In the case of Procter   Gamble  the company saw its organic sales lose steam earlier this fiscal year  However  Procter   Gamble  last quarter 
Now  as investors look to use quarterly earnings season to recoup from a rough couple of months  they need to understand how Procter   Gamble is actually expected to perform this quarter in order to see if a turnaround might be in store 
Outlook
Procter   Gamble s quarterly revenues are projected to climb 3 5  to reach  16 16 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Meanwhile  the CPG power is projected to see its earnings reach  0 98 per share  which would mark 2 1  growth from the year ago period   
Cleary  Procter   Gamble is projected to report some growth this quarter  but on their own  these top and bottom line estimates don t give investors nearly enough information 
Investors need to know if Procter   Gamble is expected to top our earnings estimate  Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season 
Procter   Gamble is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and sports an Earnings ESP of  0 58   The company has also experienced three downward earnings estimate revisions within the last seven days  Therefore  investors should consider Procter   Gamble a stock that could very well fall short of earnings estimates  and in turn  see its stock price continue to sink 
Procter   Gamble is expected to report its upcoming quarterly financial results before the market opens on Friday  April 20  just a few days before fellow CPG giant Kimberly Clark   NYSE KMB

95388,316903,PG,How Will Tax Reform Affect Buyback And Dividend ETFs ,opinion,"The performance of buyback ETFs has been moderate in the last one year as PowerShares Buyback Achievers ETF  has gained about 13 5  in the last one year  as of Feb 23  2018  versus the 15 9  rise in the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY    AX SPY    S P 500 buybacks fell  for the 12 month period ending September 2017 
Will Tax Reform Boost Buyback 
President Trump s administration passed a tax plan in December that mainly revolved around cutting corporate taxes and adjusting personal tax rates  The final tax version cuts the corporate rate from 35  to 21   read    
The Trump administration also proposed a move from the current worldwide tax system to a territorial system  allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without extra taxes  Investors are expecting tax savings to result in fatter and faster dividend hikes and more stock buybacks  read    
Are Hopes Too High  
As per an article published on Financial Times  400 earnings calls revealed that  intend to return cash to shareholders  while 44  plan to enhance capex and wages   A great deal of tax savings can also be used as debt repayments  Instead of higher payouts  if debt retirement becomes corporations  priority  especially in a rising rate environment  companies can produce a healthy leverage ratio 
Still   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analysts expect a greater overall amount of cash from tax savings to be dedicated to dividends and buybacks than capex   as quoted on Financial Times  Morgan Stanley s analysts are forecasting that 43  of the total tax savings will go to dividends and buybacks  30  will be shelled out on capex and employee compensation and just 8  will go to  balance sheet repair  
In any case  increase in returns to shareholders has already been an established trend  Tech behemoths  have been raising buybacks and dividends  against savings held offshore  
But then  if the global economy gains momentum  and central banks tighten policies faster  interest rates are expected to rise faster  So  accessing the debt market to finance buybacks would not be an easy task going forward 
Plus  investors should also note that the S P 500 is hovering around multi year highs and a loose fiscal policy  if at all it materializes  may spur stock rally even further  Amid such inflated prices  buying back their own shares may not be a great idea for the corporations 
ETFs in Focus
Whatever the case  investors can keep a tab on the following buyback ETFs 
PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio  looks to track companies that have implemented a net reduction of 5  or more in shares outstanding in the last 12 months  see    
Another buyback ETF SPDR S P 500 Buyback  NYSE SPYB  ETF   AX SPY   measures the performance of the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios in the S P 500 in the last 12 months 
Yet another fund iShares U S  Dividend and Buyback ETF  invests in U S  companies that return capital to their shareholders through dividends or stock buyback 
AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF  looks to generate long term capital appreciation 
Bottom Line  
Call transcripts of tech biggies did not evoke any enthusiastic on dividends and buybacks  But not every company has been stingy  as per Financial Times  The article revealed that Pepsi   NASDAQ PEP   plans to hike its dividend by 15   make a one time pension payment and speed up capital spending while Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG   raised its plans for share repurchases to  6  8 billion from  4  7 billion 
Overall  the outlook for buyback and dividend activity is neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic  It remains to be seen what decides the path of buyback ETFs   whether Trump s tax plan benefits the activity or if the Trump rally and an all time high corporate leverage come in the way of shareholder s value maximization

95410,316925,PG,Yen Whipsaws After BoJ And Aussie Tumbles On Trade Risk,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets    FOREX  The US dollar index traded slightly higher on Tuesday  in the aftermath of Congress voting for a temporary funding bill  thereby ending the US government s partial shutdown    STOCKS  Equities were in the green across the board  Japanese markets skyrocketed  with the Nikkei 225 and the Topix closing higher by 1 3  and 1 0  respectively  both indices reached fresh 27 year highs  In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng surged by 1 35   breaking another all time high  seemingly unfazed by increasing trade tensions between the US and China  In Europe  futures tracking the Euro Stoxx 50 are up 0 5   Last but not least  the equity winning streak in the US continued unabated  with the Dow Jones  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all closing at record highs once more  Futures tracking the Dow Jones  S P and Nasdaq 100 are all currently in positive territory as well    COMMODITIES  Oil prices traded higher  with WTI and Brent crude being up 0 6  and 0 5  respectively  Although there is no clear fundamental catalyst behind the moves  the advances are being attributed to signs that healthy global economic growth could strengthen demand for the precious liquid  In precious metals  gold was higher by nearly 0 3   last trading near  1336 per ounce  Major movers  Yen whipsaws after BoJ  Aussie tumbles on rising trade tensions
The Japanese yen whipsawed on Tuesday  in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan s  BoJ  policy decision  The BoJ kept its policy framework unchanged as was widely expected  while it upgraded its language around inflation expectations  which it now describes as  more or less unchanged  from  weakening  previously  This triggered a modest surge in the JPY  though the advance was short lived  with the currency giving back all its gains to trade even lower against its major counterparts after Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stepped up to the rostrum 
The Governor sought to reassure investors that there is no need to adjust the Bank s policy framework simply due to a rise in inflation expectations  as actual inflation remains far away from its target  Moreover  he poured cold water on expectations that the Bank is moving towards the stimulus exit door  noting that changes to day to day bond buying operations do not indicate the future course of monetary policy  Overall  the key message from the BoJ was that Japan s economy is gradually improving  but with inflation still so low  it is far too soon for markets to be speculating whether the Bank will scale back its massive stimulus program 
In the US  the government s partial shutdown ended yesterday after Congress voted in favor of a temporary funding bill that will keep public services running until the 8th of February 
The British pound surged on Monday  with sterling dollar briefly touching the 1 4000 mark before pulling back  with no major piece of news behind the advance  Market chatter suggests that sterling s recent gains are being driven by a repricing of the Brexit risk premium  amid signs that the negotiations are slowly but surely moving forward  and that the two sides may soon agree on a transitional Brexit deal 
Elsewhere  Aussie dollar plunged overnight  weighed on by signs of increased protectionism in the US  after President Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and certain washing machines  This prompted China to reply in strong rhetoric  condemning the US action  The risk of further escalation in trade tensions between the world s two largest economies appears to be high  and should China decide to reply in similar fashion  then the AUD could extend its losses  Given Australia s heavy trade exposure to China  anything that could harm the Chinese economy is considered as a negative for the Australian dollar  which is seen as a liquid proxy for  China plays   Day ahead  Business surveys  politics and corporate earnings on the horizon

EUR USD is currently trading not far below January 17th s more than three year high of 1 2322  The positively aligned Tenkan  and Kijun sen lines continue to point to a bullish bias for the pair  though the two lines getting flatter suggests that positive momentum in the short term is weakening  Turning to the stochastics  they are giving a bearish signal in the very short term  the  K line has crossed below the slow  D line and both lines are moving lower 
In case of positive momentum in German government coalition talks  euro dollar might receive a boost  In this case  the area around last week s three year high of 1 2322 would come into view as a potential barrier to the upside

95412,316927,PG,Should Value Investors Pick Procter   Gamble  PG  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Procter   Gamble has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Procter   Gamble s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Procter   Gamble has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Procter   Gamble stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Procter   Gamble has a P S ratio of about 3 3  This is marginally lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years As we can see  the stock is trading around its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Procter   Gamble currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Procter   Gamble a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Procter   Gamble might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives PG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current fiscal quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Procter   Gamble Company  The  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineProcter   Gamble is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors

95424,316939,PG,P G  Peltz vie for small investor votes in biggest ever proxy fight,news,"By Michael Flaherty NEW YORK  Reuters    The largest corporate proxy fight in history  between Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  and activist investor Nelson Peltz  may ultimately be decided by small shareholders like Tom Neubecker  The Cincinnati retiree is among the company s vast army of individual stock owners that collectively hold about 40 percent of the consumer goods giant  a much higher proportion than at most big companies  The majority of votes for or against the nomination of Peltz  chief executive and founding partner of Trian Partners  to P G s board will be cast by massive index investors such as Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc  N BLK   But small shareholders could tip the balance in a tight vote   As a result  both P G and Trian are spending unprecedented amounts of money and effort courting Neubecker and his fellow retail holders  by email  old fashioned paper mail and even social media   Like most individual shareholders who vote in corporate elections  Neubecker is backing management    A lot of us have the fear that if Peltz is successful  he will break up the company and cut back retiree benefits   said Neubecker  66  who keeps tabs on the P G proxy fight through an email group called  PNGeezers   made up of around 2 000 company retirees   Opposition from shareholders like Neubecker represents an uphill struggle for Trian  which wants to streamline the maker of Crest toothpaste and Gillette razors into three autonomous units  which the fund says will allow the company to react faster to market changes   P G  with a market value of  235 billion  has rejected that idea  saying its recent global reorganization is already creating value  Trian  where Peltz is CEO and co founder  disclosed a  3 5 billion stake in P G in February  The firm nominated Peltz to the board in July and put forward its strategic plan last month  P G rejected the election of Peltz to the board as an unnecessary disruption  Trian has said it is not seeking to break up P G or cut pension benefits  Nevertheless  Neubecker said he already voted online in favor of his former employer  ahead of P G s Oct  10 annual meeting when the final votes will be counted  Out of six small P G investors contacted by Reuters  four said they would vote with management   EVERY VOTE MATTERS Trian lost a proxy fight against industrial conglomerate DuPont  NYSE DWDP  in 2015  which the fund blamed on failing to win over large index funds and small investors   DuPont  clearly did a better job with the retail shareholder   Peltz told reporters after the vote  This time around  with even more small investors in play  Trian does not want to make the same mistake   Neubecker said he has seen several ads on his Facebook  NASDAQ FB  feed that link to Trian s  Revitalize P G  website and to videos of Peltz and former P G Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley  who is advising Trian   The video of Peltz features him sitting in Trian s Park Avenue  New York City headquarters  discussing P G s future  gripping a Trian labeled coffee mug that reads  Sales up  expenses down    In response  P G has called upon more than a century of product marketing experience with its own  Vote Blue  campaign  One YouTube video begins with an image of P G s blue logo and a banner proclaiming  Every Single Vote Matters    A narrator and series of slick images offer step by step instructions  ending by asking viewers to vote for the blue proxy card and to throw Trian s white card in the recycling bin   DELUGE OF PAPER It is not yet clear how effective the campaigns will be   Social media can definitely get you closer to the retail shareholder in a proxy fight   said Waheed Hassan at Alliance Advisors  which consults companies on mergers and proxy fights   Grabbing shareholders  attention and getting them to vote is a massive undertaking  Retail investors own 40 percent of P G s stock  or 1 1 billion shares  according to the company  more than DuPont s entire outstanding shares at the time of its proxy fight   P G s larger than normal retail base is due  in part  to long running stock based incentive plans for employees and the attraction of its well known brand names for  mom and pop  investors   Of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  P G has the fifth largest retail investor base  according to data from research firm Proxy Insight  which tallied retail and insider holdings of each company  Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   with a large portion of insider holdings  tops that list   To reach retail investors  P G has dispatched at least five mailings while Trian has sent at least three since the campaign started last month    The intent of both sides is very clear   said Frank Rhodes  84  who retired from P G in 1989 and lives in Crestview Hills  Kentucky  a short drive from the company s Cincinnati  Ohio headquarters   I just don t understand why they re sending all of this mail   Since August  Rhodes and his wife  who also worked at P G  have received hundreds of pages of proxy materials and more than 30 blue and white proxy cards   thanks to multiple stock accounts within the family   Rhodes  who mailed in his vote for management  said he has also received a Facebook message and two phone calls from each side  GETTING OUT EARLY Trian was first to get its proxy materials cleared by securities regulators  in July  giving it a slight head start on its campaign and the right to use a white proxy voting card  a color usually offered by management  The white card may appeal to retail investors  who often side with a company out of a sense of loyalty  and could even be mistaken for the P G card  proxy experts said   There is some strategic importance to the white card  so in that sense  Trian did kind of pick P G s pocket   said Damien Park of advisory firm Hedge Fund Solutions  Trian hit the Cincinnati media circuit early too  with Peltz giving interviews late in August  just prior to P G s rollout of CEO David Taylor to the local press   Both sides have to keep the pressure on until the end of the fight as shareholders can submit as many voting cards as they want but only the last one counts  Shareholder John Lame  who worked in P G s finance department  said he voted online for Trian  swayed by Peltz s industry experience  
 Around one third of the retail vote could change in the next few weeks   said Lame  now CEO of Lenox Wealth Management in Cincinnati  which manages the money of around 250 area families   As Trian has now made its case  people are saying   These guys make sense   ",2017-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pampg-peltz-vie-for-small-investor-votes-in-biggestever-proxy-fight-532354,532354

95440,316955,PG,What s In Store For Procter   Gamble  PG  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23  before market open  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 87  This consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 3 72  Factors to ConsiderProcter   Gamble has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years  Weak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting its sales  Soft consumer spending environment in developed markets  particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom  also adds to the worries  Overall  the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States like Dollar Shave Club and Harry s Razor in the male grooming category is likely to hurt the company s razors and blades  sales  Again  lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes That said  this conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product  packaging  and marketing initiatives in order to boost sales Although the company did not provide any sales guidance for the fiscal second quarter  Procter   Gamble remains positive and expects new product launches to improve sales in fiscal 2018  Its innovation led products like premium Olay and SK II products are creating higher demand and the trend is likely to follow in the to be reported quarter as well

total revenues is pegged at  17 34 billion  reflecting a sequential growth of 4 1   Revenues of the company are likely to increase 2 9  year over year Despite muted sales growth  the company has exceeded analysts  expectations for the 10th consecutive quarter  Procter   Gamble has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost saving plans in order to boost margins  thereby lifting profit level However  the company failed to expand margins in the last two reported quarters  as productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs  unfavorable geographic and product mix  and product reinvestments  Then again  the company s focus on reducing its SG A  selling  general  and administrative  costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending has helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent  The trend is unlikely to change in the to be reported quarter as well Overall  for the to be reported quarter  the company s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs that have heightened further by the recent hurricanes  The company expects higher commodity costs  including pulp  kerosene  ethylene  and propylene  to adversely impact its profitability by  300 million in fiscal 2018 Again  unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category is likely to impact margins further  Procter   Gamble s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades  due to increased competition from shave clubs  have affected its market share  Yet  productivity

95457,316972,PG,Ackman targets retail investors in ADP proxy contest,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss BOSTON  Reuters    Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman  whose firm owns an 8 3 percent stake in Automatic Data Processing Inc  O ADP   is turning up the heat in his proxy war for the human resources outsourcing company by targeting an often ignored but influential group of people   retail investors  The activist investor who spends much of his time meeting institutional shareholders in Wall Street boardrooms is now speaking directly to the Main Street investor through video  telephone and television as his proxy fight with ADP intensifies before the company s annual meeting on Nov  7  Ackman  51  began voicing his criticisms of ADP s performance in late August  Now  his campaign to get himself and two other nominees associated with his Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management hedge fund elected to the ADP board is taking a tack seldom seen in proxy contests  speaking to the company s retail investors to win their votes  Individual shareholders hold 28 percent of ADP shares while Ackman s Pershing Square Capital Management has an 8 3 percent stake of which only 2 percent is in common stock  Ackman s firm will be able to vote only the shares of common stock  Ackman  known for his presentations of 100 plus pages and hours long conference calls with analysts  will soon let retail investors who own as little as one share in ADP ask him anything they want  He is planning a conference call on a weekday evening at 8 p m  that will last as long as it takes  he said  A date has not been set   The usual method of dissident investors like Ackman is only to send letters to retail investors  which often end up in the trash  Earlier on Wednesday  Ackman released a video telling retail investors they hold the key to ADP s future and should send management a message at the November meeting that the status quo is no longer acceptable     Ackman in the video describes the company as a great business but one that is underperforming  He said he wants average investors to decide whether a large hedge fund manager like himself would add expertise in the boardroom  TAKING TO THE AIRWAVES ADP has rejected all of Ackman s critiques and said it does not need his help  ADP s Board is concerned that Pershing Square s extreme  swing for the fences proposals and unqualified nominees would disrupt client services and damage relationships  putting ADP   and the value of shareholders  investments   at significant risk   a spokeswoman said on Wednesday  Ackman has also taken to the airwaves  appearing on business channel CNBC s noontime show and with plans to appear on Jim Cramer s  Mad Money  show which is aimed at mom and pop investors  Proxy contests are traditionally decided by institutional investors like Vanguard  BlackRock and State Street with activists like Ackman making their cases behind closed doors  These three mutual fund firms are also the top investors in ADP and Ackman is also appealing to them to vote for him  Some have told him they would like the two sides to iron out their differences   Ackman will also visit proxy voting advisory firm ISS before it makes recommendations on how institutional shareholders may want to vote   But retail shareholders  often ignored in proxy contests because they traditionally back management or do not bother to vote at all  are now featuring prominently in a number of boardroom battles this year  Billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz is reaching out to them as part of his campaign to shake up consumer products company Procter   Gamble Co  N PG    Similarly  Ackman   who has both won and lost big proxy contests   needs the retail investor vote at this time  As the proxy contest has gained steam  a war of words is taking hold and Ackman is trying to change the narrative  ADP s CEO  Carlos Rodriguez  in mid August referred to Ackman as a  spoiled brat  in a CNBC interview  Ackman later said this upset his mother  who did not raise him as that  While Ackman s fund is losing money this year  he has earned an average 10 6 percent a year over the life of the fund   
Ackman said on Wednesday that to set the record straight  he does not want to control ADP  Rather  he thinks the company   whose shares have gained 22 percent in the last year   can perform better ",2017-09-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackman-asks-adps-retail-investors-to-back-him-in-new-video-531036,531036

95461,316976,PG,Factors To Weigh On Consumer Staples Stocks In 2018,opinion,"The U S  market is currently in good shape and favorable economic indicators are likely to aid the performance of consumer staples companies  However  the improved economic scenario may divert investors  attention from these defensive stocks to other lucrative counters 
Further  the Fed s recent rate hike may make the dollar stronger against a basket of currencies  which is likely to hurt overseas profits and create an unfavorable environment for emerging economies  Though some emerging markets have started to witness improved trends lately  risks associated with operating internationally continue to act as deterrents for consumer staples stocks 
Also  responding to consumers  rapidly changing preferences creates significant competition  price wars and an intense promotional environment  This remains a threat to margins  which have been squeezed for a while now  So  investors must assess the possible issues in the sector  before placing their bets 
Troubles Looming Over Consumer Staples Stocks 
Strained Margins 
Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins  stemming from various factors  These include tough grocery market conditions  rising input costs  costs associated with meeting consumers  changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars  From grocery chains like SUPERVALU  SVU   food companies like Campbell Soup to consumer products companies like Church   Dwight  CHD   Colgate  CL  and Kimberly Clark  KMB   all remain troubled by squeezed margins 
The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions  which became more pronounced after Amazon s takeover of Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM   Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals  which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples 
Also  customers are more inclined toward private label products  which are low cost alternatives to national brands  This  in turn is hurting food companies  Evidently  SUPERVALU has been facing stiff competition from grocery rivals in terms of innovative food offerings and related services  Going ahead  management continues to expect its business to be impacted by competitive pressure and price sensitivity existing in the market 
Input Cost Volatility
Input costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company  An increase in input cost directly hits the company s margins and profits  Moreover  any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away  We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs  which remains a concern for the future 
Evidently  Smucker has been struggling with the performance of its coffee segment  as price of green coffee  the raw material used in producing coffee  has been rising steadily for some time now  affecting this segment s profitability and gross margin  Consumer goods behemoth  Colgate also anticipates persistent pressure from increased commodity and packaging costs to impact gross margin 
Also  input cost inflation remains a cause of concern for Campbell Soup  Dean Foods  Church   Dwight and Kimberly Clark  In fact  Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials  including pulp and polymer resin  Input costs for some companies like Procter   Gamble  PG  have also increased lately due to the detrimental impact of hurricanes  However  this is likely to be just a short term hurdle 
Volatile Emerging Markets
The majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies  Thus  food beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India  China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per capita consumption  Another reason is the burgeoning middle class population with rising income levels  which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages 
Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects  they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues  Moreover  any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China  Brazil  Russia  remains a threat 
Higher Operating Expenses to Limit Profits
Consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising  As demand for staples is usually consistent  companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations  promotions and efficient marketing and advertising  Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition  it severely hits the profit margins of these companies  Also  efforts to keep up with consumers  changing needs entail significant costs  In this regard  costs related to e commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability 
Companies like Kimberly Clark  PepsiCo  PEP  and Procter   Gamble have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing  innovation  R D  supply chain and capacity additions  which may hinder profits  Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs  and it expects higher freight rates associated with the hurricanes to linger 
Competition Rife
Consumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation  pricing  brand strength  promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends  This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share  which in turn compresses margins and earnings  For example  Kimberly Clark s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity  which puts the company s market share at risk  Dean Foods also battles stiff competition  not only with various dairy processors for shelf space  but also with various beverages and nutritional products  Further  the beauty and beauty related products industry is highly competitive  which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products  NYSE AVP  and Coty 
Declining Volumes
Many consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth  which is hurting their top line  Mondelez s volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand  Further  growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of PepsiCo and Dr  Pepper  while it has also been hurting shipment volumes of smokeable products of bigwigs like Altria  MO  and Phillip Morris  Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products company  Dean Foods 
Government Restrictions
Tobacco companies like Altria Group  NYSE MO   Philip Morris and British American Tobacco  LON BATS  are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products  Per the court orders issued in November 2017  cigarette manufacturing companies will be forced to acknowledge the perils of smoking through corrective advertisements circulated via television channels  newspapers  websites  store displays and cigarette packs 
Moreover  in July  the FDA directed companies to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non addictive or minimally addictive levels  Additionally  cigarette consumption rates have declined globally due to precautionary labels and higher tax rates 
Further  the FDA had announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  In May 2016  the FDA expanded this restriction to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah alongside traditional tobacco products  Moreover  the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act which essentially states that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health 
These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and have significantly dented volumes  While this was for tobacco companies  alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations  Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries  Thus  rising fiscal pressure in the United States  European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries 
Bottom Line
Though the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems  does the sector have anything to offer to short term investors

95485,317000,PG,Reckitt bets on  smart  products to renew innovation mojo,news,"By Martinne Geller SLOUGH  England  Reuters     Reckitt Benckiser   L RB  is betting on connected consumer products as part of a push to show investors its innovative approach can still drive growth  In an interview at Reckitt s global headquarters outside London  Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor dismissed suggestions that a recent product failure signaled Britain s 12th most valuable company has lost its design mojo    Innovation for this company is cultural  It s in our blood  in our DNA   said Kapoor  who has a reputation for disciplined cost management  adding that detailed product pipeline reviews were conducted monthly like profit and loss assessments  The group s creative prowess is under scrutiny after last year s poor market response to a 60 pound   77  version of its Scholl electronic hard skin remover  which continued to hurt the company and contributed to its first ever quarterly sales fall last month  Even without one time items  which also included a June cyber attack and the collapse of its South Korean business  Reckitt s core health business slowed   Kapoor said the unit  which makes up half its annual sales following the  16 6 billion Mead Johnson purchase  remains strong and will benefit from new products   Reckitt will next month start selling a new brand  Siti  in China and India to help protect against outdoor air pollution  and is also launching a Fever Smart temperature monitor in Australia  Both comprise pricey monitors that can send data to smartphones aimed at prompting the use of company products   For Siti  that means face masks costing about 2 pounds each and fitted with a 20 pound vent that Reckitt says makes them perform better than existing choices  For Fever Smart  it would be a Nurofen tablet to lower a child s fever  Kapoor said these illustrate the new products in prospect at the maker of Durex condoms  Lysol cleaners and Mucinex cold medicine   There is a connected innovation pipeline for all of our brands   he said   Think about air fresheners or pest control solutions or multipurpose cleaning   REAL PROBLEMS Despite price tags of 99 Australian dollars   78  for the Fever Smart and 50 pounds for the Siti monitor  Kapoor thinks they will be successful because they are linked to solutions for real problems  Yet Reckitt s foray into smart devices comes as the market for wearable gadgets slows  CCS Insight predicts a 1 percent increase in the number of wearable gadgets shipped this year  versus 10 percent last year   It is not a secret that demand for smart wearables has been weaker than we  or anyone else  initially anticipated   said George Jijiashvili at the consultancy   He noted other companies also offer pollution monitors but said they will likely have niche appeal   Certain individuals who are very concerned about the air quality  especially those living in heavily polluted cities such as Delhi  are likely to seek out such devices   RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones said he had become more skeptical about Reckitt s product pipeline  especially after the failed Scholl skin file   The wider issue is not about one innovation going wrong  it s that one innovation went wrong and there was nothing else to fill the gap that it left   said Jones  who has an  underperform  rating on the stock  He said greater upside may be had elsewhere in the sector  which is being rocked as activist shareholders push Nestle  S NESN  and Procter   Gamble  N PG  to improve returns   Unilever   L ULVR  aims to boost performance after an aborted takeover proposal from Kraft Heinz  O KHC  and  Danone   PA DANO  is reportedly being targeted by an activist investor  INCREASED PRESSURE   I still think they  Reckitt  are an exceptionally managed company  but others are starting to do the same sort of thing from a much lower base   Jones said   Kapoor acknowledged the increased pressure on the sector as growth has slowed  He says it gives rise to two types of CEO   those who become activist targets and those who play that role themselves   The day I stop being the activist CEO in my company I should have an activist from outside    Reckitt shares have risen by more than 130 percent since Kapoor took over as CEO in September 2011  growing more than three times as much as the FTSE 100  though they are down nearly 6 percent since last month s results   Reckitt is moving deeper into consumer health  a market that Euromonitor International says is worth  217 billion  evidenced by the Mead Johnson deal and a healthcare development center being built in northern England   At 105 million pounds  the site in Hull slated to open in May 2018 is Reckitt s biggest such investment to date  Kapoor said he chose Hull to strengthen Reckitt s British roots  before Britons voted last year to leave the European Union   I did not support Brexit in a personal capacity   said Kapoor  He said he would have weighed Hull harder against other choices in Singapore and India if he had foreseen Brexit and remained concerned about its impact   Brexit happened  but we are steadfast   he said about the facility that should add about 250 employees to a local workforce of more than 800   We will continue  and get it done      1   0 7771 pounds

95528,317043,PG,U S  activist presses for  bold action  at Nestle,news,"By Martinne Geller and Michael Flaherty LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  activist shareholder Third Point LLC has targeted Nestle  S NESN  by taking a  3 5 billion stake in the food maker and urging Europe s most valuable company to boost returns as demand for its products weakens  Nestle shares jumped as much as 4 8 percent on Monday  touching a record high after Third Point disclosed its position late on Sunday in a letter to the hedge fund s investors  In the letter  Third Point said it was urging the Swiss group to improve margins  buy back shares and get rid of non core businesses  including its  27 billion stake in L Oreal  PA OREP   Third Point s 40 million shares    or 1 3 percent of the total    make it Nestle s eighth largest shareholder  according to Thomson Reuters data  The  10 billion added to Nestle s market value on Monday showed that shareholders hoped the investment would spark change at a company which has a reputation for being slow moving and insular   Nestle has arguably been lackadaisical and complacent and underperformed its potential   Bernstein analysts said   It might now be stirred into action by an external force    New York based Third Point is an  18 billion hedge fund run by American billionaire Daniel Loeb  Loeb runs a multi strategy portfolio though he is known as an aggressive  bare knuckled shareholder activist who has taken on major companies such as Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Inc   and Japan s Sony Corp  T 6758    Loeb and Nestle CEO Mark Schneider met in Switzerland earlier this month to discuss Third Point s ideas  according to a person familiar with the matter  Senior managers at Third Point  which started buying Nestle shares at the end of the first quarter  plan to meet again with Nestle leaders in the next few weeks  said the person  who wished to remain anonymous  Third Point s investment comes as Nestle and its packaged goods rivals grapple with slowing emerging markets  pressure on prices and consumers shifting from traditional brands toward healthier  fresher fare   Nestle has missed its long term sales target for four straight years  but so far has eschewed radical moves like Danone s  PA DANO   12 5 billion purchase of WhiteWave or Reckitt Benckiser s  L RB   16 6 billion Mead Johnson deal   The company has instead pushed slowly into healthcare  with a series of small investments and acquisitions that blur the boundaries of food and medicine  Nestle  which is based on the shores of Lake Geneva and makes Nescafe coffee  Maggi noodles and Gerber baby food  said it was committed to its strategy under new Chief Executive Schneider  who joined from German healthcare group Fresenius  DE FREG    As always  we keep an open dialogue with all of our shareholders and we remain committed to executing our strategy and creating long term shareholder value   a Nestle spokesman said   Beyond that  we have no specific comment   One top 40 investor said Nestle has done a good job adapting over the years to a changing industry  selling its stake in eyecare company Alcon and buying pet food business Ralston Purina and Wyeth Nutrition   The new CEO has been brought in with a mandate for change   the investor said  pointing out that Schneider is Nestle s first external CEO hire in nearly a century   We would prefer to let Schneider make his own decisions and judge him on the outcome than try to dictate what should happen    RECURRING PRESSURES  The move by Third Point cranks up pressure on Schneider  who arrived in January just before the sector was rocked by Kraft Heinz s  O KHC  abortive  143 billion approach for  Unilever   L ULVR    He has already been looking at ways to reignite growth  He has already scrapped the company s long standing sales target and said it might sell its U S  confectionery business  which includes brands such as Baby Ruth and Butterfinger  Nestle had a market value of  263 billion on Friday  making it the biggest traded company in Europe   The consumer goods sector  home to usually reliable sales and dividends  has seen its share of investor activism in the past with mixed results  Before Nestle  the latest big bet was the  3 5 billion stake in Procter   Gamble  N PG  disclosed by Trian Partners in February  U S  activist hedge funds have slowly cast their nets wider as corporate America becomes saturated with dissident shareholders seeking rapid changes to boost share prices    We feel strongly that in order to succeed  Dr  Schneider will need to articulate a decisive and bold action plan that addresses the staid culture and tendency toward incrementalism that has typified the company s prior leadership and resulted in its long term underperformance   Third Point said in the letter  It argued that Nestle should sell its 23 percent stake in French cosmetics firm L Oreal  L Oreal shares rose 4 1 percent on Monday   The letter also said Nestle should set a formal profit margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020 to help improve productivity  Nestle s current margin is 15 3 percent  below Unilever s 16 4 percent but higher than Danone s 13 8 percent  Third Point also recommended Nestle more than double its debt load  as well as sell the L Oreal stake  in order to generate the capital to buy back stock  Vontobel analyst Jean Philippe Bertschy said Third Point s suggestions echoed proposals long made by other shareholders   Previous management was not too open to listen to critics   he said   Now with Mr  Schneider  one of his top priorities was

95530,317045,PG,Trian takes off the gloves  aiming to put Peltz on P G s board,news,"By Michael Flaherty and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Reuters    Activist investor Nelson Peltz is seeking a seat on Procter   Gamble Co s  N PG  board  taking public his frustrations with the company s lagging stock price and railing against its  suffocating bureaucracy   Trian Fund Management LP on Monday announced the nomination of its chief executive and co founder Peltz  launching the largest proxy fight ever against a  223 billion consumer products juggernaut that sells everything from Tide detergent and Gillette razors to Pampers diapers   Peltz s nomination comes after five months of behind the scenes discussions between Trian and P G s top executives and board  according to the company s proxy filing  At one point  the two sides nearly struck a truce in May that would involve P G laying out certain performance metrics over the next year   But any sign of an agreement was absent on Monday when both came out swinging  The 180 year old company  founded on a hand shake agreement by a soap and a candle maker  issued a statement strongly backing its board and strategic plan  See Breakingviews column  Trian  which owns about  3 3 billion of P G s stock  or 1 5 percent of the company  has until an October annual meeting to convince fellow shareholders that Peltz deserves to be voted onto the board   The firm s campaign website  revitalizepg com  and press release has few immediate changes proposed for the company other than advocating for a geographic organizational structure that it believes will empower divisional leaders to make faster and better decisions  Shares of P G were up slightly at  87 72 in afternoon trade   Trian s previous battle with a consumer goods conglomerate was with PepsiCo Inc  N PEP   where it pressured the company to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division  a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace     That campaign began with Trian advocating Peltz for Pepsi s board and ended with industry veteran William Johnson joining as Trian s representative   In a CNBC interview on Monday  Peltz  75  talked more about Trian s track record with companies such as H J  Heinz than actual operational changes needed at P G  Peltz railed against the company s  suffocating bureaucracy   but noted he was on good terms with CEO David Taylor  Trian said it wants P G to cut costs more efficiently  and that it does not want to replace Taylor  any board directors  or to break up the company  Since Taylor became CEO in November  2015  P G s stock has gained 0 3 percent  In contrast  the S P 500 Household Products index   which includes Kimberly Clark Corp  N KMB  and  Clorox Co   N CLX   has risen 12 percent over the same period   P G s quarterly organic sales  which excludes acquisitions and divestitures  has fallen just once during his one and half years at the helm  For this year  the consumer goods giant expects a 2 3 percent rise in organic sales growth  BATTLE LINES The Trian P G battle comes as activist investors  emboldened by years of successful campaigns for changes at corporations across the U S  and abroad  use their growing coffers to seek bigger targets  Trian won two seats on H J  Heinz s board in its 2006 proxy fight  and lost its battle to get board representation at industrial conglomerate DuPont  N DD  in 2015   P G s proxy filing  disclosed on Monday  shows that Trian s dialogue with the company goes back to Feb  16  when Peltz called Taylor shortly after disclosing the stake to make the introduction and set up an in person meeting    I am quite surprised and very disappointed because I think David  Taylor  and I have developed a very positive relationship   Peltz told CNBC  when asked if he was surprised that the dialogue had turned into a proxy fight   I like the man    Trian said in a press release that its bid to get Peltz on the board centers on P G s continuing underperformance  costs  complexity and culture   OCTOBER ANNUAL MEETING With P G s annual meeting usually held in October  the two sides have roughly three months to discuss ways to avoid a shareholder vote on Peltz  If elected  Trian has said it wants P G to expand the board to 12 members rather than have Peltz replace a sitting director  P G s current board has six past or current CEOs  including  American Express   NYSE AXP  CEO Kenneth Chenault and Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman   P G has a best in class board of directors that is fully supportive of and actively engaged in overseeing the company s transformation   the company said on Monday  P G s proxy filing noted that last Tuesday  in a meeting between Trian and members of P G s board  Trian said it was moving ahead to elect Peltz because the company was not moving fast enough to improve its performance   P G directors at the meeting said they too were not happy with the performance  but that they felt that Trian s representation on the board was unnecessary in light of recent initiatives undertaken by the company   the filing said   In a bid to boost profits even as sales remain stagnant  P G has sold unprofitable brands  including 41 beauty brands to  Coty Inc   N COTY   and focused on core brands  However  the efforts have failed to boost the stock much beyond the level where it traded at the beginning of this year   Trian said that P G s last cost cutting plan  launched in 2012  failed to impact profit or sales growth  
Barclays noted on Monday that Trian is working with former P G CFO Clayt Daley  a consultant on the campaign who could become a potential board candidate to replace Peltz as part of the negotiations ",2017-07-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trian-seeks-seat-for-peltz-on-p-amp;g-board-506224,506224

95550,317065,PG,Exclusive  Aldi raises stakes in U S  price war with Wal Mart,news,By Nandita Bose WHEATON  Ill   Reuters    German grocery chain Aldi Inc is trying to beat the world s biggest retailer at its own game  low prices  Already with 1 600 U S  stores  Aldi s internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest priced rivals  including Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT   according to Chief Executive Jason Hart  He plans to maintain that gap going forward  His strategy  previously unreported  centers on adding more private label goods  which are a retailer s in house brands  to win over price sensitive customers  and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U S  grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014   Hart s plan calls for spending  1 6 billion to expand and remodel 1 300 U S  stores  and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida  Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018  He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed   We are re merchandising  remodeling  enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past   said Hart  who added Aldi s U S  sales have doubled in five years   Though it only accounts for only about 1 5 percent of the U S  grocery market  Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year  whereas Wal Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U S  sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year  according to analysts  Aldi s growth potential has competitors taking notice  Reuters reported in February that Wal Mart is running price tests in 11 states  pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about  6 billion to regain its title as the low price leader  For a graphic  click  Price wars are roiling the entire retail sector   from department stores to discount chains   but it is nowhere as intense as in the grocery sector  Beyond Wal Mart s move to match Aldi on price  German discount chain Lidl plans to open up to a 100 U S  stores in a year  and Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  is aggressively testing out various brick and mortar grocery formats along with growing Amazon Fresh  its grocery delivery service  For a graphic  click    We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before   said Scott Mushkin  managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst   Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors   Given Aldi s expansion  Lidl s entry  Wal Mart s response and Amazon s growing ambitions in this space  it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years   said Burt Flickinger  managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group  For more on Wal Mart s stock performance vs Amazon  click  L1N1IC270   GOAL  EVERYDAY LOW PRICING  Aldi  has a simple strategy to win more customers  everyday low pricing  according to Hart    We don t confuse our customers with yo yo discounts  sales  coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees   he said  Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates  although they did say Wal Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests   Depending on the product  Aldi s prices are cheaper than most rivals  private label items and even most branded items  analysts said  Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries   Aldi counts on its no frills shopping experience to help keep costs low  and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume  But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses  Hart said   Aldi and Wal Mart do no break out the figures  but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1 200 stock keeping units  SKUs  or type of products  90 percent of which are private label  Wal Mart stocks about 30 000 40 000 SKU s of products similar to ones Aldi sells  and only 30 percent of that are private labels  That different product mix can potentially make it more difficult for Wal Mart to adjust prices because it often first needs buy in from suppliers  and many times faces push back from packaged goods makers like Procter   Gamble  N PG    Unilever   L ULVR  and even smaller brands  Such vendors fear steep discounting can erode the value of their brands  analysts said  A Wal Mart spokesman declined comment  saying the company would not comment on a competitor s strategy  P G and Unilever did not respond

Procter   Gamble is speeding up innovations and investments to counter the softening industry growth  Its productivity improvements and cost saving efforts are also consistently helping to boost profit level  However  major foreign exchange headwind  weak volumes  divestitures and slowing market growth have been hurting sales 
A soft consumer spending environment in developed markets and uncertainties in emerging countries also add to the worries  Shares of Procter   Gamble have underperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry so far this year   8 2  vs   18 1   
 You can   
ADRs of PetroChina have declined  12 6  over the last six months  underperforming the Zacks International Integrated Energy industry  which has gained  6 2  over the same period  But with higher oil prices helping the state run giant report a jump in first half profits  the stock might return to favor 
The energy titan s biggest unit   exploration and production   swung to profitability as oil price soared 50   PTR also experienced strong natural gas demand  while operational optimization helped control costs  However  the analyst is concerned over China s decision to cut natural gas prices for industrial users that reduced margins in PTR s gas wholesale business 
A limited international operation and an ambitious investment program give investors more reason to be cautious on the stock  Hence  while being incrementally positive on PTR  the analyst expects the ADRs to remain soft

Shares of Buy rated Biogen have outperformed the Zacks Biomedicals Genetics industry in the last six months   14 8  vs   13 3    Biogen has a strong position in the MS market  backed by a wide range of products  Newly launched Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy is also off to a promising start 
Spinraza has witnessed faster than expected adoption in the U S  and Biogen is ramping up launch efforts outside the U S  The Zacks analyst is also encouraged by Biogen s efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s 
The company also spun off its hemophilia business in Feb 2017  which allows it to focus on neurology  its key area of expertise  Estimates have moved up ahead of the Q3 earnings results  The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters 
However  Biogen has its own set of challenges  Despite its position in the MS market  the emergence of new PML cases for Tecfidera are likely to weigh heavily on the stock along with pipeline setbacks  Meanwhile  the recent Ocrevus launch by Roche may create pressure on Tysabri s sales

95556,317071,PG,Pinnacle Foods Grows On Acquisitions Despite Industry Woes,opinion,"Shares of Pinnacle Foods  Inc   NYSE PF   have been underperforming of late  owing to underlying weaknesses in its Specialty segment and pickle business  The company s share performance has remained dismal since it released second quarter 2017 results on Jul 27  wherein sales were negatively impacted by the divestitures of its low margin businesses 
Further  shares of the company have also declined 3 5  in the past three months  compared with the  s fall of 1 5  
Investors seem to be disappointed with the company s murky sales surprise history  whereby it missed estimates in 10 out of the past 14 quarters  Being a leading marketer and distributor of canned meat  shelf stable pickles and frozen seafood  Pinnacle Foods has been struggling with consumers shift toward healthy and natural food products  Stiff competition  aggressive promotional spending and tight margins have also been bothering firms in the food industry 
Considering its ongoing challenges  Pinnacle Foods now expects earnings for 2017 to be at the lower end of its expected range of  2 55  2 60 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the forthcoming third quarter 2017 results as well as for 2017 has also declined by a penny to reach 58 cents and  2 55 respectively  in the past 60 days 

 
Nevertheless  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company remains hopeful on improving its performance backed by dedicated expansion initiatives  Let s now delve into some of the efforts undertaken by the company to improve performance and the factors from which it has been gaining 
Acquisitions Aiding Portfolio Expansion 
The acquisition of Boulder Brands  completed in January 2016  gave Pinnacle Foods a new growth platform for refrigerated foods and also added brands such as Udi s  Glutino  Smart Balance  Earth Balance and EVOL to the company s portfolio  The benefits from the acquisition are expected to be spread over 2017  in areas such as procurement  manufacturing and logistics  The company received synergies of  15 million from the acquisition of Boulder Brand in 2016  It expects to achieve the same worth  15 million in 2017 
The company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to expand its distribution network and customer base and boost long term growth  Few noteworthy acquisitions of the company in the past include Duncan Hines  Garden Protein and Wish Bone salad dressings 
Initiatives to Enhance Savings   Margins 
The company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain  In fiscal 2016  the company s operational excellence initiative drove productivity savings of 4   as compared with 4 4  in fiscal 2015 and 3 7  in fiscal 2014 
These productivity savings  along with higher pricing  have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins  The company continues to expect gross margin to improve 300 to 400 basis points by 2019 
In order to enhance gross margin  Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives  including the improvement of its product mix through innovation  The company has also been exiting from low margin businesses in order to utilize resources more efficiently 
In this respect  the company had undertaken divestiture of Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products in May 2017  and also closed down its Boulder UK operations in November 2016  Such rationalizing efforts have negatively impacted the company s top line of late  in the long run  These initiatives are expected to aid Pinnacle Foods to focus specifically on growth oriented businesses

95575,317090,PG,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Tyson Foods  Kellogg  Procter   Gamble  Kimberly Clark And J  M  Smucker,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 13  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 2  including Tyson Foods  Inc   NYSE   NYSE TSN        Kellogg Company  NYSE   NYSE K        The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE   NYSE PG        Kimberly Clark Company  NYSE   NYSE KMB       and The J  M  Smucker Company Inc   NYSE   NYSE SJM       Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 2Link  Companies in the Consumer Staples sector sell relatively low priced products used in daily lives like food  beverages and products for personal hygiene or household cleanliness  These stocks are considered defensive and are most trusted during periods of economic downturn An improving economy and rising consumer confidence have been driving the sector lately  However  serious concerns abound  North Korea s latest nuclear test has further raised geopolitical tensions and increased pressure on the Trump administration  Other headwinds like potential price wars  a competitive environment and slowdown in international markets may also hinder growth We understand that the sector will remain immune to market bumps and a few disruptive trends will probably persist  These might influence investment decisions  However  it should be kept in mind that the consumer staples sector has the potential to face the headwinds Market Scenario Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   increased considerably in August  after posting a moderate gain in July  In fact  August recorded the second highest reading since 2000  Encouraging manufacturing index  steady increase in housing prices as well as improving labor market owing to a gradual rise in wages also signal good health of the economy and indicate higher purchasing power  GDP growth also remains a driving factor Improving economy and a strong labor market is a key indicator of the U S  economic health and a critical tool for the Federal Reserve in deciding the interest rate hike  Keeping in view the favorable scenario  economists expect Fed to raise short term interest rates in 2017  most likely in December  It would be the third rate hike of the year Moreover  economists expect continuing strength in consumer confidence and indicate that expenditure could rise in the third quarter  which makes it a good time to pick consumer staples stocks  It is quite likely that higher consumer spending will continue to be the economy s primary engine of growth in the forthcoming quarters The encouraging data are well reflected in the three key U S  indexes  which have closed in positive territory so far this year  The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 10 5   while The S P 500 rose 10 2   Nasdaq grew 11 4  in the said time frame  The Zacks  sector  on the other hand  has registered an increase of 9 8  so far in the year Zacks Industry RankWe put our 265 designated industries into two groups  the top half  i e   top 132 Zacks Ranked industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the bottom 133 Zacks Ranked industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1  Click here to know more   The broader Consumer Staples sector is currently placed in top 31  of the Zacks Classified sectors  5 out of 16   It is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  260 industry groups   Agricultural Operation  Beverages   Alcohol  Beverages   Soft drinks  Consumer Products   Staples  Cosmetics  Food   Miscellaneous  Food   Meat Products  Food   Dairy Products  Food   Confectionary  Publishing   Newspapers  Publishing   Periodicals  Publishing   Books  Funeral Services  Soaps   Cleaning Materials  Textile   Apparel and Tobacco The majority of these are placed in the top half of the 260  industry groups  with Food   Meat Products and Beverages   Alcohol both carrying a Zacks Industry Rank  9  It is followed by Publishing   Books  which carries a Zacks Industry Rank  24  Beverages   Soft Drinks and Soaps   Cleaning Materials hold a Zacks Industry Rank  35  Publishing   Newspapers also fall in this category with a Zacks Industry Rank  74  Cosmetics and Consumer Products   Staples  each holds a Zacks Industry Rank  89  It is followed by Publishing   Periodicals and Textile   Apparel  each with a Zacks Industry Rank  105 The remaining few are placed in the bottom half of the group  While Tobacco holds a Zacks Industry Rank  169  Agricultural Operation carries a Zacks Industry Rank  180  Food   Miscellaneous and Funeral Services sub sectors have a respective Zacks Industry Rank  184 and  191  Food   Confectionary and Food   Dairy Products hold a Zacks Industry Rank  234 and  248  respectively Looking at the position of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the Consumer Staples space is positive  While increased competition and squeezed margins remain a major drag for these stocks  the companies in the sector are poised to benefit from cost cutting initiatives and lower energy input costs Earnings TrendsThe Q2 reporting cycle has almost come to an end with sectors like Energy  Basic Material and Auto showing weakness  On summarizing the performance of the 479 S P 500 members that have come out their financial results as of Aug 25  we see that total earnings improved 11 2  on a year over year basis  74 3  of the companies beat EPS estimates  while total revenue increased 5 6   68 4  beat top line expectations   per our  report Almost 87  of the S P 500 companies in the Consumer Staples sector have reported their results as of Aug 25  wherein 61 5  beat earnings estimates while 69 2  surpassed revenue estimates  While earnings rose 5 4  year over year  revenues increased 1 3  A few consumer staples stocks in the S P 500 cohort like Tyson Foods  Inc   NYSE       Kellogg Company  NYSE      and The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE      beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts You can see  On the other hand  companies like Kimberly Clark Company  NYSE       The J  M  Smucker Company Inc   NYSE      lagged earnings and revenue estimates Bottom LineThe current economic scenario is bolstering and the consumer staples sector is expected to grow on rising consumer spending and solid employment numbers  As a result  despite global headwinds  the sector seems attractive at the moment 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be tough  There s a simple way to invest in

TEVA Technical Analysis


TEVA opened trading yesterday at  17 88 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  15 50  TEVA closed trading yesterday at  18 50 and spiked up after market to  18 79  equivalent to a 20  increase from the previous day s closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time TEVA traded above these levels we have to go back to August 4th when it traded at  20 60 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up TEVA had been in an overall downward dating back to July 26th when it traded at  33 04  TEVA has a float of 909 68 million shares and traded 6 13 times the normal daily trading on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see TEVA open trading on Tuesday above  18 25 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 25 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

95579,317094,PG,Why Unilever  UN  Stock Is A Strong Buy For Growth Investors,opinion,"Unilever   NYSE UN   is in the midst of a strong run that has seen its shares skyrocket to a new all time high  New highs can sometimes cause investors to hesitate because they assume a stock will settle down  but our Zacks Style Scores can help investors find stocks that are still poised to grow  even as they sit near their historical peaks 
Almost any investor could benefit by sticking to stocks with strong Zacks Ranks and high grades in our Style Scores systems  But for growth investors  it takes much more than simply looking for stocks with the highest growth rates  Understanding and evaluating quality is essential as well 
This is where the Growth category of the Style Scores system comes into play  This category not only analyzes the growth prospects of a company  but also evaluates its corporate financial statements 
Studies have shown that stocks exhibiting the best growth characteristics consistently outperform the market  and if investors add a strong Zacks Rank on top of those growth fundamentals  the returns are even better 
With that said  let s take a look at Unilever  a high Zacks Rank stock that also grades out well in terms of Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system 
Unilever N V   UN  
Shares of the Anglo Dutch consumer packaged goods giant  which owns brands such as Dove  Lipton  Ben   Jerry s  Degree Deodorant  and many more  started to soar after a  143 billion merger attempt from Kraft Heinz   NASDAQ KHC   failed to go through 
Since then  Unilever s stock price has shot up 47 59  year to date and now rests just below its all time high of  60 81 per share  which it hit on Sept  11 
Unilever has flexed its muscles since the merger failed  The company posted a 22  increase in net profits during the first half of its fiscal year  and it has begun to bolster its brand portfolio by adding companies such as British based organic tea maker Pukka Herbs  which helps Unilever as consumers look for more eco friendly and healthy options 
The London headquartered company is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Unilever also sports an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  as well as an overall VGM grade of  A  
Unilever s projected EPS growth of 31 97  blows out the industry average of 7 71  and crushes Proctor   Gamble s   NYSE PG   6 46   The company also outpaces the industry with projected sales growth of 9 11   Unilever s 30 73  cash flow growth also helps to show that the company is on a solid growth trajectory  especially compared to the industry s 7 28  average 
The company also earned an  A  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system  This metric helps to indicate when the timing is favorable to enter a stock in order to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success 
Bottom Line
Unilever s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ranking and it s  A  grades for both Growth and Momentum help demonstrate that the company is in a solid position  both today and going forward  Despite recently hitting a new all time high  the CPG powerhouse might just be a stock to consider

After closing at  13 22 per share on Monday  Snap opened modestly higher at  13 33 on Tuesday morning  Nevertheless  the stock quickly surged to an intraday high of  13 82 and eventually settled near the  13 70 level in early trading hours Snap Inc  Price and Consensus   Tuesday s gains put the social media company on pace to see its first positive day after six straight negative trading sessions  which marks its second longest losing streak in its short history as a publicly traded stock 
 
Snap s longest losing streak occurred in early July and lasted eight trading days  Shares of the Snapchat parent lost nearly 15  during that decline  On Monday  the stock finished trading at its lowest closing price since August 16 
Snap has failed to generate any momentum since its March debut  and shares now rest comfortably below their IPO price of  17  Nevertheless  this latest slump comes on the back of an industry wide lull in the digital advertising space 
As Marc Pritchard  the chief brand officer at Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG    pointed out at a recent marketing conference in Cologne  digital advertisers seem to be running out of ideas and someone desperately needs to save the day 
 Bottom line  it is time for marketers and tech companies to solve the problem of annoying ads and make the ad experience better for consumers   Pritchard said  via  
Those bullish on Snap see the company s unique platform as an opportunity to be this hero  Although Snapchat s disappearing messages and  story  mode ideas have been copied throughout the social media world  its location based services are still relatively unparalleled  and it already has a head start with developing short and engaging branded content 
Nevertheless  the stock remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an overall VGM grade of  D   In comparison  its social media nemesis Facebook   NASDAQ FB   is currently rocking a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

95592,317107,PG,Procter   Gamble  Going Back To Growth,opinion,"Activist hedge fund manager Bill Ackman succeeded in 2013 in ousting Procter   Gamble s  NYSE PG  CEO Bob McDonald  It was noteworthy at the time because the company issued a strange memo repeating often verbatim answers to questions it posed to itself  Among them was if Mr  McDonald was fired or  as had been relayed publicly  he voluntarily retired  The memo merely thanked him for his 33 years of service and  notes the Company s improving business performance  
He was replaced by the man who picked him to be his replacement  A G  Lafley was P G s CEO from 2000 to 2009  He turned over control in the executive suite to McDonald who was groomed for years by Lafley  It was then a largely uncontroversial succession 
In 2012  however  McDonald was forced to undertake a massive cost reduction effort  The company aimed to reduce spending by  10 billion between that time and 2016  It had become apparent that growth in the developed world had stalled  an outcome that wasn t supposed to happen so long after the Great  Recession   Whereas recovery was thought to be literal  it took a very real detour around 2011 
Not only would P G turn toward managing costs  it would also try to rebalance its business toward emerging markets  The company was already taking about 30  of its sales from those regions at the time  and it wanted more as a way to get out of the US Europe rut  As McDonald said  

We are making the necessary adjustments to our growth strategy to increase focus on our core business and to achieve more balanced growth across geographies  product categories and the top and bottom lines 

It was  of course  the exact wrong time to be transitioning in that way  Emerging market economies long thought immune to the kind of growth slowdown then plaguing the developed world would starting in 2013 experience one  The  rising dollar  that followed would not only wallop these economies  it would make financial translation of revenues and profits derived from them hugely unfavorable 
So in July 2015  amidst  unexpected  global turmoil  Mr  Lafley was allowed to retire a second time  And for the second time in six years he would be replaced by a P G executive he had mentored for years  David Taylor was named CEO  and less than a year into his tenure he had announced a second  10 billion cost cutting program  the first only achieved about  7 billion of the planned reductions  
When Taylor replaced Lafley  revenue at the global consumer products giant was considerably less than when Lafley replaced McDonald  Despite being six years after the official end of the Great  Recession   revenue was lower in mid 2015 than at the worst of the global contraction in 2009  As of the latest earnings report  in 2017 sales are lower still 

What other choice does PG s management have  It hasn t seen sales growth really since 2008  There was a small recovery  mirroring the global economy at large  but only up to 2012 where it all fell apart almost everywhere around the world  delayed by  dollars  in EM s   There was no longer any place to hide  no special region from which to magically capture revenue growth  It was  as PG and its open door management condition witnessed  all risk with very little return 
In times of topline advance  companies focus on managing growth  are we able to produce at a rate consistent with demand  Are we undertaking the proper growth strategy  When there is no revenue growth  the bottom line is scrutinized to an unhealthy degree  from a macro perspective   An on individual basis  it cannot be any other way since profit growth remains the central goal  For the economy  it s a trap 

If Procter   Gamble was just some unique anecdote like IBM  NYSE IBM  or Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   a dinosaur  they say  being passed by the capitalist advance of innovation and sustainable evolution then we might not care that Big Blue s revenue chart is far too much like PG s  They are not isolated cases  however  far too representative of the actual economy  By any standard economic measure  especially corporate cash flow  we can appreciate the labor participation problem  either in the US fashion  or Europe s  in a way that has nothing to at all to do with Baby Boomers or opioids 

It is an economic climate far worse than even the massive contraction of late 2008 early 2009  That one was at least temporary  or thought to be  This downturn or slowdown is relentless and never ends  and even the most reluctant business has had to come to terms with it  Sure  it changes here and there from somewhat negative to somewhat positive  but it never attains momentum that might allow companies like PG or IBM to go back to growth  and these are real businesses that put in tangible statements what might be otherwise left to a limited sense of proportion to what is really going on 
These are more than just government statistics  they are very real circumstances where tomorrow can only include the next multi billion dollar cost cutting scheme  The media can talk about  all it wishes  but PG  IBM  and calculated wage gains show that there is no such thing  Corporate America is in no rush to hire anyone but the executive with the strategy for the leanest ",2017-08-01,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/hyping-lean-200204634,200204634
95593,317108,PG,Beauty Product Investing  Trends And Opportunities,opinion,"One of the most remarkable trends in the beauty and skincare marketplace over the past decade is the trend toward natural skincare products  In this article  we are going to explore a recent  entitled  Facial Skincare and Anti Aging US 2016   by Mintel  a leading market research firm  and the impact of the survey results on the future of the beauty and skincare segment and explore some of the largest publicly traded companies in the beauty and skincare market 
For investors looking to capitalize on the beauty skincare trend and the generational shifts between Baby Boomers and Millennials  it may be helpful to understand the size  based on 2016 sales figures  for some of the largest international beauty and skin care companies  L Or al is the largest company with yearly sales of approximately  27 6 billion  Unilever  LON ULVR  is second at  22 3 billion  followed by Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  at  18 billion  After P G  Est e Lauder  NYSE EL   and Colgate Palmolive  CL  round out the top five companies with sales of  11 3 billion and  10 7 billion  respectively 
It s not just affluent customers in the U S  that are driving this segment  skin care products represent about 40  of the Canadian skin care market  which is seeing extraordinary growth  According to a recent  by Euromonitor International   skin care  not colour cosmetics is expected to post the highest retail value sales and growth over the next five years   an estimated CAD2 6 billion by 2020   while other personal care markets such as the US  UK and Germany will see color cosmetics grow faster than skin care until 2020  
So what s driving this growth globally  Natural is one of the biggest trends in skincare  According to the Mintel report  one in seven  14 percent  consumers agree that pollution impacts the appearance of their skin  Factors such as hydration  44 percent  and diet  36 percent  impact skin s appearance more than using skincare products  26 percent   Another 38 percent agree that stress impacts the appearance of their skin  and as such  30 percent of consumers look for anti aging products that highlight anti stress claims 
 We have seen an unmistakable trend of customers asking for  homemade soaps crafted the old fashioned way  using organic and high quality natural essential oils  herbs and botanicals   says Sujoy Bhattacharya  Founder and CEO of Falls River Soap Company in Chagrin Falls  Ohio  specializing in handmade soaps for sale   people are increasingly looking for skincare products with ingredients they can pronounce  things they might find in a botanical garden or health store rather than a laboratory  
Another related trend shows the intersection between food and beauty in the skincare segment  consumers are most likely to be using or interested in using products with vitamin C  85 percent   fruit based ingredients  78 percent   oatmeal  78 percent  and honey  76 percent   72 percent of consumers use or are interested in using products featuring probiotics  There is an increasing blurring of the lines between different product categories  as moisturizers now increasingly integrate anti aging properties  sun protection now highlights its moisturizing properties  While anti aging is still the dominant segment in the skincare category  it saw sales decrease 6 3 percent 2014 15  Further  21 percent of consumers do not use and are not interested in using anti aging products compared to 18 percent of consumers who use them 
While lip balm saw sales increase 55 percent from 2010 14  the segment has faltered lately  in part  to competition from cosmetics  e g   tints  gloss  lipstick  with moisturizing and protective qualities cutting into sales  The cleanser segment is currently the fastest growing in the market  increasing sales 4 6 percent 2014 15 to reach  1 8 billion and anti aging products are losing market share to moisturizers 
For those seeking the  next big thing  in skincare  Mintel pointed the spotlight on no rinse cleansers  Only 8 percent of adults currently use cleansing waters  also referred to as micellar waters   this increases to 14 percent of consumers age 18 34  Consumers view cleansing waters favorably  with many agreeing that they are refreshing  45 percent   safe for sensitive skin  43 percent  and gentler  39 percent  than rinse off cleansers  However  there are some notable barriers to usage  nearly half  46 percent  of consumers perceive these products as more expensive than rinse off cleansers and 28 percent agree they have confusing usage instructions  These are not insurmountable marketing obstacles for this segment 
Mintel reported the overall facial skincare and anti aging market  comprising facial cleansers  facial wipes  facial scrubs  facial toners astringents  liquid make up removers  cleansing waters  lip balm  facial moisturizers  eye cream gels  acne treatment products  anti aging treatments  facial masks peels  facial serums  BB or CC creams  and facial oils  experienced a 1 4 percent decrease in sales in 2015  falling to  6 6 billion  with limited penetration among Baby Boomers affecting the entire category 
 Baby boomers do remain a very important market segment for our products   notes Bhattacharya   while they have the interest and resources for more aggressive anti aging solutions  there is a strong interest in skincare maintenance with simple down to earth ingredients

95600,317115,PG,Consumer Staples Stock Outlook   September 2017,opinion,"Companies under the Consumer Staples sector sell relatively low priced products that consumers use in their daily lives  like food  beverages and products for personal hygiene or household cleanliness  These stocks are considered defensive and are most trusted during periods of economic downturn 
An improving economy and rising consumer confidence have been driving the sector lately  although some investors seem skeptical about President Trump s policies  North Korea s latest nuclear test has further raised geopolitical tensions and increased pressure on the Trump administration  Other headwinds like potential price wars  a competitive environment and slowdown in international markets may also hinder growth 
We understand that the sector will remain immune to market bumps and a few disruptive trends will probably persist  These might influence investment decisions  However  it should be kept in mind that the consumer staples sector has the potential to face the headwinds 
Market Scenario 
Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   increased considerably in August  after posting a moderate gain in July  In fact  August recorded the second highest reading since 2000  Encouraging manufacturing index  steady increase in housing prices as well as improving labor market owing to a gradual rise in wages also signal good health of the economy and indicate higher purchasing power  GDP growth also remains a driving factor 
Improving economy and a strong labor market is a key indicator of the U S  economic health and a critical tool for the Federal Reserve in deciding on interest rate hikes  Keeping in view the favorable scenario  economists expect Fed to raise short term interest rates in 2017  most likely in December  It would be the third rate hike of the year 
Moreover  economists expect continuing strength in consumer confidence and indicate that expenditure could rise in the third quarter  which makes it a good time to pick consumer staples stocks  It is quite likely that higher consumer spending will continue to be the economy s primary engine of growth in the forthcoming quarters 
The encouraging data are well reflected in the three key U S  indexes  which have closed in positive territory so far this year  The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 10 5   while The S P 500 rose 10 2   Nasdaq grew 11 4  in that time frame  The Zacks  sector  on the other hand  has registered an increase of 9 8  so far in the year

95627,317142,PG,It s The Biggest Scandal In Tech  and No One s Talking About It  ,opinion,"A truly massive scandal is brewing in Big Tech 
This scandal concerns the fact that 60  of advertising  clicks  are in fact NOT coming from humans  they are generated bots or automated algorithms that don t buy anything  EVER 
If you don t believe me  and think I m just making this up  consider what Keith Weed had to say last month 
Weed is head of Marketing for the consumer goods giant Unilever  NYSE UN   In this role  he oversees a marketing budget of  8  BILLION per year  And here are his statements on the impact of bots in digital advertising 
With  8 4 billion in annual ad spend  the advertising industry pays attention when Unilever is unhappy  During the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity  Unilever s chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed outlined the three concerns that  keep him up at night  
 If you don t have your ad viewed  you are dead   Weed told a Cannes audience on Wednesday 
He wants advertisers to  join up the dots in the digital industry   As Weed sees it  this ecosystem is corrupted  Some 60  of traffic online is bots   We want to buy eyeballs of viewers not bots   says Weed   If it is too good to be true  it probably is  
Source  Mediapost 
What does this mean 
The Tech Giants  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   formerly Google   make the bulk of their money by charging advertisers a certain amount for every click the advertisers  ads receive online 
The price that Facebook and Alphabet can charge for advertising space is based on the amount of web traffic that ads receive  The more traffic these ads receive  the HIGHER the prices Facebook and Alphabet can charge advertisers for ad space 
So if 60  of ALL AD CLICKS are in fact BOTS  not HUMANS  the reality is that these ad prices are in fact MASSIVELY overstated 
Again  if you think I m making this up  consider that another consumer goods giant  Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  cut its online marketing budget by  100 million and found  ZERO IMPACT ON GROWTH 
Procter   Gamble Co  said that its move to cut more than  100 million in digital marketing spend in the June quarter had little impact on its business  proving that those digital ads were largely ineffective 
Almost all of the consumer product giant s advertising cuts in the period came from digital  finance chief Jon Moeller said on its earnings call Thursday  The company targeted ads that could wind up on sites with fake traffic from software known as  bots   or those with objectionable content 
Source  WSJ
Again  Proctor and Gamble cut online advertising by  100 million and had ZERO impact on its results 
These are two massive companies both of which spent BILLIONS in advertising  And both of them are stating point blank that the value of digital advertising via companies like Facebook and Alphabet is MASSIVELY overstated

Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM  is officially a tech company 
Whoever owns the data owns the world 
As the dust settles on the Amazon Whole Foods deal  I figured it s time 
Time for what 
It s time to reveal why Amazon bought the organic grocery store chain for  13 7 billion 
Hint  It s not because Whole Foods  salad bar is so darn tasty 
Nope 
Amazon plans to turn Whole Foods into a technology company 
Let me explain 
Amazon is the world s foremost  big data  company 
In fact  Amazon is in a race with Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  to claim the title of  world s largest database  
Data are the blood that supplies Amazon its oxygen 
The company leverages trillions of data points   millions per second   to serve you the juiciest ads 
Therefore  Amazon bought Whole Foods for one single reason 
The 400 existing Whole Foods locations will now exist solely to transmit data back to the mothership 
If you re a Whole Foods customer  you re now a data point for Amazon 
Also  if you work for Whole Foods  you now work for a data farm

Question  Martin  let s continue along the compilation of a library we re building here at Wall Street Daily  chronicling important catalysts  These are baseline concepts that every investor should know  Today we re going to discuss activist investors  So let s jump right in  Martin  what s an activist 
Martin Hutchinson  Activist investors are big shareholders  Typically they are individuals  but not always   since there are some institutions that do it  These investors use their share state to put pressure on management 
There are two distinct groups  One is investors such as hedge funds   who use activism as part of their investment strategy to maximize returns  And secondly  there are institutions and some individuals who use their shareholdings to pursue a political or social goal  For example  this divestment from disfavored regimes  A few institutions  such as CalPERS  the California teachers pay pension scheme  fall into both categories 
Question  Hutch  tell us a few techniques that these activists like to use to influence management 
Martin Hutchinson  There are a number of them 
One is a proxy battle  where they put a resolution to the shareholders meeting and try and get the shareholders  vote for it 
Then there s a publicity campaign among the shareholders  There are shareholder resolutions of one sort or another  Litigation  inevitably   when they sue management 
And then they can just go to management and negotiate with them   with the threat of doing other things if management doesn t do what they want 
Question  Interesting  So Hutch  as a shareholder  are activists on our side or are they working against us  What s the lowdown on that 
Martin Hutchinson  It s an interesting question  The second group of activists  the ones who are trying to make a moral point  distract management  So as shareholders  they re not your friend unless you believe the same moral point they do 
If you re neutral on the issue  you should probably vote against their proposals  By and large  following them will reduce shareholder returns  Otherwise management would be doing it already 
But keep an eye on these social goals activists  Because if a lot of their votes are winning  it s probably better to follow the herd  because all the rest of the big money s going to be doing the same thing 
For example  if the activists are telling you to sell Venezuela and tobacco   and they re successful in shareholder votes   then probably you want to follow the herd because the big money is going that way 
Question  And Hutch  what about the other group 
Martin Hutchinson  The first group of activists  the group that are trying to make money  hedge funds and such  they can be more useful to individual shareholders  Activist investors often outperform  so in other words  activism does work to a certain extent  By following them  you can outperform too 
It s especially useful in very large companies that are too big for takeover bids  For example  Nelson Peltz should be able to shake up Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   Procter   Gamble is something like  230 billion   too big to take over  But you can shake it up with an activist 
So the pluses of a big activist are they shake up a dozy management  they may produce a profitable spinoff and they may produce a tender offer for part of the shares or a big dividend or an outright sale of the company 
Question  How about a few of the downsides  Hutch  when an activist is involved 
Martin Hutchinson  The minus is they may recommend something stupid  They distract management  It s obviously costly to go through the process of shareholder resolutions and such 
They will tend to encourage management to overleverage the company  And they may indulge in  greenmail   which is where they get paid off to go away and other shareholders don t benefit 
Question  All right  Hutch  just give us the bottom line on activism   bullish or bearish 
Martin Hutchinson  It s probably not wise to chase after activists  There are too many people doing it for the modest benefit they bring  But if an activist buys into your company  Google his track record and try to determine whether he s made money for other shareholders  Because some activists do make money for other shareholders  and some don t 
Question  All right  Hutch  As always  thanks for your wisdom on the matter 
Martin Hutchinson  Great pleasure

95655,317170,PG,Can Coty s Acquisition Efforts Offset The Near Term Woes ,opinion,"Courtesy of acquisition strategies  product innovation and efforts to accelerate its e Commerce business  Coty  Inc    NYSE COTY   seems to be well positioned in the beauty industry  However  the company has been underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry and the broader  sector  The stock declined 30 7  in the last one year due to sluggishness  particularly in the Consumer Beauty segment  changing consumer preferences and increasing competition  In the said time frame  while the industry declined 15 9   the broader sector dipped 1 4  

Let s now look into the factors impacting the performance of this leading player in beauty industry 
Driving Factors
Coty holds strong position in fragrances and color cosmetics and has a strong regional presence in skin   body care  Therefore  the company continuously evaluates strategic acquisitions and new brand licenses to enhance its portfolio  It also consistently introduces new products in response to shifting consumer preferences  and markets new and established products through strategic advertising and merchandising  Further  the company is repositioning some of the brands in order to reconnect these brands with the consumers  building on their existing strong brand equity  These efforts are expected to steadily bring benefits to the company 
Coty also seeks to divest its non performing brands to focus and utilize its resources in other promising areas  Coty is also boosting its end to end digital transformation efforts including e Commerce across its divisions and regions 
Meanwhile  Coty has been undertaking acquisitions to boost sales and enhance its brand portfolio  In Apr 2017  Coty agreed to acquire the exclusive long term global license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances  cosmetics and skincare  which will help the company in expanding the its premium offering in the prestige fragrances and cosmetics categories within the Luxury portfolio  In Feb 2017  the company acquired a 60  stake in Foundation  LLC which held the net assets of Younique  LLC  The stake in Younique is expected to strengthen the consumer beauty division s color cosmetics and skin and body care product offerings  Last year  the acquisitions of Good Hair Day  which is popularly known as ghd  beauty business of The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   and the personal care and beauty business of Hypermarcas S A   known as Brazil Acquisition  have helped the company to expand its portfolio as well as capitalize on its customer base 
Headwinds
Of late  the company has been facing various challenges  Most of its segments and geographies are showing sluggishness  particularly the Consumer Beauty segment 
Though the acquisitions of the P G Beauty Business  Younique and the Hypermarcas Brands drove segment s sales by more than 100  in the recently reported third quarter fiscal 2017 results  organically  sales have declined 5   primarily reflecting a negative price and mix impact  offsetting volume growth and currency tailwinds 
We note that the segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges  especially in North America  driven by a combination of weak market trends across several of its categories and some reduction of shelf space for a few brands like Astor 
Increasing competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences are also hurting the industry  In particular  declines in the retail nail  color cosmetics and hair color categories in the U S  and mass fragrance in Western Europe and the U S  are expected to continue to impact its business and the recovery might take some time 
Estimates Going Down
Despite upbeat third quarter fiscal 2017 results  Coty has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last five quarters  Further  analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the last 60 days with estimates moving south  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter has declined from 11 cents to 10 cents over the said time frame Coty Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Coty Scorecard 
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the cosmetics industry may consider Estee Lauder Companies  Inc    NYSE EL   and Inter Parfums  Inc    NASDAQ IPAR    Both the stocks carry a zzZacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
While Estee Lauder has a long term earnings growth rate of 11 9   Inter Parfums has a long term earnings growth of 12 3  
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
It s not the one you think ",2017-07-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-coty's-acquisition-efforts-offset-the-near-term-woes-200199751,200199751
95668,317183,PG,Unilever s  Marmitegate  shows strain on consumer industry,news,"By Martinne Geller LONDON  Reuters    Unilever s push to raise the prices of its brands in Britain in response to a fall in the pound exposed the vulnerabilities of a company   and wider consumer brands industry   that can no longer count on selling more goods to deliver revenue growth   Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year  hit by falling household spending across the world  fierce competition from retailers  own brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets  The pound s plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like  Unilever   L ULVR   whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap  by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar traded commodities  Last week the Anglo Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain  prompting a stand off with the country s largest supermarket   Tesco   L TSCO   which balked at the demand  The dispute   which showed an early effect of Britain s decision to leave the EU   was quickly resolved  but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector  An executive at one of Unilever s main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets  A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost cutting options   Spirits company  Pernod Ricard   PA PERP  told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too  The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises   rather than increased volume sales   to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up  even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs  The day  Marmitegate  dominated the front pages of British newspapers  the company reported a 3 2 percent rise in quarterly sales   with a 0 4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3 6 percent increase in prices  It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices  This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets  which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs  and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market   How this conflict might play out is unclear  with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come   French food group  Danone   PA DANO   which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula  reported a 0 7 percent fall in third quarter volumes this week but  like Unilever  used price increases to drive a 2 1 percent rise in sales  Britain s Reckitt Benckiser s  L RB   which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises  reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday   Nestle  S NESN  also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday  with volumes slowing  Procter   Gamble  N PG  reports results next week   Unilever  Reckitt and P G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases  while Danone did not respond to a request for comment  WHY UNILEVER  Unilever is the No  1 supplier of ice cream  deodorants  bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries  and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years  which gives it pricing power   But industry experts said the company s request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive  and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases    We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can t see 10 percent   said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo   Unilever s pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be   Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies   It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers  Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales  with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales  Much of the company s third quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America   It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros   659 5 million  more expensive this year  with a large part of that coming from Argentina  Brazil and Mexico   Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents   product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain   The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business  pushing its shares down more than 6 percent   Trevor Green  head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder  Aviva   LON AV  Investors  expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman s team  telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years   Another Unilever investor  Swiss asset management firm GAM  said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now  
 If it s a quarter or two quarters  I m not worried   GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said   If it persists for more than four quarters  then yes  I would start to worry  ",2016-10-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unilever's-'marmitegate'-shows-strain-on-consumer-industry-433638,433638

95675,317190,PG,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Procter   Gamble  General Mills  Molson Coors Brewing And Kellogg,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 16  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 2  including Procter   Gamble Co   NYSE         General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS    NYSE         Molson Coors Brewing Co   NYSE        and Kellogg Company  NYSE K   NYSE        

	Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 2

	Link  

	The recent rebound in oil prices  encouraging employment picture  along with a gradual improvement in the manufacturing sector and housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode 

	Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   had increased sharply in February and March  However  it declined in April due to less optimism in the labor market  Despite the decline  we expect consumers to remain confident regarding the economy in the near term  This positive sentiment is hence likely to translate into higher consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic growth 

	While estimates for GDP growth increased marginally by 0 7  in the first quarter 2017  overall growth for the year is expected to improve from last year  GDP is expected to increase 2 3  in 2017 compared with 1 9  last year  The recent improvement in financial conditions is expected to contribute to the upside 

	This modestly above trend pace will further tighten the labor market  with the unemployment rate expected to decline to 4 3  by the end of this year and to 4 1  by mid 2018  That will help bump up inflation to 2  or higher over the next two years 

	However  currency fluctuations and other global headwinds might dent the performance of the companies in the consumer staples space  Given such headwinds  the staples sector seems to be quite a reliable and attractive area to invest in  as these stocks can lend stability to an equity portfolio due to the relatively consistent nature of consumer demand for the products 

	The sector may also appeal to income oriented investors because of relatively attractive dividend yield than the yields offered by many bonds  Many consumer staples stocks have successfully increased their dividends over time  Therefore  despite the disruptive forces  the consumer staples sector should continue to benefit riding on steady growth  dividend income  and low volatility 

	Now let s discuss some of the key factors that have been driving consumer staples stocks since the past few quarters  despite global worries  and also have the potential to boost earnings in the near term 

OPPORTUNITIES

Innovations

	Consumer product companies regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions  In fact  companies with innovative products in their pipeline will be in a position to benefit 

	Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter   Gamble Co   NYSE        and cereal maker General Mills Inc   NYSE         P G believes that consistent product innovation  supported by strong marketing and commercialization  will help deliver stronger results over the long term  Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co   NYSE        has also been launching new products to boost revenues and market share  These also help it to offset the impact of declining volumes  Molson Coors also invests in marketing and advertising to create brand awareness 

Transition to Health and Wellness and  Good for You  Products

	Consumer staples companies are also shifting focus from packaged food items to healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness  rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressure  Companies that can respond effectively to this healthy food movement appear to be well poised in 2017 or otherwise it may hamper their sales growth  For example  food manufacturer Kellogg Company  NYSE        posted sales miss in its recently reported first quarter of 2017 on industry wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

95677,317192,PG,Shares Of Colgate Palmolive  CL  Pop As CEO May Want To Sell,opinion,"On Wednesday  shares of leading global consumer products company Colgate Palmolive Co    NYSE CL   are popping  up over 5  to  75 25 per share in afternoon trading after the New York Post  that its CEO  Ian Cook  could be open to a sale 
According to sources with knowledge familiar with the matter  Cook would be open to selling the company for  100 a share  which values Colgate Palmolive at over  88 billion  The source said this price came at a meeting with institutional investors that occurred in recent weeks 
Colgate Palmolive  which is known for its toothpaste  soap  and deodorant brands  has struggled with slowing demand for its products  and rumors of a takeover have swirled for a while now  Notably  there has been talk of possible interest by Unilever   NYSE UL    the London based consumer goods giant that owns Dove soap and Hellmann s mayonnaise  among other products 
 We as a company     build value for our share owners and all the constituents in our company  And that is what we will focus on and let the rumors and speculation take care of itself   Cook said at Colgate s annual meeting last Friday when an investor asked what he would do if Unilever made an offer 
Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG   could potentially make an offer as well  as activist investor Nelson Peltz owns a stake in Colgate s rival and may want to angle towards consolidation  Other possible bidders include Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and Kraft Heinz   NASDAQ KHC    which is owned by Warren Buffett and Brazil s 3G Capital

95682,317197,PG,Consumer Staples On The Edge Of A Break Out,opinion,"Consumer Staples are not sexy  Toilet paper  laundry detergent  diapers  milk  bread   you need them every day no matter what is going on in the world  the companies that make these items are also not sexy  Clorox Company  NYSE CLX   Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS    mega cap companies that usually offer a good size dividend to compensate for low growth  Not a place that day traders usually look for exciting stocks 
But Consumer Staples can shed some light on the state of the economy and confidence of consumers  These companies do not have high margins  but they are massive  so growth in the economy falls right to the bottom line  And right now the ETF that tracks Consumer Staples is sitting at an all time high 

After printing a double bottom from November into December  the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLP  is up 11   It has consolidated the gains over the last 3 months while sitting at the all time high  This has allowed momentum indicators to reset lower  The RSI pulled back from an over bought condition and held at the base of the bullish zone  Over the last 3 weeks it has been moving back higher  The MACD also reset from an extreme level down to near zero  It too is now crossed up and moving higher  Keep an eye here  A break to the upside not only signals a run higher in the ETF but renewed strength and confidence in the economy

95698,317213,PG,Should You Buy The Dip In Procter   Gamble Via ETFs ,opinion,"One of the most famous names in the consumer products world   Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG     came up with mixed to downbeat results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Naturally  shares remained muted post earnings  Let s delve a little deeper into the results and assess what could be done with P G shares in the coming days 
Procter   Gamble s 3Q17 Earnings in Focus The consumer staple giant s 3Q17 adjusted earnings of   beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 94 by 2 1   The bottom line also increased 12  from the prior year quarter  Currency neutral core EPS improved 15  
P G s reported net sales of  15 61 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 71 billion by 0 7   The top line also declined 1  year over year  Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2  on sales 
Organically  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestitures and foreign exchange   revenues grew 1  on the back of a 1  increase in organic volumes  Core gross margin decreased 40 bps to 50 5  as productivity cost was more than offset by headwinds like an unfavorable geographic and product mix 
Management maintained its organic sales growth projection in the range of 2 3  for fiscal 2017  However  the company expects the combined foreign exchange headwind and minor brand divestitures to hurt sales by 2 3   Hence  P G expects all in sales growth to remain down 1  to flat  earlier flat  for fiscal 2017 
The company has beefed up its guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90  to approximately 95  for the fiscal year 
Consumer ETF ImpactThanks to mixed results  shares of PG dropped about 2 6  in the last two trading sessions  as of April 27  2017   The loss also reflected in the ETF world  with consumer staples funds being slightly hurt  Many of the key funds in this segment have a double digit allocation to the consumer product giant  suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on P G s performance Let s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter   Gamble  read    
Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund The most popular consumer ETF on the market  XLP  follows the S P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index  The fund invests about  9 billion of assets in 39 holdings  Of these firms  the in focus P G takes the first spot  making up roughly 12  of the assets  The fund lost about 0 9  in the last two trading sessions  as of April 27  2017   see  here  
Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF This fund manages a  3 65 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 103 consumer stocks  The product charges a low fee of 10 bps per year from investors  Here too  P G is the top firm with 10 7  allocation  VDC retreated about 0 9  in the last two trading sessions  as of April 27  2017  
iShares U S  Consumer Goods ETF This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U S  Consumer Goods Index  giving investors exposure to the broad consumer staples space  The fund holds about 115 stocks in its basket with AUM of  721 6 million  Like the other two  the stock under consideration occupies the top position in the basket with 9 93  of assets  The fund shed about 0 9  in the last two trading sessions  as of April 27  2017 
Bottom Line
Even though PG had a downbeat quarter  its impact on the rest of the consumer staples market wasn t felt that much  Plus  the Zacks Industry Rank of Procter   Gamble is in the top 5   This calls for a buy the dip strategy for the ETFs having significant exposure to PG   
However  investors should also keep in mind that the wind is not in favor of the broader sector  The Zacks Sector Rank is in the bottom 38   So  we need to keep a track on earnings of other staples giants before being bullish on the afore mentioned ETFs  Till then it is better to remain on the sidelines  read

95699,317214,PG,Consumer Staples Stock Outlook   May 2017,opinion,"Can the Consumer Staples Sector Retain Its Mojo 
Stocks in Consumer Staples have maintained their defensive stance during periods of economic crisis  Companies in the sector sell relatively low priced products that consumers use in their daily lives  like food  beverages and products for personal hygiene or household cleanliness  The purchase of these basic supplies is generally stable  irrespective of the spending patterns or whether the economy is expanding or contracting  Thus  the sector has been a consistent performer over time 
Market Scenario
Currently  the economy is in good shape  Lower oil prices and declining unemployment along with a resurgent housing market suggest that the economy is on a recovery mode  Domestic economic progress and a boost in infrastructure spending under President Trump s administration bode well for the sector 
Though consumer confidence declined in April  we expect consumers to remain confident regarding the economy in the near term  This is likely to translate into higher consumer spending  GDP growth is also expected to improve in 2017 from last year  owing to recent improvement in financial conditions 
This is also evident from the 6 4  year to date  through May 10  2017  rally in the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLP   XLP   Year to date  shares of consumer staples sector were up 7 8   compared with the S P 500 s 7 3  gain 
In fact  the bullishness is also reflected in the major key U S  indices  which have closed in positive territory on a year to date basis  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  climbed 5 9  to 20 926 57  while the S P 500 rose 7 2  to close at 2 398 87 
These factors signal growth in the economy  which will likely boost consumer spending   a key driver for the staples sector  However  a few disruptive trends will probably persist  which might influence investment approaches  There will also remain uncertainties related to Trump s policies and over the timing at which the Federal Reserve will raise short term interest rates  which will keep investors on their toes 
Zacks Industry Rank
The broader Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at bottom 19  of the Zacks Classified sectors  13 out of 16   We rank all the 250 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   
As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top one third of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle one third  or industries with Zacks Industry Ranks between  89 and  176 is  Neutral   and the bottom one third  or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  
The Consumer Staples sector is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  260 industry groups   Agricultural Operation  Beverages   Alcohol  Beverages   Soft  Consumer Products   Staples  Cosmetics  Food   Miscellaneous  Food   Meat Products  Food   Dairy Products  Food   Confectionary  Publishing   Newspapers  Publishing   Periodicals  Publishing   Books  Funeral Services  Soaps   Cleaning Materials  Textile   Apparel and Tobacco 
A number of these are placed in the top one third of the 250  industry groups  with Food   Meat Products carrying a Zacks Industry Rank  12  It is followed by Soaps   Cleaning Materials  Consumer Products   Staples and Tobacco carrying a Zacks Industry Rank  23   44 and  50  respectively  Funeral Services and Cosmetics also fall in this category  with respective Zacks Industry Ranks  65 and  69 
Quite a few fall in the middle one third  with Beverages   Alcohol and Beverages   Soft  each holding a Zacks Industry Rank  93  It is followed by Food   Confectionary  Publishing   Books  Agricultural Operations  Publishing   Periodicals  each with a Zacks Industry Rank  108 
The remaining are in the bottom one third of the group  While Publishing   Newspapers carries a Zacks Industry Rank  179  Food   Dairy Products and Food   Miscellaneous sub sectors have a respective Zacks Industry Rank  192 and  219  Textile   Apparel  holding a Zacks Industry Rank  246  is also in the bottom one third 
Looking at the position of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the Consumer Staples space is mixed  Though the companies in the sector are poised to benefit from cost cutting initiatives and lower energy input costs  increased competition is a major drag for margins 
Earnings Trends
As earnings season picks up pace  investors seem to be happy with the way the quarter has shaped up  The reported figures show a stark improvement from the preceding quarter  At present  sectors like finance  technology  industrials  basic materials and business services look promising  The pace of growth is likely to be maintained in the second quarter as well 
On summarizing the performance of the 412 S P 500 members that have come out with their financial results as of May 5  we see that total earnings improved 14 2  on a year over year basis  73 3  of the companies beat EPS estimates  while total revenue increased 7 3   67 7  beat top line expectations   per our  report 
About 75 0  of the S P 500 companies in the Consumer Staple sector have reported their results  wherein 66 7  beat earnings estimates  while only 29 2  surpassed revenue estimates  While earnings rose 4 8  year over year  revenues declined 0 1   Consumer Staples stocks appear to be struggling in terms of revenue  probably due to a difficult sales environment  According to the report  the sector is expected to record top line growth of 4 0  and earnings growth of 4 4  this season on a margin increase of 0 1  
Some Consumer Staples stocks in the S P 500    like McCormick   Company  NYSE MKC   Inc   MKC   Kimberly Clark Company  KMB   General Mills  NYSE GIS   Inc   GIS  and The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   PG     recently reported their quarterly numbers  wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missed  Church   Dwight Company  Inc   CHD   carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   exceeded earnings and revenues in its recently reported quarter  You can see e 
On the other hand  companies like The Kraft Heinz Company  KHC  and Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   Inc   TSN  lagged their earnings and revenue estimates 
Bottom Line
Consumer behavior pertaining to spending patterns and taste preferences has changed significantly over the years  This usually alters the earnings numbers for some large packaged food manufacturers  Companies that respond promptly to the changing choices are expected to retain their advantage in 2017 
Also  the economy seems to be growing on the back of higher income and solid employment  The sector is also expected to grow on rising consumer spending 
However  an improvement in the economy will encourage investors to venture out of the defensive Consumer Staples  as the sector is viewed as a safe haven during periods of market volatility or economic downturns  Nevertheless  for the time being  the sector can safeguard risk averse investors against an economy which is not free from global headwinds yet

	This is also evident from the 6 4  year to date  through May 10  2017  rally in the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLP   Year to date  shares of consumer staples sector were up 7 8   compared with the S P 500 s 7 3  gain 

	In fact  the bullishness is also reflected in the major key U S  indices  which have closed in positive territory on a year to date basis  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  climbed 5 9  to 20 926 57  while the S P 500 rose 7 2  to close at 2 398 87 

	These factors signal growth in the economy  which will likely boost consumer spending   a key driver for the staples sector  However  a few disruptive trends will probably persist  which might influence investment approaches  There will also remain uncertainties related to Trump s policies and over the timing at which the Federal Reserve will raise short term interest rates  which will keep investors on their toes 

Zacks Industry Rank

	The broader Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at bottom 19  of the Zacks Classified sectors  13 out of 16   We rank all the 250 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit    

	As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top one third of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle one third  or industries with Zacks Industry Ranks between  89 and  176 is  Neutral   and the bottom one third  or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  

	The Consumer Staples sector is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  260 industry groups   Agricultural Operation  Beverages   Alcohol  Beverages   Soft  Consumer Products   Staples  Cosmetics  Food   Miscellaneous  Food   Meat Products  Food   Dairy Products  Food   Confectionary  Publishing   Newspapers  Publishing   Periodicals  Publishing   Books  Funeral Services  Soaps   Cleaning Materials  Textile   Apparel and Tobacco 

	A number of these are placed in the top one third of the 250  industry groups  with Food   Meat Products carrying a Zacks Industry Rank  12  It is followed by Soaps   Cleaning Materials  Consumer Products   Staples and Tobacco carrying a Zacks Industry Rank  23   44 and  50  respectively  Funeral Services and Cosmetics also fall in this category  with respective Zacks Industry Ranks  65 and  69 

	Quite a few fall in the middle one third  with Beverages   Alcohol and Beverages   Soft  each holding a Zacks Industry Rank  93  It is followed by Food   Confectionary  Publishing   Books  Agricultural Operations  Publishing   Periodicals  each with a Zacks Industry Rank  108 

	The remaining are in the bottom one third of the group  While Publishing   Newspapers carries a Zacks Industry Rank  179  Food   Dairy Products and Food   Miscellaneous sub sectors have a respective Zacks Industry Rank  192 and  219  Textile   Apparel  holding a Zacks Industry Rank  246  is also in the bottom one third 

	Looking at the position of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the Consumer Staples space is mixed  Though the companies in the sector are poised to benefit from cost cutting initiatives and lower energy input costs  increased competition is a major drag for margins 

Earnings Trends

	As earnings season picks up pace  investors seem to be happy with the way the quarter has shaped up  The reported figures show a stark improvement from the preceding quarter  At present  sectors like finance  technology  industrials  basic materials and business services look promising  The pace of growth is likely to be maintained in the second quarter as well 

	On summarizing the performance of the 412 S P 500 members that have come out with their financial results as of May 5  we see that total earnings improved 14 2  on a year over year basis  73 3  of the companies beat EPS estimates  while total revenue increased 7 3   67 7  beat top line expectations   per our  report 

	About 75 0  of the S P 500 companies in the Consumer Staple sector have reported their results  wherein 66 7  beat earnings estimates  while only 29 2  surpassed revenue estimates  While earnings rose 4 8  year over year  revenues declined 0 1   Consumer Staples stocks appear to be struggling in terms of revenue  probably due to a difficult sales environment  According to the report  the sector is expected to record top line growth of 4 0  and earnings growth of 4 4  this season on a margin increase of 0 1  

	Some Consumer Staples stocks in the S P 500    like General Mills  Inc   NYSE       and The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE           recently reported their quarterly numbers  wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missed  Church   Dwight Company  Inc   NYSE        carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   exceeded earnings and revenues in its recently reported quarter  You can see     

	On the other hand  companies like The Kraft Heinz Company  NASDAQ        and Tyson Foods  Inc   NYSE        lagged their earnings and revenue estimates 

Bottom Line

	Consumer behavior pertaining to spending patterns and taste preferences has changed significantly over the years  This usually alters the earnings numbers for some large packaged food manufacturers  Companies that respond promptly to the changing choices are expected to retain their advantage in 2017 

	Also  the economy seems to be growing on the back of higher income and solid employment  The sector is also expected to grow on rising consumer spending 

	However  an improvement in the economy will encourage investors to venture out of the defensive Consumer Staples  as the sector is viewed as a safe haven during periods of market volatility or economic downturns  Nevertheless  for the time being  the sector can safeguard risk averse investors against an economy which is not free from global headwinds yet

General Motors  have been strong performers over the past year  the stock is up  14 2  vs   9 9  for the Zacks Auto sector    11 9  for Ford   though they have struggled lately  The Zacks analyst likes the company s capital allocation strategy  investments in plants in the U S  and emerging markets  product launches and focus on technology development 

	Moreover  the company s focus on capital deployment is expected to boost shareholder returns  However  the automaker is under pressure due to lower U S  vehicles sales in 2016  a recent settlement related to the 2014 ignition switch recall and a large fine by China for monopolistic pricing behavior  Quarterly estimates for the company are also going down lately   You can   

	Shares of Procter   Gamble outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in the past year   8 9  vs   2 2   on the back of improved organic sales and improving margins as a result of productivity gains and cost saving efforts  Also  P G shares have outperformed the S P 500 index in the year to date period  up  6 8  vs   5 2    P G s quarterly results exceeded expectations 

	On the flip side  the Zacks analyst points to mature end markets and the negative impact of the strong U S  dollar as some of the headwinds for the stock  Also  flat pricing mix is reflective of increased competition and lack of transformational innovation  The company also lost global market share in three of its five reporting segments   You can     

Goldman Sachs  outperformed the Investment Brokers industry over the past six months   34 5  vs   24 2    while its focus to capitalize on growth opportunities through strategic moves  including its new digital consumer lending platform  should continue to bolster its overall business  Also  the company is poised to benefit from its disciplined expense management and solid capital position  However  several issues including sluggish global economic growth and a stringent regulatory landscape remain near to medium term headwinds   You can

The blue chip Dow futures lost 17 points  or 0 09   by 10 53AM GMT  or 6 53AM ET  the S P 500 futures fell 3 points  or 0 14   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 5 points  or 0 11  
The European banks took another leg down on Tuesday as the stress tests announced late Friday continued to put downward pressure on lenders in the region 
Italy s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  MI BMPS   the world s oldest bank  continued to suffer from concerns over its non performing loan  NPL  portfolio  while rival Unicredit  MI CRDI  suffering contagion from similar worries 
Germany s Commerzbank  DE CBKG  added to worries after launching a profit warning that it blamed primarily on negative rates implemented by the European Central Bank  ECB   while news that Swiss lender  Credit Suisse  Group AG  SIX CSGN  and German banking giant  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  will be dropped from an index of Europe s top 50 blue chip companies next week levied a further blow to the embattled sector 
In another obstacle to bullish sentiment in stocks  investors were disappointed by details of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s fresh stimulus package 
The package includes 13 5 trillion yen   132 billion  in fiscal measures  while actual new  direct spending will total about 7 5 trillion yen  most of it over the next two years 
While the headline figure for the package totals 28 1 trillion yen  it includes public private partnerships and other amounts that are not direct government outlays and thus may not give an immediate boost to growth  according to market analysts 
Stateside  traders looked ahead to key U S  data later Tuesday to gauge the health of the world s largest economy and whether it is strong enough to warrant a rate hike later this year 
The Commerce Department will release its core personal consumption expenditure  PCE  index for June at 12 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET  The Fed s favorite gauge of inflation is expected to remain at 1 6  year on year  still below the central bank s 2  target 
At the same time  markets will see the latest measure of consumer health with the release of personal income and spending  also for June 
A string of weak data in the prior week caused market participants to take the possibility of a rate hike this year off the table 
Fed funds futures are currently pricing in just an 18  chance of a rate hike by September  December odds were at 42 7   compared to 53  at the start of last week

95743,317258,PG,P G Q2 Earnings Beats Forecasts,opinion,"Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  Posted Positive Earnings For Its Second Quarter For Fiscal 2017  Investors Should Keep Monitoring Its Stock Performance In The Market 
American consumer good company Procter   Gamble Co  released its second quarter earnings report for fiscal 2017  beating most forecasts set for the company  The report was published before the opening of markets on Friday 

 Stronger top line performance in the first half of the fiscal year is enabling us to increase our organic sales growth outlook for the full year   another step towards the levels of balanced top line  bottom line  and cash flow growth that will consistently put P G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry   stated P G Chair  President  and CEO David Taylor 

Second Quarter EarningsP G has reported earnings of  1 08 per share  or 4  increase  surpassing analyst forecasts of  1 06 per share increase for the October   December quarter 
The net sales for the quarter was at  16 9 billion and although sales were unchanged from the previous quarter and the same period last year  while the diluted net earnings per share was at  2 88  surging 157  higher from the previous year  Organic sales and organic volume experienced a boost in all the five business subsidiaries of the company  with an increase of 2  each  However  there was a 2  decline under the foreign exchange sector 
Under the grooming segment  a 1  increase was added to the sales  Shave Care performed well in organic sales outside the US  seeing low single digits globally  Health care saw a good boost of 7  under higher organic volume from Oral Care and Personal Health Care  while the Fabric and Home care  organic sales also climbed 1  from the previous year report  Under Baby  Feminine  and Family care  a 1  incline was also added 
Most increases seen on each segment of the company came from product innovations and better marketing support  developed and performed by P G throughout the quarter 
Meanwhile  the company s operating cash flow was at  3 billion  with an adjusted free cash flow productivity of 82  
P G benefitted most from its Beauty brands  like brands Pantene and Head   Shoulders seeing 3  increase for the Beauty organic sales  Most of the boost came from the Hair Care and Skin   Personal Care sector 
P G has raised its sales growth projection to around 2 3  from the previous earlier forecast of 2  for fiscal 2017 
Stock ActivityShareholders received a total of  1 8 billion as dividends for the second quarter  and P G repurchased a total of  1 5 billion of common stock with exchanged shares with a value of  9 4 billion under the Beauty Brands sector

However  on the Monday session  P G lost its gains from the Friday session  closing in at  86 96  losing 0 56  of its previous gains in the market  P G s RSI was at level 68 81 during the release date of Q2 earning  but before the stock could reach level 70 on the index and bounce back from an overbought status  the stock started declining on Monday and is currently at level 64 45 
P G currently has a  3 Zacks  Hold  ranking 
ConclusionInvestors can remain bullish on P G s performance  since the company has been delivering to its promises for the past quarters  with consistent company performance and positive earnings reports  Procter   Gamble has exhibited promising profit growth with continuous market leading sales ",2017-01-24,FSM News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/p-g-q2-earnings-beats-forecasts-200173380,200173380
95744,317259,PG,Nicked By Rivals  Gillette Shaves Prices,opinion,"Gillette is shaving its prices by as much as 20 percent and focusing on its less expensive products to compete with cheaper rivals  such as Dollar Shave Club  And the move is rattling investors   The Wall Street Journal 
But Clinical Professor of Finance  at the University of Maryland s Robert H  Smith School of Business foreshadowed the razor giant s move  calling price sensitivity for personal products  the new normal  in this October 2015 piece     
For years  Gillette owner Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  had thrived by charging a premium price for premium brands  Kass said  Then  things changed  More and more people began treating consumer goods like interchangeable commodities  P G  Kass says  has been slow to adjust 
 It s basic economics that manufacturers like Procter   Gamble could raise their prices when their goods were relatively inexpensive   Kass said 
That s because  up to a certain price point  people don t pay much attention to price increases of a dime or two  At those levels  the demand for things like razors and detergent is inelastic  to use the economic terminology  People will buy what they want despite small price moves  However  Kass added   Procter   Gamble has raised its prices to the point where demand is becoming elastic  
Kass noted in 2015   exorbitant  prices for Gillette razors were leading people to seek out lower cost substitutes  such as generic razors or the low cost Dollar Shave Club  which was acquired by Unilever  LON ULVR   Executives might be inclined to say price sensitivity is a temporary blip  caused by the recent recession  But with the economy steadily improving  it appears that price sensitivity is the new normal 
To bring prices into line with those of its competitors  Kass said  P G will have to make its manufacturing processes significantly more efficient or reduce its profit margins on razors ",2017-04-05,David Kass,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/nicked-by-rivals,-gillette-shaves-prices-200181320",200181320
95760,317275,PG,U S  stocks cautious ahead of Fed  oil surges 3 ,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks wavered in the first part of Tuesday s session  trading mixed and close to flat in apparent precaution ahead of the Federal Reserve s  Fed  policy decision on the following day and after a flood of earnings and worse than expected macro data 
At 15 59GMT  or 13 59ET  the Dow Jones slipped 2 points  or 0 01   while the S P 500 edged up 4 points  or 0 17   and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite traded down 6 points  or 0 12  
Larger moves in the main indices may have been muted by caution ahead of the Fed policy decision on Wednesday 
Though no one is expecting a rate hike  investors will focus on the statement to see if language changes hint at the possibility of a move in June 
Even so  a CNBC survey released on Wednesday showed that Wall Street experts on average expected the Fed to wait until August 
Amid the flood of earnings on Tuesday  DuPont  NYSE DD  was a notable outlier as the chemicals and seed producer beat consensus with first quarter earnings and upped its full year outlook  leading the Dow higher with a gain of more than 2  
Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  and 3M Company  NYSE MMM   however  led the decliners in the blue chip index as the consumer products giant cut the top range of its profit forecast and missed on revenue  while the post it making conglomerate was unable to convince investors despite beating on first quarter earnings 
After the close  most eyes will probably be on Apple s earnings report as the tech firm is expected to report its first drop in sales in 13 years 
However  fellow blue chip index  AT T  NYSE T  will also been releasing its latest quarterly business figures 
On the economic front  total durable goods orders rose less than expected  while core orders unexpectedly fell 
Further underlining concerns over the health of the U S  economy  American consumer confidence deteriorated more than expected in April  according to a report from the Conference Board 
Additionally  the S P Case Shiller composite index revealed a lower than expected increase in house prices during the month of February 
Preliminary data from Markit also showed that the activity in the services sector increased less forecast in April 
Meanwhile  oil seemed unfazed by the constant flow of news concerning the supply gut as black gold was on track for a monthly gain of 14  in April in what would be its largest monthly gain in a year

95767,317282,PG,5 Stocks To Watch Before The Market Opens,opinion,"Under Armour Inc  NYSE UA   Under Armour    has remained focused on building its brand through strategic partnerships  key endorsements  expanding its DTC business  and its most recent foray into wearable technology  Just last week  Under Armour announced a deal with the MLB to outfits its teams with uniforms starting in 2020  Any major sporting license is a huge win for Under Armour  let alone one with America s greatest pastime  Meanwhile  the company continues to expand its catalogue of endorsements which includes  Stephen Curry  Tom Brady and Dwayne  the Rock  Johnson 
But no one category has grown faster than international sales  Last quarter the segment jumped 68   helping to push total revenue over the  1 billion mark for a fourth consecutive quarter  Under Armour spent some time in China this summer to help promote the game of basketball and its star athlete Stephen Curry  As they become more of a household name overseas  expect to see top line growth accelerate 
There still remains several near term headwinds that could impact Tuesday s report  It s becoming increasingly accepted that the athletic apparel sector should start to edge down over the next several quarters  The space is becoming saturated which has forced more frequent discounting  thereby compressing margins  The top names like Nike  NYSE NKE   Under Armour and even lululemon athletica inc  NASDAQ LULU  no longer have pricing power over the consumers  explaining the poor bottom line growth 
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Caterpillar    has watched earnings and revenue steadily decline over the past year despite recording a few better than expected reports along the way  The state of industrials in the country has reached an all time low due to weak commodity prices  waning demand  outsourcing and global uncertainty 
Caterpillar  in particular core businesses such as construction equipment  power systems and mining  suffer as a result  Fortunately  expectations have been set so low for the sector that it s ever so small improvements have pushed the stock higher  Shares are up over 25  this year as the company slowly returns to profitability  Investors are expecting that the ongoing cost controls and global expansion will help propel the stock even if earnings are subpar 
JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU   Major airlines kicked off earnings season with mixed results  Many of them exceeded expectations on the bottom line but missed on the top due to weak travel demand and increasing competition  The discounters have fared slightly better in this environment given their narrowed focus on offering cheap domestic flights 
JetBlue     however  hasn t been the beneficiary of this ongoing trend  Shares are down 18  this year after multiple quarters of negative growth and falling PRASM  The key PRASM metrics decreased over 10  last quarter  much worse compared to some of the major airlines  According to the company  this metric is expected to decline in the range of 3 4  for the third quarter  JetBlue should receive a boost from low oil prices and the summer travel demand 
General Motors  NYSE GM    is the first major car maker to report third quarter earnings and will likely set the tone for Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  who reports later this week  The automotive industry  GM included  was on the rise until recently thanks to cheaper gas prices and greater demand  Weakness in the oil industry have helped move high margin vehicles such as trucks and SUVs  This is likely to ease a little as the oil industry and gas prices have started to pick up in the second half of the year 
GM should be able to offset some of this with its focus on global expansion and strategic partnerships  The car maker is seeing strong results in China as a part of its focus on emerging market  Meanwhile  its partnerships with Lyft provides the carmaker with a pathway to the sharing economy 
Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   Procter   Gamble    has been adversely impacted by the broader pullback in the consumer staples industry  Both earnings and revenue have failed to keep up with market growth rates thanks to ongoing currency headwinds  weak volumes  and weaker demand 
Exchange rates and global uncertainty have been the biggest headache seeing as roughly 60  of its business is generated outside North America  As the dollar continues to surge relatively to other major currencies  we can expect to see revenue wind down  Greater cost controls and productivity savings should provide some relief to the bottom line which is forecasted to come in flat compared to a year earlier ",2016-10-25,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-before-the-market-opens-tomorrow-200160451,200160451

95769,317284,PG,Why The Turn In Consumer Staples Could Be Real,opinion,"Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLP  stocks  those of companies whose products you use every day like Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  and Clorox Company  NYSE CLX  had a solid run higher from the 2009 low 
They continued to rise almost uninterrupted until the beginning of 2015  That is when they changed character to a sideways consolidation  They dipped in August when the market swooned and then quickly recovered to the consolidation zone where they churned until February 
After February though they started higher again  They reached a peak in July and then started a pullback  No mere consolidation this time  the pullback has lasted almost 4 months at this point  But the last couple of days may be showing signs that the worst is over and Consumer Staples are ready to move higher 

The first thing to note is that the ETF that tracks Consumer Staples  XLP  had found support at the 200 day SMA to start September  It gave up that support at the beginning of October and it became resistance  with additional horizontal resistance at 52 50 
The pullback now found support at a 50  retracement of the last move higher  The ETF jumped up from that that Tuesday and is sitting just beneath the 200 day SMA  As it does the RSI has tuned up and is moving over the mid line  The MACD has also crossed up and is rising 
There are 3 things to watch to confirm if the Consumer Staples are ready for another run to the upside  First is continuation of the RSI over 60 into the bullish zone  The second is the MACD moving up into positive territory  The third and most important is the price moving up over 54  Until then it is a good start

95784,317299,PG,Beyond The Presidential Election  3 Disruptive Market Trends   ,opinion,"Historically  the year of a presidential election has been a turbulent one for the stock market  As per data provided by a Market Watch report  in presidential election years  the S P 500 has posted an average return of 6 5  versus 7 9  in non election years 
It was worst in 2008  coming less than two months after the U S  mortgage crisis hit  which led to the Great Recession  The market plummeted about 41   The recession bug had also started eating into market returns by that time 
3 Critical Trends to Be Watchful of Before Betting on Stocks
Although the table will turn in U S  politics  can we hold this impending change as entirely responsible for a choppy market that has prevailed for over a year  Election related ambiguity apart  there are quite a few long term factors dragging the equity markets down and can also be treated as direct signals of a muted economy with further trouble ahead 
Accordingly  we suggest investors look beyond the presidential election and be cautious of these extremely perilous market trends that may jeopardize their portfolio returns 
Significantly High Consumer Debt Level
With consumers increasingly using their credit cards and spending aggressively like ever before  credit card debt alone is projected to reach a record  1 trillion by the end of the current year  As per data released by personal finance firm WalletHub  in the second quarter of 2016 itself  Americans added  34 4 billion to their credit card debt  nearly half the total added throughout 2015 
On the other hand  debt holders paid down just  27 5 billion  the smallest amount since 2008  This apart  the Fed s expectation of raising rate once in the balance of 2016 would again swell up the economy s indebtedness  According to the Fed  this havoc credit card debt when combined with other consumer debts like auto loans  mortgage loans and other debt are expected to flare up the average Americans   total household indebtedness  to the recessionary stage in only a few months from now  Notably  the average indebted household balance already rose to  7 817 in the second quarter  just  611 below the level recognized by WalletHub as  unsustainable  
Rising Treasury Bond Yields
From the Brexit induced historically low levels reached a few months back  the U S  10 Year Treasury Bond Yield has finally started to rebound  It rose from 1 35  on Jul 8 to 1 7  on Sep 19  a 26 basis point expansion   primarily on the back of an improving labor market data  The yield curve should steepen further with the Fed Chair recently declaring the possibility of a rate hike before this year ends to help the banking system 
These can well ring a warning bell for the global equity market  Such raises attract trading   by both existing and new investors   toward treasury bonds  leading to a bloodbath in the stock market  Data shows that since 1954  the average monthly performance of the S P 500 is 1  when the 10 year yield is lower than the year before  The S P return is only 0 4  when yields are on the rise  Seeking Alpha  
Real Unemployment Still High
As per the latest data by the U S  Department of Labor  the unemployment rate moved down to an impressive level of 4 9  in June and has stayed there  While this reflects recovery at the face level  the inner story is quite different  As per many economists  taking only one parameter as the sole indicator of employment is nothing but  oversimplification  of the whole scenario  We actually need to look past this official number 
As per the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  since 2010  the full time employment level  at 35  hours per week  is steady at around 48   the lowest ever since 1983  To reach an impressive 52  level  at least 10 million new good jobs are required  Total employment  however  is increasing at a snail s pace  In fact  as per a report in the Guardian  while total employment grew just 3 700 in May 2016   the weakest since Oct 2013  full time employment fell 0 11   marking the fourth successive month of decline  This deteriorating real labor market scenario should also remain our focal point before making any investment decision  
These three trends apart  there are many other long term factors that can also be treated as direct signals of further trouble ahead  These indicators include the historical low number of business startups that is beginning to take a toll on the economy and the rapidly dropping numbers of companies trading on U S  exchanges  Gallup  
Iconic Investors Smell Trouble 
In fact  the recent bizarre asset shedding by some of the most influential investors of the era is making us more sanguine about a bumpier track ahead  It has been observed that  when the rest of the nation is excited about signs of a gradual recovery in the economy following months of downturn  billionaire investors like Warren Buffett  Jim Rogers  George Soros and many others are selling their stake in equities incalculably 
Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa     released a significant part of its holding in Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and Kraft Foods Group  NASDAQ KHC   Inc  among others  In the beginning of the second half of 2016  Buffett was seen sitting on a cash pile of more than  72 billion   his biggest stack in the 40 years that he has been in charge of the company  Stocks that Buffett is still holding on are big banks like Wells Fargo   Co    NYSE WFC    U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB   or American Express Company   NYSE AXP    He also holds a significant share of The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   
Bottom Line
Of course  it is natural for investors to try ironing out immediate concerns  However  the collapse that the stalwarts are apprehending is perhaps based on far more bigger factors than the China slowdown  the Brexit  the oil price related bankruptcy or even the presidential election which most of us are musing on these days 
According to the latest Total Wealth Research report  this kind of cash piling by investment behemoths is extremely unusual and indicative of a Wall Street crash down the line  CIA s Financial Threat and Asymmetric Warfare Advisor Jim Rickards has shared a similar view on a series of dangerous economic trends pointing to a  super critical state  of the economy 
And as per a report by John Whitefoot  selling off stake is a legible decision  considering that the underemployment rate is still at an unacceptable rate of 14 6   wages are stagnant  personal debt levels are high  and frustratingly  one out of seven Americans are still on food stamps  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP  ",2016-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beyond-the-presidential-election:-3-disruptive-market-trends-200156788,200156788

95803,317318,PG,U S  consumer  housing data underscore economy s resilience,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  consumer confidence improved in January despite a stock market rout and house prices accelerated in November  suggesting underlying strength in the economy despite a sharp growth slowdown in recent months 
There are  however  signs the malaise from manufacturing and export oriented industries is starting to filter into the services sector  with data on Tuesday showing activity in that vast sector hit a one year low in January 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to 98 1 this month from 96 3 in December as households shrugged off January s stock market sell off and focused instead on a strengthening labor market 
 Households remain quite upbeat about the economic prospects and  given the importance of consumer spending to overall domestic activity  the resiliency in household sentiment will be seen by the Federal Reserve as good news   said Millan Mulraine  deputy U S  chief economist at TD Securities in New York 
Consumers remained optimistic about the labor market this month  The share of households anticipating more jobs in the months ahead increased 13 2 percent from 12 4 percent in December  while the proportion of those anticipating fewer jobs fell slightly 
Though the share of consumers expecting an increase in incomes rose to 18 1 percent from 16 3 percent last month  there was a slight increase in those expecting an income reduction 
Other details of the report showed the proportion of consumers claiming jobs are  plentiful  fell to 22 8 percent from 24 2 percent in December  However  fewer households believed jobs were  hard to get   a sign the labor market continued to tighten 
Labor market strength  marked by a 5 percent unemployment rate  prompted the Fed to raise interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade  The U S  central bank is due to announce its latest rate decision at 2 p m  EST  1900 GMT  on Wednesday after a two day policy meeting 
While stock market volatility has diminished the chances of another rate hike in March  economists expect the Fed will increase borrowing costs in June 
A separate report showed the S P Case Shiller composite home price index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5 8 percent in the year to November  adding to a 5 5 percent increase in October 
House prices rose 0 9 percent in November from October on a seasonally adjusted basis  Home prices in Dallas  Denver and Portland  Oregon are now at record levels  the report showed 
Still  home prices nationally remain 4 8 percent below their record level from July 2006  before the housing market crash  although they have climbed 29 2 percent from their post recession bottom in January 2012 
 While continued price increases will begin to impact affordability  they are necessary to encourage sellers to list their homes for sale   said Kristin Reynolds  a U S  economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington  Massachusetts 
 Improving demographics and higher incomes  in combination with moderate price appreciation and inventory expansion  are consistent with our expectation for continued balanced improvement in the housing market  
SOFT PATCH
U S  stocks rallied on Tuesday  buoyed by a recovery in oil prices and better than expected quarterly profits from 3M Co  N MMM  and Procter   Gamble Co  N PG   The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies and prices for U S  government debt fell 
The economy has hit a soft patch as dollar strength  spending cuts in the energy sector and faltering global demand undercut manufacturing  mining and export oriented sectors  Efforts by businesses to reduce an excessive inventory build has also put pressure on economic activity 
The drag from these sectors appears to be spilling over to the services industries  In a third report  financial data firm Markit said its flash U S  services PMI business activity index slipped to 53 7 this month in January  the weakest reading since December 2014  from 54 3 in December 
While service sector firms continued to report improving domestic economic conditions and rising client demand this month  some suggested that spending cutbacks across the energy sector had a negative impact on their business activity 
The survey also showed some firms complained the buoyant dollar remained a headwind to growth at the start of 2016 
 Up until a few months ago  it had seemed that the weakness in the economy was isolated in certain areas  mainly energy  manufacturing  and exports  The recent deterioration in the services PMI is an unfavorable development   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  N JPM  in New York 

In a fourth report  the Philadelphia Fed said its non manufacturing business conditions index fell three points to 21 4 in January  Firms reported a decline in new orders received  shrinking order books and sales ",2016-01-26,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-consumer,-housing-data-underscore-economy's-resilience-381788",381788

4 U S  Stocks Going for Gold as Rio Olympics Begin

As fans  athletes and officials await the final moments of the countdown to the Rio Olympics  the event s key sponsors are also looking on expectantly  The quadrennial event is not just the world s largest such activity in sporting terms  it also attracts record sponsorship amounts every time 

The amounts involved at the very top are often stratospheric in nature  For instance  spots at the Olympic Partners  TOP  program  featuring the cr me de la cr me of sponsors have gone for nearly  200 million at the current edition  Naturally  sponsors look on with bated breath to see whether the campaigns they are betting on are delivering the necessary buzz 

Rio Battles Controversies

Every edition of the Olympics has been marred by a range of controversies However  Rio has been an exception  since troubles have dogged it from the very beginning  Construction of various facilities was running behind schedule for quite some time 

Attention then shifted to the Zika virus threat  with several key contestants withdrawing for fear of contracting the disease  Following this  the economy of Brazil slumped  and political instability continued until recently  However  now that the Olympics are about to begin  focus has shifted to the teams and participants who are already in Rio 

Focus Shifts to the Positives

Players are feeling enthused by the tropical surroundings  Additionally  several officials who have travelled to Rio during the preparations stage reported that they have not encountered many of the problems that were being talked about 

Additionally  this is not the first time that the city has hosted an event of a similar scale  Events which saw successful completion at this venue include the 2014 soccer world cup  Besides  there is the annual carnival which attracts nearly a million tourists on every occasion  TripAdvisor still puts Rio at the third place on its list of leading destinations for South America for this year 

Perils of Ambush Marketing

For sponsors  the challenge is to derive maximum value from their investments in the event  The key to this is also the execution of their campaigns related to their sponsorships and their success may not be related to the amount spent on the event  The rival campaigns of Adidas  DE ADSGN  and Nike  NYSE NKE  at the 2012 London Olympics are a good example of successful and not so successful campaigns 

In London  Adidas  sponsorship amount touched nearly  156 million for which it secured official sportswear partner rights  On the other hand  Nike spent a much lower sum to provide outfits for the Brazil national teams for both the London and Rio games  Often  such a move is referred to as ambush marketing  For the event  Nike shot ads across various places across the globe called London  The launch was timed to coincide with the opening ceremony of the event 

While Adidas  commercials focused on British athletes  Nike chose to show regular people struggling to do their best at everyday physical exercise like jogging  Several experts and polls later showed that the target audience identified more strongly with Nike as an Olympic sponsor rather than Adidas  This example illustrates that often correct execution is more important than the actual level of sponsorship which a brand opts to zero in on 

4 Stocks in Focus

The Nike and Adidas example also illustrates that the stocks which stand to lose the most are those which opt for relatively higher levels of sponsorship  The majority of Worldwide Partners for this edition of the games are U S  companies  This makes it extremely important to focus on their campaigns during the games  since they have the most to gain and lose  We are looking at four of these stocks today 

The Procter   Gamble Company  s    campaign for the Rio Olympics has already gained massive popularity on various audiovisual platforms  It tagline  Thank You  Mom   Strong  is making waves thanks to its effective emotional connection  The company s stock has gained more 8  year to date and is up more than 5  over the last three months

Dow 30 Stock Roundup  Q2 Earnings Revisited

	The Dow declined over most of the week but for gains made on Wednesday  weighed down by a number of factors  Among these was familiar weakness in oil prices  following concerns about oversupply as well as weak demand  A decline in auto sales for the month of July led to fears about a reduction in consumer spending  Weak manufacturing data also weighed on investor sentiment  However  a rebound in oil prices and encouraging private employment data led to gains on Wednesday 

Last Week s Performance

	The index declined 0 2  on Monday as energy stocks slumped  after crude oil returned to bear market territory  Oversupply concerns and subdued demand were primarily responsible for dragging down oil prices  Weaker than expected manufacturing data also dented investor sentiment 

	The ISM manufacturing index fell to 52 6 in July from 53 2 in June  signaling a slowdown in overall factory growth  Additionally  construction spending declined 0 6  to its lowest level in June since the same period last year 

	The index lost 0 5  on Tuesday  dragged down by a decline in consumer discretionary stocks  These stocks were adversely affected by a drop in sales of major automakers in July which stoked concerns about a broad spending slowdown  The Dow closed in the red for the seventh straight session in a row for the first time since Aug 2015 

	Meanwhile  oil prices continued to hover near three month lows  Personal consumption expenditure rose 0 4  in June from a month earlier  The increase in outlays in June came in ahead of the consensus estimate of a rise by 0 3   When adjusted for inflation  consumer spending rose 0 3  

	The Dow snapped seven straight sessions of losses to finish in positive territory on Wednesday  The index gained 0 2 on Wednesday aided by gains in energy and financial shares  A rebound in oil prices due to an unexpected drop in gasoline stockpiles boosted energy shares 

	Meanwhile  a better than expected rise in private sector jobs was a shot in the arm for financial stocks  U S  private employers added 179 000 jobs in July  above analysts  expectations of around 170 000 jobs  according to ADP  Such an upbeat report strengthened the case for the Fed to hike rates this year 

	The index declined a meager 0 02  on Thursday as investors refrained from making big bets ahead of Friday s U S  nonfarm payroll report  Hiring data will help gauge the strength of the economy and provide an insight into the path of further rate hikes 

	Bank of England s  BOE  big stimulus package did drag down the pound to new lows  but its effect on U S  stocks remained more or less muted  Separately  factory orders declined sharply for the second straight month in June  Orders dropped 1 5  in June after falling 1 2  in May

Energy stocks retreated on Friday  one day after a rare upward move  as U S  crude futures plunged below  36 a barrel  falling to its lowest level since February  2009  Bearish comments from the International Energy Agency on Friday sparked the latest sell off  after the influential Paris based organization said in a monthly oil report that it does not expect an oversupplied global energy market to correct its imbalance anywhere in the near future  In 2016  the IEA also anticipates demand growth to slow considerably from 2015 forecasts around 1 8 million barrels per day  As a result  stocks in the energy sector plummeted more than 3  on the day weighing on U S  equities markets overall

Dollar Shave Club s turnover is expected to grow to over  200 million in 2016  up from  152 million last year  according to a statement from Unilever Tuesday  Dollar Shave Club sells razor blades and other grooming products direct to consumers via its website 
The company s founder Michael Dubin will continue to be the chief executive even after the deal closes  which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016  In a statement  Dubin said about the deal   DSC couldn t be happier to have the world s most innovative and progressive consumer product company in our corner  
Proctor   Gamble owned razor brand Gillette actually filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Dollar Shave Club over its blades  to which Dollar Shave Club filed a counter suit earlier this year 
Unilever  which currently already owns personal care products including Axe  Dove and Pond s  said in a statement Wednesday that Dollar Shave Club has  transformed the shaving category with its lifestyle brand  and has built a membership of 3 2 million since its establishment in 2012 
Bottom Line
As mentioned Unilever already owns several other successful brands  but Dollar Shave Club is a fast growing razor company that will not only expand the company s product line  but will further its search for customer data  The deal will not close until later this year  but it will be interesting to see Dollar Shave Club s growth  as well as how it helps drive Unilever s business ",2016-07-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unilever-to-acquire-dollar-shave-club-for-reported-$1-billion-200143067,200143067
95844,317359,PG,Procter   Gamble  PG  Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"We expect The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   to beat expectations when it reports fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Aug 2  before the opening bell 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6 17  
Despite sales remaining subdued  the consumer goods company delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters with an average surprise of 5 73  PROCTER   GAMBL Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that P G is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components required for a beat 
Zacks ESP  P G s   which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate  77 cents per share  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  74 cents   stands at  4 05   This is meaningful and indicates a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  P G has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of P G s Zacks Rank  3 and  4 05  ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat 
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
P G operates in a challenging environment where market growth rates are constantly decelerating  mainly due to slow growth in developing markets  The company has been struggling to grow sales  Significant negative Fx impact  weak volumes  divestures and slowing market growth have been hurting sales 
P G anticipates fiscal fourth quarter core earnings to be 32  lower than the prior year due to a combination of increased advertising investments  a higher tax rate  headwinds from foreign exchange and lower non operating income  Venezuelan deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures are expected to impact sales by 0 3  and 1   respectively in the fourth quarter 
However  pricing gains  productivity savings and lower overhead costs should provide bottom line support despite top line pressures like in the past quarters 
Stocks to Consider
Some stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include 
Dr Pepper Snapple Group  Inc    NYSE DPS   with an Earnings ESP of  0 84  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   with an Earnings ESP of  0 94  and a Zacks Rank  3

95845,317360,PG,3 Things To Watch When Procter   Gamble Reports On Tuesday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   a global consumer packaged goods giant that manufactures and markets more than 100 internationally recognized brands including Crest  Gillette  Pampers and Tide  reports Q2 earnings on Tuesday  August 2  before the bell 

1  Revenue and Earnings Forecast
Procter   Gamble is one of the largest consumer staple companies in the world today  It operates in 180 markets globally and specializes in packaged goods ranging from cosmetics to family and household care products  The company is expected to report an EPS of  0 74 on 15 82B in revenue  This would represent a step back in the earnings for PG  Last July the company reported EPS of  0 98 per share  Additionally  P G beat expectations in each of the last four quarters 

2  Negatives Last Quarter
As indicated by the expected drop in earnings  P G has several negative factors working against it right now  First  growth in developing markets hasn t been as strong as the company expected  Costs are expected to rise as well  with a boost in the effective tax rate  from 19  last year to 27  currently  The strong dollar hurting the profitability of sales abroad will come into play as well 
More important  the company continues to divest specific  less profitable segments  What began with the sale of 43 beauty brands to Coty  NYSE COTY  for  12 5B during the summer of 2015 continued this past quarter with the sale of the Christina Aguilera fragrance to Elizabeth Arden  NASDAQ RDEN  for an undisclosed sum 

3  Future Outlook
Obviously  Procter   Gamble recognized and is rectifying the mistake of relying on emerging markets  Consequently  it is focusing on a slim down strategy 
Though this makes the past fiscal year rough on its bottom line and stock performance  refocusing on its core brands makes sense  P G s core business is highly care oriented and many of these brands are internationally recognized and respected 
Once the owner of 170 brands  Procter   Gamble is opting to keep approximately 100 brands  which recent numbers suggest account for 90  of revenue The company is betting that smaller will mean a stronger  more durable business  But will the  shrink to grow  strategy pay off 
P G has relied on price increases to try and stabilize sales in the past three quarters  That has provided a quick  short term fix  but it isn t a viable long term strategy 
With a P E ratio of 28 and the real possibility of ending up with a smaller business over the short  and medium term  investors ought to closely follow the earnings release for any clues to the viability of the company s new strategic direction  That being said  P G is a dividend aristocrat  with a dividend payout history stretching back over 50 years  currently yielding 3 13   a major selling point to investors 
Even with the lower bottom line of  0 74 EPS  the dividend appears to be safe  P G s numbers still cover the  0 66 quarterly dividend  And the 89  payout ratio  while high  surely won t be a deterrent to the reliable distribution of Procter   Gamble s sought after dividend ",2016-08-02,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-things-to-watch-when-procter---gamble-reports-on-tuesday-200145589,200145589

95868,317383,PG,10 Biotech And Specialty Pharma Bargains,opinion,"Introduction
There are many investors that believe that the stock market is currently overvalued  To a great extent  they may be correct as there is a lot of excessive valuation to be found in various segments of the market  However  as I believe it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  not everything in today s stock market is expensive  In fact  there is one sector specifically where bargains galore can be found  That sector is the healthcare sector  and more specifically the subsectors biotechnology and specialty pharmaceuticals 
As I will illustrate in greater detail later  the biotechnology and specialty Pharma segment of the stock market has been very weak over the past year or so  There are a lot of reasons offered as to why this segment has been so weak  Threats of drug price reform seem to be the predominant culprit  Nevertheless  negativity towards this sector has driven valuations to what appear to be absurdly low in many cases  I believe this is especially true for companies with solid profitability and ample cash flow generation 
As a long term investor extensively focused on valuation  I am always on the lookout for bargains  My definition of a bargain is when I can identify a stock that is selling for significantly less than its fundamentals would indicate  In the healthcare sector specifically  there are a lot of small promising biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have yet to generate a profit  On the other hand  there are many that are already quite profitable  The focus of this article is on identifying profitable biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks that appear to be unjustly undervalued by the market 
In a previous article published in early June 2016 found here I presented 5 companies in the sector that I considered attractive long term investment opportunities  In this article  I am presenting 10 additional exciting looking research candidates within this sector  What follows next is a repost of what I wrote in the introduction of this last article  I am not adding quotes because the words are mine 
Personally  my primary current investment objective is focused on achieving a reliable and growing dividend income stream  That doesn t mean that I don t expect capital appreciation to go along with my dividends  because I do  However  capital appreciation is secondary to what I need right now  Therefore  I am content to allow it to happen over the long run  This means being willing to accept the ups and downs of short term market volatility that is sure to occur  as long as my dividend income keeps increasing 
On the other hand  I also have discretionary assets that I can invest in or utilize outside of my core portfolio  So  even though I favor dependable dividend paying stocks  I still am attracted to examining exciting growth investments with money I am both willing to and can afford to lose  However  even though I m willing to lose with these discretionary assets  I don t expect to  Instead  my objective is to generate significantly higher total returns than my prudent dividend growth portfolio is realistically capable of achieving 
More simply stated  I still appreciate powerful and exciting growth stocks because I understand they are capable of generating significantly higher returns  However  I am also cognizant of the fact that the risk associated with achieving those returns is also significantly higher  Consequently  I am just as adamantly  or even more so  focused on valuation when investing in growth stocks as I am with prudent  blue chip dividend paying stocks 
One of the most difficult things for the value oriented investor to accept and embrace is the reality that the best value comes from stocks that are temporarily out of favor  In this regard  the value investor must also recognize that hitting the perfect bottom can only be accomplished with luck  Therefore  the intelligent value investor is willing to assume some short term pain in order to achieve long term gain 
The biotechnology sector contains many exciting growth stocks  But  most importantly  as it relates to this article  the sector has recently been out of favor  which I believe has created bargain investment opportunities  Consequently  I offer the following 10 biotechnology and specialty Pharma stocks as attractive looking research candidates primarily for growth or long term total return  However  the first 3 research candidates in this group do offer intriguing prospects for dividend growth as well  Therefore  I hope the following list of healthcare stocks will offer something for everyone 
10 Undervalued Biotechnology and Specialty Pharma Stocks
The following portfolio review lists the 10 research candidates offered in this article in order of lowest P E ratio to the highest P E ratio  Consequently  I asked that the reader focus on the P E ratio column to gain a perspective and insight into just how undervalued many of these companies truly are 


Dividend Growth and Total Return
These first 3 candidates do pay a dividend  however  their dividends may not be attractive enough for the conservative dividend growth investor  Nevertheless  I believe each of them offers a compelling opportunity in their own right   but not without risk  I have presented a short description of each of these candidates  as well as all the other candidates in this article courtesy of S P Capital IQ  I have also included an earnings and price correlated  to illustrate how significantly undervalued many of these names are

Summary and Conclusions
A true bargain manifests when a company or set of companies is being misappraised by the market usually due to some fear of a pending crisis in the industry  Drug pricing reform has been the primary catalyst that I believe has hurt these stocks over the past year  At this point in time  those fears have yet to be realized  Nevertheless  I believe that the reader should do their own research and due diligence on each of these candidates  What I have offered here is certainly not without risk  however  with higher risk comes potential high reward

The consumer products giant reportedly said that it would shut down its two decade old Venezuela operations  as it is struggling to obtain raw materials and facing a shortage of hard currency and dealing with soaring inflation 
Venezuela s socialist government responded by taking over and re activating the affected plant  located in the central provincial city of Maracay  A similar takeover was seen in 2014 when The Clorox Co    NYSE CLX   announced that it was shutting production 
Kimberly Clark further stated that the Venezuelan government will look after the well being of the workers and the physical assets  equipment and machinery in the facilities once it takes control of Kimberly Clark s facilities and operations KIMBERLY CLARK Price   Kimberly Clark s decision to stop production would likely add to the shortages already prevailing in Venezuela for the past few years after the ruling socialists capped the price on many consumer basics below production costs  While shoppers struggle and spend long hours in front of stores to purchase essential products  companies face hefty losses on price controlled goods 
Also  Venezuela is witnessing inflation since early 2014 and basic food and products are increasingly scarce 
Like Kimberly Clark  several big companies like Bridgestone  General Mills Inc    NYSE GIS    and Procter   Gamble Co    NYSE PG   have scaled back operations in Venezuela amid this economic crisis

95894,317409,PG,3 Diversified Factor ETFs Making Traction In This Market,opinion,"Looked at a chart of stocks lately  It s difficult to conjure up any sense of enthusiasm in the price action over the last year  We have endured two pernicious drops that have been snatched from the jaws of defeat at seemingly the last moment  Only to experience a concomitant rip roaring rally that fizzles near the highs  This type of whipsaw action is where nervous investors get shaken out near the lows and stressfully forced back in at the worst possible time 
Fact  The SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  is sitting on a gain of  0 21  over the last twelve months  That s with dividends included 

The tough part is that it s becoming increasingly difficult for stock investors to find creative ways to eke out gains in this environment  Sectors have been a hit or miss proposition to say the least  You could always buy a little gold  but who knows what that will do over the next year 
If you re like me  you want to keep your stock exposure broad  but with a specific theme such as low volatility  high quality  or even dividend focused  Fortunately  those themes have shown a trend of outperformance recently that may represent an opportunity for your ETF watch list 
iShares Core High Dividend ETF  NYSE HDV 
I have written extensively about HDV over the course of my career and it continues to stand out among its peers  This ETF owns 75 large and mid cap stocks of companies that have paid consistently high dividends and are also screened for financial health  Top holdings include well known names such as Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  
HDV has  5 billion in assets under management  charges a miniscule expense ratio of 0 12   and has a 30 day SEC yield of 3 42   Dividends are paid quarterly to shareholders 
A look at the comparative chart shows just how far this fund has surpassed the market benchmark over the last year  This divergence really took off near the start of 2016 as we started to see a strong bid under consumer staples and energy stocks  These two sectors makeup nearly 40  of the asset allocation within HDV 

The multi sector index construction and low cost of this ETF means it could conceivably fit well as a  for those who are focused on income and capital appreciation 
PowerShares S P 500 Quality Portfolio  NYSE SPHQ 
Finding high quality stocks in the market isn t always easy  but PowerShares takes the stress of that away with SPHQ  The index methodology behind this fund identifies 100 large cap stocks within the S P 500 Index with the highest quality scores  This ranking system is determined based on strong balance sheets and stable earnings growth according to several fundamental measures 
The portfolio is currently weighted heavily towards consumer discretionary  industrial  and healthcare stocks  Top holdings include  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Home Depot  NYSE HD   and Proctor   Gamble  NYSE PG  
It s clear on the chart that this fund has noticeably outpaced the S P 500 Index over the last year despite having a markedly different underlying basket of stocks than a dividend fund such as HDV 

SPHQ charges a reasonable expense ratio of 0 29  and has  900 million in total assets  This type of ETF could potentially work well as either a core holding or as a  to supplement other more diversified indexes within your portfolio 
iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF  NYSE USMV 
Low volatility stocks are another factor based investment strategy that has become something of a hot button topic lately  Investment strategists have been unnerved by the strong outperformance of these stocks and the lofty heights of their current valuations  The argument is that these companies are potentially fully valued and may not offer the same type of upside growth moving forward 
I have been a big proponent of USMV for years now and have argued that investors who use low volatility indexes should expect lower growth at the outset  The premise behind this methodology is to select primarily defensive minded companies that have shown a historical trend of lower price fluctuations than their peers  The end result is a basket of 167 stocks and a very low expense ratio of just 0 15  

These funds aren t designed to beat the stock market  they are simply designed to have a lower beta  less drawdown  than a broad index such as the S P 500  To date  this has been a solid vehicle for conservative investors who need an allocation to stocks and would otherwise find themselves nervously selling a more volatile index at inopportune times 
The Bottom Line On Factor Based ETFs
Whenever you are investing with a factor based approach such as momentum  volatility  size  fundamentals  or dividends  you have to be prepared for cycles of strength and weakness versus a broad benchmark  The funds I listed above have proven to be great indexes to own over the last year  and even much longer in most instances  However  that doesn t mean they are infallible to the natural ebb and flow of market cycles 
With every new sequence in the market we will see pockets of strength emerge that will push fresh themes into the spotlight  Then money will follow  the trade will get crowded  the fundamentals behind the original thesis will deteriorate  and it will lead to relative weakness  Then the cycle starts again just when you least expect it 
Make sure that before you invest in any sector  fund  or strategy that is currently outperforming that you know its strengths and weaknesses  Often times  investors are chasing something that has already made a big move in hopes that it will continue indefinitely  My advice is to add these funds to your watch list  research them thoroughly  and work them into your portfolio  such as a pullback  That will lead to a much greater likelihood of success over the long run

95928,317443,PG,Investment Sentiment Leads To Shoot Now  Ask Later Mentality,opinion,"Since the start of 2016  investor sentiment has led to a shoot now  ask questions later mentality  In the court of economic justice  all stocks have been convicted guilty of recession despite the evidence and defense that proves the economy innocent  Even the Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen did not prove to be a great public defender of the economy with her comments that negative interest rates are on the table 
With large cap stocks down  13  and small cap stocks losing  25  from 2015  there are a mixture of indicators suggesting a looming recession could be coming  For example  banking stocks  the beating heart of the U S  economy  saw prices collapse almost  30  from the 2015 highs this week  As CNBC pointed out   American Airlines  O AAL   United Continental  N UAL   General Motors  N GM  and Ford  N F all sell for five times 2016 earnings    about a 70  discount to the average S P 500 stock  As a group  these economically sensitive cyclical stocks grew earnings per share greater than 50  while their stock prices are down by more than  30  from their 52 week highs  In general  the cyclicals are serving jail time  even though growth has been gangbusters and the current valuations massively discounted 
On the flip side  defensive stocks with little to no revenue growth like  Campbell Soup  N CPB  trade at 20 times earnings  Kimberly Clark  N KMB  is at 21 times earnings  Procter   Gamble  N PG  is at 22 times earnings and Clorox  N CLX  is at 25 times earnings  All of these stocks are near 52 week highs  
Confused  Well  if we are indeed going into recession  than this valuation dichotomy between cyclicals and staples makes sense  Stocks can be a leading indicator  i e   predictor  of future recessions  but as the famed Nobel Prize winner in economics Paul Samuelson noted   The stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions  
On the other hand  if this current correction is a false recession scare  then now would be a tremendous buying opportunity  In fact  over the last five years  there have been plenty of tremendous buying opportunities for those courageous long term investors willing to put capital to work during these panic periods

Today s threats rearing their ugly heads have definite recession credibility  but if you think about the strong dollar  collapsing oil prices  Fed monetary policies  weakening Chinese economy  and negative global interest rates  all of these threats existed well before stock prices nose dived during the last six weeks  If the economic court is judging the current data for potential recession evidence  making a case and proving the economy guilty is challenging  It s tough to find a recession when we witness a low unemployment rate  4 9    record corporate profits  ex energy   record car sales  17 5 million   an improving housing market  a positively sloped yield curve  healthy banking and consumer balance sheets  sub  2 gallon gasoline  and a flattening U S  dollar  among other factors 
Could stock prices be clairvoyantly predicting Armageddon  Sure  anything is possible but this scenario is unlikely now  Even if the U S  economy is headed towards a recession  the  20  plunge in stock prices is already factoring in most  if not all  of a mild to moderate recession  If the economic data does actually get worse  there is still room for stock prices to go down  Under a recession scenario  the tremendous buying opportunities will only get better  While weak hands may be shooting  selling  first and asking questions later  now is the time for you to use patience and discipline  These characteristics will serve as bullet proof vest for your investment portfolio and lead to economic justice over the long term ",2016-02-14,Wade Slome,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/shoot-now,-ask-later-384497",384497
95929,317444,PG,Dow Just 6  From Another All Time High,opinion,"How s the bear market going  Haven t you ve heard  Nothing but blue skies and sunshine ahead as far as the eye can see  Hard to believe  yes  but I still can t argue that the stock market hasn t been performing better than it was in January  Mr Bear was docile last week  no days of extreme market breadth or volatility to report  and the Dow Jones  below  is trending back toward its BEV  5  line  Even so  the Dow Jones still needs 1 100 more points to make a new all time high  the Red 0 0  Line   Can it  Sure it s possible  But I suspect the next eleven hundred points will be more difficult than the past fifteen hundred it s advanced since it s last 52Wk Low on February 11th 

Next we see the Dow Jones plotted with its 52Wk Highs and Lows  One could argue that the difficulties in the stock market since last May are merely a correction within a larger bull market  But one would have to ignore completely the fact that since the credit crisis the Dow Jones has only advanced in response to three episodes of Quantitative Easing  Okay  since February 11th the Dow has managed to advance toward a new all time high without the benefit of any quantitative easing from the Fed  But since last May it s also seen not one but two twelve percent corrections  but no new all time highs 
I still say it s the bulls that bear the burden of proving we are still in a bull market  I can t see into the future  and Janet Yellen stopped taking my phone calls after she became Chairwoman of the Fed  But as you ll see later in this article there are lots of problems in the economy and financial markets  So to my way of thinking it s more likely we ll see the Dow Jones drop below 5 000  a 70  bear market  before we see it above 19 000 

The Dow Jones Total Market Group  DJTMG  s Top 20  the number of groups within 20  of their last all time high  ended the week at 41  a big improvement from Barron s 18 January 2016 issue when there were only 26  But can the Top 20 manage to exceed the post credit crisis peak of 52 from back in July 2014  Anything could happen  But since 1992 it seems to peak when the stock market is inflating as it did during the High Tech and Mortgage bubbles   and then begins to deflate until  during the credit crisis  there were no groups left within 20  of their last all time high  I expect the top seen in July 2014 will prove to be the post credit crisis bubble peak in DJTMG s Top 20 

Something interesting is happening in the DJTMG 52Wk High and Low data  In the table below I sorted the groups by their Blue 52Wk Low column   1 and  2 have seen huge declines from their 52Wk Highs  but they ve more than doubled since their January bottoms just a few weeks ago  Non Ferrous Mining bottomed 82  below its 52Wk High in Barron s January 25th issue  but then bounced back more than 140  in just six weeks  Coal bottomed 87  below its 52Wk High in Barron s January 18th issue  then bounced back more than 130  in just eight weeks 
However  looking at the huge percentage declines in Non Ferrous Mining and Coal since their 52Wk highs leads me to believe that these gains are just dead cat bounces   not long term trends  Obama famously promised to destroy coal mining as an industry  With his EPA motivating many electric power utilities to switch from coal to natural gas I d say he was successful  And I doubt that base metal mining has much potential to recover unless China once again begins to expand  China currently is capable of producing more than a billion tons of steel annually  They could sheath their Great Wall with steel if they wanted too  or go broke trying to sell hundreds of millions of tons of steel no one has any use for 
Which takes us to  3 below  Gold Mining may have advanced a huge 64 5  since its 52Wk Low  as of Barron s January 25th issue   but it s currently just 8 55  away from a new 52Wk High  After a brutal bear market that began back in August 2011  it looks like the precious metal miners have turned the corner and may be entering a multi year bull market  And unlike Coal or Non Ferrous Mining  there is never lack of global demand for the gold and silver these miners pull from the ground  I like the PM miners 

Decades ago unless a change was announced in the Discount Rate  investors seldom read anything about the Federal Reserve  People might be excused for not knowing the United States even had a central bank for what little the media said about it  All that changed in the late 1970s when Fed Chairman Paul Volcker levitated short term rates into the double digits  far above long term bond yields This is known as a  yield inversion  
In the late 70s and early 80s for the first time the Federal Reserve received much media attention when Volcker testified before Congress  He knew his inflation fighting policies were causing lots of pain but he didn t care because that s what the doctor ordered   So you see Mr  American Voter  the recession wasn t Congress s fault  it was that Volcker guy  Now you see why Chairmen of the Federal Reserve are appointed  not elected 
Who among us doesn t hear that the Federal Reserve has the solution for all that ails the economy  Does a week ever go by without a member of the FOMC giving the public insight into  Fed policy   Stanley Fischer on Monday told CNN Money that the FOMC will soon meet its 2  inflation target 
The Fed s No  2  Stanley Fischer  spoke optimistically about a key yardstick for the economy  He noted that a recent pick up in inflation could currently be moving up towards the Fed s 2  target     Comments like Fischer s suggest the Fed is gaining confidence about its two key measures  inflation near 2  and a strong job market  Many Fed officials have said the job market is at or near  full employment   The unemployment rate is 4 9  
  CNNMoney  New York  First published March 7  2016  2 54 PM ET
Before 1971  if it was announced that inflation had fallen below 2  and that the FOMC was optimistic that it could correct this  problem  it would have been quite a hoot  And what s all this about the job market nearing full employment  CNNMoney  like most legacy media outlets are captured by the Washington establishment  They re not going to mention the current inability of many college graduates to find employment in their field  or embarrass a member of the FOMC by mentioning that their personal grocery bills have risen far more than 2  over the past year 
Let s take a look at what the Federal Reserve has been doing over the past few years to elevate  inflation  above 2   They ve expanded their balance sheet by more than 400  since August 2008  Obviously  in order to achieve their 2  inflation goal a new round of QE will be soon required  Cutting through the  policy  BS  members of the Federal Reserve couldn t care less if inflation fell below 2    which it hasn t  Their actual concern is that a significant portion of the debt market they ve inflated  using open market operations  is at risk of  or has already gone into default  When it does they fear it will take everything else down with it  along with their credibility in the financial markets and in the halls of power in Washington 

Here s the problem  and it s been a long time coming  when one goes into a bank for a loan  the first thing the bank wants to know is how much debt you re carrying  If the loan applicant has no debt  they get a better rate than someone witha mortgage and car loan to pay off  Maybe they ll even refuse to lend to someone if their current debt load is too high  The banker isn t being vindictive  it s just their way of rooting out deeply indebted clients living beyond their means 
But the  policy makers  like to think they re above the bounds of natural laws such as not being possible to live beyond one s means forever 
Below we see how the US National Debt has progressed from 1953 to present  I placed the yield for the US Treasury long bond at a few key points along the chart  The first data point has the US National Debt at 267 billion dollars  with the yield on the long bond at 2 71   A national debt of two hundred and sixty seven billion dollars may seem small now  but sixty years ago it was a cause of concern  Three decades later  just months before the national debt first broke above one trillion dollars the long bond yield soared to 15 04   This was the market s way of telling the US Government it had been spending other people s money too freely and the bond market vigilantes feared a pending Treasury default 

But ever since 1981  T bond yields have been declining while the national debt has surged  Just last month the national debt climbed above nineteen trillion dollars while treasury bond yield s broke below December 1952 levels  How is that possible  Former Fed Governor Warsh told the WSJ how 

 The policy makers are finding it tempting to pursue  financial repression     suppressing market prices that they don t like   He added   Efforts to manage and manipulate asset prices are not new  

  Fed Governor Kevin M  Warsh  Wall Street Journal Quote
Former Fed Governor Warsh more specific at Stanford University back in 2012 
 Now that I am out of government  I can tell you what I really believe 
  Central banks are now so heavily influencing asset prices that investors are unable to ascertain market values  This influence is especially evident  with the Fed s purchase of government bonds  which has made it impossible for investors to use bond prices to learn anything about markets 
 This is how bond yields today can actually be lower than in 1952  using inflationary funding the Federal Reserve purchases US Treasury Debt at any price with no regard to the solvency of the issuer whose debt burden now exceeds nineteen trillion dollars  Mr  Warsh continues  
  The government sponsored housing entities remain sources of vulnerability to the U S  economy  and repeated ad hoc attempts to push Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to take greater risks at taxpayer expense are deeply counterproductive  Such efforts have not succeeded 
  Kevin M  Warsh  Former Federal Reserve Governor  Comments made to the Stanford University Institute for Economic Policy Research  25 Jan 2012 
Just four years after the credit crisis  the  policy makers  were busy inflating yet another bubble in real estate  It s obvious that the  policy makers  solutions are the cause of the problems we struggle with today  and have for a long time  Ground Zero for this mess is the banking system 

 Market participants  for example  need a clearer  better understanding of large financial institutions to be good policemen themselves  But the financial statements  the annual reports  the 10Ks  the 10Qs of the largest banks around the world tell us so little about their true risks  If you spend a few hours reading the financial statements of Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  or Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   then you would understand their business and financial statements reasonably well  It is virtually impossible to do so for the largest global banks  

  Kevin M  Warsh  member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors February  2006   March  2011  Quote from May 2011 issue of Central Banking  pages 32 40 
If the banking system  or their government regulators wanted investors to know how sound the banking system is  they could do so in their accounting  They don t because the banks and their government regulators have much to hide  and that also goes for the Federal Reserve  They are the controlling bank that is never subject to public audit 
I ve said in the past that the key to the future of the Dow Jones  and the stock market   was the banking stocks  so here s the DJTMG s Banking Index plotted with its 52Wk Highs and Lows   70 in the DJTMG table above   Remember  these companies were ground zero for the credit crisis  a crisis that spread far beyond Wall Street  Banks provide the global economy with its payment system  When the banking system breaks down   so does everything else 
If you take a moment to compare the Banks with their 52Wk plots below with the Dow Jones chart above  you ll see there is quite a difference  For one thing  unlike the Dow Jones  all three programs of quantitative easing did little to lift the bank s share prices  even though banks have been widely recommended for years by the clueless financial media 

That s a big red flag  as the only reason the Federal Reserve even conducted these three QE programs was to assist these companies  For investors in banking stocks that s not much of a return considering the many trillions of dollars in assistance 
Let s go a little deeper and compare the Dow Jones with the banking stocks  52Wk Highs and Lows  The Dow Jones  52Wk High  table below  is also its last all time high  from which it is currently only 6  away  The DJTMG Banking Index s last all time high was back in 2007  It now sits 50  below that level  and would take a 100  gain to reach it again  It s currently 17  below its 52Wk High 

As far as their advances from their 52Wk lows of a few weeks ago  they have both seen solid advances  But the gold miners have done much better  and should continue to do so for years to come ",2016-03-13,Mark Lundeen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-dow-is-just-6-from-another-all-time-high-but-banking-stocks-are-200121369,200121369

95952,317467,PG,PG Trends Higher With Momentum Indicators Supporting More Upside,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Procter   Gamble  N PG  was founded almost 180 years ago  5 hours down the road in Cincinnati Ohio  They started out making candles and soap  Now they have more than 80 brands  despite a streamlining in August 2014 that cut about 100 brands  They focus mainly on Beauty and Family care and cleaning products now and have sales of over  80 billion annually 
The stock has had a lackluster 2015 falling from a high near 90 to start the year to the August low at 66  But since then it has trended higher  The chart shows a rising channel and the price currently at resistance near 77  a price that has been important several times in the past 6 months 
A move over that resistance would target a run higher toward the top of the channel  It would carry a Measured Move to 80  which would fill a gap from July  But it would also mark continuation in the Cup and Handle towards the target of 88  Resistance above stands at 78 50 and 79 50 followed by 81 and 82 50 before 84 and 85 then 87 and a gap to fill to 88 75 before 91 50  Support lower comes at 76 65 and 74 70 followed by 73 60 and 71 50 before 69 50 and 67 70 
The momentum indicators support more upside  The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is also rising and positive  The Bollinger Bands  are also opening and shifting up  Short interest is low at less than 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next January 26  2016 
Looking at the options chain this week shows large open interest at 77 5  right where the current price is  and the 75 below and 80 above  Potential for a 77 5 pin this week  The January chain shows the call side concentrated from 75 to 80 and then falling off up to 90  The Put side is biggest at 75 but spread from 80 to 65 and lower  January 29 Expiry options just started trading so there is little open interest  We need to look at February to get a read on earnings positioning  These show a downward bias with 75 to 80 biggest on the Call side but 72 5 to 75 on the Put side 
Procter   Gamble

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 78 50 with a stop at 74 50  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock and add a January 29 Expiry 77 5 75 Put Spread 80 Covered Call adding 11 cents  Adding a collar for downside protection 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the January 22 Expiry 77 50 Calls for  1 94  A Defined risk method for participating in upside until earnings 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the January 22 Expiry 77 50 December 31 Expiry 80 Call Diagonal for  1 50  Reduces the cost of the levered option trade with the possibility to roll short calls higher later 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into Options Expiration Week  the last full week before Christmas and the FOMC meeting sees the equity markets looking weak in the short run and all but the O QQQ tired or weak on the intermediate term 
Elsewhere look for gold to consolidate in it downtrend while crude oil runs lower  The US dollar index is back into consolidation with a short term downward bias while US Treasuries are biased higher in consolidation  The Shanghai Composite looks better to the downside short term in its bounce and Emerging Markets flat out broken and falling  but oversold 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and QQQ  Their charts look weak in the short term as well  In the intermediate term  the IWM is nearing key support  and the SPY testing a shift to a downside bias while the QQQ is still the strongest  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

95953,317468,PG,Dividend Aristocrats In A Bear Market,opinion,"One of the most popular  is to buy the  Dividend Aristocrats   those few companies that have increased their dividends every year for 25 years or more 
You d think this strategy would work especially well in a recessionary bear market  when such an impressive track record would make these companies particularly attractive 
Indeed  the most aristocratic of them all  Procter   Gamble Company  N PG   has increased its dividend every year since 1954  It has bumped the payout 278  just since the turn of the century  a period in which prices have only risen 40  
Yet recessions carry a huge hidden danger for the Aristocrats 
Avoid the Pitfalls
The problem is that Dividend Aristocrats are a walking example of survivorship bias 
In economic upswings  almost all of the Aristocrats increase their dividends as advertised  But in downturns  some of them falter   and the returns on those that falter are generally very poor  dragging down the returns of Dividend Aristocrats as a whole 
Like all investing formulae  the Dividend Aristocrat method has a distressing tendency of  reverting to the mean    there are no free lunches  after all 
To see how this occurs  just look at Pitney Bowes Inc  N PBI   the postage meter company  Going into the 2008 recession  PBI was a fine Dividend Aristocrat boasting more than 30 years of dividend increases 
During the recession  the dividend sometimes exceeded the company s earnings  which can t continue for long  Nevertheless  the company continued increasing the dividend while hoping that things would pick up  They didn t  and in 2013 the company was compelled to halve the quarterly dividend 
Pitney Bowes is still profitable  and the  0 1875 quarterly dividend is still being paid  giving the company a yield of 4   and a price to earnings ratio of only 9 7 times  at current earnings  which still haven t fallen out of bed  
However  if you d held the stock since 2007  you d have lost more than half your capital and would ve seen your income almost halved  too 
It s Electric
Over a long period with multiple recessions  there are enough Pitney Boweses amongst the Aristocrats to balance out the superior returns of the Procter and Gambles 
Today s list of Aristocrats is no exception   it includes several potential Pitney Boweses just waiting for the next recession to shake them off their perch 
One is Diebold Incorporated  N DBD   the provider of ATMs and security services 
Now  DBD s dividend track record is second only to Procter and Gamble s  But DBD s trailing four quarters earnings is just  1 09 compared to its current annual dividend of  1 15  Plus  its total liabilities are nine times its tangible net worth 
Thus  rather than buying the whole basket of Aristocrats  it may be worth picking and choosing the best companies  Even in a market and economic downturn  some of the Aristocrats remain attractive 
Emerson Electric Company  N EMR   for example  is in something of a dip right now because this electrical equipment company is a substantial seller to oil and gas industries 
However  its dividend has increased every year since 1957 and it currently yields 4 3   Even though the year to September 2016 is expected to be a poor one  with earnings down 28   EMR s dividend will still only be 65  of net income  while its debt to equity ratio is less than 1 0 times 
It also has the singular virtue of being a Management Aristocrat as well as a Dividend Aristocrat  the current CEO David Farr is only the third to hold that position since 1954 and has himself been in the job since October 2000 
Emerson offers an example of stability both operationally as well as financially  and it should serve you well in a downturn 
Bottom line  The Dividend Aristocrat investment concept is an attractive one  but it can be risky during a downturn 
The wise investor will pick among these rare birds very carefully indeed  and will look for balance sheet solidarity and management stability as well as a good dividend track record

95954,317469,PG,Do Buzzy Super Bowl Ads Boost Related Stocks  ,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
The Super Bowl  It s not just the annual American football season finale  it s also a massive television event  producing viewership records which are broken year after year after year  An added bonus  for savvy stock pickers able to pinpoint the ads that will go on to become the most acclaimed after each broadcast  it might also be an early indicator of what equities will see a 5 20  boost in share price over immediate and upcoming quarters 
Super Bowl XLVIII  which saw the Seattle Seahawks anointed 2013 champions when it aired on Sunday February 2  2014  totaled 112 2 million viewers  a record at that time  The following year  Super Bowl XLIX  which aired on February 1  2015  saw the New England Patriots crowned 2014 champions  That broadcast broke the previous season s record  with 114 4 million viewers tuning in over the course of the game  ending with 120 8 million viewers during the final  decisive minutes 
But championships and record audiences are only a small part of the story  The Super Bowl is also a  for participating franchises  networks and advertisers because of the vast number of viewers  In fact  advertisers who pay premium rates for just a few seconds of air time often see dramatic upticks in sales immediately after the game  Which guarantees that the cost of a 30 second ad is heart stoppingly high 
Last year  the going rate was  4 5 million for half a minute  This year it is projected to average  5 million  The total revenue the network garnered from the full roster of ads in 2015 was a staggering  350 million 
Since the Super Bowl first aired in 1967  the commercials have become as much a part of the spectacle as the game itself  According to a  by Monthly Consumer Survey  25 1  of viewers report that for them  commercials are the most important part of the broadcast  77 1  of viewers consider them part of the entertainment proposition  and only 4 5  report being bothered by the commercials 
With the advent of the internet  the best commercial spots have a massively extended shelf life  According to Mashable  over 1600 years of Super Bowl ads have been streamed on YouTube in 2015 alone 
We ve tracked back over the past 5 years  worth of Super Bowl games  looking at companies that arguably had the best and most hyped commercials during Super Bowls 2011 2015  We also charted their stock s performance in the quarter or quarters following the game in which their commercial aired 
Here s what we found 
2015   Budweiser  Anheuser Busch 
Budweiser s  Lost Dog   parent stock Anheuser Busch Inbev SA  N BUD   was without a doubt the most talked about commercial of 2015 s game  Of course  featuring a puppy in the starring role is a pretty surefire way to create buzz  and Budweiser hit the nail squarely in the head with the touching commercial that left viewers in tears and wanting more 
The commercial was posted on YouTube and to date has over 30 million views  On Friday January 30  2015  the market close prior to that Super Bowl  Anheuser Busch traded for  122 07 a share  Within a month  on February 26th  the stock peaked at  128 35  an increase of 5 1  in value 

That s a 5  boost in just a month thanks to a cute Lab puppy

2014   Axe Deodorant  Unilever 
Axe deodorant  Unilever NV  N UN   was a polarizing product from its inception  The demographic target  15 24 year old males  were regularly fed an advertising  diet  of girls in bikinis inexorably attracted to guys holding cans of Axe deodorant  As a viewer you either loved the spots or detested them  Then Superbowl XLVIII happened  and consumers got to see a side of Axe they d never dreamed of 
Axe s agency gambled that moving away from the product s core campaign  and toward a surprisingly peaceable direction  might work in their favor  Indeed  the surprising  even lovely result had a great message that offended absolutely no one  Make Love  Not War  It showed a mature  responsible  and deeply serious side to the product that resonated with consumers 
After the game investors delivered  and over the following months showered Unilever s stock with love  Shares were priced at  37 34 for Unilever NV and  38 61 for Unilever PLC  N UL  before the Super Bowl aired on February 2nd  2014 

Through April 30th of that year  both stocks rose steadily  with NV peaking at  42 95 and PLC at  44 83  PLC   for respective gains of 15  and 16 1

2013   Tide Detergent  Procter   Gamble 
Laundry detergent is an undeniably mundane  even boring consumer staple  But Tide s 2013 Super Bowl commercial contained all the elements needed to tweak every sports fan s and every housewife s respective dreams  It focused on the the miraculous   Joe Montana salsa stain   a clever use of the legendary San Francisco quarterback s image during a season when the 49ers played against the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl  The ad included an array of winning elements  religious iconography  over the top fantasy  charm  humor and a hat tip to both championship teams 
In addition it was surprisingly and cleverly well focused on the product  Tide s parent company  Procter   Gamble  N PG   enjoyed a popularity boost following the ad s air date  Its stock  priced at  75 92 per share as of Super Bowl Sunday February 3rd 2013  reached a then all time high of  82 54 on April 23rd  an increase of 8 7  from the day the ad aired 

Appealing to sports fans  their households  and anyone who launders their clothes that s targeted advertising at its best 
Watch the commercial 

2012   Acura NSX  Honda CRV
During the 2012 Super Bowl  Honda Motor Company Ltd  N HMC  actually purchased two spots  The first was for Acura  Honda s premium brand  and featured Jerry Seinfeld and Jay Leno duking it out to be the first customer to get their hands on the soon to be introduced Acura NSX  The ad even featured the Soup Nazi  a character popularized by Seinfeld s classic TV show  and a great wink to Seinfeld fans 
The second commercial  for the Honda CRV  featured Matthew Broderick  reprising his starring role in  along with the plot of  the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller s Day Off  Understandably  not every viewer got the references  But if you hadn t been old enough to see the movie in  86  you probably weren t looking to buy a new SUV anyway 
Honda s shareholders benefited from the good publicity for both of its brands  In the 6 weeks following the Super Bowl  the stock jumped from  35 60 on February 5th when the Super Bowl aired to  39 35 on March 16th  an incredible 10  in a short amount of time 

Nostalgic references in clever packages got investors and consumers alike high on Honda 
Watch the commercials 


2011   Volkswagen Passat
No article mentioning Super Bowl commercials is complete without a reference to Volkswagen s  OTC VLKAY   The Force   which aired during the 2011 Super Bowl  The ad features a pint sized Darth Vader having trouble summoning The Force  That is  of course  until his dad gets home from work in his new Passat and gently  but remotely  takes matters into his own hands 
The commercial was a huge hit  and since airing has been seen all over the world  It s still one of the most memorable Super Bowl commercials in recent memory 
The mega hype around that commercial served the DAX listed shares of Volkswagen  DE VOWG p   which trade in Frankfurt  very well  the company saw an increase of 11  for its share price  from  110 25 right before the Super Bowl which aired on February 6  2011  all the way to  122 38 on May 2nd of that year 

The US listed shares  traded as an OTC ADR  rose from  29 95 on February 6 to  36 on May 3  an increase of 20 8   A fitting reward for a highly memorable commercial 
Watch the commercial 

Clearly  good companies with good Super Bowl commercials can see a gratifying boost to their stock after the Lombardi Trophy is handed out to the winning team  When done properly  that  5 million or so spent on a few fleeting seconds of air time doesn t seem so costly after all 
This year s contenders for best Super Bowl commercial include Nestle s  OTC NSRGY  ad for Butterfinger  The company has been hyping the commercial  and the product  with the  BolderThanBold hashtag  The ad features former New England Patriots wide receiver Terrell Owens and comedian Billy Eichner  The company released a   hoping to garner pre game interest 
Also in the mix is Korean electronics manufacturer LG  KS 066570   Their commercial stars actor Liam Neeson and was directed by Ridley Scott  whose sci fi film Alien was a global success  The ad  titled  The Man From The Future  promises    
Also expected is an election themed commercial from Bud Light  starring comedians Amy Schumer and Seth Rogan  A  was recently released  So far  additional details are scarce  but with Rogan s and Schumer s reputations  and popularity  we assume it will generate some post game buzz  and YouTube replays

95970,317485,PG,Common Stock In Your Retirement Portfolio  Concentrated Or Diversified ,opinion,"Introduction
Designing the common stock portion of your retirement portfolio is very challenging  For starters  there is no absolutely perfect or even best way to design a stock portfolio  However  there are many effective strategies that have produced successful long term results  The key to success is to find and implement the strategy that best fits your own unique goals  objectives  needs  and most importantly   risk tolerances 
There are many aspects associated with designing a common stock portfolio that need to be considered  The number of individual companies to include in your portfolio is a big one  In addition to the number of companies  how much weight you should put in each one  Should they be equally weighted  In other words  should you put the exact same percentage of your portfolio in each company  Or  does it make more sense to overweight some and underweight others  Moreover  should you own stocks from every sector or just the ones you like the best 

These are just a few of the important questions that investors must grapple with when designing a common stock portfolio  But most importantly  and I repeat myself  there is no absolute or perfect strategy for constructing a stock portfolio that fits every individual investor  On the other hand  there are important considerations that every individual investor would be well advised to contemplate  Ultimately  it comes down to designing a stock portfolio that suits you 
Therefore  my objective with this article is to provide some food for thought and common stock portfolio design ideas that I hope can help individual investors make better choices that fit and meet their own needs  I am a big proponent of applying logic and common sense to the investing process  Consequently  rather than just giving specific portfolio construction strategies  I also intend to offer some logical ways to look at common stock portfolio construction 
The Universal Principle  Start With A Plan
I believe that there is only one universal principle about constructing a common stock portfolio that universally applies to every investor  Prior to building any portfolio  common stock or otherwise  it is imperative that every investor starts by developing a comprehensive and detailed plan  Importantly  it s not only imperative to have a plan  it s even more vital to be disciplined about following it 
This is commonly referred to as an investment policy statement  IPS   However  an IPS generally goes beyond defining investment goals and objectives  it also takes into consideration risk tolerance  liquidity requirements and asset allocation  However  for the purposes of this specific article  I am simply referring to a well thought out plan design for the common stock portion of an overall portfolio  Therefore  my discussion will be limited to investment goals  objectives and risk tolerances 
Logically then  the first step in creating your investment plan is to clearly identify and determine your specific investment goals and needs  For example  if your primary objective is growth or total return  your focus might be best placed on a portfolio combination of growth stocks and or above average growing dividend growth stocks  In contrast  if your primary objective is current income  your focus might be best placed on a portfolio combination of blue chip dividend paying stalwarts and or high yield stocks 
Of course  there are many variations of what the most appropriate mix of stocks might be  Therefore  depending on your needs and risk tolerances  the mix of appropriate stocks are only limited by each investor s imagination coupled with their needs  Once again  there is no perfectly right or wrong answer  except to design a portfolio that is capable of meeting your goals  and one that you are comfortable enough with to stay the course 
How Many Stocks Should My Portfolio Hold 
The question of how many stocks a portfolio should contain has been widely discussed  and even hotly debated  Some of the greatest investors that ever walked the planet have shared their views and opinions  and there have been numerous academic studies conducted as well  However  there really is no consensus  and many of the differing views are supported by compelling and logical arguments  Interestingly  the arguments of many renowned fundamental investors versus academics that have conducted studies are not that far apart 
Therefore  instead of supporting any specific number of holdings  I have chosen to offer some practical considerations that individual investors might think about  On the other hand  I will also share some of the views and opinions of others who have studied the subject of how many stocks to own 
The Simple And Basic Mathematics Behind How Many Stocks to Own
At the risk of being accused of stating the obvious  I believe it s important to consider and have a clear perspective of the basic mathematics behind how many stocks you own  In my opinion  this is important because it relates to the investor s risk tolerance  Additionally  it also relates to the potential rate of return a portfolio can achieve  So let s look at some basic numbers 
For starters  let s assume that you are constructing an equal weighted portfolio  This simply means placing the same amount of your investment in each selection  Therefore  the number of stocks you place in a portfolio represents the percentage of your portfolio it comprises  The basic math is simple  If you hold 5 stocks  they each comprise 20  of your portfolio  If you hold 10 stocks  they each comprise 10   If you hold 20 stocks  they each represent 5   If you hold 25 stocks  they each represent 4   and so on 
The fewer stocks you own  the greater your exposure to good or to bad things happening in the future to each individual stock  For example  all things being equal  if you only hold 5 stocks  and 1 of them falls 50  in value  your overall portfolio would drop by 10   In contrast  if you hold 25 stocks  and 1 of them falls 50  in value  your overall portfolio would only drop 2   This represents the risk aspect discussed previously  The lower your tolerance for risk  the more stocks you should hold   and vice versa  Therefore  although this is pretty basic  I believe it s an important yet simple mathematical perspective to hold clearly in the back of your mind at all times 
Concentrated Or Diversified  What Do The Experts Suggest 
Let s start with what academic studies have concluded  Frankly  I was surprised to discover that there are academic studies that support concentrated stock portfolios  For example  according to a MorningStar classroom report found here   academic professors Frank Riley and Keith Brown reported in their book  Investment Analysis And Portfolio Management  that about 90  of the maximum benefit of diversification was derived from portfolios of 12 to 18 stocks 
To paraphrase the report  this suggests that by owning only 18 stocks you will get the same return as investing in a passive market index  The report also suggested that if you own more than 18 stocks  you are simply increasing your workload without receiving much benefit  The MorningStar report went on to suggest that there is also a practical risk to being too diversified  The report implies that by owning more than 18 stocks it becomes nearly impossible to know your companies well enough 
I suggest that the reader follows the above link and also read some of the other chapters on constructing a common stock portfolio  Frankly  this short course does a better job of discussing ways to build a common stock portfolio  and more succinctly that I can in this article 
As an investor with a strong orientation to valuation  I have made it a point to study the behaviors of the most renowned value investors that have ever lived  However  I am certainly not alone in that endeavor  There is an excellent website on value investing founded by fellow Seeking Alpha author Vishal Khandelwal that studies and reports on the behaviors and practices of prominent value investors and value investing in general found here  
In a post titled  How Many Stocks Should You Own    He offered a summary of the opinions of several legendary investors that I personally admire greatly as follows 

Just to sum up  here is what the legends have advised on how many stocks you should own in your portfolio 
Ben Graham   10 to 30 with each company being large  prominent and conservatively financed 
John Keynes   2 to 3 companies which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes 
Warren Buffett   5 to 10 if you are a know something investor  able to understand business economics and to find sensibly priced companies that possess important long term competitive advantages 
Seth Klarman   10 to 15 better off knowing a lot about a few investments than knowing only a little about each of a great many holdings  

Additionally  one of my favorite value investors of all time  Phil Fisher  had very strong opinions on how many stocks investors should hold  The following quote taken from the book  The Warren Buffett Way  by Robert G  Hagstrom nicely summarizes Phil Fisher s views 

Phil Fisher taught Buffett the benefits of focusing on just a few investments  He believed that it was a mistake to teach investors that putting their eggs in several baskets reduces risk  The danger in purchasing too many stocks  he felt  is that it becomes impossible to watch all the eggs in all the baskets  In his view  buying shares in a company without taking the time to develop a thorough understanding of the business was far more risky than having limited diversification  

To summarize this section on how many stocks to put in a portfolio  I suggest that less is more  For anyone managing their own stock portfolio  a comprehensive understanding of each business you own is worth more than the marginal benefit of being more broadly diversified  On the other hand  if you are very sensitive to risk  you might need to own more stocks just for the peace of mind it brings 
For example  an equally weighted portfolio of 30 stocks means that each holding only represents a little over 3  of your total portfolio  Therefore  no calamitous disaster on one holding will affect your overall portfolio very much  Nevertheless  a portfolio of only 10 stocks might be too concentrated for many investors  Consequently  I believe an equally weighted portfolio of 20 to 25 stocks offers a good compromise for most investors  However  this is not an ironclad rule and many investors might only be comfortable holding more than 25 or 30 stocks  At the end of the day  it s really a matter of investor preference and risk tolerance 
Should You Equal Weight or Overweight Portfolio Holdings 
The answer to the question regarding how many stocks to hold in a portfolio discussed above related primarily to an equal weighted portfolio of stocks  However  there is also the question of overweighting versus equal weighting that can also affect the optimum number of stocks to hold in a portfolio  This is a question that many investors who self manage their own stock portfolios have as evidenced by the following comment by a reader 

 Nice Summary Chuck  
I have a question which you might have an opinion on re  building a portfolio  Is it better to equal dollar weight your stock selection  OR could you allocate the capital better by overweighting predicted higher annual ROR vs lower predicted annual ROR  I guess this would slant the portfolio a bit to perhaps more faster growing companies   

There are advantages and disadvantages to both equal weighting of a stock portfolio and overweighting your holdings  To my way of thinking  the best course of action  as always  relates to the individual investor s own goals and also to their risk tolerances  Additionally  each individual investor s general knowledge about investing in stocks coupled with the amount of time they have available for research are additional important factors 
To complicate matters more  there are numerous approaches and strategies that can be implemented with overweighting stocks in your portfolio  Unfortunately  I will only be able to address a few of the more prominent ones  However  I think it s important that the reader understands that there are many approaches towards overweighting a stock portfolio  but not necessarily a best one 
The 60 40  70 30  80 20 and 90 10 Approach
One conceptual approach that I have personally successfully implemented over my career for investors in the accumulation phase prior to retirement is one I call the 60 40  70 30  80 20 and 90 10 Approach  This common stock portfolio design concept primarily dealt with two broad categories of equally weighted common stocks   blue chip dividend paying stalwarts and growth oriented stocks 
The central idea is to build a solid foundation of conservative blue chips supplemented by riskier growth stocks  If both your risk tolerances and total return needs were high  you might put 60  of your money in conservative blue chips and 40  in more aggressive growth stocks  In contrast  if your risk tolerances were low but you still needed some additional growth  you might put 90  of your money in blue chips and only 10  in growth  Of course  each additional blend would be determined by the needs and risk tolerances of each individual investor  In essence  the more growth you choose  the higher your total return expectation  However  the more growth you choose  the more risk you must be willing to assume 
Variations of this approach could also be applied to already retired investors in need of income  In this situation you would blend your mix based on the yield characteristics of your individual selections  This could be blue chip dividend paying stalwarts such as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  or Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   mixed in with the appropriate mix of higher yielding REITs and or MLPs 
The key is that your common stock portfolio should be custom designed to meet your own goals  needs and risk tolerances  There is no one size fits all  and each individual investor is unique and different  However  there are common sense tried and true principles that can be  and should be  commonly applied  Always starting with a well defined plan is a good example 
The More Aggressive Concentrated Diversified Approach
As the reader can imagine  there are numerous variations and common stock blending strategies that can be implemented than just those discussed above  Another one that I have successfully implemented is what I call the aggressive concentrated diversified approach  An example of this strategy might be to place 50  of your money into your top five selections  10  of your total in each   The remaining 50  of your money could be heavily diversified by putting 2  increments into 25 additional companies  or even 1  increments into 50 additional companies 
With this strategy  you are very selective with your top five holdings in the first place  and in the second place you research  watch and monitor them closely and comprehensively  To be clear  your top five holdings are intensely researched and focused upon  With the remaining  for example 25 or 50  you allow the principle of broader diversification to take care of them  The idea here is to swing at the fences with half of your money and look for singles and doubles with the other half 
Although this is a risky portfolio construction strategy  it can pay off enormously in the long run  The 5 stocks you are overweight in could be aggressive growth stocks capable of producing the 10   20  or 30 baggers that Peter Lynch talked about in his book  One Up On Wall Street   The remaining stocks could be comprised of more conservative blue chip dividend payers  If you want to be really aggressive with a total return objective  every stock could be aggressive growth  Once again  the variations are endless  It all comes down to your own goals and risk tolerances 
As an interesting aside  Peter Lynch utilized a variation of this strategy  but at a different scale  when he ran the Fidelity Magellan fund  In his book  One Up On Wall Street  in the chapter  Designing A Portfolio  he had this to say 

Some people ascribe my success to my having specialized in growth stocks  But that s only partly accurate  I never put more than 30  to 40  of my funds assets in the growth stocks  The rest I spread out among the other categories described in this book  Normally I keep about 10  to 20  or so in the stalwarts  another 10  to 20  or so in the cyclicals  and the rest in turnarounds  Although I own 1400 stocks in all  half of my funds assets are invested in 100 stocks  and two thirds in 200 stocks   1  of the money is spread out among 500 secondary opportunities I monitoring periodically  with the possibility of turning in later  

After reading the above  the reader should consider that Peter Lynch had billions of dollars to deal with and invest  as well as a large staff of associates to assist him  Obviously  for us average investors out there  our resources are much more limited  Nevertheless  the underlying principles that Peter Lynch was articulating appropriately apply  only the scale of our resources is different 
The Importance Of Sound Valuation On The Buy Side
One of the most important universal principles that I ve previously discussed is only investing in stocks at sound valuation  It doesn t matter whether you re buying growth stocks  blue chip stalwarts or any of the other categories discussed in this series   investing at sound valuation matters  You can equally weight your portfolios  or use an overweight strategy similar to what I presented above  and sound valuation matters 
There are many ways to control risk  proper diversification is certainly one of them  But so is being prudent when purchasing stocks  any stock  So from my point of view  the best portfolio construction advice that I can offer is to focus on value at all times  And although this is critical on the buy side  it also importantly applies to the sell side  In other words  no matter how you ve constructed it  once your portfolio is constructed  focusing on valuation is a tried and true portfolio management technique 
Summary And Conclusions
There is no consensus on the best way to construct a common stock portfolio  On the other hand  there are many practical methods that have proven successful  Perhaps most importantly of all  is that each investor should  know thyself   The odds are very low that your portfolio can produce the results you want and need if it is not constructed in a way that is compatible with your own psyche and goals  The key to any well designed portfolio strategy lies in your ability to effectively implement it over time  If your holdings make you uncomfortable  no matter how conservative or aggressive they may be  you can end up being your portfolio s own worst enemy 
Additionally  I believe that portfolios should be goal specific oriented  Instead of worrying about beating the market or generating the highest total returns  I believe it makes more sense to build a portfolio that meets your needs  If you need maximum income   invest for that  If growth is your goal   invest for that  Every common stock portfolio has a job to do  and therefore  it should be designed with a clear and specific focus on achieving those goals 
Importantly  in order to achieve your goals  you must start out with a well thought out plan  Constructing an appropriate common stock portfolio should never be about throwing a bunch of mud on the wall and hoping that some of it sticks  To me it makes much more sense to invest in the types of common stocks that are aligned with your objectives and risk tolerances 
Most great investors recommend knowing as much about the companies you own as is humanly possible  I contend that the same advice relates to your portfolio as well  Each investor should have a clear perspective and understanding of what their portfolios are designed to do  and whether each of the individual parts is capable of getting the job done 
Finally  if you are desirous of self managing your own portfolios  there is no substitute conducting comprehensive research and due diligence  This requires the willingness and ability to allocate the proper time and attention to your portfolios  This principle supports concentration over excessive diversification  And in the long run  it also pays to have the proper tools at your disposal  In today s Internet age  many tools are available for free  Other tools such as the F A S T  Graphs  fundamentals analyzer software tool that I use require a modest fee  Nevertheless  the point is to develop a plan  acquire the tools to execute the plan  and be as precise as possible in what stocks you select and whether their attributes are compatible with your needs

95975,317490,PG,84 Attractive Dividend Growth Stocks For Your Retirement Portfolios  Par,opinion,"Introduction
I recently completed a 3 part series of articles offered to assist retired investors in designing the equity portion of their retirement portfolios  In part 1 of this series  I presented Peter Lynch s 6 broad categories of stocks  businesses  that he wrote about in his best selling book  One Up On Wall Street   The primary objective of this first article was simply to provide the reader a general idea of the various categories of common stocks that were generally available to choose among  I presented one or two examples of each category in order to illustrate the advantages and or disadvantages of each category  I also pointed out that not every category was appropriate for most conservative retired investors 
In part 2  I pointed out the importance of clearly defining whether your primary investment objective was for current income  future growth or a combination of both  I also touched on choosing the appropriate investment objective relative to whether you are already retired or whether you were in the accumulation phase and planning for future retirement  And I put forward that in order to successfully accomplish your goals  the most critical step was to clearly define them  because once that was done it is much easier to focus only on common stocks that possess the appropriate characteristics consistent with those goals 
In part 3  I discussed the advantages and disadvantages of a concentrated stock portfolio versus a more broadly diversified stock portfolio  In this article I presented the views of many renowned expert investors on the subject  as well as my own  I also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of building an equally weighted stock portfolio versus overweighting certain sectors  And most importantly  I introduced what I considered the universal principle of starting with a plan that applies to all investors  And I added that it is not only imperative to have a plan  it s even more vital to be disciplined about following it 
For the most part the above series of articles were primarily strategic in nature  I started out by presenting the various categories or types of stocks that investors could choose from  Then I discussed the importance of only choosing the most appropriate stocks to meet your own unique goals  objectives and risk tolerances  And finally  I presented various portfolio construction strategies that individuals could implement according to their own needs and risk tolerances 
Moving from the Strategic to the Specific
After completing the three part series discussed above referencing available common stock options and strategies for designing the common stock portion of a retirement portfolio  it only seemed logical for me to move from the general to the specific  For the last few years  the overall stock market  S P 500   and quality dividend growth stocks specifically had become extended based on valuation  However  during August and September of 2015 investors were given what I consider a pause that refreshes 
Although the stock market as represented by the S P 500 has fallen approximately 6  since July 31  2015  this would only be slightly more than half way to the definition of a market correction of 10  or more  However  since the beginning of the year  2015  many high quality dividend growth stocks have  in fact  by definition experienced a bona fide correction  This includes many Dividend Champions and Contenders  which is important because they represent the best of breed dividend growth stocks for retirees to include in their portfolios for income 
Therefore  I felt it was appropriate to present an additional series of articles that readers could utilize in order to implement the strategies presented in the first series of articles with specific dividend growth stock examples and choices  In part 1 of this new series   I introduced two important principles that I believe are key to the successful implementation of a dividend growth portfolio in order to meet your specific and individual retirement yield objective or need 
Principle number 1 was to be realistic with your yield objective  The central idea behind this principle was to determine a range of yields available from quality  and most importantly  fairly valued dividend growth stocks of various categories  In other words  being clear about the yields available from quality empowers the investor to recognize that reaching for yields above those parameters is risky 
Principle number 2 was to determine how much income your portfolio needs to produce in order to meet your needs  Once this was determined  you could then mix and match your dividend growth stock choices appropriately  In other words  if your portfolio was large enough  you could focus on quality stocks with the highest yields and consistent records of dividend increases to meet your current needs  On the other hand  if you needed additional growth  you could focus on quality stocks that offered moderate yields but more growth 
84 Quality Dividend Growth Research Candidates Broken Down Into 4 Categories
I have screened the universe of quality dividend growth stocks that are currently fairly valued and came up with 84 research candidates I was comfortable presenting  In order to meet various individual investor goals or needs  I have broken this list down into 4 categories  The universal focus that I applied when making selections in all 4 categories was reasonable quality and attractive valuation 
The first category is comprised of 24 quality dividend growth stocks with above average current yields  At the time of this writing the current yields on this first group range from a low of 2 9  to a high of 3 7   I consider this first group of selections as foundational research candidates that can be utilized as core holdings for the equity portion of most every retiree s portfolio 
The second category is comprised of 16 quality higher yielding dividend growth stocks  At the time of this writing the current yields on this second group range from a low of 3 7  to a high of 5 6   This second category is offered for those retirees that require more yield than was generally available from group 1  but are still looking for quality and safety  Selections from this group can be strategically utilized to increase the overall yield of the retirement portfolio 
The third category is comprised of 30 dividend growth stocks with lower yields but higher expected levels of capital appreciation and dividend growth  growth yield   At the time of this writing the current yields on this third group range from a low of 1 1  to a high of 2 9   This third category is offered for those retirees or pre retirees that require additional growth of both capital and dividend income  Selections from this group can be strategically utilized to generate a higher future total return and generate higher future dividend income when it is needed 
The fourth category is comprised of 14 high quality fairly valued and higher yielding REITs  At the time of this writing the current yields on this fourth group range from a low of 3 8  to a high of 9 2   This fourth category is offered for those retirees looking to increase both the current yield on their retirement portfolios and for the potential for capital appreciation  Selections from this group can be strategically utilized to generate a higher current yield and the opportunity for capital appreciation and income growth 
24 Fairly Valued High Quality Dividend Growth Stocks with Above Average Yield 
The following 24 research candidates with above average current yields are listed in order of lowest to highest current dividend yield  The table presents the company s ticker  name  sector  S P credit rating dividend yield  current blended P E ratio  current blended price to cash flow ratio  P CF   market cap and long term debt to capital ratio 
Note  some of these research candidates were selected based on attractive P E ratios while others were chosen based on attractive price to cash flow ratios  I have highlighted those candidates that I believe are best evaluated based on cash flow valuations supporting current dividends and future dividend growth  Following the table I will present one example  and one example where I believe the historical earnings and cash flow correlation is more appropriate for valuing the business 

Cummins Inc   NYSE CMI   Low P E High Yield
Cummins Inc  is a high quality undervalued dividend growth stock with an A  rating and a low debt to capital ratio of 15   Since the beginning of 2015  the company s stock price has fallen to a significantly low valuation level based on both earnings and its historical normal P E ratio  This has resulted in the company currently providing an above average dividend yield of 3 5   coupled with the opportunity for significant capital appreciation when the company moves back to normal valuation levels  Although the company s earnings history is moderately cyclical  its dividend growth record has been exemplary 

High current yield  and high dividend growth rate comes with historically low valuation makes Cummins a solid dividend growth opportunity for long term oriented investors  Even at its current low valuation  Cummins has significantly outperformed the S P 500 since 2005 on both cumulative dividend income and capital appreciation 

Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   Low Price To Cash Flow Supports The Dividend
Procter   Gamble has a long history of trading at a premium P E ratio  However  since I consider this primarily a high quality high yield investment  I believe it makes more sense to value it based on cash flow  On that basis  Procter   Gamble is soundly valued and offers a substantial 3 6  current yield potential for future dividend growth 

To me  investing in Procter   Gamble is all about high current yield and a high level of safety  Although the company has not outperformed the S P 500 on a capital appreciation or a total return basis  it has outperformed the market based on total cumulative dividend income  These are the reasons why I consider Procter   Gamble a core holding 

29 Fairly Valued High Quality Dividend Growth Stocks with Yield and Capital Appreciation Potential
The research candidates presented in this group are offered for those retirees that need additional growth in their retirement portfolios to meet their future goals  The primary distinction between this group and the first group is greater capital appreciation and dividend growth potential  However  some of the higher yielding candidates at the bottom of the list could overlap from group 2 to group 1   and vice versa 

Polaris Industries Inc   NYSE PII   A Growth Story Coming In To Fair Value
I believe that Polaris Industries  recent weak performance was primarily due to significant overvaluation  Fundamentals have remained strong as both earnings and dividends have steadily increased at above average rates  Although I would like to see this research candidate a little cheaper  I believe its growth potential represents an attractive long term opportunity at current levels 

In spite of Polaris Industries  recent price weakness  it has still outperformed the S P 500 on both capital appreciation and cumulative dividend income since 2005  The potential for continued dividend growth and capital appreciation is above average going forward as it has been in the past 

16 Fairly Valued High Quality High Yield Dividend Growth Stocks 
This third category of fairly valued high yield dividend growth stocks are offered for the consideration of those investors that need to get more current yield in their portfolios  However  as a general statement  the majority of these research candidates will not produce above average growth of capital or dividend income  On the other hand  there are a few on the list that do  primarily because they are either currently very undervalued  or have hopefully short term operating issues 
The major integrated oil and gas producers Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  represent examples of companies with hopefully short term issues  Nevertheless  even though these are both extremely high quality companies  there are risks that should be considered 

Eaton Corporation plc  NYSE ETN   High Yield Low Valuation
Eaton Corporation represents an example of a high yield dividend growth stock that has recently become significantly undervalued  Consequently  the high yield in this example is above historical norms as a result  Therefore  I think this example offers the opportunity for significant short and long term capital appreciation   assuming the company moves back to a more normal valuation 

Although the company s current low valuation has caused it to modestly underperform the market on a capital appreciation basis  the total return versus the S P 500 has been very similar  The primary advantage however has been a significantly greater level of total cumulative dividend income than the market  Given today s low valuation relative to the overall market and above market current yield  that situation is very likely to reverse itself in the future 

Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE VZ   High Current Yield Low Valuation
I believe the major telecommunications companies AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon represent solid high yield investments for retirees in need of maximum current income  Although neither of these companies provide opportunities for high capital appreciation  I believe both of their dividends are well protected by strong cash flow generation 

Both AT T and Verizon get their appeal based on their high dividend yields  Although Verizon has protected principle since the beginning of 2005  capital appreciation has been minimal  On the other hand  total cumulative dividend income has been more than double what could have been earned in the S P 500  or from the average bond over the same timeframe 

14 Fairly Valued Reits For High Yield And Capital Appreciation
Although I am not a proponent of chasing yields  I believe that fairly valued REITs are one place that retired investors can safely reach for higher yields and potential capital appreciation  Consequently  I believe that selectively integrating REITs into a retirement portfolio can provide significant benefits not available from typical corporations  REITs by law are required to pay out at least 90  of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends  Additionally  many best of breed REITs provide opportunities for capital appreciation in addition to their high yield  Therefore  I think it makes a great deal of sense to sprinkle a few REITs into retirement portfolios for the higher yielding growth potential they offer 

Omega Healthcare Investors Inc   NYSE OHI   High Yield and Above Average Capital Appreciation
Fairly valued Omega Healthcare offers a strong current yield of 6 1  and I consider it attractively valued  Moreover  as a major player in long term health care facilities  I believe the company has a well defined and bright long term future  Given its current valuation  high current yield and potential for growth  I consider it an excellent option for retirees 

Since 2005 Omega has dramatically outperformed the S P 500 on all accounts  Both capital appreciation and cumulative dividend income have dramatically outperformed the average company as represented by the S P 500 

Senior Housing Properties Trust  NYSE SNH   Very High Yield Low Growth
Senior Housing Properties is the highest yielding but also one of the slowest growing REITs on my list  Nevertheless  I featured it for two reasons  First of all  I wanted to illustrate that not all REITs are the same  just as not all stocks are the same  My second reason was to provide a viable option for those retirees in need of high current yield  As previously mentioned  I am not a proponent of chasing yield  However  there are exceptions to every rule 

A quick examination of Senior Housing Properties clearly illustrates how it is different than many other REITs such as Omega Healthcare  Senior Housing Properties is clearly a yield investment  Consequently  I consider it only suitable for retired investors in need of maximum current income 

A Summary of Strategies and Approaches for Utilizing the Above Dividend Growth Stocks
In part 1 of this series I presented the ideas that retired investors should be realistic about the yields that are available in the marketplace  By realistic  I am referring to appropriate yields that are available from reasonable quality stocks trading at or near fair value  And then I suggested that retirees use that information to build portfolios that would meet their specific income needs and or growth objectives 
In this part 2  I offered 4 primary categories of high quality fairly valued dividend growth stocks with varying attributes of yield or growth  With these various groupings of dividend growth stocks  retirees could pick and choose or mix and match from in order to meet their specific growth or income targets  There are virtually an infinite number of ways that this can be accomplished 
However  there are some general common sense approaches and methods that retirees can utilize and implement  The most appropriate approach is the one that is most likely capable of meeting each individual s unique needs  Next I will list a few strategies that illustrate my point 
For the retired investor s portfolio that is large enough to meet their living needs based on the realistic yields currently available  they might restrict their selections to the categories offering the highest current yields and maximum levels of safety  As stated in part 1  the key is to determine how much yield you need and then make your selections accordingly  For example  if a 3  current yield meet your objectives  you could limit your selections to only those companies that provided current yields of 3  or better 
In contrast  for the retiree in need of a yield higher than 3   they could build a core portfolio including a large percentage of quality above average yield companies with yields of 3  or better  Then they can blend in some of the higher yielding companies in order to generate an overall portfolio yield greater than 3   As a general rule  the more higher yielding candidates you include  the lower your long term capital appreciation potential might be  There is generally a trade off between yield and growth  However  there are exceptions  as illustrated by some of the sample research candidates I featured in the article 
On the other hand  a retiree still in the accumulation phase might lean more heavily on companies from the quality yield and capital appreciation group  Since most of these companies have histories of growing their dividends and generating above average capital appreciation  they might support that objective better than some of the higher yielding groupings 
In summary  what I m suggesting is mixing and matching research candidates from each of the groups that are appropriate for your current and or future needs and objectives  But always keep in the back of your mind that higher yield typically comes at the cost of lower future growth  and vice versa 
As a bonus  I have prepared a free analyze out loud video  which provides a more in depth and detailed look at the four categories of attractive dividend growth stocks 
Summary and Conclusions
The primary objective of this article was to provide specific examples of current attractively valued dividend growth stock opportunities that could be utilized to construct appropriate equity portions of a retirement portfolio  My secondary objective was to illustrate the differences in current and future yields that are realistically available from high quality dividend growth stocks in today s market 
In my opinion  the best way to design a retirement portfolio that s appropriate for you is by clearly understanding what is realistically available and then applying that knowledge towards constructing a successful long term portfolio that s just right for you  It comes down to knowing your options and then sensibly applying the correct mix to accomplish your goals 
In this part 2A I purposely refrained from discussing or presenting extremely high yielding common stock categories  As I alluded to more than once  I am not personally a fan of reaching for yield  especially by investors in retirement  However  there are in fact many extremely high yielding stocks that are available  In part 2B I will present several examples of extremely high yielding companies such as BDCs  MLPs and mortgage REITs 
There are numerous companies in these categories that offer what at first glance appear to be irresistible and enticing double digit current yields  Some of them have yields that are so high that they appear too good to be true  My objective in part 2B will be to illustrate the risks and dangers of investing in extremely high yield securities  However  to be fair  I will also point out some of the advantages that these types of securities also offer

95984,317499,PG,Soft U S  economic data suggests mild second quarter growth rebound,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment aid edged up last week for a third straight week  but the underlying trend continued to point to solid momentum in the labor market 
Still  the rise in jobless claims and other data on Thursday showing weak new home sales in March and factory activity this month could heighten concerns about the economy s ability to rebound strongly after stumbling at the start of the year 
Growth braked sharply as the economy was slammed by harsh winter weather  weak global demand and a now settled labor dispute at West Coast ports  Activity also was constrained by a strong dollar as well as lower energy prices  which cut into domestic oil production 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1 000 to a seasonally adjusted 295 000 for the week ended April 18  the Labor Department said  Despite the increase  claims remained for a seventh consecutive week below the 300 000 threshold  a level associated with a strengthening labor market 
 Overall  the level of claims remains low and is consistent with a healthy labor market   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as a rise in crude oil prices offset disappointing quarterly results from a handful of large companies including Procter   Gamble Co  N PG   which reported a steeper than expected drop in sales 
Prices for U S  government debt rose  while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies 
Last week s claims covered the period during which the government canvassed employers for April s nonfarm payrolls report  The four week moving average of claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  increased 1 750 last week to 284 500 
WEATHER RELATED WEAKNESS
The four week average of claims fell 20 750 between the March and April survey periods  suggesting an acceleration in job growth  Employment growth slowed sharply in March  with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 126 000  ending a 12 month stretch of gains above 200 000 
But with the weakness mostly concentrated in the weather sensitive leisure and construction sectors  economists downplayed the slowdown 
 The trend in claims     continues to impress and runs counter to the disappointment we saw in the March payrolls report  suggesting it may be too early to draw conclusions about the strength of the labor market from that one report   said Derek Lindsey  an analyst at  BNP Paribas   PARIS BNPP  in New York 
Federal Reserve officials have said they would like to see further improvements in the labor market before raising interest rates  The faltering economic growth early in the first quarter has made a June rate hike less likely 
The U S  central bank has kept its short term interest rate near zero since December 2008 
In a separate report  the Commerce Department said new home sales declined 11 4 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481 000 units 
The drop  which was the biggest since July 2013  followed three straight months of hefty gains  and February s sales pace was revised up to the highest level in seven years 
New home sales  which account for 8 5 percent of the market  were up 19 4 percent from a year ago 
 The trend is our friend when you take a step back and see that new home sales are up significantly compared to this time last year  We also saw supply increase  which will help consumers as the spring home buying season kicks off   said Bill Banfield  vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit 
The outlook for the housing market remains upbeat against the backdrop of a strengthening labor market and moves by the government to ease credit conditions for first time buyers 
Data on Wednesday showed that sales of previously owned homes hit an 18 month high in March  while applications for home loans last week vaulted to the highest level since June 2013

The major stock indices finished well off the highs for the day but still in positive territory  The New York Stock Exchange was open for business today  following a 3 5 hour shutdown yesterday  While yesterday s outage stopped trading at the New York Stock Exchange  shares listed on that exchange continued to trade on other venues such as the Nasdaq Stock Market and Bats Global Markets  NYSE officials blame the halt in trading on a software update that didn t work out  And they say it was just coincidental that United Airlines had computer problems that grounded flights for 2 hours 
And it just coincidental that the Wall Street Journal Website went down just before trading was halted  And it was just coincidental that the ZeroHedge website went down just before trading halted  And it was just coincidental 12 hours before the shutdown  the hacktivist group Anonymous sent a Tweet saying   Wonder if tomorrow is going to be bad for Wall Street   we can only hope   And it was just coincidental that China s stock market was going through its own meltdown  though much more fundamental in nature  and the Chinese were more than a little miffed at media coverage of their markets  Just a coincidence  Nothing to see here  Move along

Greece has a plan  According to a  for Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem  a new Greek bailout proposal has been received  Greece is asking for a new three year bailout from its Eurozone creditors  Greece s stock exchange will also remain closed until July 13  after authorities decided to extend a bank holiday and capital controls  Greece has a debt payment due Monday  and about  4 billion due before the end of the month  They don t have the money to pay  US Treasury secretary Jack Lew and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde put pressure on the EU to grant Greece debt relief and help it avoid a Grexit  Both implicitly urged Germany and others to drop their refusal to clear Greek debts  saying the country was in desperate need of a  restructuring  
Desperate doesn t begin to describe it  As Greece hurtles toward a Sunday deadline for either reaching a bailout deal or risking a hasty exit from the Eurozone  the one certainty is that its economy is already on the brink of collapse  Greece already has a humanitarian crisis  and default would be ugly  but a deal wouldn t clean everything up  either  Even though Greece represents just 2 percent of the Eurozone economy  the implications of a country falling out of the euro currency union could be unpredictable  especially if it occurs at the same time as the steep decline in the Chinese stock market 
Betting against stocks has been a losing strategy since 2009 as the Standard   Poor s 500 Index rallied more than 200 percent and all but 22 members climbed  Going short has been like going against the flow  until the past month or so  With stocks in China plunging more than 30 percent over four weeks and aid talks between Greece and its creditors breaking down  bears are perking up  The number of shorted shares increased 3 3 percent from a month ago to 16 2 billion in June  the most since September 2008
The IMF cut its forecast for global growth this year  citing a weaker first quarter in the US and warning that financial market turbulence from China to Greece clouds the outlook  The world economy is now projected to grow 3 3 percent in 2015  less than the 3 5 percent pace projected in April and slower than the 3 4 percent expansion last year  Much of the global downgrade was driven by the U S   which the fund now sees growing 2 5 percent this year  compared with 3 1 percent in April  The IMF this week reiterated its recommendation that the Federal Reserve hold off raising interest rates until the first half of next year  when wage and price inflation are expected to pick up 
More Americans than forecasted filed for unemployment benefits last week  representing a pause in the pace of labor market improvement  Jobless claims climbed by 15 000 to 297 000 in the week ended July 4  the highest since February  Applications for benefits have been below 300 000 for 18 straight weeks

Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  knew as early as 1981 of climate change  seven years before it became a public issue  according to a newly discovered email from one of the firm s own scientists  Despite this the firm spent millions over the next 27 years to promote climate denial

95994,317509,PG,Avoid These Pricy Dividend Stocks,opinion,"Dividend Aristocrats   those companies that have increased their dividends for 25 or more years consecutively   seem ideal for the income investor  After all  their combination of reliable and increasing income is not to be found anywhere else

Before World War II  there was essentially no inflation  and companies were thought to be doing very well if they simply maintained their dividends 
AT T  NYSE T   then including all the regional Bell companies  became known as the ultimate  widows and orphans  stock by maintaining its annual  9 dividend from the 1920s through the Great Depression until 1958  By then  inflation was eating away at the value of the steady dividend income  so AT T increased its dividend and split the stock in 1959 
Procter and Gamble  NYSE PG   which did well through the 1950s  had figured out the persistence of inflation a few years earlier  and so began annual dividend increases in 1954  That makes it the oldest  and therefore most aristocratic  of the Dividend Aristocrats 
Other stocks followed suit in the later 1950s  but the activity wasn t thought especially significant until after the recessions of 1973 to 1975 and 1980 to 1982  which thinned out the list of companies that had been able to maintain their increases  Then  in the 1980s and 1990s  dividend investing became unfashionable  It was only after the crash of 2008 to 2009 that the group of  Dividend Aristocrats  achieved iconic status 
In principle  a company that decides to become a Dividend Aristocrat should have an exceptionally safe dividend  since the status loss from cutting it is so great  But in practice  Aristocrat status can work the other way  Companies stretch their operations to maintain and increase their dividends  underinvesting in recessions and ultimately getting into difficulties  Of 52 Dividend Aristocrats in 2009  10 cut their dividends in 2010  And in the 1930s  the most likely year for Aristocrat humbling came after the trough of the recession 
Pitney Bowes Inc   NYSE PBI   for example  had a stable business in postage meters  and had increased its dividend every year since 1982  However  in 2012  its  440 million of net income was subject to  320 million of adjustments  the net of which failed to cover the  319 million cost of its  1 50 annual dividend  Therefore  with the first dividend declaration in 2013  the company halved its dividend  losing its Aristocrat status  PBI has continued to make money and pay a decent  0 75 annual dividend  but clearly hasn t been reliable as an income stock 
As Chris pointed out a few weeks ago  a number of the current S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats have dividend payouts ratios above 80   putting the sustainability of their dividends in doubt  after all  we re not in a recession   In addition  HCP  Inc   NYSE HCP   a real estate investment trust  has paid dividends exceeding net income for the past three years  I d regard its dividend as shaky  whatever special rules you keep for real estate companies 
The Best of the Bunch
Now  as an Englishman by birth  I like aristocrats in general  though I m certainly not one myself   Yet after a while  you find that not all of the House of Lords are equally pleasant 
Some are vulgar nouveaux riches with flashy tastes and dodgy business ethics  Others are impossibly haughty  using their family connections to make others feel inferior  However  there are a few  like P G  Wodehouse s Earl of Emsworth  who have the right combination of down at heel friendly charm  a sense of humor  a beautiful stately home  and Plantagenet descent 
In this spirit  I give you my favorite Dividend Aristocrat  Emerson Electric  NYSE EMR  
Emerson describes itself as a  technology and engineering solutions company  and has increased its dividend every year since 1957  making it one of the most established Aristocrats  More extraordinarily  it has had just three CEOs since 1954  The current CEO  David Farr  is only 60 and has been in office since 2000 
You hardly ever hear of Emerson in the financial press  even though it s a  38 billion company   another good sign  With management continuity and an excellent profits and dividend record  EMR just oozes aristocracy  Its dividend yield is 3 2   lower than usual because of the market s exuberance  and its P E ratio is a modest 15x 
Even if  as a good American  you disapprove of aristocracies  I think you ll agree that EMR is one of the few exceptions ",2015-07-12,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avoid-these-pricy-dividend-stocks-257975,257975
95995,317510,PG,Unilever  A Company That Offers Stability,opinion,"Unilever  LONDON ULVR  is one of the largest publicly traded personal products company in the world  The company s market cap is  125 billion  For comparison    NYSE PG  has a market cap of  220 billion and Colgate Palmolive Company  NYSE CL  has a market cap of  just   60 billion 
The company s shares are issued in both the Netherlands  UN  and the United Kingdom  UL   The United Kingdom shares are more beneficial to United States shareholders because the United Kingdom does not withhold dividend taxes on United States investors 
Unilever was founded in 1929  The company now operates in over 200 countries and has 400 brands  Some of Unilever s most well known brands consumer products are listed below 
Dove soap
Lever soap
Axe body spray
Degree deodorant
TRESemm  hair products

Unilever Growth Analysis
Note  All of Unilever s growth stats and financial numbers from this point forward are based only on the United Kingdom based UL shares  not the UN shares 
Unilever has grown its earnings per share at 5 3  a year over the last decade  The company s dividends have grown at a slightly faster rate  6 2  a year over the last decade 
Most of Unilever s growth has come from margin improvements  Total sales have actually declined from  59 5 billion in 2008 to  58 8 billion in 2014 
Operating margins have increased from 16 6  in 2005 to 19 4  in 2014  While a 2 8 percentage point boost might not sound like much  it translates over to 16 9  operating income growth 
Going forward  Unilever s growth will likely continue to be somewhat sluggish  The company has over 400 brands  This is similar to the situation Procter   Gamble found itself in before it underwent its large restructuring project to shed underperforming brands and focus on core brands 
An overly large brand portfolio is one reason why Unilever s revenues have stalled  The company is also fighting currency headwinds  Unilever s financial results are translated into United States dollars  The dollar has appreciated around 20  over the last year  The effect of the strong dollar on Unilever s financials is a decrease in reported sales and earnings  Currency effects do not have a serious effect on the company s underlying business or long term growth potential 
Safety and Recession Performance
Unilever does not offer investors rapid growth potential  The company does offer stability  Unilever s portfolio of high quality brands in  give it a durable competitive advantage 
Soap  Dove  Lever   deodorant  Degree   and body spray  Axe  are not going anywhere  Neither is tea  Lipton   Q Tips  or Vaseline  Ice Cream  Ben   Jerry s  Breyer s  will be consumed as long as people have taste buds  Unilever s brands will generate strong cash flows for the company for decades to come  The same cannot be said for most businesses 
Unilever s brand strength and recognition in Q Tips and Vaseline is especially strong  People often refer to petroleum jelly as Vaseline rather than petroleum jelly  and cotton swabs as Q Tips  This is the same level of brand domination that Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  enjoys with its Kleenex brand 
Unilever managed to remain highly profitable throughout the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009  The company s earnings per share through each year of the Great Recession are listed out below 
2007 earnings per share of  1 75
2008 earnings per share of  2 54  all time high 
2009 earnings per share of  1 68
Unilever s best year was in 2008  The company still has not eclipsed earnings per share highs from 2008  The Great Recession did drop earnings from 2008 to 2009  but did not put the company s dividend in any jeopardy 
Unilever currently has  15 4 billion in debt on its balance sheet  The company has an interest coverage ratio of 14  In addition  the company has over  2 billion in cash on hand  Unilever is not over leveraged  The company s high quality brands help insulate it from recessions and generate stable cash flows 
Unilever Valuation
Unilever currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 21 4  The company is trading for a slight premium to the S P 500 s current price to earnings ratio of 20 2  despite having only mediocre growth prospects 
On the other hand  Unilever does have an above average dividend yield of 3 0   The company s high quality brands in slow changing industries make the company a considerably safer long term hold than the average S P 500 stock 
Based on these factors  I believe Unilever is trading around the higher end of its fair value at this time 
Total Return Potential and Final Thoughts
Unilever has grown earnings per share at 5 3  a year over the last decade  Going forward  the company will likely continue growing in the 4  to 7  a year range  This growth combined with Unilever s 3 0  dividend yield gives investors expected total returns of 7  to 10  a year 
The real appeal of Unilever stock is its high safety  The company s consumer products brands all but ensure investors will continue to see steady or rising dividends  Unilever is a low risk investment that offers  ",2015-07-12,Sure Dividend,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-safety---a-3-yield-look-into-unilever-now-257984,257984
95996,317511,PG,20 Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Today For Retirement,opinion,"Introduction
We are in the seventh year of a strong bull market  and stock valuations have generally become extended as measured by the S P 500  It is undeniable that the overall market s valuation today is higher than it has been in years  However  even though that statement may be true in the general sense  it does not mean that every stock in the market is overvalued  Nevertheless  there are many investors unwilling to invest in any common stocks simply because they believe the market is too high  even though there may be many individual stocks available at attractive valuations 
This all stocks are too high attitude is even more pervasive when it comes to dividend growth stocks  Many are arguing that because interest rates are so low  investors desirous of income have driven up the valuations of all blue chip dividend growth stocks to dangerously high levels  Although I will agree that this is in fact true for perhaps a majority of blue chip dividend growth stocks  it is not true for all of them as I will illustrate later 
With this in mind  I conducted an extensive search of all prominent dividend growth stocks looking for value and attractive dividend yields  I went through the entire  of Champions  Contenders and Challengers presented by fellow Seeking Alpha author David Fish  and screened the entire universe of more than 20 000 companies in the F A S T  Graphs  research tool universe  My objective was to find 20 attractively valued high quality dividend growth stocks that could produce an average yield greater than 3  in the aggregate  Although attractive value and above average yield was admittedly difficult to find  I was able to come up with my list of 20 
Principles of Sound Valuations on Common Stocks
Examining the same concept expressed in my introduction from a different perspective  rational investors recognize that all stocks do not move in tandem with the market  This is especially true over the longer run  In my experience  I have an observed and learned that there are two primary forces that generate long term returns on an individual stock  business   The first and foremost driver of return is the level of operating success of the business behind the stock  The second primary driver is the price or valuation you pay to buy the stock relative to its operating business success  
A company s operating success is typically reflected by its earnings growth rate per share over time  In the same vein  valuation is often measured as a function of the multiple of earnings you pay to buy the company s operating success  The company s earnings multiple is expressed as a P E ratio  which is simply the company s price divided by its earnings 
However  the more important aspect of the P E ratio is that it also serves as a quick and simple measurement of the return on your invested capital that a company s total earnings provide when expressed as earnings yield  This is also a simple calculation  which is just the inverse of the P E ratio  In order to determine a company s earnings yield  you invert the formula and divide earnings by price  E P   earnings yield   A quicker and easier way to calculate earnings yield is to simply divide the number 1 by the P E ratio  For example  if you divide the number 1 by a P E ratio of 15  you get an earnings yield of 6 67  rounded  1 15 6 67  
Now  at this point  it should be understood that calculating earnings yield does not simultaneously indicate that by investing as a shareholder  partner in a company  that you are entitled to all of its earnings  Instead  earnings yield is a useful indication of whether or not the company s earnings power is adequately compensating you for the risk you are taking in comparison to alternative investment options 
One method where this calculation becomes especially useful is as a measurement of the risk premium a stock offers in relation to prevailing risk free rates  The most common risk free measurement is the 10 year T bill  The current rate on a 10 year T bill is 2 23   Therefore  rational investors would expect a company to offer a risk premium earnings yield that is significantly higher than 2 23   This same logic would equally apply to evaluating the valuation of an index like the S P 500  just as it does to an individual stock 
Another way to utilize the earnings yield in order to evaluate fair valuation is to compare it to the long term average return that stocks have historically generated  Depending on the timeframe being measured  the long term average return on stocks is somewhere in the range of 6  to 8   Keep in mind that this is the average  meaning that some stocks have historically done better and some stocks have done worse 
But more importantly  this indicates that it is no coincidence that the average P E ratio of the S P 500 has historically been approximately 15  Consequently  as a general rule of thumb  and depending on a given company s earnings growth potential and quality characteristics  a P E ratio of 15 is a reasonable indication of fair or sound value  Although this is not a perfect indicator of fair value  I have learned to trust a P E ratio of 15 to be an objective indicator of sound value for most companies 
However  just as it is with all rules of thumb  there are rational exceptions or adjustments that can be made  For example  it might be rational to pay a modest premium for impeccable quality  Additionally  it might also be rational to accept a moderately higher valuation on a blue chip dividend growth stock when its yield is attractive enough  coupled with a history of raising its dividend every year  Furthermore  with interest rates as low as they are today  the spread between the risk premium on stocks versus risk free 10 year T bonds may also be high enough to indicate a willingness to pay a modest premium valuation on stocks 
To summarize  a P E ratio of 15 can serve as a reasonable valuation guide or reference  However  it is not perfect  and therefore should not be thought of as an absolute  Instead  I contend that it be thought of as a fair valuation reference or a first glance indication that fair valuation may be evident on a stock  With a P E ratio of 15 serving as a valuation baseline  appropriate adjustments can and should be made based on many other factors  such as the ones I discussed above  But most importantly  the investor should be cognizant that a P E ratio higher than 15 represents a lower earnings yield  and consequently the potential for earning a lower future total rate of return  Of course  the opposite is also true 
The S P 500  A Valuation Perspective
The blended P E ratio of the S P 500 Index is 17 6  therefore  clearly moderately higher than my baseline fair value P E ratio of 15 previously discussed  This clearly indicates overvaluation  however  I would argue that this does not indicate especially dangerous levels from a long term perspective  On the other hand  this would indicate the potential for a short term correction of 15  or greater if the market was to move back to a fair value P E ratio of 15  This is vividly revealed and calculated on the earnings and price correlated graph on the S P 500 below 

However  if we take a slightly longer term view out to calendar year end 2017 and run a return calculation assuming a normal P E ratio of 15 based on consensus analyst earnings estimates  we could see a positive total annual return in excess of 4   This is below the long term average returns for the index  but it is at least positive 

Taking a slightly more optimistic view  if we applied a historical normal P E ratio of 16 as reflected in the long term graph above  the S P 500 index could generate a total annual rate of return of 6 83   This would be consistent with the long term average return of the index 

Regarding the accuracy of analysts  earnings estimates on the S P 500 index  the following analyst scorecard suggests we have a better than 70  chance that they might get it right  The scorecard is based on analysts  historical accuracy records when making forecasts one year forward and two years forward  There is a 10  accepted margin for error on the one year forward estimates  and a 20  accepted margin for error on the two years forward estimates 

Top 10 High Quality Blue Chip Dividend Growth Stocks with an Average Aggregate Yield of 3 
In this part 1 of this 2 part series I will present my top 10 blue chip dividend growth stock research candidates in order of the highest S P credit rating to the lowest  All but 2 of these top 10 blue chips are currently available at my fair valuation baseline P E ratio of 15 or lower  When I cover them individually I will argue that the two exceptions  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   could be considered worthy of a modest premium valuation 
The average current dividend yield of this top 10 list is slightly in excess of 3   But more importantly  most of them are Dividend Champions or Aristocrats with long histories of increasing their dividends every year  In each specific example  I will present calculations of potential future total returns on the same basis that I did with the S P 500 index above 

Johnson   Johnson  JNJ 
Johnson   Johnson  with its AAA credit rating and low debt to capital ratio  is arguably the highest quality dividend growth stock on the planet  Although its blended P E ratio at 16 5 is moderately above my baseline valuation reference  I believe the company is worthy of this modest premium  especially considering its current yield of 3  

On the other hand  when you pay a premium for quality  you must simultaneously be prepared to accept a lower rate of return as a result  The following rate of return calculation based on consensus estimates would indicate a 5  annual total return through investing in Johnson   Johnson out to 2017  It should be noted that the majority of this return would be supplied by Johnson   Johnson s expected total cumulative dividends  Consequently  I offer Johnson   Johnson as a safe research candidate offering above average yield 

Regarding analyst estimates  the following analyst scorecard indicates a perfect record on this bluest of blue chips dividend growth stock  Consequently  I offer the expectations of the above calculated total annual return with high confidence 

Wal Mart Stores Inc   NYSE WMT 
High quality dividend growth stock Wal Mart Stores Inc  has fallen over 14  since the beginning of the year as a result of recent earnings weakness  This brings it comfortably down to my baseline fair valuation level 

Wal Mart s earnings are expected to recover next year and the following two years thereafter  Assuming a fair value P E ratio of 15 based on consensus earnings estimates out to 2017 indicates a total annual rate of return in excess of 7  

The analyst scorecard on Wal Mart is almost as impressive as what we saw with Johnson   Johnson  However  it should be noted that the only miss that analysts recorded since calendar year 2000 was for the last fiscal year when earnings were slightly down 

Cisco Systems  Inc   CSCO 
Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  has only paid a dividend since fiscal year 2011  However  its dividend growth rate has been impressive  With a current P E ratio of 13 and a dividend yield of 3   I believe Cisco represents an excellent value at these levels 

It should be noted that Cisco has only commanded a historical normal P E ratio of 14 since fiscal year 2007  This is clearly below my fair value baseline P E ratio of 15  However  even if you only assume that Cisco s stock price moves to a P E ratio of 14 by fiscal year end July 2018  and further assume that analysts estimates are correct  this research candidate offers the potential for double digit returns in excess of 12  per annum 

It was not a surprise to see that the analysts scorecard on Cisco was not perfect  After all  this is a tech stock and therefore  prone to moderate cyclicality  Nevertheless  the company s low valuation and 3  dividend yield indicate that AA  rated Cisco is attractive at current levels 

International Business Machine  IBM  NYSE IBM  
IBM  once considered one of the bluest of blue chips  has been recently maligned due to earnings weakness  However  I believe that IBM s extremely low valuation and high dividend yield warrant consideration 

When calculating the potential future return on IBM out to fiscal year end 2017  I chose to utilize a conservative P E ratio valuation only moving to 12 8  Although analysts expect only moderate growth for the next couple of years  today s current low valuation would indicate high double digit return potential 

Considering that future growth expectations are rather low  coupled with a reasonably high scorecard  I have confidence that IBM represents an attractive long term opportunity  To be clear  I believe that much of the risk associated with investing in IBM is already reflected in its low valuation 

The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG 
Procter   Gamble is a blue chip dividend growth stock that has historically commanded a premium valuation  Recent softness in earnings  performance has driven the stock down approximately 10  since the beginning of the year  Although this blue chip offers little in the form of growth  its dividend yield of 3 5  is worthy of consideration 

Utilizing the company s historical normal P E ratio of 17 8 as a target  Procter   Gamble offers the potential to generate annual returns in excess of 7  out to fiscal year end June 2018  However  it should be noted that more than half of that return is expected to come from dividends 

The most comforting aspect of the analyst scorecard on Procter   Gamble is the 2 year forward forecast record  Consequently  this gives me confidence that Procter   Gamble might deliver on analysts  expectations over the next couple of years 

Royal Bank of Canada  NYSE RY 
Royal Bank of Canada is considered one of the best Canadian banks  I found this research candidate interesting because it is a dual listed security  The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graph looks at Royal Bank as it s listed on the New York Stock Exchange  Consequently  this is the graph that would be best utilized by US residents  Note that all data is presented in US dollars  USD   Low valuation and high current yield is the primary attraction 

Once again  utilizing a discounted historical normal P E ratio of only 12 3 would indicate the potential for double digit returns out to fiscal year end October 2017 in excess of 12  per annum  High dividend yield and low valuation is the attraction here 

The analyst scorecard on Royal Bank of Canada has been exceptional  Consequently  I have confidence that future earnings forecasts are reasonable 

For those investors domiciled in Canada  the Royal Bank presents a more consistent historical record of earnings and dividend growth  The following earnings and price correlated graph illustrates Royal Bank on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX  and all data is presented in Canadian dollars  CAD  

Devoid of potential currency exchange headwinds  the Canadian version of Royal Bank is more consistent than what we saw on the New York Stock Exchange version  Nevertheless  the return potential for both US and Canadian citizens are similar  

S P Capital IQ only provides analyst scorecard data on one year forward estimates for the TSX listing  Nevertheless  analysts have been accurate with their forecasts 

Cummins Inc   NYSE CMI 
Cummins Inc has a moderately cyclical record of earnings growth  However  its record of dividend growth has been consistent and strong  The company s recent earnings and revenue beat seem inconsistent with its recent weak price action  Consequently  its low P E ratio and above average dividend yield appear attractive 

Leading analysts reporting on Cummins  CMI  appear to be very upbeat about their earnings over the next couple of years  Consequently  this A  rated dividend growth stock with a low debt to capital ratio and a dividend yield over 3  appears quite attractive in today s overvalued environment 

However  due to the cyclical nature of this company s operating history  the analyst scorecard has not been as accurate as we ve seen with other companies  Therefore  prospective investors should monitor future earnings reports closely  On the other hand  current low valuation and dividend yield might mitigate some of that potential risk 

Qualcomm Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM 
Qualcomm s current low valuation is somewhat justifiable based on its recent earnings reports  Nevertheless  the company appears attractively valued with a dividend yield above 3  and a consistent record of dividend increases since they initiated one in 2002 

If we assume that Qualcomm trades at its historical normal P E ratio of 18 by fiscal year end September 2017  the future return potential is extraordinary  A quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated graph would indicate that this is not the first time that Qualcomm experienced a moderate earnings drop 

The 1 and 2 year forward analyst scorecard on Qualcomm does indicate some caution  Nevertheless  low valuation and high dividend yield indicate this candidate as an attractive opportunity 

Archer Daniels Midland Company  NYSE ADM 
The primary attraction motivating me to include Archer Daniels Midland was its fair valuation P E ratio and prospects for a return to growth next fiscal year  Additionally  in spite of a moderately cyclical record of earnings  this Dividend Champion has consistently increased its dividend for 40 consecutive years 

In spite of leading analysts expecting a flattening of earnings in fiscal year 2017  Archer Daniels Midland still calculates out to a total annual rate of return in excess of 7   The real attraction to this dividend candidate is its long history of dividend increases 

The analysts  record of forecasting future earnings is positive  but not as consistent as we saw with other companies on the list  Nevertheless  the real story with Archer Daniels Midland is reasonable valuation and a long record of increasing its dividend 

AFLAC Incorporated  NYSE AFL 
Aflac is a financial that has suffered with low valuation since the Great Recession of 2008  Additionally  earnings growth has been weak over the past several years  Nevertheless  Aflac is a Dividend Champion that has consecutively increased its dividend for 32 straight years 

Even when you assume that Aflac will continue to trade at a discounted P E ratio to the market average  the company still offers the opportunity for average total returns  However  even in spite of low future earnings growth expectations  if the company were to once again be valued at a market multiple P E ratio of 15  the annualized total return would exceed 23  per annum  Consequently  I consider this an attractive long term opportunity for the patient dividend growth investor 

A strong analyst scorecard contributes to my confidence in analysts  forecasts on Aflac  Consequently  I see a low downside potential with a possibility of significant long term upside 

Summary and Conclusions
In this part 1 of a 2 part series  I presented the first 10 of 20 attractively valued high quality dividend growth stocks with an average aggregate current yield exceeding 3   In part 2  I will present 10 additional fairly valued dividend growth stocks  some of which offer higher dividend yields as I move down the quality chain  The fairly valued research candidates I will present in part 2 will offer an average aggregate current dividend yield exceeding 4 3  
Assuming an equal investment in each of the 20 research candidates provides an average aggregate dividend yield of 3 66   Although each candidate was primarily suggested based on the merit of fair or attractive valuation  the 10 research candidates in this article was primarily focused on quality  In part 2  the 10 candidates presented were focused primarily on either yield or total return 
Consequently  the primary objective behind both articles is that there are fairly valued common stock opportunities even in today s moderately overvalued market  Admittedly  it is getting very difficult to find attractive valuation at any quality level  Nevertheless  I believe that the research candidates presented in this series are worthy of consideration for those retired investors primarily focused on income  However  thanks to fair valuation  I believe this group of 20 dividend growth stocks also offers a reasonable opportunity for capital appreciation  Given the current high valuation of the S P 500  I believe this group of stocks also provides the opportunity for market beating future total returns as well

Sterling Rebounds on Stronger U S  Data

Hot Topic  Can Stocks Rise On Strong Dollar 
One of the hot topics in the financial markets and on CNBC Monday was the question of whether stocks can continue to rally with a rising U S  dollar and it could not come at a better time with the wrap up of fourth earnings  In Q4  many big names like  NYSE P G    NASDAQ Google    NYSE IBM  and  NYSE McDonald s  have said a strong dollar stifled earnings and with the dollar index appreciating more than 10  between January and mid March  the main concern is that Q1 earnings will take an even bigger hit  For an individual company or sector  the impact of the dollar can be significant    both directly and indirectly  through the changes in commodity prices and other factors  but for the S P 500 as a whole  the following chart shows that a rising dollar has very little immediate impact on stocks  In fact  a now well circulated study by  NYSE Goldman Sachs  found that the S P 500 index is indifferent to FX moves  Since 1981  the median annualized return of the index was nearly identical in both strong and weak U S  dollar cycles and similarly on a 1 year basis  they found the daily correlation of the dollar and stocks to be zero  This indicates that many multi national companies do fine when the dollar is strong because a strong dollar makes raw material imports cheaper and helps to preserve margins 

But many investors are wondering if the current market environment is different because the Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates  Borrowing a line from the Brits  stocks won t crash if the Fed opts for a gentle rise in rates  Taking a look at the last 15 times the Federal Reserve raised interest rates after keeping them on hold for some time  the S P 500 rose on average 0 8  one month after the first hike  The worst sell off was in 1999 when stocks fell 3 2   which was a steep but short lived decline because just 12 months later  the index was up 6   As long as U S  data continues to improve providing support for current and future earnings expectations  stocks can still rise  This last stipulation is one the Federal Reserve will need to keep in mind if it wants to prevent a crash in equities when its starts raising rates  In order to maintain steady earnings expectations  the central bank will need to ensure that rates don t rise quickly and aggressively    a point we expect Yellen to stress at this week s FOMC meeting 
Euro Sees Strongest Rise in Over 20 Days
After dropping to a fresh 12 year low during the early Asian trading session  EUR USD reversed sharply  Monday  rising by the strongest amount in 20 trading days  No Eurozone economic reports were released  but softer U S  data drove the U S  dollar lower against most of the major currencies  According to the Empire State manufacturing survey and NAHB housing market reports  the recovery in the U S  economy lost momentum in March  That led investors to wonder if the Fed will signal patience at this week s meeting  more on this Tuesday   EUR USD traders were also disappointed that the ECB did not buy more bonds last week as part of its Quantitative Easing program  According to the central bank  it bought 9 751 billion euros  which is less than the amount that it needs to buy on a weekly basis to achieve its 60 billion euro a month target  That raised concerns that there are not enough sellers  which is perceived to be euro positive because less money is injected into the economy  The currency also benefitted from the latest comments from ECB President Draghi who noted the signs of a sustained recovering taking hold in the region s economy  The German ZEW survey is scheduled for release Tuesday and between Draghi s optimistic outlook  the positive implications of QE and stronger German data  we expect an improvement in investor confidence  which could drive EUR USD above 1 0650 
CAD  Oil Drop to 6 Year Lows
The decline in commodity prices prevented the Canadian and Australian dollars from trading higher against the greenback Monday  The oil price dropped to its lowest level in 6 years on rising inventories and signs of a possible nuclear deal with Iran  which could allow for the sale of Iranian oil to the global market  That was the lowest price for oil since March 2009 and raises the risk of a move below  40 a barrel  There s no doubt that central bankers around the world are watching the move in oil closely because a break below  40 would lower inflation expectations and either add pressure on central banks thinking about easing or slow others from tightening  Gold prices also declined slightly but the upcoming RBA minutes are the main reason for the consolidative price action in the Aussie  The last time we heard from the central bank  it left rates unchanged and said that further easing may be appropriate in the months ahead  which meant that it is still inclined to lower interest rates  The minutes will most likely reinforce the bank s dovish bias and reinvigorate the decline in the Australian dollar  Finally  the New Zealand dollar traded sharply higher against the greenback despite a slowdown in service sector activity 
Sterling Rebounds on Stronger U S  Data
Like the euro  sterling rebounded against the U S  dollar Monday  House prices grew at a slower pace according to Rightmove but the market ignored the news choosing instead to focus on weaker U S  data  This week will be an important one for sterling as Bank of England Governor Carney s recent comments have left investors thoroughly confused  On the one hand  he has been talking about gentle rate rises while on the other  he s expressed concern about sterling strength  The BoE minutes will shed light on where the monetary policy committee as a whole stands and how likely rates are to rise this year  We believe there s more upside than downside risk to this week s U K  event risks but  given that the minutes and employment report will be released on the same day as the FOMC minutes  the price action for GBP USD could be dominated by U S  dollar flows  For a purer sterling bet  its best to look at the crosses ",2015-03-16,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-stocks-rise-on-strong-dollar-245196,245196

96027,317542,PG,Preferred Stock ETF Dodges High Yield Mania,opinion,"I often caution against running with the   especially when it comes to higher yielding securities 

Well  Bank of America recently put out a report warning about  a cleansing drop in asset prices   Sure enough  the popularity of various high yield investments is one of the five potential catalysts   which the analysts have combined into an ominous C R A S H  acronym 

The report includes perhaps the most striking depiction of the  reach for yield  phenomenon I ve ever seen 



Cumulative flows into dividend funds  master limited partnerships  MLPs   real estate investment trusts  REITs   and high yield bonds have totaled  413 billion since 2002 

The popularity of these investments  along with the associated fund flows  has adversely impacted their risk reward propositions  Returns are effectively pulled forward in time as investors chase prices higher  thereby lowering yields  Meanwhile  stock valuations become inflated  hampering performance 

For example  in July 2014  I noted that Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   a Dividend Aristocrat  had become expensive relative to its historical valuation  Despite a nice yield and solid underlying businesses  the stock had underperformed since mid 2013   and it continues to underperform 

Since my article  PG has gained 3 2  on a total return basis  including dividends   compared with an advance of 9 1  for the S P 500  The stock continues to work off its high valuation  but many investors are complacent 

Indeed  high yielding stocks and other  crowded trades  are particularly vulnerable if the herd was to get spooked  as BofAML has illustrated 

However  there s one corner of the market that s conspicuously absent from the above chart  preferred stocks  They re perhaps the only higher yielding assets which are truly out of favor 

Because they ve been overlooked during this high yield mania  at least so far   yields offered by preferred stocks are still relatively high in this low yield environment  Many preferred stocks are still yielding just as much as they were in 2010  when the U S  10 year Treasury rate was above 3 5  

Back in January 2014  we highlighted a special type of  with a floating dividend 

As it turns out  there s now a convenient way to own a basket of these floating  variable  rate preferreds via an exchange traded fund  ETF   The PowerShares Variable Rate Preferred ETF  VRP   which holds nearly 100 preferred stocks and similar  hybrid securities   has a trailing 12 month yield of 4 6  

That s a slightly lower return than traditional preferred stock funds  which behave more like bonds with long durations  sensitivity to interest rates   Variable rate preferreds  on the other hand  tend to trade more like bonds with shorter durations  However  this lower risk profile is going to be welcome for many conservative investors 

This way  we can earn a relatively high yield and still be protected from a  cleansing  crash that BofAML has warned about 

By investing in variable rate preferreds  you can be a trailblazer rather than a herd follower 

Safe  and high yield  investing ",2015-05-24,Alan Gula,https://www.investing.com/analysis/preferred-stock-etf-dodges-high-yield-mania-252734,252734

Is Strong Dollar the Fed s  1 Problem this Month  
We all know that the U S  dollar has had a great month  In the past 30 days  it appreciated against all of the major currencies  rising more than 4  in value versus the Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar  Since the beginning of the year  the dollar is up more than 7  versus the euro and over 6  against the Australian and Canadian dollars  Even though it gave up part of its gains on Monday  the uptrend in the greenback remains intact  A strong currency is rarely positive for a country s economy and Monday  report that President Obama said the strong dollar is a problem is in line with the challenges posed by the recent strength of the currency  These reports were denied by the U S  government  because it would never publicly stray away from paying lip service to its all mighty dollar policy  But in reality  the rising dollar is a problem for the Federal Reserve  There are 2 primary consequences of a strong currency   weaker exports and lower inflation  The U S  is not an export dependent economy and based on the trade balance  the strong dollar has not been major drag on export activity  although corporate earnings have suffered  In the first quarter  big names such as Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  blamed weaker earnings on the stronger currency because it reduces their earnings abroad  The impact that a strong dollar has on inflation is more significant  It keeps a lid on price pressures  which normally is not bad if not for the low level of inflation around the world  Yet the latest report showed core consumer prices rising at its strongest pace since June 2013  a sign that inflation is moving back toward the Federal Reserve s target  So as it stands right now  the strong dollar is not a big problem for the Federal Reserve but it can be a problem if it continues to move higher  which is almost a certainty with the central bank preparing to raise interest rates this year  On average  the greenback has already appreciated more than 6  since the beginning of the year and if it rises by another 6  on the back of Fed tightening  it could slow the cycle  Most other countries would welcome a stronger dollar at this stage because it would drive their local currencies lower  encourage exports and boost inflation  With no major U S  economic reports scheduled for release until Thursday  consolidation and profit taking is likely for the dollar over the next few days  With 125 broken  the next stop should be 123 80 
Behind the 1  Jump in Euro 
Euro was the best performing currency Monday  rising more than 1  versus the U S  dollar  Better than expected German data kicked off the rally with industrial production and the trade balance rising strongly  As we mentioned above  other countries like Europe would welcome a strong dollar as the weakness of the euro drives economic activity  While Quantitative Easing has played a role in the region s recovery  the much larger contribution was from the currency  We saw that in Monday s data   not only did the trade balance beat expectations but more importantly  exports rose 1 9  when they were expected to fall by 0 4   The decline in the dollar also contributed to the euro s strength along with comments from ECB officials  ECB member Nowotny said the downturn in the Eurozone is over and according to Noyer  a Greek exit would not cause instability for the Eurozone  We beg to differ and see Greece as an ongoing headache for the region especially if Germany is willing to let Greece go  According to Schaeuble  if there are no reforms they are willing to let Greece exit the euro  At the same time  Greek officials continue to reject the EU IMF proposal so clearly no meaningful progress is being made which should have been negative for the currency and yet euro traded sharply higher today  We believe that selling euros on the 1 13 handle is an attractive opportunity 
EUR GBP Soars on Euro Strength 
The British pound traded slightly higher against the U S  dollar but fell sharply versus the euro  That was  of course  due to euro strength  not sterling weakness  Tuesday s trade balance report and Wednesday s industrial production numbers are the most important pieces of economic data on the U K  calendar this week  However the bigger market movers could be speeches from Bank of England Governor Carney  Chancellor Osbourne and BoE member McCafferty  The Bank of England is comfortable with the current level of monetary policy but Carney and McCafferty are generally more hawkish  So if they touch on monetary policy or the economy  it will most likely help the currency  It is believed that McCafferty is very close to voting for a rate hike  but having just lowered its growth outlook last month  chances are the Bank of England will leave rates unchanged for the rest of the year  We are looking for GBP USD to consolidate this week with a bias to the upside and we see EUR GBP dipping back below 73 cents 
CAD Shrugs Off Stronger Housing Data
Better than expected Canadian housing market data failed to lend support to the Canadian dollar as USD CAD traded slightly higher after bouncing off 1 24 support  Canadian housing starts jumped from 183 3k to 201 7k in May while building permits rose 11 6  against expectations for a 5  decline  Between the uptick in manufacturing activity  jump in employment and stronger housing market activity  there are clear signs of recovery in Canada s economy  The Bank of Canada is in no place to raise interest rates but its outlook will have improved with the latest reports and so we are looking for USD CAD to drop below 1 24  The Australian and New Zealand dollars traded higher Monday but the best performer was NZD  No data was released from either country but both currencies benefitted from stronger Chinese trade numbers  China s trade surplus ballooned to  59 49B from  44 8B in May  exports and imports declined but the drop in exports was less than anticipated  The decline in imports however was large  which has raised speculation about the possibility of additional easing by the PBoC ",2015-06-08,Kathy Lien,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-strong-dollar-the-fed’s-1-problem-this-month-254352,254352

The Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee is meeting to determine monetary policy  Tomorrow they will issue a statement and Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference  Nobody expects the Fed to change policy tomorrow but they will probably signal that they are looking to raise interest rates at the FOMC s September meeting  with a few qualifiers  if the labor market continues to improve  if mild inflation does not turn into deflation  if global markets don t melt down  if the dollar remains well behaved  And then  over the next few weeks  the policymakers will talk about how the rate hike will be small and measured

doesn t have plans to present new proposals at the Eurogroup meeting on Thursday  saying it is up to creditors to make the next move  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras accused the International Monetary Fund of  criminal  responsibility for his country s predicament  Tsipras s rhetoric further diminishes the chances that the Greek government will be able to bridge the divide with its creditors in the IMF  the ECB and the European Commission any time soon New reports  mainly out of Germany  that European governments are ready to push for capital controls in Greece if there s no deal this week  That would mean a severe lockdown on flows of cash similar to the ones brought in for Cyprus in 2013  strict limits on the amount that could be withdrawn from banks  taken abroad physically  or passed between international accounts  The move would slam the brakes on outflows of money streaming out of Greek banks  There s no institutional procedure for the rest of Europe locking down an individual member state  Greece would have to pass its own law agreeing to the capital controls  and only if there is a run on Greek banks  which has basically been underway for quite some time  the ECB has been supplying emergency liquidity assistance  or emergency cash  so the way to force capital controls is to remove the emergency assistance  the Greek banks run out of cash and

Update schedule  I generally update Trend Model readings on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at  humblestudent 
Outlook is turning bearish
In the past week  the outlook has turned decidedly negative for the following reasons 
Commodities are signaling a lack of demand 
US EPS estimates continue to deteriorate 
Uncertainty is rising in Europe 
Let s go through these factors  one by one  
Commodities signaling weak global economy
Commodity prices have been falling for quite some time and they represent a key input to my Trend Model  Historically  falling commodity prices have signaled weakness in the global growth outlook  In my last post  see Good news  bad news on the commodity downturn   I struggled to find reasons such as USD strength and the de financialization of commodities as an investment to explain the downtrend  Perhaps this time is different 

Alas  this time is NOT different  Even if we to filter out the effects of the strong USD  the picture isn t pretty  The chart below shows the CRB Indexdenominated in euros  Even in euro terms  the CRB remains in a downtrend 




The chart of industrial metals in euros is a bit more constructive as it appears to have rallied through a downtrend and seems to be trying to stabilize 




Overall  I would rate the message from the commodity market as neutral to negative at best  Mr  Market is telling a story of a lack of global demand  which is not helpful for the growth outlook and risk appetite 

The failing grade from US Earnings Season

In the US  the equity outlook is deteriorating  The latest analysis from  of Factset shows that forward EPS continues to fall  As the chart shows  falling consensus EPS has historically been associated to either corrections or bear markets  annotations in red are mine  




In the past few weeks  I had been cautiously bullish as I waited for EPS estimates to turn up as the benefits of lower oil prices became more clear  It s time to throw in the towel on that thesis 
Earnings Season is in full swing with 227 of the companies in the S P 500 having reported their Q4 results and there is no sign of an upturn in estimates  The earnings beat rate is 80   which is well above the historical average  and the sales beat rate is 58   which is roughly in line with past history  The more disturbing result is the negative guidance rate  which is a whopping 80  and has consequently pushed down estimate revisions 

While Energy stocks have born the brunt of the earnings downgrades   reports that negative revisions have not been confined to that sector alone  emphasis added  
The biggest drag is expected to be energy companies suffering from the oil price collapse  but analysts have dropped projections in almost every sector as the earnings reporting season has unfolded On Jan  1  SP 500 first quarter earnings were forecast to rise 5 3 percent  including energy companies  and 10 5 percent excluding energy companies  On Thursday  that consensus forecast was flat from a year ago including the energy sector  and cut to 7 9 percent growth excluding energy 
The earnings headwinds are not just coming from falling oil prices for energy companies  The stronger USD is posing a challenge for multi nationals  Consider  for example  this comment from the   NYSE PG   which missed expectations because of greenback strength  emphasis added  
Core earnings per share were  1 06  a decrease of eight percent versus the prior year  Foreign exchange reduced core earnings by about  0 16 per share  resulting in a 14  decrease in core earnings per share 
And this 
 The October   December 2014 quarter was a challenging one with unprecedented currency devaluations   said Chairman  President and Chief Executive Officer A G  Lafley   Virtually every currency in the world devalued versus the U S  dollar  with the Russian ruble leading the way  While we continue to make steady progress on the strategic transformation of the company   which focuses P G on about a dozen core categories and 70 to 80 brands  on leading brand growth  on accelerating meaningful product innovation and increasing productivity savings   the considerable business portfolio  product innovation  and productivity progress was not enough to overcome foreign exchange  
 showed that negative guidance was not restricted to just energy 

The gloom is spreading  according to   emphasis added  
U S  chief executive officers are more pessimistic about corporate earnings than any time since the financial crisis  according to research from Bespoke Investment Group LLC   The percentage of companies cutting profit forecasts during this earnings season has outpaced those with upward revisions by 8 6 percentage points  the widest margin in six years  according to data compiled by Bespoke  Consumer companies and drugmakers are the most bearish among 10 major industries  with at least 18 percent of each group providing lower guidance  the data show 
The Street is now projecting negative EPS growth in Q1 and Q2 
Analysts now expect per share earnings from SP 500 companies to decline 2 1 percent in the first quarter and fall 1 1 percent over the following period  estimates compiled by Bloomberg show  Should the forecasts come true  it would be the first back to back profit contractions since 2009 
Fundamentally  there are two basic ways that stock prices can advance  Either the P E multiple expands  the E in the P E ratio rises  or both  Now consider that  for more details see  Sort of  debunking the bear case for stocks  
Valuations are elevated 
The Fed is starting a tightening cycle  which will put downward pressure on P E multiples  and
EPS estimates are falling 
The combination of these factors is a recipe for either a bear market or correction  In a more typical mid expansion phase of an economic cycle  especially when energy input prices are falling   the positive effects of rising earnings growth offsets the negative effects of Fed tightening  This time  EPS estimates are falling down on the job 
A WTF Greek moment
 Across the Atlantic  the macro picture looks dire on a short term basis  Late in the European trading day  we saw the news from Greece that they would decline the next round of  7 billion aid without a deal on the conditions surrounding the funds  according to  
Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis set the clock ticking on Greece s standoff with the euro area on Friday saying he s ready to take his chances without a financial backstop rather than submit to more austerity   The new government may be operating without a financial safety net for the first time in five years by March after Varoufakis challenged the euro area to agree to a new framework of support that allows for more spending  Greece won t engage with officials from the troika who have been policing the conditions of its rescue since 2010  he said at a joint press conference with Eurogroup Chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem in Athens    We don t plan to cooperate with that committee   Varoufakis said   The Greek state has a future  but what we won t accept has a future is the self perpetuating crisis of deflation and unsustainable debt  
While I continue to believe that the standoff between the new Greek government and the Troika will end in a benign manner  see The  European  parents fight and the kids hear everything   the news of the Greek opening gambit in negotiation undoubtedly represented a WTF moment for the market  Without the next tranche of aid  Greece will quickly run out of money  perhaps as soon as the end of February  To put the latest Greek announcement into context  Imagine that some criminals try to rob a bank but the robbery attempt has turned bad  They are holed up in the bank and have taken several hostages  but are surrounded by the police  The police send in a negotiator  Instead of trying to convince the criminals into giving themselves up  he orders the police sharpshooters to shoot a hostage  in order to show that the robbers have no negotiating leverage   Maybe this unusual opening gambit  which undoubtedly befuddled the eurocrats  can be explained by the fact that Greek finance minister Yaris Varoufakis once  on game theory   Then  on Saturday  Greek PM Tsipras sought to tone down the rhetoric as part of a damage control effort  according to this  report  emphasis added  
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras sought to repair relations with Greece s creditors ahead of a diplomatic push to win support for his economic program  as euro area officials said they re looking for concessions from the new government  Greece will repay its debts to the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund and reach a deal  soon  with the euro area nations that funded most of the country s financial rescue  Tsipras said in a statement e mailed to Bloomberg News on Saturday    The deliberation with our European partners has just begun   Tsipras said   Despite the fact that there are differences in perspective  I am absolutely confident that we will soon manage to reach a mutually beneficial agreement  both for Greece and for Europe as a whole  
Yes  WTF would be an apt description of the negotiations  In the meantime  Greek stocks continue to tank relative to eurozone equities  While the Athens market is oversold on a relative basis  it s still very early in the negotiation process and anything can happen  No doubt there will be much more drama and tantrums in the days and weeks to come  The bottom may not be in yet   and any more posturing by either side is likely to spook the markets 

Stay tuned for more drama and volatility as the markets react to the latest headlines  The stakes are high  not just in Greece  but because of the heightened risk of political contagion as the Guardian reported that  
China the one bright spot
Ironically  the one bright spot that could contribute positively to the global growth outlook is China  Despite the headlines about slowing Chinese growth  analysis of the Shanghai market and the stock market of China s major Asian trading partners  Hong Kong  Taiwan  South Korea and Australia  indicates that they are either in uptrends or in the process of turning up  Such a development must be regarded as a positive development for the bulls and investors may want to look at exposure to  Greater China  for the equity component of their portfolios 

While the Chinese economic trajectory is weakening as the latest official PMI figures   the market is in a  bad news is good news  phase as the perception is that weakness is setting the stage for more easing 

A correction  or more choppiness 
The combination of these factors indicate that the path of least resistance for US equity prices is down   wrote last week that he is seeing ominous signs from his technical indicators and believes that we are already in a bear market 
Here are four observations about this market  1  Institutions are not buying  Without big institutional support  this market is in trouble   Using the CCT  a proprietary breadth indicator   I can see that on the days the market goes up  institutions aren t participating  This is reflected in the low volume numbers  Lack of institutional buying is bearish  2  There were more minus 1 000 NYSE ticks than plus 1 000 ticks  This demonstrates that the rallies are hollow and short lived  3  The stock market is now at lower prices than just before the European QE was announced  Positive news has no lasting effect on rallying the market  4  The volume  the lower highs  and now the lower price highs are all indications of a price pattern deterioration 
In addition   at Thomson Reuters is seeing signs of declining risk appetite from the credit markets 

On the other hand  the stock market has been volatile and range bound for the last few weeks and we have to allow for the possibility that  instead of declining right away  it rallies and resumes the choppy pattern  The chart below shows that the SPX has seen its recent declines arrested at the 150 day moving average and the index closed just slightly below that level on Friday  In addition  the 5 day RSI  which is a useful short term swing trading indicator  is showing a slight positive divergence so the rally scenario remains a possibility 
In response to these changes in market conditions  my inner investor is looking to lighten up his equity positions on strength  A correction is brewing and he wants to be prepared 
My inner trader  and took a minor NDX  after the FOMC statement  but before the sell off cascade that occurred in the last hour of trading  He is leaning bearish  but he has been burned too many times in the past few weeks by the market choppiness  see All washed up    He is therefore keeping his short exposure lower than normal for risk control reasons Disclosure  Long SQQQ

Consumer ETF impact
 Thanks to a downbeat earnings release  shares of PG hurtled down about 4 4   as of January 29  2015  since it reported Q2 earnings  The pain also carried over into the ETF world  with consumer staples ETFs being the hardest hit  Many of the key funds in this segment have a double digit allocation to the consumer product giant  suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on P G s performance  And  since many smaller companies in the sector were also impacted by PG s weakness  they too had a tough time  leading to sluggish trading overall for the segment  In particular though  poor trading was seen in the following three ETFs  as these have the biggest allocation to Procter   Gamble  read

96055,317570,PG,Say Goodbye To The  Strong Dollar Policy ,opinion,"It is absurd to believe that the inhabitants of the Eccles building in D C  promote a strong dollar policy  Printing  3 8 trillion dollars and keeping interest rates at zero percent for going on the seventh year can hardly be confused with a hard currency regime  Merely pretending to cheer the dollar higher appears to be the Fed s method of operation 
But since World War II every administration likes to pledge their support for a  strong dollar policy   However  the truth is this policy has only truly been practiced in the United States on very rare occasions  The courageous Fed Head  Paul Volcker  raised interest rates to the dizzying level of 20  in order to squeeze inflation out of the economy in the early 1980 s  During his tenure the intrinsic value of the dollar increased and the economy thrived  This is because  contrary to what the Keynesians who currently run our economy believe  a strong dollar is great for America  while a weaker dollar is most efficient at destroying the purchasing power of savers 
A weak currency doesn t boost GDP or balance a trade deficit a philosophy that governments and central banks now embrace with alacrity  Take Japan  which still has a 660 billion yen trade deficit two years after Shinzo Abe unleashed his all out assault on the yen  which is down a staggering 40  against the dollar since January 2013  This  after a 50 year average trade surplus of 382 billion yen prior to his reign  And  in its 25th month of massive currency depreciation  Japan still finds itself in an official recession 
However  despite these facts Keynesian logic favors a currency debasement derby to the bottom  This is because they maintain that a weak currency stimulates exports  boosts manufacturing and leads to lower rates of unemployment  So with the dollar rising over 15  against the Euro and the Yen since July of 2014  it is no wonder we see a renewed fear of the stronger dollar  as it plays into their number one fear of deflation  We got the first hint of this from the U S  treasury sec   as he explained that the current dollar strength is more the result of yen and euro manipulations  and less about the intrinsic dollar strength  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said this in Davos Switzerland last week 
 The strong dollar  as all my predecessors have joined me in saying  is a good thing  It s good for America  If it s the result of a strong economy  it s good for the U S   it s good for the world  If there are policies that are unfair  if there are interventions that are designed to gain an unfair advantage  that s a different story  
We see multi national companies playing right into this theme  These companies are now using the strong dollar to replace last year s harsh winter as their excuse for not making the numbers  The plethora of companies that missed earnings this season are all blaming it on currency translation  leading to the new buzz phrase of 2015 Constant Currency  Constant Currency is when last year s earnings are re translated to this year s rates to strip out the effects of currency dynamics 
First  we have the construction and mining equipment giant Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   who reported a lower profit that came in well below expectations  This was due primarily to the recent drop in the price of oil and lower prices for copper  coal and iron ore  But of course they had to mention  The strong dollar didn t help either it seems like when it rains it pours  and this is one of those days   Then  of course  the Caterpillar CEO urged the Fed to hold off on any rate hikes this year 
Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG CFO Jon Moeller told CNBC that the strong dollar was the major factor in the company s disappointing earnings report last quarter  And we heard similar stories from 3M  NYSE MMM   Pfizer  NYSE PFE   United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   just to name a few 
This appears to be a legitimate excuse  until you ask yourself  is the problem that the strong dollar is hurting their earnings  or is it that they no longer have a weakening dollar making it easier to beat the estimates  After all  I didn t hear these same companies offer this excuse when the weakening dollar was helping their profitability  Currency translations work both ways 
The truth is politicians and multinationals alike enjoy a weakening dollar because they don t have to work as hard  A weak dollar allows politicians to do what they do best  spend money without having to raise taxes  And a weak currency allows multinationals to appear more profitable  as they enjoy gains when stronger currencies are translated back to a weakening dollar  After all  how many times did we hear the term  Constant Currency  during the 2002 2008 time frame  for example  when the dollar was plummeting in value 
Keynesians cling to the belief that a weak currency is the corner stone for building a healthy economy  But I believe this fatuous notion is a ruse that stems from the necessity to find a justifiable excuse to give central banks carte blanche to monetize debt  For without an activist central bank aggressively printing money to purchase sovereign debt  interest expenses would soon spiral out of control a falling currency is just an ancillary side effect of supplanting the free market for government issued debt 
Therefore  it is my prediction that Yellen will not be able to raise rates and will soon have to adopt a very bearish stance towards the dollar  After all  a hawkish interest rate policy is untenable for a Fed that is now paralyzed with the fear of deflation  especially while the rest of the world is frantically printing money  Our central bank will not have the courage to allow the dollar s rise to continue  And  it is inevitable that Yellen and her comrades at the Fed will soon follow the lead of our Treasury Secretary in talking the dollar down  That may be music to the ears of multi national corporations and our government  but will be the death knell for the middle class

96056,317571,PG,Consumer Staples  Will The Recovery Continue ,opinion,"Will the Recovery Continue in the Consumer Staples Space 
The consumer staple sector had a tough ride in 2014  While the year began with a prolonged and severe winter  increasing food costs  a weak consumer spending environment and currency headwinds continued to add to the industry s woes through the year  The decline in consumer spending power was due to concerns over higher gas prices  delayed income tax refunds and higher payroll taxes  However  things began to improve in the second half of the year on the back of a moderate economic recovery  better job prospects  improved business and renewed optimism as a result of the housing recovery  Rising wages and cheaper fuel were the other positives  With oil and natural gas prices subsiding  consumers are left with more disposable income  Commodity costs have in many cases stabilized  with some at five year lows  Consumers are also expecting lower inflation primarily due to lower gas prices  Not surprisingly  consumer staple stocks are now performing well compared with the S P 500 as a whole  Overall U S  retail sales including all sectors showed a positive trend from October  In fact  the rebound can be seen in the last reported quarter results of most of the stocks in the consumer staples sector  Industry players like Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   Sysco  NYSE SYY    United Natural Foods   NASDAQ UNFI  and Supervalu  NYSE SVU  have delivered improved performances on the back of a recovering economic scenario  However  there are some companies like The Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG    Mondelez International  NASDAQ MDLZ   and Kellogg  NYSE K   which are still grappling with challenging operating environment  These companies have been posting sluggish results due to lackluster top line growth and lower unit volumes  The recent weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U S  dollar has also pulled back revenues significantly for these giants as they generate a significant portion of their businesses from international markets  Hopefully  the year 2015 will prove to be better for these companies with a strong rebound in earnings 
Zacks Industry Rank
 Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative   The consumer staples sector is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  260 industry groups   Agricultural Operations  Beverages   Alcohol  Beverages   Soft  Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples  Cosmetics   Toiletries  Food   Miscellaneous Diversified  Publishing   Newspapers  Soaps   Cleaning Preparations  Textile   Apparel and Tobacco  While none of the sub sectors are placed in the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  a number of them fall in the middle portion of that group  with Agricultural Operations industry holding a Zacks Industry Rank  95  It is followed by Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples and Textile   Apparel sharing a common Zacks Industry Rank  120  Other sub sectors such as Food   Miscellaneous Diversified  Beverages   Alcohol and Publishing   Newspapers are also featured in the middle 1 3rd portion with Zacks Industry Rank  166   167 and  173  respectively  The remaining sub sectors  Beverages   Soft  Cosmetics   Toiletries  Soaps   Cleaning Preparations and Tobacco are featured in the bottom one third with a respective Zacks Industry Rank of  177   185   189  and  191  Looking at the exact position of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space is neutral  Results of most of the companies have improved towards the end of 2014 owing to a gradual recovery in the economic environment  However  there are a few that are struggling and will take time to recover 
Earnings Trends
 The fourth quarter earnings turned out to be a mixed bag for consumer staples stocks  While on the one hand it was characterized by a gradual economic recovery and lower fuel prices which helped the companies recover from the sluggishness  on the other hand  the companies faced significant foreign currency headwinds  Of the 44 1  companies in the consumer staples sector that have already reported fourth quarter  the earnings  beat ratio  was 66 7  while the revenue  beat ratio  was only 33 3   On a year over year basis  total earnings for this sector are expected to decline 2 1  in the fourth quarter compared with 4 2  growth registered in the third quarter of 2014  Total revenue is expected to decline 9 5  in the fourth quarter against a decline of 0 4  in the previous quarter  Annual earnings are expected to increase marginally by 0 3   while revenues are expected to decline 7 5   The sector is expected to contribute 6 6  of the total S P 500 income for 2014  less than its 7 5  market cap weight in the index at present  This signals that companies would take time to overcome the difficult consumer spending environment ",2015-02-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consumer-staples-stock-outlook---feb.-2015-241523,241523

Shares of the company  which also reported a 92 percent drop in third quarter profit  fell 13 percent after the bell on Monday 
The weak forecast underscores faltering sales at the company  which has been strenuously denying claims by activist investor Bill Ackman that it is a pyramid scheme 
Ackman  who has taken a  1 billion short position against Herbalife  has said the company makes most of its money by recruiting new distributors rather than selling products to customers 
The same allegations were brought by a former distributor in a class action lawsuit  which the company settled last week for  15 million after a costly 18 month legal battle

 I have always been impressed by Duracell  as a consumer and as a long term investor in P G and Gillette   Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said in a press release 
Procter   Gamble  which is one of Berkshire Hathaway s biggest stock holdings  will receive shares of P G s common stock currently held by Berkshire  which has a value of nearly  4 7 billion  P G said it would contribute nearly  1 7 billion in cash to recapitalize Duracell before the transaction 

Procter   Gamble first announced it would pursue a spinoff of the Duracell battery brand into a stand alone company during its quarterly earnings announcement in October  the first step in a plan to shed up to 100 of the company s nearly 200 brands  
 Duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products  and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway   Buffett said

At the close of U S  trading  the Dow 30 rise 0 23   the S P 500 index rise 0 05   while the NASDAQ Composite index rose 0 11  
The S P 500 VIX index  which measures the outlook for market volatility  was up 5 91  at 13 79 
Wal Mart reported earnings per share of  1 15  or  3 71 billion  and revenue at  119 billion  both figures topping analyst expectations of around  118 4 billion and  1 12  respectively  which drew applause on Wall Street 
The earnings  which fueled hopes for more sustained U S  recovery  offset slumping energy stocks  the product of falling oil prices 
Crude oil took a hit after the National Bureau of Statistics of China reported that industrial production fell to a 7 7  growth in October from 8 0  in the preceding month 
Analysts had expected growth to remain unchanged at 8 0  in the Asian giant  and the disappointing figure exacerbated growing concerns that supply far outstrips demand 
Elsewhere  expectations that OPEC countries will not cut output to relieve a global supply glut pressured prices lower as well 
Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have resisted calls to lower production  while Libya  Venezuela and Ecuador have asked for action to prevent further price declines 
The 12 member oil cartel is scheduled to meet in Vienna on Nov  27 to discuss whether to adjust their production target for 2015 
Those expressing a willingness to let prices slide are doing so on the presumed expectations that U S  shale producers will halt operations as a result  as such production costs more than traditional drilling 
Once U S  shale producers table their operations for profitability reason  prices would presumably rise as the global economy absorbs excess supply

96089,317604,PG,Prepping An Entry Into P G Stock,opinion,"So we start the first full week of trading with a big down day  closing gaps and testing trend lines  If you are one that believes the end of the trend is here then you are probably pretty happy today  But if you like to get confirmation of a trend change  or believe the longer trend remains higher then there may be some opportunities developing 
I fall into the latter camp  looking at this pullback as a possible opportunity  And one name that I am looking at is Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   I closed out my position last week in the name after holding it from the run up from the base at 84  But with a strong uptrend and a good dividend it looks really good on this quick  4 pullback 
There are two ways that I look at stocks like this  One is to buy them and immediately protect them with a collar  The second is to get paid a credit to put on a trade with a possible entry at a lower level 

For P G the chart above shows it testing rising trend support and the momentum indicators mixed  The MACD continues to point lower  while the RSI is in the bullish range and is starting to level  There is also very large open interest in the options contracts for January Expiry at the 90 strike  This could keep it close to 90 for the next two weeks or draw it back at Expiry 
Using the first trade structure  you could look to buy the stock here around 90  and add a January 90 87 5 Put Spread as protection  The put spread  buying the 90 Strike and selling the 87 5 Strike  costs about 70 cents  By also selling a March 95 Strike Covered Call for about 60 cents  you have a collar that protects the downside for 2 weeks while allowing upside to 95  for the cost of 10 cents 
Using the second structure  you might choose a January 23 Expiry 90 89 88 1 2 split Strike Put Spread  Say What     All the fancy jargon means is that you buy a 90 Strike Put and sell both a 89 and 88 Strike Put  The combination costs nothing but uses margin  or can be done in an IRA if you have cash to cover the short 88 Strike Put  This gives a  1 payout if the stock closes at 89 or lower on January 23rd  And if it closes below 88 you will be put the stock  you will own it  with a basis of  87

96092,317607,PG,Market Scenarios  Winners And Losers ,opinion,"Durables Miss In Big Way
The slow growth low inflation story gained additional traction Tuesday when durable goods orders came in well below expectations  From The Wall Street Journal 

U S  businesses broadly cut capital spending in the final months of 2014  raising red flags about the economy s ability to sustain momentum amid troubles around the globe  Orders for durable goods products like cars and kitchen appliances designed to last at least three years fell 3 4  in December from a month earlier  the Commerce Department said Tuesday  Orders have fallen four of the past five months 

Bonds Win In Two Of Three Scenarios
From an investment perspective  there are three major scenarios likely facing investors  Scenario one is an ongoing period of slow growth and low inflation  which can be favorable for both stocks and bonds  Scenario two  slower growth  has gained some momentum with the recent trends in earnings and economic data  Scenario three involves a stronger economy and a shift toward higher inflation  You can see a larger and economically broader version of the flow diagram below via this  

The least likely outcome in the short run appears to be scenario three  stronger economy   Given the stock market has not broken down in a meaningful way yet  it seems reasonable to assign the highest probability to scenario one  which is more of the same  slow growth and low inflation   The broader market s failure to make a new high over the last seven months tells us scenario two  slower growth recession  is creeping higher on the probability ladder  The video below puts some additional fundamental and historical context around the three scenarios

96093,317608,PG,Why The Damage To The Economy Caused By The Oil Crash Is Going To Get Pr,opinion,"We are really starting to see the price of oil weigh very heavily on the economy and on the stock market  On Tuesday  the Dow was down 291 points  and the primary reason for the decline was disappointing corporate sales numbers  For example  heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT  is blaming the  dramatic decline in the price of oil  for much lower than anticipated sales during the fourth quarter of 2014  Even though Caterpillar is not an  energy company   the price of oil is critical to their success  And the same could be said about thousands of other companies  That is why I have repeatedly stated that anyone who believes that collapsing oil prices are good for the U S  economy is crazy  The key to how much damage this oil collapse is going to do to our economy is not how low prices ultimately go  Rather  the key is how long they stay at these low levels  If the price of oil went back to  80 a barrel next week  the damage would be fairly minimal  But if the price of oil stays at this current level for the remainder of 2015  the damage will be absolutely catastrophic  Just think of the price of oil like a hot iron  If you touch it for just a fraction of a second  it won t do too much damage  But if you press it against your skin for an hour  you will be severely damaged for the rest of your life at the very least 
So the damage that we are witnessing right now is just the very beginning unless the price of oil goes back up substantially 
When the price of oil first started crashing  most analysts focused on the impact that it would have on energy companies  And without a doubt  quite a few of them are likely to be wiped out if things don t change soon 
But of even greater importance is the ripple effects that the price of oil will have throughout our entire economy  The oil price crash is not that many months old at this point  and yet big companies are already blaming it for causing significant problems  The following is how Caterpillar explained their disappointing sales numbers  

 The recent dramatic decline in the price of oil is the most significant reason for the year over year decline in our sales and revenues outlook  Current oil prices are a significant headwind for Energy   Transportation and negative for our construction business in the oil producing regions of the world  In addition  with lower prices for copper  coal and iron ore  we ve reduced our expectations for sales of mining equipment  We ve also lowered our expectations for construction equipment sales in China  While our market position in China has improved  2015 expectations for the construction industry in China are lower 

We also learned on Tuesday that orders for durable goods were extremely disappointing  Many analysts believe that this is another area where the oil price crash  

Orders for business equipment unexpectedly fell in December for a fourth month  signaling a global growth slowdown is weighing on American companies  Bookings for non military capital goods excluding aircraft dropped 0 6 percent for a second month  data from the Commerce Department showed  Demand for all durable goods   items meant to last at least three years   declined 3 4 percent  the worst performance since August 

Let s keep an eye on the durable goods numbers in coming months  Usually  when the economy is heading into a recession durable goods numbers start declining 
Meanwhile  a bunch of other big companies reported disappointing sales numbers on Tuesday as well  The following summary comes from  

Microsoft lost 9 9 percent as software license sales to businesses were below forecasts  Caterpillar plunged 7 3 percent after forecasting 2015 results that trailed estimates as plunging oil prices signal lower demand from energy companies  DuPont Co  dropped 2 8 percent as a stronger dollar cuts into the chemical maker s profit  Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  and United Technologies Corp  declined at least 2 percent after saying the surging greenback will lower full year earnings 

What the economy could really use right now is a huge rebound in the price of oil 
Unfortunately  as I wrote about the other day  that is not likely to happen any time soon 
In fact  a top executive for Goldman Sachs recently  that he believes that the price of oil could ultimately go as low as 30 dollars a barrel 
And hedge fund managers are backing up their belief that oil is heading even lower  

Hedge funds boosted bearish wagers on oil to a four year high as US supplies grew the most since 2001 
Money managers increased short positions in West Texas Intermediate crude to the highest level since September 2010 in the week ended January 20  US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show  Net long positions slipped for the first time in three weeks 
US crude supplies rose by 10 1 million barrels to 397 9 million in the week ended January 16 and the country will pump the most oil since 1972 this year  the Energy Information Administration says  Saudi Arabia s King Salman  the new ruler of the world s biggest oil exporter  said he will maintain the production policy of his predecessor despite a 58 percent drop in prices since June 

Sadly  the truth is that anyone that thought that the stock market would go up forever and that the U S  economy would be able to avoid a major downturn indefinitely was just being delusional 
Our economy goes through cycles  and every financial bubble eventually bursts 
For example  did you know that the S P 500 has never had seven up years in a row  The following comes from a  that was posted on Tuesday 

Doubleline Capital founder Jeff Gundlach  more known for his bond prowess than as an equity market expert  pointed out that the S P 500 has never had seven consecutive up years 
Of course  records are made to be broken  and each year is supposed to stand on its own 
But in a market that faces an uncertain future regarding monetary policy  the specter of a global economic slowdown  and an oil price plunge that is dampening capital investment  Gundlach s little factoid sparked a lot of chatter at ETF com s InsideETFs conference in Hollywood  Florida 

Hmm   that reminds me of the seven year cycles that I discussed  
If the price of oil stays this low for the rest of 2015  there is no way that we are going to avoid a recession 
If the price of oil stays this low for the rest of 2015  there is no way that we are going to avoid a stock market crash 
So let s hope that the price of oil starts going back up 
If it doesn t  the damage that is inflicted on our economy is going to get progressively worse ",2015-01-28,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-damage-to-the-economy-caused-by-the-oil-crash-is-going-to-get-pr-239941,239941

The debut gave Alibaba an initial market cap of  228 billion  shares initially surged as high as  99 70 before falling back to the IPO price in the first hour of trading  The debut came after Alibaba s IPO  which raised  21 8 billion  a number which could rise to  25 billion if underwriters exercise their option to increase their allotment by 15 percent 
If that happens  the deal will exceed the  22 billion raised by the IPO of the Agricultural Bank Of China  HK 1288  in 2010  which holds the global record  according to the Wall Street Journal

96114,317629,PG,Exclusive  P G  Hasbro in crosshairs of Mexico s taxman   sources,news,"By Alexandra Alper  MEXICO CITY  Reuters    The world s largest household product maker Procter   Gamble and No  2 toymaker Hasbro are at the heart of a Mexican probe into tax avoidance that could cost the firms hundreds of millions of dollars in back taxes between them  sources told Reuters    In January  Mexico said it had launched a probe of 270 companies for allegedly exploiting tax loopholes that have leaked income out of Mexico for years    At first  seven multinationals were the focus of the government s  informal audit   led by Oscar Molina  who audits big companies at Mexico s tax collection agency SAT   But Molina says he is in advanced discussions with two companies to pay more income tax for prior years    He didn t name them but said one of the two has been involved in litigation since 2005 over the extent of its taxable presence in Mexico  The other  he said  has been less aggressive and had made gradual changes to its tax scheme    Five sources have told Reuters the firms are Hasbro and P G   In its 2014 second quarter report released in July  Hasbro said it is defending itself against outstanding tax assessments by Mexican authorities totaling about  250 million for the 2000 to 2007 period related to how it accounts for cross border transactions  known as transfer pricing issues    The company is party to discussions with the Mexican tax authorities to determine if the two parties can reach an agreed settlement of these issues   Hasbro said in the filing    It said it has made a settlement offer to authorities without specifying the amount   SAT says the probe  which still includes a handful of firms  involves examining corporate structures that ensure profits based on Mexican manufacturing activities or sales to Mexican customers are reported in offshore units  beyond the reach of the Mexican tax authority    Molina is arguing that these offshore units which derive profits from economic activity in Mexico  had a de facto taxable residence or permanent establishment in Mexico and so  he can tax their Mexico related profit   Tax authorities in Spain  France and Norway have previously gone to court to argue a multinational using such profit shifting structures  had a deemed permanent establishment in their countries    However  those efforts largely failed  which is partly why countries are now pressing for changes in international tax rules which would bring profits shifted offshore by convoluted arrangements back within reach of tax authorities   Mexico levies 30 percent income tax on firms  above OECD countries  average of 25 percent     We are working under the understanding that there is permanent establishment   Molina said in a June interview about the probe   They send away part of the income  And we say  No  no  no  Your income is bigger than that  And it is because of your permanent establishment    P G and Hasbro declined to comment on whether they are being probed  Neither company revealed their tax obligations in Mexico   Hasbro spokeswoman Julie Duffy said that the global toymaker is often involved in tax audits around the world   P G spokeswoman Jennifer Corso said in an email that the company pays all taxes owed in more than 150 tax jurisdictions and does not pursue aggressive tax planning        Ohio based P G  the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent  employs about 7 000 people at eight plants  two distribution centers and an office in Mexico  the company said   RULES REVIEW  An undated confidential document that a source said P G submitted to the Mexican government last year described the company s operations in Mexico  It was reviewed by Reuters and shows about  1 billion in revenue and some  3 billion in exports from P G Mexico in 2012    Neither Hasbro nor P G have said how much income tax they pay annually in Mexico  SAT would not say how much it believed the two companies it is in advanced talks with should pay    Hasbro  known for its My Little Pony toys and Transformers action figures  generates nearly  200 million in Mexican sales annually  according to a confidential document  also undated and about its operations in Mexico  that the source said the firm presented to the government in 2013   The toymaker has offices in Mexico City  a distribution center and sales personnel in five cities  the document said  The Rhode Island based firm  which trails only Mattel in the world toy market according to Euromonitor  says it has 245 employees in Mexico    Mexico s actions reflect growing frustration among some large developing countries  including China and India  with legal loopholes in international tax rules that companies can exploit to shift profits to tax havens  Mexico s SAT argues that by doing so  some companies are avoiding their tax dues    In 2012  the group of 20 leading economies stepped up efforts to crack down on corporate tax dodging  after reports of firms like Apple and Google using complex structures to slash their tax bills sparked outrage    The G20 asked the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development  OECD  to review the rules on how multinationals are taxed  emboldening Mexico to pursue its own tax avoidance probe    Mexico  a haven for auto manufacturers and light assembly plants  has the lowest tax take in the OECD  crimping its ability to spend on programs vital to boosting economic growth and living standards    The main factor in determining whether a company has a taxable presence or a  permanent establishment  in a country is the extent of its sales operations there       But loopholes allow companies to avoid hefty levies in high tax countries where they generate big sales revenue  for example  by signing sales contracts abroad   
Molina said he could complete formal audits of the firms he is in advanced talks with quickly and go to court if they don t reach a deal      Additional reporting by Tom Bergin in London and by Ana Isabel Martinez and Carlos Gonzalez in Mexico City  Editing by Simon Gardner and Kieran Murray ",2014-09-25,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-p-amp;g,-hasbro-in-crosshairs-of-mexico's-taxman---sources-310788",310788

96129,317644,PG,Dollar Strength   What s The End Game  ,opinion,"I do wish there was a better way to track or trade the US dollar  but for the last few years  I ve watched the PowerShares Dollar Bull ETF  NYSE UUP   which consists of a Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Futures Index 
The weighting of the basket is critical  According tofound on the Invesco website  date unknown   UUP consists of contracts or weights on the following currencies in the following percentages 
Euro   57 60 
Yen   13 60 
British Pound   11 90 
Canadian Dollar   9 10 
The weights fall sharply from that point 
Yesterday s big news was on the British pound  which fell sharply after a pre vote survey revealed that Scotland might vote themselves out of the UK  I don t know if you call it secession or abdication  but Scotland seemingly wants independence from England and the British Empire 
All three of the top weighted currencies have suffered weakness over the last few years  first starting with the yen and Shinzo Abe s election  which has weakened the yen from near 80 to today s 104 level  to the euro s weakness of late  the euro traded as high as 137 50   138 in mid March to early May  14   and then today s action in the pound 
After having waited for years for the dollar to rally   and it seems like it has been weak since early in the Bush Administration  we could be in the early stages of a long term dollar strengthening  particularly as the U S  10 Year Treasury yield  which closed at 2 46  yesterday  has a higher yield than many 10 year sovereign credits 
Note on the above chart how UUP is trading above its 200 day weekly average for the first time since early 2013  but the ETF is also approaching the downtrend line off the 2009 and 2010 highs  UUP volume was heavier yesterday  with yesterday s trading volume at 1 14 ml shares traded versus the longer term average of 868 million 
Discussions about the dollar  inflation and the Fed can often make the writer look very smart  but just as often lead nowhere in terms of investment usefulness 
Watch the UUP and how it trades around the downward sloping trend line  If you see a higher volume move above the trend line  readers can use the UUP to hedge some of their Consumer Staples Discretionary and Industrial longs  Where dollar movements tend to have the biggest impact on financial results is with companies that are mid single digit secular growers  like a Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  or Altria  NYSE MO  or the soup or cereal companies 
Remember too  that currency impact is at first translational  but it takes a long time to be  economic   Think back to the mid 1980s and President Reagan s strong dollar policies  The strong dollar caused a tremendous amount of capital to flow into America  but after a year or two the dollar strength began to create the Rust Belt  and decimated large US exporters  like the steel companies  and the Midwest manufacturing belt 
Don t overestimate the dollar s importance  but don t underestimate it either 
A strong move above that trend line for the UUP and I do think we have entered a new phase for the US dollar  particularly if interest rates start to rise  Remember  as mentioned above  the 10 year Treasury  despite the relatively weak equity market  closed above the 2 45  level  again yesterday afternoon

96130,317645,PG,Choose Income Stocks For True Long Term Value,opinion,"Today s market can be absolute hell for an income investor 
Interest rates are nonexistent  Short term bonds don t yield a damn  Long term bonds have a big price risk if rates rise  And junk bonds have an even bigger risk in an economic downturn 
Luckily  there s a select group of companies that continue to make solid income investments in this zero interest world 
I call them  Heirloom Stocks  
Based on my calculations  only 80 of these stocks exist in the market today  Better yet  some of them are seriously undervalued right now  And one in particular could deliver double digit gains 
A History of Excellence
One of the basic tenets of an Heirloom Stock is that the company has a track record of increasing its dividend for 30 years or more   and has plans to continue increasing it for years to come 
You see  the practice of annual dividend increases started in the mid 1950s  when profitability had recovered from the ups and downs of the post war period 
Companies like the old AT T  NYSE T  telephone monopoly had become favorites of retail investors because of their steady  9 per share dividends  maintained through the Great Depression  But by the mid  50s  shareholders noticed that a flat dividend was losing its value to post war inflation 
Thus  some companies began giving annual dividend increases to shareholders  One of the best known dividend growers  Procter and Gamble  NYSE PG   began increasing dividends in 1954 and  at 60 years and counting  now has the longest track record of dividend increases 
Of course  many of these dividend growers fell by the wayside in the takeover boom of the late 1960s and the recession of the 1970s  But by the 1980s  it was clear that companies able to increase their dividends annually  even in recessions  were truly superior investments 
As I mentioned  there are now only about 80 U S  companies with a track record of increasing dividends for 30 years or more  And these companies form excellent permanent investments 
Here s why 
Running on Electric Power
First  their ability to increase dividends every year for several decades indicates that their business is long term oriented and stable  with the ability to survive recessions without crises  In addition  if the dividend increases are substantial  the yields eventually become juicy   for example  there are several companies paying 10 times their 1994 dividends 
Second  since we can be confident that these companies will continue increasing their dividends  we no longer need to worry about their stock price  except as a chance to buy more   At some point  the increased cash flow to investors will inevitably result in a higher stock value 
Finally  the most important reason to trust these companies is because once they have established a long track record of dividend increases  their managements are loath to break it  They will make extra effort to ensure they can continue paying dividends during recessions and will manage the company for long term shareholder value  In particular  they won t goose their stock options by indulging in share buybacks   Which are a rip off of small shareholders and normally result in the company buying high and selling low in a recession  Managers are TERRIBLE judges of when the stock is overpriced  
On top of that  we don t have to pay a premium for these track records  Many of these companies are trading at a discount to the S P 500  which is currently at 20 times earnings  If you need further proof  look at the dividend payout ratio  which tells you a company s ability to survive a setback in earnings 
One especially attractive Heirloom Stock is Emerson Electric  NYSE EMR   an electrical equipment company that s well diversified  with operations all over the globe and more than half of its sales and earnings outside the United States 
Not only has Emerson increased its dividend every year since 1957  it s also had just three CEOs since 1954  That s my kind of management continuity  and the current guy is only 59  so he has a few years left yet 
The stock yields 2 7   with a trailing P E ratio of 23 times  but a forward P E ratio of below 16 times  Third quarter  ended June 30  earnings were triple that of the previous year  Finally  with a quarterly dividend of  0 38 per share  EMR paid out 61  of earnings in the last four quarters  indicating it has room to survive a few bumps in the road 
A yield below 3  may not get you excited  but Emerson s 20 year return since 1994 is in the double digits  Now that s an investment to leave your grandchildren

96131,317646,PG,How To Profit From Hong Kong s Current Unrest ,opinion,"Most investors haven t got a clue about what Hong Kong s riots represent  let alone the investment potential that s being unleashed there  As a result  they re going to miss out on some really terrific profit opportunities  Hong Kong is like an onion  Returned from a century of British rule to Beijing on June 30  1997  there are layers and layers of subtleties  For most westerners  the place is a complete enigma 
For me  though  it s an economic playground  I ve been very fortunate to have spent almost my entire career in global markets including a lot of time on the ground in Asia  so I am intimately familiar with both the culture and the perspective that can t be obtained by watching only Western news feeds 
It s this background that provides the ability to peer through the government and market filters  and find what I believe are solid niches for profit  even in the midst    and dangers    of the turmoil  Indeed  understanding what s driving the unrest is our key   
Beijing s Response Is Muted    For Now
Contrary to what many in Hong Kong s elite circles like to believe  the world does not revolve around them  Beijing is the true power base 
So far  Beijing has demonstrated remarkable and unprecedented restraint in dealing with the protestors  What s happening in Hong Kong wouldn t be tolerated in mainland China for a nanosecond  Beijing will not hesitate to roll in the troops if it believes the Communist Party is threatened  even if it means they have to squash the  Capitalist  party now taking to the streets 
That said  the Central Committee is acutely aware of the stakes   Hong Kongers   in their arrogance  don t understand this  A century of British rule has led many to mistakenly believe that they are economically  politically  and morally superior to the mainland s  bumpkins   It s a serious lapse in judgment that has become a part of the cultural fabric over time 
The irony is that Beijing decided years ago   long before the handover   that Shanghai s financial markets are China s future  So they have largely left Hong Kong alone because it is a useful source of foreign capital and currency  Doing so conveys  face   a uniquely Asian concept incorporating the combination of influence  honor  social standing  and reputation 
But that s changing by the day as Hong Kong s markets become further marginalized and Shanghai s exchanges become increasingly modernized  Saving  face  becomes less important if Hong Kongers are willing to  de face  Beijing by demonstrating in the streets 
You can see that very clearly in the indices of both  which have diverged considerably over the past month as the protests have gathered steam  The Hong Kong based Hang Seng has lost 7 34  while the Shanghai Composite has gained 4 32  over the same time period 
If anything  further rabble rousing in Hong Kong only solidifies Beijing s decisions  Further  the money being lost in Hong Kong s markets is irrelevant to Beijing s way of thinking with each new demonstrator taking to the streets
Remember  we are talking about a divide between the Communist Party and the  Capitalist  party    NOT the democracy the Hong Kongers are protesting and NOT the financial markets that western analysts believe 
To that end  if this really goes to the mat   and I think it will   there are going to be a number of things happening  And that brings me to your money   

Hong Kong s Weakness Will Benefit These U S  Giants
First  these riots are going to resurrect the world s perception of the political risks of doing business in China  That s going to cause many big brand names to rethink their business there no matter how potentially lucrative and essential it is to future growth 
Second  property and casualty companies are going to take the first hit  Simply put  property values drop where there s political instability  Companies like Sino Land Co  Ltd   HK 0083  and New World Development Co  Ltd   HK 0017  are primed for a tumble  And so is some of the world s most expensive real estate 
That  in turn  will affect the financial houses who have long called Hong Kong home  Financial giants like HSBC Holdings Plc  HK 0005  are going to get whacked because of the impact on earnings  so shorting the entire financial sector or specific companies like HSBC could be a really terrific way to capture this  So could buying long date put options that limit your risk while still giving you tremendous upside 
To give you an idea of the magnitude of the potential for profit  consider this  The Hong Kong market is worth some  3 7 trillion  and 56  of the Hang Seng is related to financial shares 
Closer to home  a failure in Hong Kong has the potential to hit pension fund and individual investors holding global ETFs with an emphasis on Hong Kong like the iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF  ARCA EWH   So you ll want to take one basic precaution  If more than 20  of your investment in any given global instrument is tied to Hong Kong  I d rethink that level of exposure  And  if needed  consider rebalancing in order to minimize risk 
Further weakness in Hong Kong is going to make the beleaguered U S  dollar even stronger than it s already become in recent months  That s going to benefit large cap stocks because they re viewed as a hedge against global economic weakness 
The key here is to stick with companies having large brand names that Chinese consumers recognize  like Procter and Gamble  NYSE PG  or Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  
It s also going to benefit U S  Treasuries  where the yield on average is 1  or higher than comparable Asian bonds at the moment 
And  finally  anyone who didn t flee Hong Kong in 1997 or just prior to the handover has to be rethinking that decision at the moment  Another wave of expat capital will hit western Canadian cities like Vancouver and Victoria  already expat Chinese enclaves  driving up real estate values  Apartments and condo investments may become even more appealing as a result ",2014-10-05,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-profit-from-hong-kong's-current-unrest-227958,227958
96132,317647,PG,Consumer Staples Outlook  Will Weakness Persist ,opinion,"The year 2014 started on a weak note for consumer staples companies with concerns over higher gas prices  delayed income tax refunds and higher payroll taxes  Slower recovery in Europe and difficult operating conditions in some Asian countries like China also added to the woes 
Extreme weather conditions affected almost all the consumer staple companies in the first three months of 2014  Though weather conditions improved in the second quarter and the labor market conditions started improving as well  but the overall environment remained unfavorable due to lower consumer demand 
Despite this tough backdrop  the consumer staples sector has done reasonably well this year  beating the SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY  index in the year to date and trailing 52 week periods  The sector s stock market performance in the last 4  12  and 24 weeks is roughly in line with the broader index  This relatively improved stock market performance is likely a reflection of the group s perceived defensive and non cyclical attributes  Lackluster top line growth  lower unit volumes as well as currency headwinds have been a drag on the results of consumer staples companies like The Procter   Gamble Co   NYSE PG   Mondelez International  Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  and Kellogg Co   NYSE K  in the first half of 2014 and have led many of them to provide a weak outlook for 2014  In such a scenario  some of these companies managed to increase their earnings solely with the help of cost controls  inorganic growth and share buybacks  which signals a lack of real growth 
Zacks Industry Rank
Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  
As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  
The consumer staples sector is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  260 industry groups   Beverages   Alcohol  Beverages   Soft  Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples  Cosmetics   Toiletries  Food   Meat Products  Food   Miscellaneous Diversified  Publishing   Newspapers  Soaps   Cleaning Preparations  Textile   Apparel and Tobacco 
The Food   Meat Products industry is the best placed with a Zacks Industry Rank  14  which places it in the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  It is followed by Beverages   Soft and Textile   Apparel  with a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and  43  respectively 
Beverages   Alcohol is the only Industry group in the middle 1 3rd portion sharing a common Zacks Industry Rank  106 
The rest of the sub sectors  Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples  Cosmetics   Toiletries  Food   Miscellaneous Diversified  Publishing   Newspapers  Soaps   Cleaning Preparations and Tobacco are featured in the bottom one third with a respective Zacks Industry Ranks of  181   258   194   210   239 and  200 
Looking at the exact position of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space is negative  as most of the companies suffered from an uncertain macroeconomic environment in the first half of 2014  The companies have provided a soft outlook for 2014  but are hopeful of a recovery through 2015 
Earnings Trends
The consumer staple sector s second quarter earnings weakness is likely to spill over into the third quarter as sluggish top line growth  foreign currency headwinds and slowdown in the developing markets continued to nag 
For the 11 8  companies in the consumer staples sector that have already reported the third quarter  the earnings  beat ratio  was 50 0   while the revenue  beat ratio  was only 25 0   On a year over year basis  total earnings for this sector are expected to decline 0 9  in the third quarter compared with 6 5  growth registered in the second quarter  Total revenue is expected to decline 7 5  in the third quarter against growth of 1 1  in the previous quarter 
The sector so far is expected to contribute 6 7  of the total S P 500 earnings in 2014  less than its 7 5  market cap weight in the index at present  This signals a difficult consumer spending environment for the third quarter overall  However  as per consensus  earnings are projected to grow 5 4  in 2014  while revenues are expected to decline 6 3  in 2014  For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our    report 
Bottom Line
The sector s operating challenges notwithstanding  consumer staples stocks stand to benefit in the current uncertain market environment given their defensive attributes ",2014-10-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consumer-staples-outlook:-will-weakness-persist-228696,228696

96134,317649,PG,Defensive Leadership  A Bull Market Showstopper  ,opinion,"Consumer Discretionary Underperforming
The chart below shows the performance of consumer discretionary stocks relative to consumer staples  For most of 2013  discretionary sectors were leading defensive sectors  ratio was rising in 2013   2014 has been a different story with more conservative stocks  such as Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   taking on a leadership role 

Is This A Major Red Flag For The Bull Market 
While there is no question defensive leadership speaks to a more tentative market  have the bulls ever remained in control under similar circumstances  This week s video provides some historical insight  along with how the Fed may be impacting the SPDR Consumer Discr  Select Sector  ARCA XLY  vs  SPDR   Consumer Staples  ARCA XLP  ratio 


Earnings Provide Some Insight
Dean Foods and Toll Brothers both provided some backing for the bullish case Monday by reporting better than expected profits and sales projections  From Bloomberg 

 The numbers in the third quarter showed a steady economy  we continue to have oil below  80  consumers feeling confident  low interest rates  and that s a combination that works well for stocks   Mark Kepner  an equity trader at Chatham  New Jersey based Themis Trading LLC  said by phone   Central banks have also been quite accommodative in what they ve been saying and it seems to be working  

Investment Implications   The Weight Of The Evidence
If defensive leadership becomes a problem for the current rally  deterioration in the market s tolerance for risk will begin to spill over into other areas  something that we have not seen yet  In fact  the observable evidence continues to show improvement  allowing us to reduce exposure to conservative assets  TLT  while increasing exposure to equities  VOO   With a relatively light economic calendar this week  the market may focus on earnings in the United States and abroad ",2014-11-10,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/defensive-leadership:-a-bull-market-showstopper-232008,232008
96135,317650,PG,A Smorgasbord Of Interesting Tidbits,opinion,"Thanksgiving day is rapidly approaching  and in anticipation of a more festive meal  it seems the sentiment in the investment universe has improved quite a bit over the last month  You see  major stock market indexes are now sitting on on four straight weeks worth of gains  Nearly every sector has participated  absent those locked in the familiar dog pound  namely oil  small caps  and anything resembling coal or Russia  The biggest beneficiaries of the reduction in energy prices are thought to be those centered around discretionary spending  specifically restaurants and retail 


There was plenty of action on the earnings front as Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  reported a nice number on Monday  With unit sales up 16  year over year due to strength in the western portion of the country  many in the housing complex benefited as Wall Street bid up the entire group  In the retail sector  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  reported a better than expected number and then guided down for the rest of the year  Still  the stock made a nice move so shareholders will gladly take it  With Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  at an all time high  Target licking its wounds from their poor execution in Canada  long suffering Sears  NASDAQ SHLD continuing to lag the field in every meaningful way  and Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  poised to grow the top line another 30  during the next few months  notice I did not mention the bottom line   has retail ever been more competitive for the big boys 




Cisco again showed its strength on Wednesday with improvement in data centers  security  the cloud  and software defined networking to offset weakness in hardware and routing  Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  is a massive company and John Chambers chimed in on the net neutrality issue which was addressed by our lovely President earlier in the week  You see  Cisco is the supplier of equipment to the big telecommunications carriers  When AT T s  NYSE T  CEO Randall Stephenson mentioned they have to cut back on building out their fiber to the home platform because they have an uncertain regulatory environment  Mr  Chambers sat up and took notice  Chambers then proceeded to make the simple defense that you cannot expect the carriers to invest capital if they do not see a return  Not rocket science  but economics 101  and politicians routinely forget it to appeal to the masses 



In the oil patch  the sector remains under pressure from hedge funds and other investors in the commodity area who have made leveraged bets which have gone sour  As the week ended  it was reported that Halliburton would try and buy Baker Hughes  its long standing rival in the oil services sector  Time will tell how this plays out  but consolidation across the entire sector cannot be considered unreasonable  especially if oil prices stay low 



I would not expect oil to gain much ground during the rest of the year  The government stated this week it believes gas prices will remain subdued for the next year  Make sure you take that one to the bank as soon as possible as you know how accurate government forecasts are 



In the merger and acquisition space  our friend Mr  Buffett participated in an interesting deal  He bought Duracell batteries from Procter   Gamble  NSE PROC  but swapped his shares in P G for the ownership stake  By using this method  in the process he saved Berkshire shareholders a ton of dough on taxes  You notice the media did not give him any grief about it  eh 




Conversely  our other friend Mr  Malone  took a beating in the press when they found out about Liberty Global s NASDAQ LBTYA  tax inversion last year and Malone s personal shuffling of his trusts  His net savings were over  250 million on the personal side and a cool billion on the corporate side  The media might not like it  but shareholders benefit from the tax efficiency  Can you really blame them for being as creative as possible to find ways to minimize and defer taxes  Especially when you read every week about the way the current U S  government operates  I cannot  and remain a loyal shareholder of both Malone and Buffet  as well as an admirer 




Alibaba reported that singles day in China was a massive success for them  shock of shocks  The massive Chinese payment processor detailed gross merchandise sales of over  9 billion during the day  considerably higher than the 5 billion from last year  Based on this data  the shares of Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd  NYSE BABA  rose the rest of the week  as did those of its biggest shareholder and fan  the Yahoo s  I expect commission checks from all of you who bought Yahoo  Inc  NASDAQ YHOO  when we mentioned it earlier in the fall  didn t think I remembered  did ya   



Last but not least  we got some  sunshine  over the heavy use of political content in the column last week  I would just note investors should remember the effect regulatory events have on industries  and the companies in those industries  You saw it last week with cable stocks falling  telecom carriers rising  and the defense industry continuing to rise  We might dislike politicians  but it would be unwise to not pay attention to them  and more importantly  their actions  no matter how ill advised   Certainly  staying informed can benefit  or hurt  your portfolio  depending on your positioning  Good luck with it as I know it is not easy

96153,317668,PG,P G to sell up to 100 brands to revive sales  cut costs,news,"By Devika Krishna Kumar  Reuters    Procter   Gamble Co  N PG   the world s largest household products maker  said it could sell about half of its brands in the next two years and cut jobs to revive sales growth and save costs  sending its shares up as much as 4 3 percent 
The maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent said it would consider selling about 90 to 100 brands whose sales have been declining for the past three years 
P G said the 70 to 80  core  brands it will focus on accounted for 90 percent of sales and more than 95 percent of profit over the past three years  Twenty three of the brands have sales of between  1 billion and  10 billion 
 Less will be much more   Chief Executive A G  Lafley said 
P G did not name the brands it planned to sell  keep or discontinue  but Lafley told Reuters the company s family  feminine and baby care business would lose fewer brands than its other four businesses 
The business  which houses brands such as Pampers diapers and Always sanitary napkins  is P G s fastest growing and was the company s second biggest revenue contributor in the year ended June 30 
P G s top 80 brands had sales of about  84 1 billion in 2013 while the other roughly 100 brands had sales of just  2 4 billion  according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj 
Dibadj expects the company to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan  Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products among others  P G is unlikely to sell its Gillette  Tide  Pantene  Oral B  Olay and Old Spice brands  he said 
P G said it would have fewer but larger distribution centers in North America and would focus on strengthening its presence in emerging markets  or what Lafley called the company s  engines of growth  
Lafley told Reuters he expects the moves to result in fewer job cuts than the near 10 000 the company cut in 2002 
SLUGGISH SALES
P G s revenue growth has been sluggish  with sales missing Wall Street s estimates in nine of the last 13 quarters 
The company says it has been hurt by  choppy  growth in developed markets  tough competition and a strengthening U S  dollar 
P G has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management  reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five year   10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012 
P G s organic sales  which excludes divestitures and acquisitions  rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter  but currency losses wiped out the gains  Net sales fell 1 percent to  20 16 billion  missing the average analyst estimate 
P G said it expected fiscal 2015 organic sales to rise by a low  to mid single digit percentage and core earnings to rise by a mid single digit 
A 7 percent fall in operating expenses in the quarter helped P G post a core profit of 95 cents per share  beating the average analyst estimate of 91 cents 
 PG s earnings quality is below its potential   BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note 

P G s shares were up 3 5 percent at  80 03 in early afternoon trading on Friday

96154,317669,PG,P G eyes Duracell  Braun in sweeping brand culling  sources,news,"By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim NEW YORK  Reuters    Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  is working with advisors including Goldman Sachs Group  N GS  as the world s largest household products maker reviews up to 100 underperforming brands for potential divestiture  people familiar with the matter said 
While P G has yet to determine which brands it will seek to shed  Duracell batteries and Braun shavers are the two largest assets likely to be divested  the people said  asking not to be named because the matter is not public 
The company  which also makes Gillette razors and Tide detergent  said this month it would consider selling more than half its brands whose sales have been declining for the past three years  a drastic attempt to revive growth and save costs 
These brands up for review are estimated to have roughly  900 million in earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  combined  the people said 
Duracell  the world s No 1 battery business  alone accounts for the majority of the value with estimated EBITDA of around  500 million  according to one person  Braun is the next largest brand likely to be shed  with less than  100 million in EBITDA  that person added 
Several private equity firms have already started exploring potential deals involving various P G brands  according to the people familiar with the matter 
Representatives for P G could not be immediately reached for comment  Goldman Sachs declined to comment 
P G did not name any of the brands it planned to sell but Chief Executive A G  Lafley said the company would narrow its focus to 70 to 80 of its biggest brands  which include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent 
These top brands generate 90 percent of its  83 billion in annual sales and over 95 percent of its profit 
The sweeping move is a major strategy shift for the consumer products giant  whose revenue growth has been sluggish  with sales missing Wall Street s estimates in nine of the last 13 quarters 
It also reflects a wider trend among conglomerates across various industry sectors to streamline their business lines  by shedding non core operations and allocating resources to high growth areas 
Large consumer companies like Nestle SA  VX NESN  and Unilever Plc  AS UNc  have shed underperforming businesses in the last year to focus on their top brands 
Healthcare giants including Merck   Co  N MRK   Abbott Laboratories  N ABT  and GlaxoSmithKline Plc  L GSK  have also moved to shed their declining mature drug businesses in recent months 
P G says it has been hurt by  choppy  growth in developed markets  tough competition and a strengthening U S  dollar  The company has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management  reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five year   10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012

96164,317679,PG,Avoid This Expensive Consumer Staple Company,opinion,"Tide  Gillette  Duracell  Crest  Pantene  Old Spice  Bounty  Pampers  Tampax  Charmin 
These are some of the world s most well known household product brands And they re all produced by Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  
In fact  the company has 25 brands that each generate  1 billion in annual sales 
This blue chip stock has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1932  Its 3 2  dividend yield is comfortably above the S P 500 median of 2 0   And the company is also a Dividend Aristocrat  having raised its dividend for 58 consecutive years 
So  what s not to like about this consumer staple colossus 
Two words  Expensive valuation
The Golden Ratio
I ve talked about the merits of the enterprise value to EBITDA ratio in the past  One way to use this fantastic valuation metric is to compare a company s current multiple with its historical average 

P G currently trades at a 13 5x EV EBITDA multiple 
That s expensive relative to its 10 year average of 12 1x  And in July 2012  P G traded at a 9 5x EV EBITDA   far lower than today s level 
In other words  if you were disinterested in P G in 2012  but are super bullish on the stock now  you might want to adjust your stock picking process 
Remember  we want to buy companies that are trading at cheap valuations and sell those that are trading at rich valuations 
As you can see in the chart  P G reached an EV EBITDA multiple of 13 9x in July 2013  At the time  this was the highest level in six years  Since August 1  2013  the stock has produced a total return  dividends reinvested  of just 1 9  
By comparison  the S P 500 has trounced P G with an 18 9  gain over the same period  Even the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF  ARCA XLP   which counts P G as its largest constituent  has risen a respectable 11 6  
Bottom line  P G is significantly lagging its large cap and industry peers  and based on its total valuation it s not hard to see why 
The Hunt for Blue Chip Dividend Payers
P G is very popular among dividend investors for many of the reasons I mentioned above   along with the fact that the company has raised its dividend by 7  in each of the last three years 
Plus  consumer staples stocks are often coveted for their non cyclical businesses and steady cash flows  And consumer staples stocks tend to be much more defensive in nature than the consumer discretionary sector 
However  it s important for investors to resist getting lulled into a false sense of security by holding 3  yielding large caps  P G and other expensive consumer staples companies won t provide you with the total return performance  or safety during a correction  that you may expect 
By all means  continue to buy P G s popular products that keep us  our loved ones  and our houses clean and smelling fresh  Just avoid the stock

96165,317680,PG,The Dividend Aristocrats  Fall From Grace,opinion,"How much are you willing to pay to get what you want 
This question is especially important right now because there are so many good companies that currently have expensive valuations 
Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  is a perfect example  As I explained earlier this week  the company s total valuation has become stretched  and the stock s recent underperformance is glaring 
But it s not the only Dividend Aristocrat that s lagging 
As the S P 500 continues to reach all time highs  many Dividend Aristocrats aren t even close to breaking out 
Is this an early warning sign that the Aristocrats are set for an ugly fall from grace 
Let s take a look at the valuations of the Dividend Aristocrats  in an attempt to determine what s plaguing this group of prolific dividend growers 
As we know  the SPDR S P Dividend ETF  NYSE SDY   which tracks the S P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index  is one of the most popular dividend ETFs 
The chart below compares the valuations of the constituents of SDY  excluding financials  with the broader market s valuation 

A value of 1 0x means that the median enterprise value to EBITDA multiple of SDY is equal to that of the S P 500 s EV EBITDA multiple  Anything below 1 0x means that the Aristocrats  as a group  are trading at a discount to the market 
The chart shows that in mid 2008  the Dividend Aristocrats were downright cheap on a relative basis  The performance results agree with this observation 
Since June 2008  the SDY has produced a total return  dividends reinvested  of 113   far outpacing the S P 500 s gain of 77  
Buying cheap stocks paid off handsomely 
But in mid 2013  the valuation of the Aristocrats became fairly expensive relative to that of the broader market  Accordingly  since June 2013  SDY has achieved a total return of 19   trailing the S P 500 s gain of 26  
In other words  the EV EBITDA ratio helps to explain the Aristocrats  long term outperformance  as well as their short term underperformance 
Knowing Everything s Price  and Nothing s Value
Again  one of the reasons why EV EBITDA works so well is because few investors look at this valuation metric 
Even when presented with statistical evidence suggesting that EV EBITDA is the best performing valuation metric  most investors will stick with the simple P E ratio 
So while others remain blissfully unaware of valuations  we need to be vigilant  We should be emphatic about dividend growth  but we shouldn t be willing to pay an arm and a leg to have it in our portfolios 
Even stocks with long histories of dividend growth can have prices that make them unattractive  The chart above suggests that now is one of those times for the Dividend Aristocrats 
Intuitively  this makes sense to me  As the Federal Reserve s zero interest rate policy has dragged on  consistent dividend growers have become increasingly popular  More and more people have jumped on the bandwagon  driving up prices and making the Aristocrats more expensive than the broader market 
Armed with this information  your plan of action now depends on what type of investor you are  If you like to follow a simple buy and hold strategy  then SDY will probably be fine for you over the long term 
On the other hand  if you want to outperform and retire early  or sleep more soundly in retirement   then you should only seek out the cheapest Aristocrats 
It s important to be selective  because the Dividend Aristocrats have gotten too rich  That s not a statement you ll likely hear anywhere else

The Markets
Stocks ended slightly higher on Monday  supported by better than expected economic data pertaining to manufacturing and housing in the US  Risk aversion  however  was apparent during the session with Consumer Staples and Utilities topping the leaderboard as investors remain cautious given the evolving situation in Iraq  Oil prices continue to be elevated  providing ongoing strength to the Energy sector  which is now up 12 4  for the year  according to the Energy Sector ETF  XLE   The broad energy sector seasonally peaks around this time of year  trading flat into the start of summer  The Energy sector ETF is currently the most overbought since November of 2010  according to the Relative Strength Index  RSI   With RSI currently sitting at 81 14  only 5 other days in the history of the ETF have shown readings more overbought than Monday s close  Upside momentum may be close to exhaustion  increasing the risk of declines  particularly if the event risk in Iraq fades Seasonal strength for the sector  once again  becomes apparent in the late summer  particularly in the oil exploration and production industry as hurricane season in the US reaches a peak 



With Consumer Staples showing strength relative to the market during Monday s session  investors may be looking towards one of the most well known companies within the sector  Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   The stock enters a period of seasonal strength at this time of year  running through to November  The stock averages a gain of close to 14  over the period  outpacing the S P 500 by over 11   The stock tends to perform well amidst the volatility that is common during the summer season as investors seek equity alternatives to reduce portfolio risk  The stock is currently hovering around oversold levels  bouncing from its 200 day moving average during Monday s session  support at this long term average can be implied  Watch for seasonal strength into the weeks ahead

96199,317714,PG,Consumer Staples ETFs In Focus On Philip Morris Stock Slide,opinion,"Cigarette giant Philip Morris  NYSE PM  is seeing tumbling volumes as anti tobacco campaigns have led to a sizable decline in demand    Pressed by a weak tobacco business  the company has recently reduced its earnings guidance for fiscal year 2014  Following the cut in the outlook  the company s share prices have plunged roughly 5  in a little over the past week 
Philip Morris Lowers Earnings Forecast 
The company has reduced its earnings per share  EPS  forecast for fiscal year 2014 from a range of  5 09 to  5 19 to a new range of  4 87 to  4 97  Weak macroeconomic environment in the European Union  rising illicit trade in Asia  costs related to restructuring and higher excise taxes are some of the factors that have prompted the company to lower its outlook    The company however expects its EPS to grow by 6  to 8  this fiscal year excluding asset impairment and exit cost charges related to the discontinued cigarette production in the Netherlands in 2014 and an unfavorable currency impact    Higher excise taxes on cigarettes and advertising restrictions on cigarette makers have led to a pricing war  Philip Morris is facing stiff competitive pressure from several local brands in key markets such as Japan s Melvis Cut and Philippines brands like Mighty and Marvel    Besides closing its Netherlands plant  the company has recently relocated its six decade old manufacturing plant from Australia to South Korea on account of dwindling volumes    In the face of a softening tobacco business  the company has been planning new investments in order to diversify its product portfolio  Philip Morris plans to roll out its Marlboro Architecture 2 0 and is also undergoing several restructuring programs to facilitate the launch of its  Next Generation Products  NGP   in fiscal 2015    For fiscal 2015  Philip Morris expects adjusted earnings growth in the range of 8 10  
Market Impact    Not only has Philip Morris underperformed its peers in the past week  it has also been a laggard in the year to date frame  The company has posted a negative 2  return this year  as compared to a 10  return by Altria and a roughly 22  gain by Lorillard and Reynolds American each    Weak performance by Philip Morris is expected to put some downward pressure on Consumer Staples ETFs that are heavily invested in the cigarette giant  This is all the more true as the company currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and falls in a poor industry category  This portends downside movement in PM s share price and the following ETFs in the coming weeks             Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLP    PM has 7 9  Allocation   This fund is the most popular product within the Consumer Staples equities space  having an asset base of  6 6 billion  The fund tracks the S P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index and holds a small basket of 42 stocks    The fund has the largest exposure to Procter   Gamble Company  followed by Coca Cola and Philip Morris  The trio has a roughly 30  allocation in the fund    The fund nicely diversifies itself among different industries such as Food   Staples Retailing  Household Products  Beverages  Food Products and Tobacco    The fund is one of the cheapest in the category with 18 basis points as expenses and has returned a modest 5  since the start of the year    XLP currently carries a Zacks ETF Rank  4 or Sell rating   MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF   FSTA     PM has 7 4  Allocation   FSTA tracks the MSCI USA IMI Consumer Staples Index  holding a basket of 104 stocks    Philip Morris occupies the third spot here having 7 4  allocation while Procter   Gamble  Coca Cola and PepsiCo Inc are the top two holdings  Like XLP  this fund too has a nice mix of the Consumer Staples sector    The fund charges 12 basis points as fees and has returned 5 7  this year   Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF  NYSE VDC    PM has 7 2  Allocation   Launched in January 2004  VDC is the second most popular product in the space managing an asset base of  1 9 billion     The fund holds 109 stocks with Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   Coca Cola Enterprises Inc  NYSE CCE  and Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM  being the top three holdings  The ETF is quite concentrated among its top 10 components which together form 60  of total fund assets    The fund currently has a Zack ETF Rank  4   Bottom Line    The three above mentioned ETFs did not perform as badly as the stocks  primarily because they diversify in other industries as well  However  investors should keep in mind that the overall Consumer Staples sector has been a laggard this year    A rough consumer spending environment  foreign exchange headwinds and declining volumes are some of the factors for the weakness within the sector  Moreover  difficult operating conditions in Europe and a slowdown in some Asian countries  like China  also weighed on the sector s outlook  As such  most of the Consumer Staples ETFs currently have a Zacks ETF Rank  4  Investors are thus advised to take a cautious approach or stay away from this space for now ",2014-07-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consumer-staples-etfs-in-focus-on-philip-morris-stock-slide-218432,218432

96217,317732,PG,P G Hopes New Razor Keeps Its Results On The Cutting Edge,news,"By    It s been said that if you build a better mousetrap the world will beat a path to your door  but what about razors and tooth whitener 
We ll find out on Wednesday when Procter   Gamble Co  NYSE PG   the Cincinnati firm behind Pampers diapers and Tide detergent unveil results it hopes will vindicate a strategy narrowing its focus to a slew of new   premium products and trump a nasty winter that had consumers shut in across the nation 
The world s largest consumer products company is expected to grow fiscal 2014 third quarter net income 13 1 percent to  2 96 billion  or  1 per share  for the three month period ended March 31  from 88 cents per share in the year earlier period  according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters 
Revenue is expected to rise 0 4 percent from  20 6 billion in last year s third quarter to  20 68 billion in this fiscal year s third quarter 
P G has a core market in the U S   but nearly two third of sales and slightly more than half of its profits come from outside the U S  according to a December company report 
Sales in developed markets like the U S  and Japan made up 61 percent of total sales in 2013 and have fallen in recent years  while sales in developing markets like China  which together accounted for the remaining 39 percent of sales in 2013  have increased 
Foreign currency markets and weaker than anticipated market growth in P G s Beauty and Grooming segments pulled down profit in the company s fiscal second quarter  October to December 2013 
The expected earnings growth could indicate P G s strategy to boost productivity and sell noncore businesses successfully increased the company s bottom line in recent months   
 Our vision is clear  and we are single minded about our goals   CEO A G  Lafley s told investors and analysts gathered in February for the annual Consumer Analytics Group of New York meeting in Boca Raton  Fla  Lafley estimated that about 10 percent of the company s brand portfolio is non core 
P G generates more than  80 billion in annual sales with top brands including Pampers  Tide  Always  Pantene  Bounty  Dawn  Charmin  Downy  Crest  Oral B  Olay  Duracell and Gillette  P G divides its brands into four business segments  beauty  baby  feminine and family care  fabric and home care  and health and grooming 
This quarter  unusually cold weather in much of the U S  drove up commodity costs by as much as 48 percent for natural gas  according to BMO Markets  while inflation has continued rising in many emerging markets  including Indonesia  India  Turkey  Russia  Brazil and  particularly  Venezuela 
To counter the headwinds from a strong dollar and weak market growth in some segments  P G s focus in the third quarter was on rolling out new products in laundry  including Tide Plus upgrades and Tide Oxi  and new products in oral care  including Crest 3D White Brilliance  3D White Luxe and 3D Whitestrips  The segments fabric and home care  which includes laundry products  and health care and grooming  which includes oral products  have grown sales more than other segments in recent quarters 
Last week  leaked marketing documents revealed P G s plans to introduce a high end razor for men with a swiveling ball hinge that pivots the blade  The ProGlide FlexBall is the first major upgrade from Gillette since 2010  when the five blade Fusion model was updated with new blade technology  The razor will hit the market June 9  in time for Father s Day  and is expected to generate  188 million in sales for the first year  Company spokeswoman Kara Buckley said the company will share more details about the razor at a launch event April 29 in New York 
The recent launches of premium products mark Lafley s return in strategy to squeeze more revenue from the upscale market while risking an exodus of more frugal customers  McDonald had reigned in the company s premium product strategy from 2010 to 2012 after it hurt sales during the recession and its aftermath 

The other part of Lafley s strategy  selling non core businesses  continued in the third quarter  In February  he announced that P G will divest what remains of its global bleach business  including brands in Latin America  Eastern Europe  the Middle East and Africa 
Then  P G announced April 9 that it sold about 80 percent of its noncore pet care business to Mars for  2 9 billion  The pet food brands  including Iams  Eukanuba and Natura  have struggled in recent quarters 
 Strategically  we believe this transaction makes sense for P G  as it helps the company increase its focus on its core brands in more attractive areas such as beauty care  fabric care  health care and grooming   Joseph Altobello  an Oppenheimer analyst  wrote in a research note this month 
Analysts expect P G s businesses Duracell batteries and Braun small appliances are next in line for sale  and that the second half of 2014 will reap the most earnings growth from the product launches ",2014-04-22,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/p-g-hopes-new-razor-keeps-its-results-on-the-cutting-edge-278599,278599

96226,317741,PG,Investing In Emerging Markets  Multi National Companies Ease The Way,opinion,Investing in emerging markets has become de rigeur for equity investors in recent years  If you like stocks  goes the argument  how could you not like stocks in countries where growth is fastest  It s probably fair to say that investing today with the objective of avoiding emerging markets is a more controversial approach than including them No doubt GDP growth and other measures of economic output are favorable in the BRIC  Brazil  Russia  India and China  countries than in the developed world  Frontier markets  for those who find mere Emerging Markets boring  are more loosely defined but include Argentina  Bangladesh and Croatia  Of course not every country gets promoted  The implicit promise is that an Emerging country will eventually emerge into the warm sunshine of the developed world  Sadly for Greece  they were recently relegated from developed and back to emerging by MSCI The faster growth enjoyed by these more dynamic economies doesn t necessarily translate into superior returns for investors  China s growth has moderated in recent quarters  but the central planners are still targeting 7  annual increases in GDP  around three times the sustainable rate in the U S  However  investors in the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund  FXI  have since the end of 2007 endured an annualized return of  6 4  whereas over the same period the S P 500 has returned  4 2   The mechanism that translates increased GDP into investor profits isn t that reliable in China  And why should this be surprising  Public policy objectives regard both real and intellectual property rights as subservient to government policy  Fair treatment of investors is a fairly low priority  John Paulson lost an estimated  500 million in his hedge funds through an investment in Sino Forest  a Chinese lumber company that on closer inspection appeared to be harvesting trees on property it did not own  Running a Ponzi scheme such as this one doesn t draw the same ire of securities regulators that we see in the U S Several years ago on a trip to India I found myself in a conversation with a senior member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India  SEBI   India s securities regulator   Approximately how many insider trading cases are prosecuting annually in India   I enquired of a man closely involved in maintaining the integrity of India s capital markets   Oh none   there is no insider trading in India   was his breezy response Intrepid buyers of securities in countries where substantial segments of the population struggle with basic issues of human survival should leave their pre conceived ideas of fair markets behind That doesn t mean you shouldn t invest in emerging markets   that is  after all  where the growth is  But it s far more sensible to do so through large multi national corporations who are infinitely more able to assess each opportunity  control their risk and wind up with a fair return  P G  PG  is heavily focused on growing its already substantial sales in developing markets  currently  33 34 billion   Mondelez  MDLZ  reports that 40  of its sales are in emerging markets  IBM  IBM  is targeting 30  of its sales in Growth markets by 2015  We are invested in these companies and others like them  because their brands of products and services continue to have globally attractive growth prospects Investors can obtain exposure to the faster growth of the developing world through companies whose brands are sought throughout the world  In addition  they ll be protected by U S  standards of governance and accounting  It turns out that you don t need to go abroad to invest there  Although we don t invest directly in emerging markets  we profit from their growth through the expertise of global companies like these and others that do business there  Why do it any other way ,2013-06-18,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investing-in-emerging-markets:-multi-national-companies-ease-the-way-171749,171749

96228,317743,PG,Sector Rankings For ETFs   Mutual Funds,opinion,At the outset of 3Q2013  only the Consumer Staples sector earns an Attractive rating  My sector ratings are based on the aggregation of my fund ratings for every ETF and mutual fund in each sector  Investors looking for sector funds that hold quality stocks should look no further than the Consumer Staples and Information Technology sectors  Only these sectors house Attractive or better rated funds  Figures 6 and 7 provide details  The primary driver behind an Attractive fund rating is good portfolio management  or good stock picking  with low total annual costs  Note that the Attractive or better Predictive ratings do not always correlate with Attractive or better total annual costs  This fact underscores that  1  low fees can dupe investors and  2  investors should invest only in funds with good stocks and low fees  See Figures 4 through 13 for a detailed breakdown of ratings distributions by sector  Figure 1  Ratings For All Sectors Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  To earn an Attractive or better Predictive Rating  an ETF or mutual fund must have high quality holdings and low costs  Only 10 sector ETFs and mutual funds meet these requirements  which is only 1  of all sector ETFs and mutual funds   Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP  is my top Consumer Staples ETF  It gets my Attractive rating by allocating over 61  of its value to Attractive or better rated stocks   The Procter   Gamble Company  PG  is one of my favorite stocks held by XLP and earns my Attractive rating  GAAP data significantly understates the profitability of PG  In 2012  PG s reported earnings were artificially depressed by over  1 2 billion of non operating expenses hidden in operating items  PG is currently undergoing a restructuring plan that involves significant cutting of personnel and technological upgrades  and this plan has non recurring charges of over  1 billion related to it   Investors just looking at reported earnings would see a compounded annual decline of 7  over the past three years  In reality  PG has actually grown its after tax operating profit  NOPAT  by just over 1  a year during that time  The misleading decline in PG s profits are part of the reason the stock is undervalued  At its current valuation of   78 34 share  PG has a price to economic book value ratio of only 1 1  implying that the company will never grow NOPAT more than 10  from its current level  Not many blue chip stocks trade at such a cheap price   Rydex Series Funds  Real Estate Fund  RYREX  is my worst Financials mutual fund  It gets my Very Dangerous rating by allocating over 76  of its value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  and to make matters worse  charges investors annual costs of over 7    Ventas Inc   VTR  is one of my least favorite stocks held by RYREX  I wrote in a recent Danger Zone article that many REITs are dangerously overvalued  and VTR is a perfect example  People expect the growth in demand for senior housing to provide a massive boost to VTR s profits  but they ignore the fact that more companies are entering the market  pushing down margins  VTR s NOPAT margin has declined from over 70  in 2003 to 14  last year  At those margins  VTR would need to grow revenue by 20  a year for 15 years to justify its valuation of   68 04 share  Such high expectations and declining profit margin earn VTR my Very Dangerous Rating   Figure 2 shows the distribution of our Predictive Ratings for all sector ETFs and mutual funds   Figure 2  Distribution of

96258,317773,PG,20 Most Profitable Dividend Aristocrats ,opinion,Dividend Aristocrats are some of the best dividend growth stocks with a proven dividend hike series of more than 25 years  But if you are a fundamental investor  you also look for a strength business  Margins are a good indicator for a healthy business   The margins are important for investors  They show if a company is getting stronger or even weaker within its business area  A very high margin shows that the company has products with a big customer satisfaction and desire  Clients need those products and they pay a high price because they can t find a better provider  Sometimes margins are very high due to one off effects  Basic material companies benefitted from high raw commodity prices  They are in a one off situation which can also keep up for years   Today I like to look at the Dividend Aristocrats list and show you the most profitable companies  measured by the highest operating margin  The index has

96259,317774,PG,Huge Potential But Tough Entry  Female Sexual Dysfunction Drugs,opinion,Female Sexual Dysfunction  FSD  is often overshadowed by the more prominent erectile dysfunction market  While companies like Pfizer  PFE  recruit the likes of Bob Dole and other prominent celebrities to help push Viagra  the attention on FSD has been lacking to say the least  This obscures an analysis of a National Health and Social Life Survey performed six years before initial FDA approval of Viagra which estimated that 43  of women suffer from symptoms of FSD  This and other studies imply that there is indeed a vast and significant unmet need for FSD treatments that needs to be addressed to improve the wellbeing of millions of women  In addition to this  there is a huge and untapped therapeutic market that offers a multi billion opportunity  mimicking the size and scope of the Viagra Cialis market  for drug developers and their investors   Currently there is a transdermal testosterone product for FSD available that was developed by Watson Pharmaceuticals along with partner Procter   Gamble  PG  which is sold in Europe  although the drug never made it to FDA approval and had its NDA withdrawn in 2004 due to concerns over its safety data  Another big attempt by the US market by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals with the drug that was commonly referred to as  Pink Viagra  fell flat on its face in 2010 after the company failed to convince the FDA of the utility of the product  In more recent history  we saw the failure of the testosterone gel known as  Libigel  hurt shares of BioSante Pharmaceuticals  BPAX  at the end of 2011 after the placebo arm outperformed the Libigel arm in a Phase III study   Despite all of the trouble that companies have had in the past in their attempts at the US FSD market  the unmet need  and monetary potential  remains up for the taking  Investors who are familiar with the space are now looking at other FSD drug developers have a shot at FDA approval   One of the leading candidates in the space is Palatin  PTN   which anticipates the start of a Phase III trial later this year  The Company is testing bremelanotide  a peptide melanocortin receptor agonist  in patients with FSD  Bremalanotide works via activation of melanocortin receptors in the central nervous system  and is intended for on demand use approximately an hour prior to anticipated sexual activity  In the first quarter of 2013  Palatin released top line data for their Phase IIb  at home clinical trial in patients with female sexual dysfunction  The trial was a randomized  double blinded study testing the safety and efficacy of bremalanotide in almost 400 patients with FSD  The patients were separated into one of four trial groups and received bremalanotide at 0 75 mg  1 25 mg  1 75 mg  or placebo  Patients self administered via a single sub cutaneous dose prior to an anticipated sexual encounter   The trial hit on the primary and key secondary endpoints  a major success  demonstrating a good safety profile for bremalanotide and statistically significant increases in the number of Satisfying Sexual Events  SSE  versus placebo  The most common adverse reactions with incidence over 5  among bremalanotide users at any dose included nausea  flushing  and headache  The FDA approved a Phase III trial design with bremalanotide  and the Company could start the trial as early as Q4 2013   Palatin is in good financial shape with  32 9 million in cash at the end 2012  With a cash burn rate of approximately  12 million per year  the company can readily fund its operations through FY2014  including the upcoming Phase III trial  With a market capitalization of about  24 million  shares of Palatin are actually trading below the value of cash on hand  so this may be a very attractive entry point for investors who want exposure to a potentially successful FSD drug development program   Also promising for Palatin is the notion that there are no strong competitors in the FSD space  As mentioned earlier  BioSante Pharmaceuticals  BPAX  announced very poor results from two Phase III trials with their candidate LibiGel in 2011  These trials did not achieve statistical significance  forcing the company to temporarily step back from the program  While the company has not officially abandoned the Libigel program  it s difficult to see how they will overcome the problem of the extremely high placebo response   Palatin s program is differentiated from BioSante s failed effort because bremalanotide uses a specific MOA directly affecting FSD  while BioSante is simply making another testosterone gel   Apricus  APRI  is the only company that is close to an approved treatment and has finished a Phase III study with their candidate Femprox  alprostadil and DDAIP HCl   The company is planning to submit an application for approval in Canada in the near future   The Takeaway Female Sexual Dysfunction is a huge unmet need in the United States  although the companies that have made attempts on this drug indication in the past have been unsuccessful  Currently  there are only a handful of companies with drug development plans that target this indication  Some are better than others  BioSante s Libigel  which is just another testosterone gel  doesn t look as likely to succeed while Palatin s melanocortin receptor agonist bremalanotide and also Apricus  topical prostaglandin agonist Femprox look more interesting ,2013-05-07,Myriad

96333,317848,PG,How Can I Know If My Stocks Are Fairly Valued  ,opinion,Not having the confidence that they know the true worth of their stocks  is one of the most common laments expressed by many individual investors  Even more importantly  knowing the price of all their stocks  but not knowing their value  is often a major source of shareholder losses  Expressed differently  when you don t know the value of what you own  it s very easy to be taken advantage of  It s an undeniable fact  that people are emotionally attached to their money  Therefore  it s no wonder that all the price volatility accompanying an often irrational stock market can be quite unnerving  As a result  investors often buy when they should sell  and sell when they should buy  Making matters even worse is the reality that there is no precise or absolute calculation of intrinsic value or what we like to call true worth  This stems from the fluid nature of a business where future prospects can rapidly change  Think financial stocks in late 2006  going into 2007 and 2008  Once apparently very healthy and profitable enterprises  the fortunes of many financials collapsed with a vengeance  The following earnings and price correlated  on Citigroup  C  provides a vivid portrayal of how quickly a company s prospects can change  On the other hand  as frightening as this is  it is very rare to see the fortunes of a company or industry change so dramatically and as fast as we saw with the financial industry  But clearly it can happen  which makes a strong case for diversification Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the Citigroup example is that the company s stock price actually correlated to its intrinsic value based on earnings throughout this 20 year history  In other words  where earnings went  stock price followed  and even more importantly  whenever price deviated  over or under  from fair value  the orange earnings justified valuation line in the graph   it quickly came back into alignment  But obviously  although the price adjusting to earnings in 2007 and 2008 was rational  it was horrific at the same time  Nevertheless  the principles of valuation held true in this example and will be elaborated on later in this article What Is Fair Value and How Can I Calculate It As we stated earlier  there is no absolute or perfectly precise calculation of fair value  However  that does not mean that attempting to determine fair value is an impossible exercise  Quite the contrary  the prudent investor can  easier than many people believe  calculate a reasonable range of fair valuation that they can use to make sound and smart long term investing decisions  The only reason that fair value cannot be calculated with absolute precision is because part of the calculation must be based on estimates relating to future time Moreover  the rational and intelligent investor recognizes that although estimates of future fundamentals such as next year s or next quarter s earnings might not be perfect  they also recognize that they don t need to be  Instead  future earnings estimates only need to be good enough to make a decision that is economically sound  Because  the rational and intelligent investor also realizes that since Mr  Market often behaves irrationally  that perfect tops or bottoms are rarely achieved except by chance  Therefore  instead of seeking perfection  investors must accept a reasonable range of probabilities that offers a high potential for success But perhaps the most important aspect of fair valuation is that it is only one component  albeit a very important component  for determining your long term potential return from owning a common stock  The second important component is the rate of change  growth rate  of the earnings of the respective company you are analyzing  This leads me to another important refinement that adds insight to the relevance and importance of valuation  True worth  intrinsic value or fair value  no matter what you choose to call it  all refer to the same concept  However  it s important to understand that fair value is a present time metric  whereas the earnings growth rate is more applicable to future time The notion that fair value is a present time metric is based on the following  and often misunderstood relevance of fair value  as it applies to making a sound investing decision  At its core  the fair value of a common stock relates to what you are paying to buy a current dollar s worth of the company s earnings  From this perspective  fair value depicts the current earnings yield that the investor is receiving on their capital  The most common PE ratio that depicts fair value for most companies is 15  which represents a current earnings yield of 6  to 7   the actual number is 6 666   but somehow my Christian upbringing precludes me from stating so   Put another way  this is more or less the average earnings yield for the average publicly traded company To clarify even further  let s review two companies through the lens of F A S T  Graphs  where both demand a current fair value PE of 15  however  each respective company has significantly different historical earnings growth rates  In both examples  the current fair value PE ratio of 15 applies regarding making a sound current investment decision  However  the rate of change of earnings growth will have a material impact on future earnings power  and therefore  future long term return potential Our first example will look at Church   Dwight Inc  CHD  an above average growing supplier of household products  With this fast growing company  we only have to look back to calendar year 2003 to illustrate fair value as one component of return versus rate of change of earnings growth as our second component  At the beginning of 2003  Church   Dwight was trading at approximately a PE ratio of 15 which calculates our 6  to 7  fair value earnings yield  In other words  this represented a sound valuation to pay for this above average growing company In this example  assuming that we bought the stock in January of 2003  we acquired   61 worth of earnings at an approximate PE ratio of 15  This purchase represented our fair value current earnings yield of 6  to 7  based on the current earnings we purchased  However  thanks to the power of compounding  and utilizing the Rule of 72  we are purchasing a stock whose earnings are doubling approximately every five years  Therefore  although we are buying current earnings at fair value  we are buying 5 year future earnings at a bargain PE ratio of approximately 7 5  or half the cost of our original earnings  thanks to the doubling approximately every 5 years  Note through the green highlights at the bottom of the graph that our original   61 of earnings grew to a  1 27 worth of earnings by year end 2007  in essence a doubling  With our second example  we look at a slower growing utility stock  SCANA Corp   SCG  whose historical earnings growth has only averaged 3  per annum  At this rate of earnings growth  again using the Rule of 72  it takes approximately 24 years for this company to double its earnings  Unfortunately  our graphing tool only offers data going back approximately 21 years to 1993  nevertheless  we can see that after 21 years  earnings have yet to double  On the other hand  we see clear evidence that this utility stock has typically commanded a PE ratio of approximately 15  the orange line on the graph represents a PE of 15  for the most part over the past 21 years  Other ways of stating this would include that a PE of 15 is a good buy  and a PE ratio below 15 is a better buy  but prudence would dictate that you never really want to pay much above a PE of 15 to buy this utility The lesson underpinning this story is that it s important to only pay fair value for either of these companies on the buy side  However  keep in mind that fair value is only part of the return story  Consequently  if you stick to the PE ratio of 15 as a fair value guide for most companies  you can be confident that you are investing in them at a sound valuation  By doing this you can then turn your attention to the earnings growth rate in order to develop a reasonable expectation of future potential returns  However  keep in mind that these examples have only focused on capitalizing earnings  Dividends  if any  would need to be added into your potential return calculations The moral of the story is that any time you find a company that is trading at a PE ratio above 15  you can immediately assume that an overvaluation situation is probably evident  On the other hand  there are additional considerations regarding the proper valuation of a business that come into play  For example  the concept of risk is an important consideration  There are certain companies of impeccable quality that have historically enjoyed  and may even deserve  a premium valuation Keep in mind that if you buy a high quality blue chip and pay 16  17 or 18 times earnings  in other words  above our rule of thumb fair value PE of 15  this simply means that your future return will be lower than it would have been had you only paid the PE ratio of 15  But this does not mean that you will lose money  nor does it mean that you won t receive a reasonable rate of return on your money  However  it might mean that you will earn a return that is lower than you deserve  but perhaps a return that is earned at lower risk Procter   Gamble Co   PG  represents a case in point  Historically  this blue chip dividend growth stock has commanded a premium PE ratio of approximately 18 to 20 times earnings  Currently  the company is trading at a PE ratio of 17 7 which is slightly higher than our ideal PE of 15  but not excessively so  Especially if you are willing to accept that this is lower than their historical PE  and that this blue chip offers a 3 2  above average dividend yield that has increased every year for 56 consecutive years  When these things are considered  paying a slight premium for this blue chip  although technically above our fair value PE of 15  might actually make sound and prudent sense On the other hand  the wise investor should also realize and accept that they can expect to earn a lower total return for the safety and reliability of investing in a blue chip like Procter   Gamble at a premium valuation  Therefore  let s look to the future to see what this actually means regarding our potential future return  The following estimated earnings and return calculator on Procter   Gamble represents consensus estimated forward 5 year growth at 6 9   The 5 year estimated total return of 6 3  is positive and maybe even reasonable for a company of this quality with a 3 2  dividend yield that could be expected to grow by approximately 7  per year But here is another twist to the valuation conundrum that also needs to be considered  Since our future return is a function of what happens in future time  our decisions can only be made based on estimates  Consequently  it s also rational to recognize that estimates may not come to pass as precisely as we originally anticipated  On the other hand  as it relates to quality companies with long established records like Procter   Gamble  we can be pretty confident that our estimates will come in within a reasonable range of accuracy  more or less To illustrate this point  the following forecast  estimated earnings and return calculator  is based on 21 analysts reporting to Zacks  Instead of the 6 9  forecast 5 year growth we got from Capital IQ  the Zacks  analysts forecast Procter   Gamble to grow at a slightly higher rate of approximately 8   Consequently  our theoretically premium  slightly overvalued  PE ratio of 17 7 would produce a 7 1  compounded annual return assuming Procter   Gamble trades at a fair value PE of 15 by year end 2018  assuming of course that the 8  estimate proves true The point of this exercise is to illustrate that valuation is a little more subtle and even complex than just saying that a PE of 15 is fair value  Factors such as quality  risk  and future growth rates are major factors that need to be considered as well  At the end of the day  we can use these measurements in order to determine whether or not we feel we have the opportunity to be adequately compensated for the risks we are taking Our next and final example looks at Home Depot  HD   a company that appears clearly overvalued based on its historical earnings growth rate of 7 2  per annum  which justifies our normal or average PE of 15 valuation  Up until the beginning of this calendar year  it is clear that the market had normally priced the company in line with our fair value PE of 15  the orange line on the graph   As we turn our attention to the future  the Home Depot valuation story becomes more interesting  Since calendar year 2003 Home Depot has  as previously stated  averaged an operating earnings growth rate of 7 2  per annum  However  the consensus of 30 analysts reporting to Capital IQ  expect Home Depot s future 5 year growth to average 15  per annum  On that basis  if you could buy the company at a PE of 15  you should expect capital appreciation of 15   plus a percentage point or two of dividend kicker However  since Home Depot is currently valued at an overvalued PE ratio of 21 3  the 5 year estimated total return  including dividends  drops down to 9 7  per annum  They are two points here that relate to valuation that are important  First of all  this future expected rate of return  we should point out  is higher than what we can rationally expect from Procter   Gamble with its lower PE ratio  but approximately half the future expected growth rate Second  the real risk in this example in the short to intermediate term relates to the potentiality that share price could drop into the  40 range over the next two years or so  which assumes that the company mean reverts to its fair value PE of 15  On the other hand  if this company does in fact grow at 15  per annum  we will have more than twice as much future earnings   6 77 versus  2 97  for the market to capitalize  However  the rational and prudent expectation would be that Home Depot s future PE mean reverts to 15  which is our rule of thumb fair value PE Summary and ConclusionsAlthough this article deals with some of the more important aspects of ascertaining the fair valuation of a common stock  it should be understood that it only scratches the surface  On the other hand  we hope that the readers agree that it does establish some important principles and frameworks that fair value is based on  There are numerous variations  nuances and combinations of PE ratios and growth rates that space and time precluded being made  However  we also hope that we laid a solid foundation of which greater understanding of valuation could be built upon What was written in this primer on valuation dealt primarily with companies whose earnings growth rates were less than 15  per annum  Once earnings growth exceeds 15  per annum  the power of compounding creates a powerful dynamic that implies PE ratios greater than 15  With the case of very fast growing companies  the current fair value earnings yield of 6  to 7  gives way to much higher future earnings yields  This is based on the exponential increase in future earnings that high growth rates  if achieved  will generate  Furthermore  this also implies that the higher potential future returns also carry the necessity of higher risk However  when all is said and done  the principle of valuation is not as complex  esoteric or even as mysterious as many people believe  Having a grasp of valuation is mostly about applying a little common sense and an awareness of some simple mathematics  When the operating results of a business  i e  its earnings and cash flows  do not represent an attractive rate of return on investment  it should be instantly obvious to the prudent investor that fair valuation is not present  Conversely  when the earnings yields are very high based on reasonable assumptions  the opportunities this represents should be readily apparent as well  So in closing  valuation is not hard  especially if you have the right tools at your disposal Disclosure

96365,317880,PG,Procter   Gamble  Growth And Income For Your Retirement Portfolio,opinion,Procter   Gamble  PG  has long been a blue chip stalwart that the market has traditionally applied a premium valuation to  However  even though they maintained strong profitability right through the recessionary years  the market took the bloom off of the rose  In our opinion  this created the opportunity for conservative investors  seeking growth and income from a high quality blue chip  the rare opportunity to invest at an attractive valuation    Dividend Champion   Procter   Gamble Co     This article looks at Procter   Gamble Co  PG   a Dividend Champion  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will

live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs    Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life     A Dividend Champion is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 25 or more straight years  Procter   Gamble Co is a dividend champion that has raised its dividend every year for 56 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Champions list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Champions list   P G serves approximately 4 4 billion people around the world with its brands  The Company has one of the strongest portfolios of trusted  quality  leadership brands  including Pampers   Tide   Ariel   Always   Whisper   Pantene   Mach3   Bounty   Dawn

OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Procter   Gamble Co s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Procter   Gamble Co has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 8 2   see purple circle on graph  per annum Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line   On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem   If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line   Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1     The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2     The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs   Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance   Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values   Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Procter   Gamble CoThe associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 3 4  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Procter   Gamble Co would have received an additional  38 215 74 in dividends that increased their total return from 3 4  to 4 9  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Champion it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 25 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Procter   Gamble Co is 2 09  which is historically normal Looking to the Future   Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants    1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings 2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings   Therefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance    Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Procter   Gamble Co represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Procter   Gamble Co has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns    The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions    The consensus of 24 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Procter   Gamble Co long term earnings growth at 7   Procter   Gamble Co has low long term debt at 24  of capital  Procter   Gamble Co is currently trading at a P E of 16 1  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Procter   Gamble Co s True Worth valuation would be  85 33 at the end of 2017  which would be a 9 2  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Procter   Gamble Co to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Procter   Gamble Co s expected earnings would be 4 5 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Champion Procter   Gamble Co  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his

Graphs  on Procter   Gamble Co Summary   ConclusionsProcter   Gamble may not be the most exciting investment on the planet  but it may be one of the soundest  The dividend yield is very attractive in

106728,328243,PG,January Sends Warning For 2020  Play Quality ETFs   Stocks,opinion,"January 2020 was pretty volatile for the global markets with the month opening to Middle East tensions and ending with the rapid spread of coronavirus  mainly in China  Just in the middle of the month  the markets had a nice spell owing to the signing of the phase one U S  China trade deal  But there was a bloodbath on the last day of January on rising fear about coronavirus and its adverse impact on the global economy 
Overall  the S P 500 based ETF  and the Dow Jones based ETF have lost about 1  and 2 1   respectively in the past one month  as of Jan 31  2020   The Nasdaq 100 based ETF  advanced about 1 4   However  emerging market ETF   China A Shares ETF  and Asia ETF   NZ AIA   shed 6 2   10 9  and 5 8   respectively  read    
Is It an Ominous Sign for 2020 
There is apparently a correlation between January sperformance and full year returns  According to Stock Trader s Almanac   going back to 1950  when the S P 500 was positive in January  86  of the time  the full year turned out to be up     The track is even better in presidential election years like 2020  In an election year  when January sees stock gains  it is likely to be a positive one 100  of the time  with an average S P 500 return of 16 6    
Apart from coronavirus  2020 is likely to be an edgy one as it is an election year   Elevated policy uncertainty usually leads to lower equity valuations and higher implied volatility in the months ahead of Election Day   per Ben Snider  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  equity strategist  as quoted on CNBC 
But then the track record of market performances in presidential election years is not that bad    the return of the S P 500 Index has been positive in 19 years out of 23 years  It means investing in stocks in election years is not imprudent  it is just that one has to be a bit careful
